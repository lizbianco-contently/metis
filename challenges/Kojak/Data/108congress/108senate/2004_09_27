Mr. President, today we will have a period of morning \nbusiness until the hour of 2 p.m., and at 2 o'clock under the order \nfrom last week we will begin consideration of S. 2845, the intelligence \nreform bill sponsored by Senators Collins and Lieberman. As we \nannounced on Friday, amendments are in order to the bill today. \nHowever, no rollcall votes will occur. Any votes ordered with respect \nto any amendment will be delayed until tomorrow morning.\n  Following the opening remarks on the intelligence legislation, we \nhope some Members will be available to begin that amendment process.\n  I also encourage any Senator who anticipates offering additional \namendments to the bill to contact the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee. This is a critically important \npiece of legislation. It would be extremely helpful to have an orderly \nconsideration of the bill, and we expect to do just that. With a full \nweek of Senate business, we should be able to finish the bill this \nweek.\n  We could have other legislative matters to complete over the course \nof this week, including such measures as a highway extension and a \ncontinuing resolution. Therefore, Senators should be prepared for full \ndays and evenings as we wrap up these matters.\n  As everyone knows, the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission were \nreleased in late July. Immediately thereafter we began a very \nstructured and orderly hearing process. A number of committees held \nhearings over the course of August. The Governmental Affairs Committee \nin a very orderly way had a markup and considered the range of \nrecommendations and findings that have emerged. Now we have a bill that \nis being brought to the floor to be debated and appropriately amended, \nif necessary and as necessary, over the course of this week.\n\n  This will be a very full week. It is important that we start on this \nbill today, and we will continue with each and every day until we \ncomplete that bill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9692-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n              RECOGNITION OF THE ASSISTANT MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the Republican leader and the Democratic \nleader appointed Senator McConnell and this Senator to work on the \nlegislative aspects of the 9/11 Commission. If the cooperation among \nMembers is as good as Senator McConnell and I have had, we are going to \nbe able to move forward on this bill, I think with bipartisanship. And \nwe need to move forward. I think the 22 of us who serve on this task \nforce feel that way.\n  We have to understand how much there is to do these next few days. \nThere is a lot to do. We had a very productive last 2 weeks when most \npeople expected a tremendous amount of partisanship this last little \nbit before we break for the elections. But from my observation it has \nbeen the opposite. There has been cooperation, and we have gotten a lot \ndone. The next 2 weeks are important.\n  Also by virtue of the schedule we will have a difficult time this \nweek because Tuesday we have an event for retiring Senators. That has \nbeen scheduled for months and there is no way out of that. That is \nTuesday evening. Then, of course, Thursday is the first Presidential \ndebate. It makes a lot of sense to me that we be in tune with that. I \nknow there are some Senators who have events related to that. We will \nhave to keep those things in mind.\n  I hope we can move forward on these matters which the leader has \ntalked about. There is an opportunity to get a few things done with a \nlimited time agreement. During the time we are working on this matter, \nwe should go ahead and do that to prevent a lot of backlog next week \nbefore we head home before the recess.\n  I appreciate the leader's comments. I hope my observation is a \ncorrect one. We have been doing very well in spite of what some of the \npolitical prognosticators have said. This isn't a time for meltdown. \nThis is a time for accomplishing a lot.\n  When the Chair announces morning business, we have two on the \nDemocratic side who wish to speak, Senator Harkin and Senator Nelson of \nFlorida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue we discussed \nlast week that I will shed further light on, which is the broad topic \nof health care in America. I listened last week with some \ndisappointment to the comments made in the Senate by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader regarding health care costs. The senior Senator from \nMassachusetts repeated some of the Democratic leader's critique of the \nPresident's policies on health care. Because both of my colleagues left \nan incomplete picture, I take a moment to step back and give a more \nrealistic assessment of where we are today and where we should be \ngoing.\n  America has the best doctors, the best nurses, the best hospitals, \nthe best medical technology, the best medical breakthrough medicines in \nthe world. There is absolutely no reason we should not have in this \ncountry the best health care in the world. The time has come for common \nsense--not Washington--to determine how patients interact with doctors \nand with hospitals. The time has come for health care professionals, \nnot Government or HMO bureaucrats, to make health care decisions. The \ntime has come to put patients and consumers back in charge.\n  Under the leadership of President Bush, we have taken measurable, \nconcrete steps toward making quality health care more affordable, more \navailable, and more reliable. Although much work remains to be done, a \ncomprehensive, independent study confirms that we are, indeed, moving \nin the right direction.\n  One report released last week by the highly valued Lewin Group \nexamined the costs of health care proposals put forward by President \nBush and by Senator John Kerry. This is the second nonpartisan \nindependent analysis in recent weeks to compare the Presidential \ncandidates' proposals side by side. It is the second independent study \nto find that the price tag of Senator Kerry's plan is twice--two \ntimes--what he claims. The Lewin Group study finds Senator Kerry's \nproposals would cost $1.25 trillion--not billion but trillion--over the \nnext 10 years and still leave 20 million Americans uninsured. This is \nsimilar to the findings of another independent study released 2 weeks \nago by the nonpartisan American Enterprise Institute. That study put \nthe price tag of Senator Kerry's plan at $1.5 trillion.\n  We all know it is difficult and, yes, next to impossible to project \nthe accurate cost of major Federal Government programs. We know all too \nwell Washington has that annoying habit of underestimating the cost of \njust about everything it does and sticking taxpayers at the end of the \nday with that tab. However, if these two independent studies are even \nmildly accurate, Senator Kerry's estimates are off by half a trillion. \nLet me say that again: Senator Kerry's estimates for his health care \nproposals are off by half a trillion dollars. Talk about fuzzy math. To \nput that in perspective, that is more than the cost of the WIC Program, \nthe Low Income Energy Assistance Program, the Ryan White Program, and \nthe School Lunch Program combined. In\n\n[[Page S9693]]\n\nfact, it is more than the annual cost of the entire Medicare Program \ntoday.\n  So we are left with the perennial question, how will Senator Kerry \npay for all of this? Who is going to get stuck with the tab this time? \nFor starters, nearly all of the tax relief passed by Congress during \nthe past 2 years would have to be repealed--all of that tax relief: No \nmore marriage penalty relief; no more child tax credit; no more middle-\nclass tax relief; no more death tax reduction. That means if you are a \ntaxpayer, you will be paying a lot more and keeping a lot less of your \nhard-earned dollars. Yet still today Senator Kerry is telling the \nAmerican people that his health care plan will save you money.\n\n  As a doctor, as a Senator, I am here to tell you it simply won't. For \nstarters, he would have to raise an average of $1,115 per family in \ntaxes for his proposal--unless, of course, he plans to add $1 trillion \nto the deficit. As a defender of the American taxpayer, both options \nare unacceptable. American families simply deserve better. This is one \nWashington-imposed solution we do not need. When it comes to health \ncare, as a matter of principle, it should be about you. It should be \nabout your doctor; it should be about your hospital, period. It should \nfocus on you, the patient, the consumer. Senator Kerry's proposal is \nnot a prescription for progress; it is a prescription for more \nGovernment-controlled health care.\n  Consider another finding from the Lewin report released last week. \nMore than 21 million of the 25.2 million who would get health insurance \nunder the Kerry plan would be forced into the Government-run Medicaid \nProgram. As we all know, and it has been documented again and again, \nexpanding Government-controlled programs can force people with good \nprivate health insurance coverage to lose it. In fact, an analysis \nreleased by the National Center for Policy Analysis concludes that 8 \nmillion people who are currently privately insured will lose this \nprivate coverage because of Senator Kerry's expansion of Medicaid. This \nis plain wrong. America deserves better.\n  In sharp contrast, we have the policy of President Bush, including \nthose already enacted by this body and by Congress. They are focused on \nthe patient. They are focused on the consumer. They are focused on you. \nAs a matter of principle, we believe patients should be able to see the \nright doctor at the right time. As a matter of principle, we believe \nnothing should interfere with that doctor-patient relationship. As a \nmatter of principle, we believe all Americans deserve affordable, \navailable, and reliable quality health care.\n  Health care costs are soaring. We must address the root causes of \nthese soaring costs. There are countless commonsense reforms we can \npursue today to control your rising health care costs. At the top of \nthat list is a reform all Americans can agree upon. We need to reel in \npersonal injury trial lawyers whose frivolous lawsuits are crippling \nhealth care in communities all across America. The fact is, too many \nlawyers and too many frivolous lawsuits are making medicine much too \nexpensive. This lawsuit abuse is driving good doctors out of practice \nand discouraging our very best and our very brightest from entering the \nprofession. Doctors literally today are telling their children: Because \nof lawsuit abuse now and in the future, maybe it is best that you not \neven enter the profession of medicine. That presents a crisis.\n  Worse yet, lawsuit abuse is now threatening people's access to \ncritical health service and is occurring in communities all across \nAmerica. Did you know there are countless counties across this country \nwhere Americans no longer have access to their obstetricians to deliver \nbabies? There are counties across this country where Americans no \nlonger have access to trauma centers. Can you imagine?\n\n  According to the American Medical Association, this situation has \nreached true crisis proportions in 20 States, and that includes some of \nthe most populous States in this country: Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, \nNew York. Families in these States are not getting the quality care \nthey deserve. I will tell you why. Out-of-control litigation is leading \nto out-of-control medical liability premiums, which leads to out-of-\ncontrol costs. Too many doctors are being forced to close their doors \nsimply because they can no longer afford to keep the insurance to keep \ntheir doors open.\n  If you have no doctor, that ultimately means no care; it means loss \nof access; it means loss of availability of care. If you want your baby \ndelivered, it means an obstetrician may not be around. If you have an \naccident driving home from work today, the trauma center may not be \nopen. That is a crisis. It is a crisis of cost; it is a crisis of \naccess; it is a crisis of availability; it is a crisis of reliability.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na recent article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From American Medical News, May 3, 2004]\n\n              Liability Crisis Ends Century of Deliveries\n\n                           (By Tanya Albert)\n\n       Perhaps one day the children of family physicians Jim \n     Schwieterman, MD, and Tom Schwieterman, MD, will pick up \n     where medical liability rates have forced the brothers to \n     leave off.\n       The duo is scheduled to deliver their last baby in \n     September, stopping a more than 100-year run of their family \n     bringing children into the world in Mercer County, Ohio.\n       An in an ending that wouldn't have been more perfect if \n     Hollywood had written the script, the brothers' last delivery \n     will be the baby of a woman their father delivered.\n       The grandfather delivered the woman's mother. And the \n     doctors' great-grandfather who founded the Maria Stein, Ohio, \n     family practice, delivered the woman's grandmother.\n       But the Schwietermans--who their patients call Dr. Jim and \n     Dr. Tom--don't want people to interpret their fate as a \n     ``woe-is-me'' story.\n       They are saddened that they're being forced to give up a \n     part of their practice that they love. But they'll continue \n     to provide the cradle-to-grave primary care that patients in \n     their rural county of 40,924 need.\n       They're telling their story because they worry that \n     patients who need obstetrical care may not be able to get it \n     in the future.\n       ``Something is wrong when a legal situation is preventing \n     us . . . from doing a service for very little income and when \n     we have good outcomes,'' Dr. Tom said.\n       The brothers want people to know that even rural doctors in \n     a practice with no lawsuit payouts in more than 100 years can \n     be forced to cut back services to patients because of \n     unaffordable medical liability rates. Only one lawsuit has \n     ever been filed against the practice, and it was dropped a \n     few days later.\n       ``We've fallen victim to another outside force,'' Dr. Jim \n     said.\n\n\n                           the outside forces\n\n       Maria Stein's small-town atmosphere hasn't changed much \n     over the years, Dr. Jim's and Dr. Tom's father, Don \n     Schwieterman, MD, said.\n       Churches still stand in the community of crossroads. And \n     Dr. Don said the town still clings tight to the values of the \n     thrifty, hardworking German farmers who settled it.\n       ``It's still an area where we have a very close \n     relationship with patients,'' said Dr. Don, who retired in \n     1997.\n       But the practice of medicine has changed.\n       In Ohio, like so many other states, an increasing number of \n     physicians have had to give up ``high-risk'' aspects of their \n     practice because insurance has become unaffordable.\n       An Ohio State Medical Assn. survey released April 15 found \n     that 80% of the state's physicians agree that rising premiums \n     have directly impacted their patients.\n       The survey found that 34% of Ohio doctors expect to close \n     their practices in the next two years if rates continue to \n     climb. When asked to look forward three years, 58% plan to \n     close.\n       ``If only 10% of that happened, that's a huge crisis,'' \n     said Bill Byers, OSMA's government relations director.\n       For the Schweitermans, giving up obstetrics was purely a \n     business decision. When the fax for this year's premium came \n     through, the insurance company was asking for $80,000 for the \n     brothers to keep delivering the 60 or so babies a year that \n     they average. That's a premium hike of about 150% over the \n     past six years.\n       ``It was a financial no-brainer,'' Dr. Jim said.\n       And given how long their family has been in the community, \n     neither wanted to move 20 miles west to Indiana where tort \n     reform is established and rates would have been 75% less.\n       ``It doesn't make any sense that geography can play such a \n     role,'' Dr. Tom said. ``[Rates] have nothing to do with the \n     medicine you practice.''\n\n\n                       savoring every last moment\n\n       It's beginning to hit the doctors that they only have five \n     more months of deliveries left, and they find they're soaking \n     up every moment in the delivery room.\n       ``It's giving up one part of a job where there are tears of \n     happiness,'' Dr. Tom said.\n       While both brothers would love to be able to offer \n     obstetrics again, they realize that once they are out of it \n     for a couple of years it will be difficult to go back. ``I \n     feel like I'm\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\n     a baseball player stepping up to bat for the last time,'' Dr. \n     Jim said.\n       Family physicians have been giving up deliveries for years. \n     In 1978, 46% had hospital privileges to deliver babies, \n     according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. In \n     2003, only 24% of FPs did deliveries.\n       While premiums have been an issue in some states, Thomas S. \n     Nesbitt, MD, MPH, said there are a number of reasons for the \n     decline, including the fact that more FPs are joining groups \n     where the scope of practice is already established.\n       Dr. Nesbitt, associate dean for graduate education, \n     continuing education and outreach at the University of \n     California, Davis, said it's a loss to family medicine. ``The \n     real tragedy is that family care is being fragmented.''\n       Dr. Don hopes the climate shifts so that one or more of his \n     grandchildren may be able to enjoy the special experience of \n     helping deliver children into the world.\n       ``I would love that,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this article is about Dr. Jim Schwieterman \nand his brother, Dr. Tom Schwieterman. Both are family physicians who \npractice in Mercer County, OH. This month ``Dr. Jim'' and ``Dr. Tom,'' \nas their patients call them, will deliver their last baby, bringing an \nend to a distinguished 100-year run of their family providing care in \ndelivering babies in their community in this corner of Ohio. The \nbrothers' final delivery will be the baby of a woman who their father \ndelivered. Their grandfather delivered the woman's mother, and their \ngreat-grandfather, who founded the family practice, delivered the \nwoman's grandmother--a wonderful, rich tradition of caring in that \ncommunity.\n  Why will this long and honorable family history of physician service \ncome to an end? Because of out-of-control medical liability costs. The \nSchwieterman brothers simply cannot afford to deliver children because \nof the skyrocketing insurance fees they must now pay. It is a tragedy, \nand we all suffer in one way or another.\n  I was in Philadelphia earlier this month to speak to a group of \nphysicians. Did you know that the average or the typical obstetrician/\ngynecologist now pays over $134,000 a year for liability insurance just \nfor that privilege of being able to deliver babies? That is a tripling \nof the cost just since 2000, a $100,000 increase in just 4 years. It is \nnot surprising that Pennsylvania is on the crisis list and physicians \nare leaving the State. That means diminished access for the people of \nPennsylvania. And it applies to orthopedic surgeons, to trauma \nsurgeons, to obstetricians.\n  The trial lawyer special interest lobby is next to impossible to beat \nat the State level, but, fortunately, some States are taking action. \nThey see what is happening to their neighbors, and they know they could \nbe next. Without restoring common sense to the legal system, it is just \na matter of time before their health care is hijacked by the lawsuit \nlottery.\n  Take California, for example. Because California has acted and \nadopted comprehensive medical liability reform, including limits on \npain and suffering awards, liability insurance costs for OB-GYNs in the \nLos Angeles area are less than half of what their colleagues pay in \nPennsylvania, Illinois, or Florida. Everything else is more expensive \nin California but not health care.\n  Texas is another State pursuing comprehensive, commonsense legal \nreform. Recently, my distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator \nCornyn, spoke passionately on the Senate floor about the need for \nlawsuit abuse reform. His State recently adopted medical liability \nreforms similar to those passed in California, and they are working.\n  Texas Medical Liability Trust, the largest medical liability insurer \nin the State, is now decreasing its rates for the second time in the 2 \nyears since this reform was instituted. The new 5-percent cut comes in \naddition to a 12-percent reduction implemented earlier this year. These \ncuts are a direct result of Texas's constitutional amendment capping \nliability costs. According to the trust president and CEO, Thomas \nCotton, 12,000 Texas doctors will save $34 million in a single year. \nThis represents almost half of all Texas physicians. And when doctors \npay less, patients pay less, premiums fall, and health care becomes \nmore available for all. Before Texas passed the new liability law, the \nsame insurer had raised rates over 146 percent between 1999 and 2003. \nNow that the medical malpractice insurance market has stabilized, 13 \nnew insurance companies have entered the Texas market and doctors are \nreturning to their practices. That is the way it should be.\n\n  The lesson is clear. If we adopt Federal reforms based on the \ncommonsense laws that are working in States such as California and \nTexas, we will dramatically lower health care costs, in turn providing \nmore affordable and more accessible health care to our communities, to \nthe American people. That means our precious health care dollars will \nbe spent in the operating room and not in the courtroom.\n  The Senate has tried three times during the 108th Congress to debate \ncomprehensive medical liability legislation. We have tried three times \nto have a simple debate about the merits of ending the abuse of our \nhealth care system by personal injury trial lawyers and their frivolous \nlawsuits, and each time my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave filibustered, obstructed even consideration of this legislation. \nThey block consideration of a solution. No action, no vote, no \naccountability, and no change is partisan politics at its worst. It \nhurts the doctor. It hurts the patient. It hurts the consumer. It hurts \nyou. That is plain wrong and, again, America deserves better.\n  Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards have made it clear that they oppose \nthe laws that are working today in California and Texas. They have also \nmade it clear that as long as they are in the Senate, they will not \neven allow a vote on real reform. Why, you ask? Why oppose reforms that \nprovide more health care services than ever before? Why oppose reforms \nthat ensure doctors and hospitals will be more involved in providing \ncare? Why oppose health care services that are more accessible and more \nconvenient? And why oppose health care services that will be there when \nyou need them? America deserves an explanation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to comment on one other issue, and \nthat is the new drug discount card available to seniors today.\n  I will turn to some compelling testimony that was provided to the \nSenate Finance Committee, I guess it was 2 weeks ago. I had the \nopportunity to chair that Finance Committee hearing, and I listened \nvery carefully as Dr. Mark McClellan, who is the Administrator for the \nCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services, discussed the Medicare \nModernization Act, which this body passed, which was signed into law by \nthe President. In his testimony, Dr. McClellan said that 4.3 million \nseniors have already enrolled in the Medicare Prescription Drug \nDiscount Card Program, which was signed into law by President Bush last \nyear. Over 1 million low-income seniors are today, because of this new \nlaw, receiving an additional $1,200 of free prescription drugs on top \nof the already deep discounts available to all seniors who have signed \nup for this card.\n  Those discounts are making a difference. They make a difference in \nthe lives of those seniors. They make a difference in the health care \nof those seniors.\n  It is beyond belief how anyone could tell seniors, don't get that \ncard; it is too confusing. That is wrong. We should be encouraging \nseniors to sign up for the card. Why? A recent Kaiser Family Foundation \nstudy reported that the Medicare drug cards are providing a savings of \n17 to 24 percent off retail prices in urban and rural areas. That means \nif you have the card, you have a savings of 17 to 24 percent than if \nyou don't have the card. How could anybody tell our seniors today, \ndon't get the card, with those demonstrated savings?\n  A Lewin Group study analyzing the 150 drugs most frequently used by \nseniors found that people participating in the Medicare drug discount \nprogram can, beginning this year, save an average of well over $1,200 \non their prescription drug purchases with this card.\n  A study by Consumers Union found that in California, the Medicare \nprescription drug discount cards provided drug prices that are even \nlower than the State's Medi-Cal program. I say ``even lower'' because \nthe Medi-Cal prices are 20 percent below those typically available at \nretail pharmacies.\n  The Democratic leader indicated last week that too little has been \ndone to control prescription drug costs in America. The facts--study \nafter\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\nstudy--show otherwise. In my colleague's own State of South Dakota, \n40,000 Medicare beneficiaries who do not have prescription drug \ncoverage stand to gain the most from that drug discount card; 28,000 \nSouth Dakotans are eligible for an additional $1,200 over the next 14 \nmonths. How can they be told not to sign up for that card?\n  The discount drug card is only the beginning. In the year 2006, all \nMedicare beneficiaries will be eligible for prescription drug coverage \nunder the Medicare program. Tens of thousands of South Dakota's seniors \nand citizens with disabilities will receive coverage with no premiums, \nno deductibles, no gaps in coverage, and copayments of no more than $2 \nfor generics and $5 for brand-name drugs.\n  There is a better way to provide affordable prescription drugs and \nhealth coverage to the American people. Texas and California have \nchosen the right path. I ask: When will Senator Kerry and Senator \nEdwards choose theirs? Make no mistake, we need health care reform now. \nCosts are way too high today, and they continue to rise. Quality chasms \nand health care disparities exist in our health care sector today. But \nI can tell you from personal experience--both in medicine for 20 years \nas a physician and as a policymaker today--these are tough and \nchallenging issues. Reform is a challenge that is not easy, but we have \nbegun to address it and we will continue.\n  The health care challenge is complicated, and it is much more \ncomplicated than a lot of politicians would have you believe. They \nsimply are not going to be solved overnight.\n  Let us pledge today to get it right the first time. Let us pledge \ntoday to give that power back to the patients. Let us pledge to tackle \nthe challenges today and to stop the partisan politics and to stop the \nfoot dragging that becomes an embarrassment to this institution and a \nsource of frustration for the American people.\n  With the President's leadership and the bipartisan reforms that we \nhave enacted during the past several years, we are on the right track. \nA lot of work remains to be done. We need to pass medical liability \nreform. We need to expand those health savings accounts that are now \nthe law of the land. We need to give small businesses the ability to \nban together to buy more affordable health care coverage for their \nhard-working employees. Because as a matter of principle, every family \ndeserves access to affordable, reliable, and quality health care that \ncan never be taken away.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the fourth hurricane has \nvisited my State, and that is the subject of my remarks.\n  I am compelled to respond to some of the statements the majority \nleader has made about the condition of medical malpractice in the \ncountry.\n  One of the great privileges of being a part of the Senate, it being \nthe greatest deliberative body in the world, is out of the discussions \nof ideas, hopefully truth can ultimately be achieved. A number of the \nstatements the majority leader has made are giving his point of view, \none side of the argument. Indeed, it is absolutely no secret that there \nis a medical malpractice insurance crisis in the country.\n  As the majority leader would have it characterized, it is all as a \nresult of lawyers and excesses. Are there excesses? Yes, there are. And \nthose ought to be reformed in the system. But in outlining how you want \nto solve the problem of bringing down the insurance premiums for \ndoctors to protect themselves with medical malpractice, what is \nproposed by the majority leader leaves the main entity out of the \nsolution, and that is the insurance company.\n  The doctors have characterized this--indeed, some lawyers--as a fight \nbetween doctors and lawyers. But they have left out the main party, if \nwe are going to reach a solution. I speak from a little bit of \nexperience, having been the elected insurance commissioner of Florida \nfor 6 years. I found myself, interestingly, as insurance commissioner, \ndenying rate decreases for insurance companies that were medical \nmalpractice companies because they were wanting rate decreases so they \ncould get additional market share, but it was not financially prudent. \nIt was not actuarially sound. This was during the 1990s, when the stock \nmarket was robust.\n  Insurance companies make money in two different ways: One, with \nregard to their premiums, which ought to be actuarially sound for the \nrisk they are insuring; and two, by investing those funds in prudent \ninvestments. And in the decade of the 1990s, those investments were \npaying off handsomely for the entire business community, including \ninsurance companies.\n  But what happens when the stock market turns south and the return on \ntheir investments is not there? Then an insurance company is supposed \nto have its premiums so that it can be actuarially sound so it can pay \nits claims due to the risk it has assumed.\n  Well, a lot of those companies started getting in difficulty because \nthey were not getting the returns on their investment. So they had to \nstart yanking their premiums up.\n  All of this is to say that if we want a real solution to this \nproblem, we have to get doctors and hospitals, lawyers and insurance \ncompanies all in the room in order to solve the problem.\n  The majority leader made reference to the State of California as if \nit were just a cap on lawyers' fees. That is not the history of the \nState of California. California not only did that, but they also put a \nlimit on the increases on insurance premiums as well. So when we have a \ndiscussion, we should have a discussion of an overall comprehensive way \nto solve this problem. That is what I would like to see--this being \nless partisan, less ideological, less special interests, and talk about \na solution where we can bring all parties in and get something done. \nThat should be done at the State level. What we have seen from it is \nthat States that have taken up legislation like that do not bring all \nof the parties to the table to find a viable solution.\n\n  I felt compelled to respond to the majority leader's comments because \nin the debate that ought to occur in this body, it ought to be a \ncomprehensive debate showing all sides to the argument.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9695-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9695-S9696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FLORIDA'S HURRICANES\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I came here because, as most \neverybody in the country knows, an unusual meteorological phenomenon \nhas occurred in my State where it has now been battered by four major \nhurricanes. Part of the State now has been battered in the same area--\nnamely, south of Orlando, southeast of Lakeland. In that area, it has \nbeen traversed now by hurricane strength winds from three hurricanes--\nfirst Charley, then Frances, and now this last one. The third \nhurricane, Ivan, took off for a different part of the State. It hit \nwest Florida in the Pensacola area, as well as eastern Alabama, with \nsuch force of not only 138 mile per hour winds but also with that surge \nof water called a tidal surge, which was so significant that it went \nall the way up Pensacola Bay and, in fact, lifted up sections of the \nInterstate 10 bridge--huge, heavy concrete sections--lifted it up by \nthe pressure of that water and deposited it on the bottom of Pensacola \nBay. That is the kind of force and fury of Mother Nature that has been \nvisited upon my State. So what do we need to do? Well, there is one \nreason for the Federal Government, other than the protection of the \nnational defense of this country, and that is also to provide during \ntimes of disaster.\n  FEMA ran out of money several weeks ago. We came in here and we \npassed an emergency appropriations bill of $2 billion to try to fill up \ntheir coffers. But since then, we have passed several things appendaged \nto the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, plus receiving several \nacknowledgements and commitments to, in particular, this Senator from \nFlorida from the esteemed chairman of the Appropriations Committee of \nadding additional funds in the conference that is now occurring on the \nDepartment of Homeland Security funding bill.\n  But as of yet, we have seen an appropriation request come from the \nWhite House that is just not going to solve the problem. For example, \nthe Commissioner of Agriculture of Florida\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\nsaid that for the first two hurricanes, we are going to have $2 billion \nof losses just in agriculture. Yet all we have announced out of that $2 \nbillion requested by the Commissioner of Agriculture--who happens to be \nin the same party as the President--all we have seen is the Secretary \nof Agriculture offer a package that is only one quarter of what the \nCommissioner of Agriculture of Florida has asked for. That is just not \ngoing to do it.\n  Since the first two hurricanes, we have been hit by a third hurricane \nand, a day ago, by a fourth hurricane. In that third hurricane, there \nis going to be a big loss of the cotton and peanut crops up in the \npanhandle. With the fourth, what was left of the citrus crop across \ncentral Florida is going to be all gone because these ferocious winds \nare going to drop to the ground any fruit that was remaining. This is \nan election year, but this should not be partisan.\n  People are hurting and they need help, they need it now. I ask the \nWhite House, this administration, the Department of Agriculture, and \nall those myriad of agencies to come forward and help us. We need that \nhelp right now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little about Iraq. Before \nthat, I have a responsibility to respond to the majority leader's \ncomments on health care today. Sometimes you hear things on the Senate \nfloor and you have to stop and say, did I really hear that or is that \njust something I thought?\n  I was really listening to the Republican leader talk about Republican \nsupport for health care--meaningful health care. Listening to the \nRepublican leader talk about Republican support for meaningful health \ncare is like listening to the big tobacco companies talk about the need \nfor cancer research. How do I say that? Because the problems of cancer \nbasically are caused by the big tobacco companies. The problem that we \ndon't have a meaningful health care system in America today--people-\nbased, patient-based, preventive care-based--is because of Republican \nParty policies.\n  It has been very clear for a long time that the Republican Party has \nopposed any kind of meaningful people-based health care program. After \nall, it was our colleague, former Senator Robert Dole, who during his \nPresidential campaign in 1996 bragged he had voted against Medicare, as \nmost Republicans did in the mid 1960s. Now, again, the majority leader \nsays that the elderly are not signing up for these discount cards and \nwe ought to be promoting them, sort of like a cheerleader. Maybe they \nare all taking their cue from the fact that President Bush was a \ncheerleader in college, so now we have to be a cheerleader. We heard \nthat we have to cheerlead, regardless of what the facts are. There is a \nreason the elderly are not signing up for this card. It is meaningless. \nIt doesn't do anything for them. Yet we are supposed to go out and be a \ncheerleader for them?\n  Well, the Republicans rammed through their health care program. The \nelderly get a meaningless card, and the pharmaceutical companies got \n$12 billion in payments to entice them into this program. How about \ngiving the elderly in our country $12 billion?\n  I sum it up by saying that President Bush does have--I want to be \nfair to him--a health care plan. It is very simple and straightforward: \nPray you don't get sick. That is President Bush's health care plan.\n  John Kerry has a sound health care plan: One, to overturn the ban on \nMedicare bidding down the prices from pharmaceutical companies. Again, \nthat was in our last Medicare bill. Republicans insisted on it. They \npushed it through. Right now, Medicare cannot bargain with the large \npharmaceutical companies to bid down the prices. Why? Because they are \npaying in the bill and they are forbidden to do so. What kind of sense \ndoes that make? The Veterans' Administration can bargain down the price \nof drugs with pharmaceutical companies but not Medicare. That makes no \nsense.\n  One of the first things a President Kerry would do is get rid of that \nban and let Medicare get the price of drugs down for the elderly.\n  Secondly, a President Kerry will say we have to allow for the \nreimportation of drugs from Canada. We have a free-trade agreement with \nthem on cars, clothes, pens, ties, and everything else, except for one \nthing--drugs. Well, it is time we have a free-trade agreement on drugs \nand let us reimport drugs from Canada.\n  The third part of the Kerry program is to provide a tax credit for \nsmall businesses--up to 50 percent--so they can carry a health care \npolicy on their workers. That is so important for us in rural America, \nwhere most of our people work for small business.\n  Fourth, Senator Kerry says we ought to open the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Program to everybody in America. That is a good program. \nIt allows you to pick your doctor and hospital, and it allows you to \nchange your plan if you would like to do so. It is a great program. I \nought to know, I am in it. So is President Bush. So is Vice President \nCheney. So is every Senator on this floor. If it is good enough for us, \nit ought to be good enough for the American people.\n\n  The last thing in the Kerry program for health care is to double the \nNational Health Service Corps to get more doctors, physicians' \nassistants, nurse practitioners, and others serving in our rural and \nunderserved areas and to increase the number of community health \ncenters in America.\n  So while I am proud John Kerry has a forward-looking, comprehensive \nhealth care plan that will be meaningful, that will reduce drug prices, \nand that will get affordable, reliable health care to the American \npeople, President Bush is silent. Again, President Bush's health care \nplan is simple: Pray you don't get sick. That is not enough. We need \nbetter than that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9696-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9696-S9700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I also wish to speak for a few minutes \nabout the mess in Iraq. Last week, Prime Minister Iyad Allawi came to \nWashington to join in President Bush's campaign of relentless happy \ntalk about the war in Iraq. President Bush says:\n\n       We're making progress. We're making progress.\n\n  Meanwhile, back in the real world--the world that American soldiers \nconfront on the ground in Iraq--the chaos gets worse and worse. Entire \nregions and many provincial capitals are under the insurgents' control. \nVirtually every day we see car bombings, kidnappings, assassinations, \nbeheadings.\n  As we learned last week, the CIA has produced a formal National \nIntelligence Estimate that says that, at best, the current level of \nviolence will continue and, at worst, Iraq will plunge into a civil \nwar. As Secretary of State Colin Powell acknowledged yesterday, it is \ngetting worse in Iraq. But amazingly, President Bush insists that this \nmess in Iraq has made us safer, and the President and his political \nallies have been relentless in using the war on terror for their own \nelectoral purposes.\n  Their message to the American people is simple: Be afraid, President \nBush will protect you; his opponent will not.\n  Vice President Dick Cheney also took this line of attack 2 weeks ago \nwhen he darkly warned with his Darth Vader-type voice that if John \nKerry is elected President, then ``the danger is we'll get hit again, \nthat we'll be hit in a way that will be devastating.'' That was Vice \nPresident Cheney.\n  Last Tuesday, the senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, said that \nterrorists ``are going to throw everything they can between now and the \nelection to try and elect Kerry.''\n\n  Last Monday, Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage said \nterrorists in Iraq ``are trying to influence the election against \nPresident Bush.''\n  If these gentlemen have such excellent access to the terrorists' \nthoughts, they are not doing a good job of turning that knowledge into \neffective policy against the terrorists. At key junctures, this \nadministration has made disastrously wrong choices. Repeatedly, these \ndecisions have played into the terrorists' hands. Let's look at the \nrecord.\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\n  It is a fact that the September 11 attacks happened despite repeated \nwarnings to Mr. Bush from the CIA that al-Qaida was planning to attack \nAmerica. Those warnings included an August 8, 2001, President's daily \nbriefing which he received while he was vacationing in Crawford, TX. \nThe report was titled ``Bin Laden Determined to Strike in the U.S.'' \nThat is not a subhead or a sentence in the memo, that is the title of \nthe memo: ``Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.''\n  Let's look at the rest of the record.\n  On President Bush's watch, the U.S. botched the single best \nopportunity to capture bin Laden at Torah Borah in Afghanistan. A \npolitical decision was made to allow Afghan warlords to carry the brunt \nof that siege, and bin Laden escaped.\n  It was President Bush who 3 years ago pledged to smoke bin Laden out \nof his cave, but has utterly failed to do so. Instead, by successfully \ndefying President Bush, bin Laden has become a folk hero across the \nMuslim world. He has attracted not only thousands of new recruits, but \ndozens of imitators, new bin Ladens who are forming their own terrorist \norganizations to attack America and Americans.\n  It was President Bush who diverted our military intelligence \nresources and certain military hardware, such as the Predator aircraft, \nthe unmanned aerial vehicles, took them out of Afghanistan, away from \nthe hunt for bin Laden and sent them to Iraq.\n  It was President Bush whose taunt, ``Bring it on,'' did indeed bring \nit on--a nationwide insurgency in Iraq, an urban guerrilla war that has \ntrapped our Armed Forces in a quagmire.\n  It was President Bush whose unilateral approach on Iraq alienated \nmany of our oldest allies and turned world opinion against the United \nStates.\n  It was President Bush whose invasion and occupation of the second \nlargest Arab country has outraged much of the Muslim world and has been \na recruiting bonanza for Islamist terrorists.\n  This is an astonishing record of mistakes, misjudgments, and \nmismanagement. It is an astonishing record of George W. Bush again and \nagain playing into Osama bin Laden's hands. It is like Wile E. Coyote \nchasing the Road Runner, only this time it is not funny. It is a \ncolossal tragedy. It has put our Nation at even greater risk of \nterrorist attack.\n  Ironically, President Bush's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, \nwarned against the folly of invading and occupying Iraq. Listen to \nthis. On February 28, 1999, speaking to a group of Desert Storm \nveterans at Fort Myer, VA, former President Bush said:\n\n       Had we gone into Baghdad--we could have done it, you guys \n     could have done it, you could have been there in 48 \n     hours--and then what?\n  The first President Bush continued:\n\n       Whose life would be on my hands as the Commander in Chief \n     because I, unilaterally, went beyond international law, went \n     beyond the stated mission, and said we're going to show our \n     macho? We're going into Baghdad. We're going to be an \n     occupying power--America in an Arab land--with no allies at \n     our side. It would have been disastrous.\n\n  That is the first President Bush. That is not me. That is an exact \nquote from the first President Bush, 1999. I would say to this \nPresident: You do not have to listen to us, just listen to your father. \nHe would have told you what you are getting into in Iraq.\n  This is what his father said:\n\n       We're going to be an occupying power--America in an Arab \n     land--with no allies at our side. It would have been \n     disastrous.\n\n  It is disastrous. Of course, we heard the same prophetic warnings \nfrom Brent Scowcroft, James Baker, and other foreign policy experts. \nBut this President Bush and his partner Dick Cheney and the \nneoconservative intellectuals thought they knew better. They reveled in \nwords such as ``slam dunk'' and ``cakewalk.'' And so now the disaster \nthat Bush 41 warned against has become a reality under Bush 43.\n  The Iraq invasion has set back, rather than advanced, the war on \nterrorism and al-Qaida. Osama bin Laden remains at large--an imminent \ndanger to our homeland. Our Armed Forces are bogged down in Iraq, with \ncasualties rising above 8,000, and they are not able to respond to real \nthreats to the United States. Our moral authority and credibility on \nthe world stage are at rock bottom.\n  The other day I was watching former President Carter at the Carter \nCenter answer a question. He said he has been, I believe I am not \nmistaken, in over 120 countries. He said never in the history of the \nUnited States has our country been at such low esteem and moral \nauthority in the rest of the world--never in the history of our \ncountry.\n  Despite President Bush's blustery threats about the so-called axis of \nevil, on his watch, North Korea has acquired nuclear weapons and Iran \nappears to be proceeding with impunity to develop its own nuclear \nweapons. This is an extraordinary record of mistakes, misjudgments, \nmiscalculations, and missed opportunities.\n  As a consequence of President Bush's choices over the last 4 years, \nAmerica is weaker, America is less secure, America is more vulnerable.\n  I say to my friend and colleague from Utah, whom I quoted earlier, \nlook at the record. Look at this record and come to only one \nconclusion: The single best recruitment poster for al-Qaida and the \nterrorists is our policy in Iraq. Quite frankly, the architect of that \npolicy, the person who is carrying it out, is President George W. Bush. \nNo, it is not John Kerry, I say to my friend from Utah. It is not John \nKerry. George W. Bush's reckless, stubborn policy is the single best \nrecruiter for al-Qaida, and this must end so that our people can truly \nbe made secure; that we can go after the terrorists; that we can get \nout of this quagmire in Iraq; that we can once again become the moral \nauthority, the shining city on a hill that America has been to the rest \nof the world. I am sad to say it will not happen on this President's \nwatch. That is why a change is in order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article that appeared September 26, \n2004, in the Los Angeles Times be printed in its entirety in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Sept. 26, 2004]\n\n                     Al Qaeda Seen as Wider Threat\n\n (By Douglas Frantz, Josh Meyer, Sebastian Rotella and Megan K. Stack)\n\n       Rabat, Morocco.--Authorities have made little progress \n     worldwide in defeating Islamic extremists affiliated with Al \n     Qaeda despite thwarting attacks and arresting high-profile \n     figures, according to interviews with intelligence and law \n     enforcement officials and outside experts.\n       On the contrary, officials warn that the Bush \n     administration's upbeat assessment of its successes is overly \n     optimistic and masks its strategic failure to understand and \n     combat Al Qaeda's evolution.\n       Even before the Sept. 11 attacks, Al Qaeda was a loosely \n     organized network, but core leaders exercised considerable \n     control over its operations. Since the loss of its base in \n     Afghanistan and many of those leaders, the organization has \n     dispersed its operatives and reemerged as a lethal \n     ideological movement.\n       Osama bin Laden may now serve more as an inspirational \n     figure than a CEO, and the war in Iraq is helping focus \n     militants' anger, according to dozens of interviews in recent \n     weeks on several continents. European and moderate Islamic \n     countries have become targets. And instead of undergoing \n     lengthy training at camps in Afghanistan, recruits have been \n     quickly indoctrinated at home and deployed on attacks.\n       The United States remains a target, but counter-terrorism \n     officials and experts are alarmed by Al Qaeda's switch from \n     spectacular attacks that require years of planning to \n     smaller, more numerous strikes on softer targets that can be \n     carried out swiftly with little money or outside help.\n       The impact of these smaller attacks can be enormous. \n     Bombings in Casablanca in May 2003 shook Morocco's budding \n     democracy, leading to mass arrests and claims of abuse. The \n     bombing of four commuter trains in Madrid in March \n     contributed to the ouster of Spain's government and the \n     withdrawal of its troops from Iraq.\n       Officials say the terrorist movement has benefited from the \n     rapid spread of radical Islam's message among potential \n     recruits worldwide who are motivated by Al Qaeda's anti-\n     Western doctrine, the continuing Palestinian-Israeli conflict \n     and the insurgency in Iraq.\n       The Iraq war, which President Bush says is necessary to \n     build a safer world, has emerged as a new front in the battle \n     against terrorism and a rallying point for a seemingly \n     endless supply of young extremists willing to die in a jihad, \n     or how war.\n       Intelligence and counter-terrorism officials said Iraq also \n     was replacing Afghanistan and the Russian republic of \n     Chechnya as the premier location for on-the-job training for \n     the next phase of violence against the West and Arab regimes.\n       ``In Iraq, a problem has been created that didn't exist \n     there before,'' said Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere of France, \n     dean of Europe's anti-terrorism investigators. ``The events \n     in Iraq have had a profound impact on the entirety of the \n     jihad movement.''\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\n       Officials warn that radical Islam is fanning extremism in \n     moderate Islamic countries such as Morocco, where the threat \n     of terrorism has escalated with unexpected speed and \n     ferocity, and re-energizing adherents in old hot spots such \n     as Kenya and Yemen.\n       In recent weeks, police thwarted an attack against a U.S. \n     target in Morocco at the last minute, and concerns have \n     increased sharply about the possibility of attacks in Kenya, \n     U.S. and foreign officials say.\n       The Madrid bombings and arrests in Britain this summer \n     highlight Europe's emergence as a danger zone. Long used by \n     extremists as a haven for recruitment and planning attacks \n     elsewhere, the continent now is believed to be a target \n     itself, especially countries backing the Iraq war.\n       Al Qaeda's transformation since the destruction of its \n     Afghan training camps nearly three years ago has been \n     chronicled extensively. Arrests and killings of senior \n     leaders and the shutting down of major avenues of financing \n     further fragmented the network.\n       Bush said at the Republican National Convention this month \n     that more than three-quarters of Al Qaeda's leadership had \n     been killed or captured.\n       Among those arrested are Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, alleged \n     planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, and Abu Zubeida, who oversaw \n     the global network and helped recruit for the training bases \n     in Afghanistan.\n       Administration officials contend that information from \n     interrogations helped prevent new attacks and unravel the \n     network, leaving Al Qaeda too diminished to carry out a \n     strike as complex as that of Sept. 11.\n       Polls indicate that voters trust Bush to handle the fight \n     against terrorism better than his Democratic challenger, Sen. \n     John F. Kerry.\n       A far less reassuring assessment of the condition of \n     Islamic extremism emerged from the interviews with government \n     intelligence officials, religious figures and counter-\n     terrorism experts in the United States, Europe, the Middle \n     East and North Africa.\n       Although opinions are not unanimous and ambiguities remain, \n     there is a consensus that Al Qaeda's leadership still exerts \n     some control over attacks worldwide. However, veterans of the \n     extremist movement have demonstrated a new autonomy in using \n     the group's ideology and training techniques to launch \n     attacks with little or no direct contact with the leaders.\n       ``Any assessment that the global terror movement has been \n     rolled back or that even one component, Al Qaeda, is on the \n     run is optimistic and most certainly incorrect,'' said M.J. \n     Gohel, head of the Asia-Pacific Foundation, a London think \n     tank. ``Bin Laden's doctrines are now playing themselves out \n     all over the world. Destroying Al Qaeda will not resolve the \n     problem.''\n       U.S. and foreign intelligence officials said the Bush \n     administration's focus on the ``body count'' of Al Qaeda \n     leaders and its determination to stop the next attack meant \n     comparatively few resources were devoted to understanding the \n     threat.\n       Michael Scheuer, a senior CIA official, said in an \n     interview that agents wound up ``chasing our tails'' to \n     capture suspects and follow up leads at the expense of \n     countering the rapid spread of Al Qaeda and the international \n     jihad.\n       Scheuer, chief of the CIA's Bin Laden unit from 1996 to \n     1999, now plays a broader role in counter-terrorism at the \n     agency. He is the author of ``Imperial Hubris,'' a recent \n     book that criticized U.S. counter-terrorism policy; the \n     interview with him occurred before the CIA restricted his \n     conversations with reporters.\n       Another counter-terrorism expert who works as a consultant \n     for the U.S. government and its allies said Scheuer's \n     criticism had been echoed elsewhere.\n       ``I think they're deluged with the immediate stuff and I \n     think their horizons are also very, very short-term,'' said \n     the consultant, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``One of \n     the biggest complaints I hear when talking to intelligence \n     services around the world is that the Americans are so \n     interested in the short term, preventing attacks and getting \n     credit.''\n       Anti-terrorism experts who fault the administration's \n     strategy and its optimism argue that concentrating on \n     individual plots and operatives obscures the need to address \n     the broader dimensions of Islamic extremism and makes it \n     impossible to mount an effective defense.\n       The Al Qaeda movement now appears to be more of an ideology \n     than an organization, spreading worldwide among cells \n     inspired by the Sept. 11 attacks.\n       Adherents generally share a few basic principles: an \n     overarching belief that Muslims must take up arms in a holy \n     war against the Judeo-Christian West, a profound sense of \n     indignation over the deaths of Muslims in Palestinian \n     territories and Iraq, and a conviction that secular rulers \n     should be replaced by Islamic governments.\n       But beyond that, their concerns often splinter along the \n     lines of geography, local politics and the intricacies of \n     Islamic thought. A Moroccan is unlikely to pursue the same \n     targets or even agree with the strategy of his Saudi \n     counterparts. Saudis, in turn, are fighting bitterly among \n     themselves over whether it's more important to battle the \n     royal family at home or the Americans in Iraq.\n       The inadequate response to the threat is not unique to \n     Washington.\n       European officials also see gaps in their policies, \n     particularly when it comes to understanding the complexity of \n     the situation, said Gijs de Vries, the counter-terrorism \n     coordinator for the European Union.\n       ``Al Qaeda is increasingly being invoked as an ideological \n     motivation of Islamic radicals,'' he said. ``There is a type \n     of diffuse jihadism, which on the one hand consists of \n     loosely structured small cells and on the other hand \n     ideology.''\n\n\n                        shift to smaller strikes\n\n       A new cadre of second-generation Al Qaeda commanders has \n     compensated for the damage to the network by stepping up the \n     pace of attacks with smaller strikes on soft targets.\n       The strategy relies on a limited number of veteran \n     operatives trained in Afghanistan who function with a high \n     degree of autonomy. They recruit foot soldiers through \n     mosques, local groups and the Internet, then provide on-site \n     training in bomb-making and tactics.\n       Senior counter-terrorism authorities in the U.S. and Europe \n     say they are not certain how much central control is \n     exercised over these independent operators--or even whether \n     they are linked to one another in a formal manner.\n       But officials said evidence indicated that attacks in Saudi \n     Arabia, Morocco and Turkey during the last 16 months were \n     part of a loosely coordinated pattern that could be traced to \n     Bin Laden and his lieutenants.\n       Based primarily on intercepted communications from Iran to \n     Saudi Arabia by U.S. listening posts, U.S. and European \n     officials said orders for the suicide bombings in the Saudi \n     capital of Riyadh on May 12, 2003, came from an Al Qaeda \n     fugitive in Iran.\n       The officials said the most likely suspect was Saif Adel, a \n     former Bin Laden bodyguard now believed to be Al Qaeda's \n     military commander. But Western security officials said Adel \n     was only one of numerous Al Qaeda figures granted haven by \n     Iran's Revolutionary Guards. Iran denies that.\n       Extremists behind a string of attacks in Saudi Arabia since \n     then operate with a large degree of independence, but Saudi \n     security officials said the radicals retained links with Al \n     Qaeda leaders in Iran and elsewhere by telephone and courier.\n       Authorities in Morocco and Europe said the go-ahead for the \n     Casablanca suicide attacks on May 16, four days after the \n     Riyadh bombings, was given at a meeting of Al Qaeda \n     commanders in Istanbul, Turkey, in January 2003. They also \n     said the young men who died carrying out the five nearly \n     simultaneous bombings were recruited and trained by an Al \n     Qaeda veteran.\n       Turkish extremists who bombed two synagogues, the British \n     Consulate and the headquarters of a London-based bank in \n     Istanbul in November 2003, killing more than 60 people, \n     received money and advice on targets from Al Qaeda and its \n     associates, according to testimony this month in the trial of \n     69 suspects.\n       One of the defendants, Adrian Ersoz, testified that he \n     arranged a meeting in August 2001 in Afghanistan between \n     Habib Akdas, the leader of the Turkish cell, and Mohammed \n     Atef, also known as Abu Hafs Masri, a top Bin Laden \n     lieutenant later killed in a U.S. airstrike in Afghanistan.\n       He said that Akdas was promised money from Al Qaeda but \n     that after Afghanistan's Taliban regime collapsed, the cell \n     leader turned for financial help to Al Qaeda representatives \n     in Iran and Syria, whom Ersoz did not identify. Akdas fled to \n     Iraq immediately after the Istanbul bombings and participated \n     in the kidnapping of several Turkish workers there, Turkish \n     authorities said.\n       These smaller strikes cost relatively little, even compared \n     with the modest $500,000 price tag for Sept. 11, indicating \n     that the network has adapted to the clampdown on its \n     financing methods.\n       Mohammed Bouzoubaa, Morocco's justice minister, said the \n     bombings in Casablanca, which killed 45 people, cost $4,000.\n       Top suspects in the Madrid bombings have long-standing ties \n     to Al Qaeda cells in Spain, Morocco and elsewhere. Still, six \n     months after the bombings, investigators have no evidence \n     that the planners received instructions or money from outside \n     for the attacks that killed 191 people.\n       The methods used in Casablanca and Madrid illustrate what a \n     senior European counter-terrorism official described as ``the \n     most frightening'' scenario: local groups without previous \n     experience, acting with minimal supervision from an \n     interchangeable cast of Al Qaeda veterans.\n       ``By now we have no evidence, not even credible \n     intelligence, that the Madrid group was steered, financed, \n     organized from the outside,'' he said. ``So that might be the \n     biggest success of Bin Laden.''\n       In the past, Al Qaeda militants were mostly educated young \n     men in their mid-20s and older who had strong religious \n     convictions and middle-class backgrounds. They trained \n     extensively at camps in Afghanistan and their missions were \n     planned over months or years.\n       Recent attackers were drawn from a larger pool of alienated \n     young men, reflecting the wider tug of Al Qaeda's doctrine, \n     Bin Laden's status as a hero to some Muslims and fury at \n     American foreign policy.\n       Some experts, like Richard Clarke, the former White House \n     counter-terrorism chief, publicly blame the war in Iraq for \n     strengthening the motivation of radical Islamic groups \n     globally. Others still in governments around the world make \n     the point privately, saying that the conflict in Iraq has \n     broadened support for extremism.\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\n       De Vries, the EU counter-terrorism chief, acknowledged only \n     that there were differences over the impact of Iraq. ``Public \n     opinion in many countries has not been convinced that the war \n     in Iraq has helped the war on terror as defined by some,'' he \n     said.\n       The bombers in Casablanca were uneducated slum dwellers \n     between the ages of 20 and 24 with little previous \n     involvement in extremism, religious figures and people who \n     knew them say.\n       The Moroccan immigrants who spearheaded the Madrid attacks \n     were shopkeepers and drug dealers. They embraced a theology \n     that justified their crimes as part of their jihad.\n       The sense that an angry young man anywhere could become the \n     next suicide bomber, the absence of training camps and only \n     intermittent contact with any central command structure pose \n     tough challenges for law enforcement.\n       ``Terrorist culture has been disseminated,'' said Pierre de \n     Bousquet de Florian, director of France's intelligence \n     agency. ``Technical knowledge has spread.''\n       Even U.S. officials, most of whom are more optimistic than \n     their foreign counterparts, acknowledged that there were too \n     many blank spots for them to understand the full scope of the \n     threat.\n       ``From what we have seen and learned, particularly in light \n     of the recent arrests, we have made enormous strides in \n     knocking out Al Qaeda,'' a senior counter-terrorism official \n     in the Bush administration said. ``That said, we believe \n     there are operational people who have moved up, with \n     operational expertise, and that there remains some sort of \n     loose command and control structure.''\n       Among the mysteries is whether Bin Laden and his second-in-\n     command, Ayman Zawahiri, still play operational roles. \n     Another question is the extent of coordination between Al \n     Qaeda's leadership and the attacks in Iraq.\n       The role that Jordanian militant Abu Musab Zarqawi plays in \n     Iraq has been cited repeatedly by the administration as \n     evidence of an Al Qaeda-Iraq link, but many counter-terrorism \n     officials said he had long operated independently.\n       His activities in Iraq have boosted his status among \n     Islamic extremists and led to what investigators suspect is \n     an even greater independence from Bin Laden.\n       Zargawi's reach extends beyond the carnage in Iraq and \n     makes his offshoot of Al Qaeda an urgent threat. As the \n     former chief of a training camp in Afghanistan, he has \n     alliances with militant groups from Chechnya to North Africa.\n       European counter-terrorism officials blame him for several \n     thwarted attacks in Europe and suspect that he helped plan \n     the Casablanca and Istanbul bombings.\n       Investigators believe that there are ties between suspects \n     in the Madrid attacks and the Zarqawi network. They have \n     turned up evidence of an operational and ideological axis \n     that links fighters traveling to Iraq from Europe and North \n     Africa--and raises the threat that they will bring the mayhem \n     home with them.\n       In June, Italian police arrested Rabei Osman Sayed Ahmed, \n     an Egyptian suspected of playing a lead role in the Madrid \n     attacks.\n       According to transcripts of electronic eavesdropping, \n     police also learned of Ahmed's involvement in a European \n     network sending fighters to Iraq to carry out suicide \n     bombings.\n       ``All my friends are dying, one after another,'' he said \n     during a conversation in his Milan hide-out May 26. ``I know \n     so many who are ready. I tell you there are two groups ready \n     for martyrdom. The first group leaves the 25th or 20th of \n     next month for Iraq via Syria.''\n       French authorities opened an investigation Wednesday into a \n     network involved in recruiting extremists and helping them \n     get to Iraq, but so far the flow of such foreigners does not \n     approach the thousands who went to Afghanistan before 2001.\n       Still, European investigators are particularly concerned \n     about the increasing movement of North Africans--some from \n     Europe but most from their homelands--to fight in Iraq and \n     what it means for the future.\n       ``Our fear is that they go and become a threat to our \n     countries,'' said De Bousquet de Florian, the French \n     intelligence chief. ``We pay a great deal of attention \n     because once these guys have gone to Iraq to train, they know \n     how to use weapons and explosives. That's the first level: \n     Iraq as a new Afghanistan, a Chechnya.''\n       Determining who is behind the attacks in Iraq is difficult. \n     U.S. military and Iraqi authorities blame much of the \n     violence on foreign fighters, and Saudis, Egyptians and other \n     nationals have been seen saying farewell in videotapes before \n     suicide bombings. A Saudi captured after a botched car \n     bombing in Baghdad recently said he had been slipped across \n     the border, given $200 and keys to a car and told to attack a \n     military convoy.\n       But some say pinning most of the suicide attacks on \n     Zarqawi's network and foreign fighters in general ignores the \n     insurgency's home-grown aspects and overlooks growing links \n     between Iraqis and radical Islam.\n\n\n                          Radical Islam Adapts\n\n       The new model of Islamic terrorism was born May 16, 2003, \n     in Sidi Moumen, a shantytown of 200,000 people on the \n     outskirts of Casablanca. That day a band of unemployed young \n     men from the neighborhood, most of whom lived on the same \n     narrow street, carried out five nearly simultaneous attacks.\n       The targets were in the heart of Casablanca: a Jewish \n     community center, a Spanish restaurant and social club, a \n     hotel, a Jewish cemetery and a Jewish-owned Italian \n     restaurant. The death toll was 45, including 12 of the 14 \n     bombers.\n       Morocco's role in Islamic extremism previously had been as \n     a way station for jihadis entering and leaving Europe, and \n     investigators said the emergence of Moroccans as front-line \n     operatives demonstrated the ability of radical Islam to \n     adapt.\n       In unraveling the Casablanca plot, Moroccan and foreign \n     authorities discovered that the bombers had no previous ties \n     to extremism, which meant spotting them in advance would have \n     been almost impossible, even in a country where paid \n     informants lurk in almost every neighborhood.\n       Moroccan authorities identified Karim Mejatti, a Moroccan \n     veteran of Afghanistan, as the person who recruited them and \n     received a green light for the attacks in the meeting in \n     Istanbul. Unlike his recruits, Mejatti is educated and spent \n     time in the U.S. in the late 1990s. He remains a fugitive.\n       On camping trips in the dusty hills outside Casablanca, \n     Mejatti indoctrinated the men and taught them to make \n     explosives, authorities said. Al Qaeda videos on making bombs \n     with TATP, the group's trademark explosive, were later \n     discovered in their homes. They rode to the attacks in taxis \n     with homemade explosives stuffed into backpacks.\n       ``They did not need sophisticated equipment or means,'' \n     said Bouzoubaa, the justice minister. ``They made their own \n     explosives.''\n       Mejatti recruited the men in November 2002, and authorities \n     were struck by the speed with which he converted them into \n     suicide bombers.\n       Moroccan police foiled a number of follow-up attacks in \n     other cities by cells formed by Mejatti and a handful of \n     other graduates of Afghan camps, investigators said.\n       ``The thing about this kind of operation is that it could \n     be repeated just about anywhere,'' said an Italian law \n     enforcement official who investigated the European links to \n     Casablanca.\n       Spanish anti-terrorism police who visited Casablanca after \n     the attacks said they were convinced the tactic could be \n     replicated in Europe. The prediction came true 10 months \n     later in Madrid.\n       The involvement of Moroccans in the Madrid attack and \n     evidence that it was linked to Casablanca sent shivers \n     through the counter-terrorism community.\n       Spain's leading anti-terrorism judge, Baltasar Garzon, \n     testified before a government commission investigating the \n     bombings that Morocco was home to as many as 100 cells linked \n     to Al Qaeda. They pose Europe's biggest terrorist threat, he \n     said.\n       Other counter-terrorism officials said Garzon's figures \n     might be too high, but they estimated that 400 to 500 Al \n     Qaeda veterans returned to Morocco after the Taliban regime's \n     collapse in Afghanistan.\n       The officials said Moroccan extremists posed a unique \n     danger because they could slip easily in and out of Europe \n     and blend in with the immigrant population. Moroccans are the \n     largest immigrant group in several European countries.\n       Morocco prides itself on being a moderate country with \n     virtually no history of terrorism, but the Casablanca attacks \n     led to a massive crackdown that has drawn complaints from \n     local and international human rights groups.\n       More than 100 mosques have been closed and thousands of \n     people rounded up and jailed. Family members and lawyers \n     complained that detainees were abused and tortured.\n       So far, about 1,000 people have been convicted of \n     terrorism-related offenses; 14 have been sentenced to death, \n     including the two surviving Casablanca bombers.\n       Washington has provided tens of millions of dollars in aid \n     to Morocco and deeper cooperation in law enforcement.\n       In July, three FBI agents moved into the U.S. Embassy in \n     Rabat to work with the Moroccans. A Navy officer was assigned \n     to help monitor potential attacks on shipping in the Strait \n     of Gibraltar.\n       U.S. diplomats are on high alert in Morocco. Two planned \n     attacks in recent months, including one on an American \n     target, were stopped only hours before their execution, \n     authorities in Rabat said.\n       Police also discovered that a private security guard at the \n     embassy was reporting diplomats' movements to an extremist \n     group.\n       Morocco's leaders are defensive about their country's new \n     profile in the campaign against Islamic extremism. Senior \n     officials argue that outsiders are trying to destabilize a \n     country that is striving to be a model of moderation for the \n     Arab world.\n       Moroccans and officials of other Islamic countries agree \n     that anger over U.S. policies in the Israeli-Palestinian \n     conflict provides much of the motivation for the attacks.\n       ``If the Palestinian issue were settled, if Iraq were \n     stable, 70% of the threats would disappear,'' said Bouzoubaa, \n     the justice minister.\n       But officials say they also recognize that not enough has \n     been done to reach disaffected areas such as Sidi Moumen.\n       In July, King Mohammed VI ordered new social programs, \n     including the construction of 100 small mosques and 20 large \n     ones to counter the spread of hard-line Islam.\n       ``We are very aware that we must fill the gap between what \n     is good in Islam and the initiatives by outsiders, \n     particularly in the poorer areas,'' said Ahmed Toufiq, the \n     minister of Islamic affairs. ``They were left to themselves \n     too long.''\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\n                         Refuge for Extremists\n\n       Even as new trouble spots emerge, eradicating known \n     extremist sanctuaries has proved difficult, particularly in \n     remote places out of the reach of government authority, such \n     as parts of Yemen on the southern tip of the Arabian \n     Peninsula.\n       After Al Qaeda bombed the U.S. destroyer Cole in Yemen in \n     2000, killing 17 American sailors, Washington helped train \n     and equip Yemeni security forces and tried to persuade the \n     government to do more to counter extremists.\n       But diplomats say the country remains primarily a lawless \n     place where forbidding terrain and intricate tribal codes \n     provide an ideal nest for militants.\n       Saudi and U.S. officials identified Yemen as the primary \n     source of weapons and explosives for the Al Qaeda cells that \n     have launched attacks in neighboring Saudi Arabia.\n       ``Yemen still has to be viewed as largely ungovernable,'' a \n     senior U.S. counter-terrorism official said. ``We sunk some \n     money and time and effort into it, but we don't have much to \n     show for it.''\n       Yemeni officials acknowledged in interviews that surface-\n     to-air missiles, grenade launchers and other weapons remain \n     widely available despite a crackdown on open-air arms \n     bazaars.\n       The mix of radicals and weapons is particularly potent \n     along the Saudi border, which encompasses rugged mountains \n     and remote desert where tribal leaders hold sway.\n       ``If somebody comes, he's going to pay for tribal \n     protection,'' said Faisal Aburas, a sheik from the \n     impoverished province of Al Jawf on the Saudi border.\n       ``Then it would look bad for a sheik to hand him in, even \n     if he's a criminal, because it shows weakness.''\n       Abubakr al Qerbi, Yemen's foreign minister, denied that the \n     country still harbored Al Qaeda veterans.\n       ``This is old information,'' he said, saying they were \n     expelled in 1995 and again after the Cole bombing.\n       But Hamood Abdulhamid Hitar, a Yemeni government official \n     in charge of negotiating with extremists, said he was holding \n     theological debates with hundreds of militants, including 107 \n     suspected Al Qaeda loyalists.\n       Yemen also links the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of \n     Africa. Somalia, where there is virtually no workable, \n     central government, is just an hour by boat across waterways \n     that are essentially wide open.\n       Farther down the coast in Kenya, concerns focus on a group \n     run by Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, an Al Qaeda operative with a \n     $25-million bounty on his head. Mohammed, a native of Comoros \n     off the southeastern coast of Africa, was indicted in the \n     United States on charges of orchestrating the 1998 bombings \n     of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He also is \n     suspected of organizing the 2002 attacks on Israeli targets \n     in Mombasa, Kenya.\n       Today, U.S. and other Western security officials say they \n     believe he is planning another round of attacks, possibly on \n     the new U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.\n       ``Al Qaeda is preparing for another sensational attack \n     against Western targets in Kenya,'' a Western security \n     official said. ``Two attacks planned for Kenya were exposed \n     during the past year.''\n       U.S. officials suspect that the hunt for Mohammed has \n     driven him into a remote part of northern Kenya, but they say \n     he remains in touch with Al Qaeda leaders through courier and \n     computer.\n       ``I consider him to be a high-value target and a real \n     player in the global Al Qaeda operation,'' said a senior U.S. \n     official in Washington.\n\n\n                          U.S. Still a Target\n\n       U.S. and foreign intelligence and counter-terrorism \n     officials warned that the United States remained the prime \n     target of radical Islam.\n       ``They have overcome the shock of the Afghanistan war and \n     very likely they are preparing another large scale attack, \n     possibly on a U.S. target,'' the senior European counter-\n     terrorism official said. ``There are good reasons to be on \n     alert.''\n\n\n                           A Changing Roster\n\n       Despite the arrests of several high-profile leaders, anti-\n     terrorism experts believe that Al Qaeda has managed to \n     reemerge as a lethal ideological movement. Dispersed \n     operatives--loosely organized or acting alone--recruit and \n     quickly train local terrorist groups for small but deadly \n     attacks.\n\n\n                         A Terrorist Evolution\n\n       In operations such as the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in \n     Africa and the Sept. 11 attacks, Al Qaeda leaders exercised \n     considerable control over operations. Today, Al Qaeda appears \n     to have become more ideology than network, spreading globally \n     among cells inspired by Sept. 11.\n\n\n                        Marking Terror's Changes\n\n       ``In Iraq, a problem has been created that didn't exist \n     there before. The events in Iraq have had a profound impact \n     on the entirety of the jihad movement.'' Judge Jean-Louis \n     Brugulere, French anti-terrorism investigator.\n       ``Any assessment that the global terror movement has been \n     rolled back or that even one component, Al Qaeda, is on the \n     run is optimistic and most certainly incorrect. Bin Laden's \n     doctrines are now playing themselves out all over the world. \n     Destroying Al Qaeda will not resolve the problem.'' M.J. \n     Gohel, head of the Asia-Pacific Foundation, a London think \n     tank.\n       ``Once these guys have gone to Iraq to train, they know how \n     to use weapons and explosives. That's the first level: Iraq \n     as a new Afghanistan, a Chechnya.'' Pierre de Bousquet de \n     Florian, director of France's intelligence agency.\n       ``Al Qaeda is increasingly being invoked as an ideological \n     motivation of Islamic radicals.'' Gijs de Vries, counter-\n     terrorism coordinator for the European Union.\n       ``By now we have no evidence, not even credible \n     intelligence, that the Madrid group was steered, financed, \n     organized from the outside. So that might be the biggest \n     success of Bin Laden.'' A senior European counter-terrorism \n     official.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to consideration of S. 2845, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2845) to reform the intelligence community and \n     the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of the \n     U.S. Government, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today the Senate begins an important \ndebate on the National Intelligence Reform Act. This legislation, which \nI have introduced with my good friend and colleague, Senator Joe \nLieberman, represents the most sweeping reform of our intelligence \nstructures in more than 50 years. It reorganizes an intelligence \ncommunity designed for the Cold War into one designed for the war \nagainst global terrorism and future national security threats. It \nrecognizes that the fundamental obligation of government is to protect \nits citizens and that those protections must evolve along with the \nthreats. It reorders the priorities of an intelligence structure that \nwas devised for a different time and a different enemy.\n  On July 22, the 9/11 Commission released its final report on \nterrorist attacks against the United States. On that same day, our \nleaders, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, assigned the Governmental \nAffairs Committee the task of developing legislation addressing the \nCommission's recommendations to restructure the intelligence agencies \nwithin the executive branch. Our committee performed that task with \ndedication and diligence, and with the active participation of its \ntalented members. From late July until mid-September, we held eight \nindepth hearings to assess the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. \nWe heard testimony from more than two dozen witnesses, including \nSecretary of State Powell, Secretary of Homeland Security Ridge, FBI \nDirector Mueller, CIA Director McLaughlin, the 9/11 Commission \nCochairmen, Kean and Hamilton, Commissioners Fielding and Gorelick, \nintelligence experts, field operatives, professors, and representatives \nof the 9/11 families. As a result of this unprecedented effort and \nwide-ranging input, the committee has produced the legislation now \nbefore the Senate. It is legislation that is comprehensive, \nbipartisan--indeed, unanimous--and historic.\n\n  This legislation is not, however, merely the product of 2 months' \nwork by our committee. It is based upon the work of the 9/11 Commission \nand the inquiry that spanned 20 months, with 19 days of hearings and \n160 witnesses, the review of 2.5 million documents,\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\nand interviews of more than 1,200 individuals in 10 countries. The new \nintelligence structure we propose in our legislation is built upon a \nrock-solid foundation of inquiry and information.\n  In crafting a structure designed for today and for the future, the \ncommittee built on the strengths of our current system, recognized the \nprogress that has been made since 9/11, and charted a new course to \nstrengthen our intelligence community. We understood that the 15 \nagencies that comprise the intelligence community provide a wide range \nof unique experience, expertise, and viewpoints that must be preserved. \nWe realize that the barriers to information sharing, cooperation, and \ncoordination--what the 9/11 Commission referred to as ``stovepipes''--\nmust be demolished.\n  We set as our goal an intelligence structure with the agility that \nthe times and the threats demand, not simply another layer of \nbureaucracy. We were determined that this new structure not infringe \nupon the freedoms that Americans cherish.\n  This legislation uses the Commission's recommendations as our guide \nand these principles as our compass. It begins with the creation of the \nposition of national intelligence director. The NID will be the head of \nour intelligence community and the principal adviser to the President \nof the United States. As the head of the new National Intelligence \nAuthority, this Presidentially appointed, Senate-confirmed official \nwill truly be in charge of our intelligence community. No longer will \nthere be confusion and doubt about who is in charge and accountable. \nThe answer will clearly be the national intelligence director.\n  The director will have broad authority to unify and strengthen our \nintelligence community's efforts and to eliminate barriers that impede \nthe coordination of intelligence activities. He or she will set \nstandards for information sharing and classification across the \nintelligence community and develop an integrated, coordinated \ncommunications network. His responsibility will be to turn the \nstovepipes that separate our intelligence community into conduits that \npromote cooperation. Along with this responsibility will come strong \nauthority to direct budgetary and personnel resources where they are \nneeded most.\n  To illustrate why these authorities are crucial, consider this \npassage from the 9/11 Commission Report.\n  In late 1998, it had become increasingly apparent that Osama bin \nLaden and al-Qaida posed a direct, immediate, and deadly threat to the \nUnited States. On December 4 of that year, Director of Central \nIntelligence George Tenet issued this memorandum. I quote from it:\n\n       We are at war. I want no resources or people spared in this \n     effort, either inside CIA or the Community.\n\n  You may ask, What is the result of this clear, concise and direct \norder from the head of our intelligence community.\n  According to the Commission:\n\n       The memorandum had little overall effect on mobilizing the \n     CIA or the intelligence community.\n\n  Why did it have so little impact? The expert witnesses before our \ncommittee and before the Commission provided the answer. Under the \ncurrent structure, the DCI is responsible for managing the intelligence \ncommunity but does not have the real authority to do so. No \norganization can succeed with such a disconnect between responsibility \nand authority.\n  At our committee hearing on September 13, I asked Secretaries Powell \nand Ridge what I consider to be the bottom-line question in this \ndebate. I asked them both: Do you believe that a strong national \nintelligence director with enhanced power to set collection priorities, \nto task the collection of intelligence, will improve the quality of \nintelligence that you both need in your capacity as policymakers?\n  Each answered with an enthusiastic and unambiguous ``yes.'' As \nSecretary Powell put it, our intelligence team needs, and I quote the \nSecretary, ``a stronger, empowered quarterback.'' The Collins-Lieberman \nbill would provide that quarterback.\n  Perhaps the most important power that we provide to the national \nintelligence director is the power of the purse. In order to foster \ncooperation throughout the intelligence community, the NID will have \ncontrol over the budget for national intelligence. Currently, that \nfunding is largely funneled through the Department of Defense, and the \ndirector of the CIA has only very limited authority over the overall \nresources of the intelligence community.\n  Under the Collins-Lieberman bill, the NID, in consultation with the \nagency and department heads, will develop and recommend an intelligence \nbudget to the President. After congressional action, it will be the NID \nwho receives the appropriations for what will be known as the national \nintelligence program. The NID will also have significant authority to \nreprogram and transfer funds so that he can marshal the resources \nneeded to counter a threat.\n  Never again should we have the kind of situation we saw with the \ndirectives issued by George Tenet in December of 1998, calling on the \nmarshaling of resources and yet nothing happens.\n  After careful consideration, the committee decided to declassify only \nthe aggregate figure for the national intelligence program. The \nCollins-Lieberman bill does not require the declassification of the \nbudget totals for the various agencies that make up the NIP. Our \nwitnesses generally urged great caution in going that far; instead, we \nrequire the directors to report to Congress on whether further \ndeclassification of budget totals is appropriate.\n  The NID will allocate the budget to the various intelligence agencies \nin accordance with the appropriations determined by the Congress. That \nincludes agencies such as the National Security Agency, the National \nGeospatial Intelligence Agency, the National Reconnaissance Office, and \nparts of the Defense Intelligence Agency which serve national \nintelligence consumers but are located within the Department of \nDefense. In recognition of the dual roles played by these important \nagencies, which provide critical intelligence not only to the \nDepartment of Defense but also to the CIA and other national customers, \nour bill keeps these agencies within the department but strengthens the \nNID's authority over them.\n\n  It is important to emphasize that nothing in the national \nintelligence agency's authority will in any way hinder military \noperations or readiness. Tactical and joint military intelligence \nprograms will remain under the control of the Pentagon and outside the \nnational intelligence program as they are today. The Collins-Lieberman \nbill will not affect the tactical intelligence assets of the Army, Air \nForce, Navy, or Marines. This bill will not impede the flow of real-\ntime actionable intelligence that our war fighters require. In fact, by \nstrengthening and improving the collection and analysis of \nintelligence, our legislation should improve the quality of \nintelligence provided to Pentagon officials and the combatant \ncommanders.\n  The members of the intelligence community collect a vast amount of \ninformation, but the Commission found that we have a weak system for \nprocessing and transmitting this information where it is needed. As the \n9/11 report reveals, this weakness has been evident during many \nterrorist attacks over many years. It took an attack that claimed the \nlives of 3,000 people for this weakness to be fully exposed, and now it \ncannot be ignored.\n  Our legislation contains strong provisions that make information \nsharing the rule, not the exception, and requires integrated \ncommunications networks to be developed, a serious deficiency in our \ncurrent system which Senator Durbin highlighted in our hearings. We \nsimply can no longer tolerate a system where the pieces of the puzzle \nare not assembled, where the CIA and the FBI each have vital, urgent, \nand compelling information, but no one puts the picture together.\n  The second major Commission recommendation included in our bill is \nthe establishment of a national counterterrorism center. It would \nexpand the communitywide intelligence analysis capabilities of the \nTerrorist Threat Integration Center established by the President last \nyear.\n  A major benefit of this new center is that much of its staff will be \ndrawn from the various intelligence agencies now scattered across the \nFederal Government. These intelligence experts will work side by side \nsharing and analyzing information, gaining an understanding of each \nother's mission, and\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\ncreating a culture of cooperation. A significant responsibility of the \nNCTC will be joint planning. The center will have the authority to \ndevelop plans that include a mission, objectives to be achieved, \ncourses of action, and recommendations from operational plans. \nMoreover, the center will assign responsibilities for counterterrorism \noperations to the agencies as set forth in these plans.\n  As an example of how this might work, the NCTC would have the \nauthority to create an interagency plan to dismantle a particular al-\nQaida cell. The center would assign specific tasks to the appropriate \nagencies. But I want to be clear that the NCTC would not have the \nauthority to tell any agency how it must execute that task, nor will it \nbe in the military chain of command. Should an agency object to the \nNCTC assignment, the national intelligence director could either accede \nto the objection or appeal to the President to resolve the conflict.\n\n  These provisions are important. They will ensure an integrated \napproach to operational planning. We are not telling the various \nagencies precisely how to carry out the plan, how to execute it, but we \nwill make sure that someone is looking at plans that span agencies, and \nin doing the planning when it affects more than one agency, when it is \njoint.\n  The legislation also includes provisions recommended by the \nCommission and authored by Senator Voinovich that streamline and \nstandardize the system for security clearances, a system that we have \nheard, over and over again, is inconsistent, slow, and backlogged. An \nimportant provision requires the President to designate a single agency \nto handle security clearances for Government employees and contractors.\n  The final chapter of the 9/11 report, the chapter that outlines the \nrecommendations we seek to implement, begins with this statement:\n\n       Some of the saddest aspects of the 9/11 story are the \n     outstanding efforts of so many individual officials \n     straining, often without success, against the boundaries of \n     the possible. Good people can overcome bad structures. They \n     should not have to.\n\n  This summarizes one of the major reasons we need reform. We have a \nsystem now that does not allow us to respond with agility to the \nthreats we face today.\n  As this next chart shows, in our legislation we are not adding a \nlayer of bureaucracy, nor are we breaking up individual agencies, nor \nare we creating a new department of intelligence. We are, instead, \ncreating a new structure for cooperation, accountability, and results. \nOur legislation gives the good people in our intelligence community the \nstructure they deserve. It also takes steps recommended by Senator Jay \nRockefeller, the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, to ensure \nthat we will always have good people. It creates a scholarship program \nto encourage bright young Americans to join the intelligence community \nand it will enable veteran intelligence officers to enhance their \nskills. Intelligence reform requires this investment in human capital. \nWe also create a reserve corps of retired intelligence officers who can \nbe called upon when their special skills and judgment are needed.\n  Our bill also creates a civil liberties board as recommended by the \nCommission and strengthened by amendments offered by Senator Durbin. \nNominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, the members of \nthis board will advise agencies of the civil liberties ramifications of \npolicies before they are adopted and then will conduct oversight.\n  In addition, our legislation will create both a civil liberties and \nprivacy officer as part of the new national intelligence authority.\n  The fundamental obligation of any government is to protect its \ncitizens. The American Government has an additional obligation to \nprotect the freedom of its citizens. Our legislation does not ask the \nAmerican people to choose between security and liberty. We firmly \nbelieve that no such choice is necessary. Our structure reflects that \nbelief.\n  To help ensure a smooth transition from the current structure to the \nnew, the bill provides a 6-month phase-in period that gives the \nPresident considerable discretion in implementing these reforms. We \nwill not let our guard down during any point in this process.\n  We also recognize that reforms of this magnitude require continued \nand careful congressional oversight and review. The bill includes a \nprovision recommended by former Senator Warren Rudman that requires a \nreport to Congress on implementation of these reforms after 1 year. As \na result of an amendment offered by Senator Pryor, it also includes a \nuseful requirement for a government accountability study and report to \nCongress.\n  As I have indicated, this legislation is the product of a concerted \neffort by the Governmental Affairs Committee. It reflects the \nrecommendations of other committees and it builds upon the work of the \n9/11 Commission. But it is important to know that the 9/11 Commission \ndid not start from scratch, either. Its work takes into account nearly \na half century of studies on intelligence reform dating back to the \nEisenhower administration.\n  The titles of the studies and commissions reads like a ``Who's Who'' \nof 20th century military, intelligence, and diplomatic expertise: \nHoover, Doolittle, Schlesinger, Rockefeller, Scowcroft, to name just a \nfew. These studies were conducted under a variety of conditions and \nthreats but a central theme emerges: America's intelligence system is \nhindered by a fragmented structure and compartmentalized thinking.\n  Our past failure to act on these many studies, which spans decades, \nwhich is repeated over and over again, is why we are here today. For \nexample, the Boren-McCurdy legislation of 1992 realized the emerging \nthreat of the post-Cold War era, terrorism, and weapons proliferation. \nUsing the successful restructurings of the military since World War II \nas models, the National Security Act of 1947 and the Goldwater-Nichols \nAct of 1986, this legislation called for the creation--yes, you guessed \nit, Mr. President--the creation of a national director of intelligence \nwith strong authority similar to what we propose today.\n  The Boren-McCurdy Act was not adopted. At the same time that those \nreforms were being set aside for another day, one component of our \nintelligence community had identified Osama bin Laden as the mastermind \nbehind a foiled plot to bomb American troops. Another noted bin Laden's \nclose ties to a known terrorist who was later revealed as the architect \nof the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Yet another considered bin \nLaden to be nothing more than an extremist financier. Information that \ncould have led to effective action against bin Laden a decade ago was \nthere, but it was not shared or acted on. In 1996, the Aspin-Brown \nCommission reached the same post-Cold War conclusion and made very \nsimilar reform recommendations. The result: yet another failure by \nCongress to take action.\n  Meanwhile, our intelligence community was starting to agree that bin \nLaden had started something called al-Qaida and that it was some kind \nof terrorist army. As the 9/11 Commission notes, however, every \nrelevant member of the intelligence community had a different plan for \ndealing with bin Laden and al-Qaida, from cruise missiles to diplomacy \nwith the Taliban. While these conflicting plans were butting heads, two \nAmerican Embassies in Africa were bombed, the attack on the USS Cole \nwas approved, and what became known as the Planes Operation was taking \nshape.\n\n  The need for reform was made clear by the 9/11 Commission's \nexhaustive study on the intelligence failures that preceded the murder \nof 3,000 innocent people on September 11, 2001. In late July of this \nyear, as the Governmental Affairs Committee's work began, Washington, \nNew York City, and northern New Jersey were placed under elevated \nterrorist alert, an alert that is still very much evident at the \nintersections of this city today. Our committee work neared its \nconclusion as terrorists murdered once again, this time at a \nschoolhouse in Russia.\n  These terrible events, combined with the slaughter we have seen in \nBali, Istanbul, Madrid, Jerusalem, Jakarta, and so many other places, \nleaves no doubt that the enemy we face has both a global reach and an \nunlimited capacity for cruelty. Our response must be far reaching, and \nit must unleash America's capacity to meet any challenge. This \nlegislation is an essential part of that response.\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\n  The calls for reform go back 50 years. For nearly 2 years, the 9/11 \nCommission conducted an investigation of unprecedented depth. Our \ncommittee produced comprehensive legislation with unanimous support.\n  Hardly a day passes in which we do not see new evidence of \nterrorism's depravity. Yet there are still some who say: We should \nwait. We need more information. Under the current threat of terrorist \nattack, the time is not right. The charged atmosphere of the election \nseason is not the right environment for such important decisions.\n  I ask, What more information do we need? Look at the list of \nwitnesses who appeared before the 9/11 Commission and our committee. \nWhat point of view has not been heard? What area of expertise was not \nexplored? What more compelling evidence do we need before we act?\n  I ask, If the time is not right now, when will the right time come? \nWhen will there be no threats? I ask, What could be more cynical than \nour failure to act on something of such critical importance to the \ncitizens of our country?\n  At our very first Commission hearing on July 30, Commission Chairman \nThomas Kean spoke on the need to move forward with these reforms. This \nis what he said--and I hope we will heed his words--\n\n       These people are planning to attack us again and trying to \n     attack us sooner, rather than later. Every delay we have in \n     changing structures or changing people . . . to make that \n     less likely is a delay the American people can't tolerate.\n\n  Yes, we can wait. We can wait until the day when we know everything \nwe possibly can know, when there are no more threats, when the American \npeople do not expect their leaders to lead. We can wait until the day \nanother attack leaves us all wondering once again why we did not see it \ncoming.\n  That first day will never come. If we do not act, the second surely \nwill.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request \nwhich I am really happy to make. I am sure Senator Collins, if she does \nnot know yet, will be happy to hear this. I ask unanimous consent to \nadd Senators Feinstein and Mikulski as cosponsors of our legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am truly proud to join with Chairman \nCollins in presenting to the Senate this historic bipartisan \nlegislation, the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.\n  Senator Collins deserves enormous credit for shepherding this bill \nthrough the Governmental Affairs Committee and for involving so many \ninterested parties to produce transformational reform, which, when \nimplemented, will make all Americans safer than we are today. It has \nbeen truly a personal pleasure to work with her and other members of \nour committee to produce the legislation we have brought before the \nSenate this afternoon.\n  On the day after the September 11 Commission report was issued and \nthe bipartisan leadership of this Senate, Senator Frist and Senator \nDaschle, gave the Governmental Affairs Committee jurisdiction to take \nup and discuss and report back to the full Senate on the executive \nbranch recommendations for intelligence reform, Senator Collins and I \nspoke and we agreed from the beginning that this was the moment to \nforget party labels and focus on the national security interests.\n  After all, not only were we attacked 3 years ago, we are under \nimminent threat of another terrorist attack. Al-Qaida and the other \nterrorist groups have made absolutely clear they intend to strike us \nagain. The news reports today feature warnings from our Government to \nvarious levels of Government throughout the country to be prepared and \non guard for the potential of terrorist attempts to disrupt our \nelection process, right up to and through election day.\n  So Senator Collins and I understood from the beginning that we had to \nwork together to do what was best for the country as we saw it. There \nwould be differences of opinion, but we would do everything we could to \nmake sure they were not partisan. That is exactly the tenor of the \nmarkup our committee conducted for 2 days last week. It was one of the \nbest 2 days of my 16 years as a Senator. When it was over, we had more \nthan 40 amendments filed with the committee. Not a single amendment was \ndecided on a partisan vote. One particular Democratic colleague said to \nme: For 2 days it was actually like we were legislating, the reason we \ncame here in the first place.\n  That is absolutely right. We produced a solid, bold bill to transform \nour intelligence community to meet the challenges of an age of \nterrorism. We present it to the Senate with a confidence that the \nmomentum that has been created by the 9/11 Commission, by the families \nof victims of September 11 appealing to us for action, by our own \ncommittee's nonpartisan work, will carry through the Senate, the House, \nthe conference committee, and we will get this critical job done and in \nlaw as soon as possible, certainly this year, hopefully before the \nelection.\n  I call this transformational reform because transformational reform \nis exactly what is necessary to face the enemy of today.\n  Terrorists working across national boundaries are brutal. They are \ninhumane. They strike, most of all, undefended targets, and they adapt \nto meet new circumstances. They are not going to be defeated solely, or \nperhaps even largely, in the end by military power or with the help of \nan intelligence system and community that were organized to fight the \nCold War and helped win the Cold War. We need to restructure our \nintelligence capabilities to meet the challenges of 21st century \nwarfare, and that means the war on terrorism.\n  That is what the legislation Senator Collins and I are presenting \ntoday will do. We owe a great debt to the seminal work of the 9/11 \nCommission and to their staff whose recommendations we relied on in \ndrafting this bill. The Commission spent a year and a half studying the \nweaknesses in our national defenses that left us vulnerable on \nSeptember 11, 2001. They interviewed more than 1,200 witnesses, \nreviewed literally millions of documents, held 12 public hearings, and \nproduced a compelling narrative, chilling in its details and \nimplications.\n  Under the strong leadership of Governor Kean and Congressman \nHamilton, this bipartisan Commission made 41 recommendations to \nstrengthen our country against terrorists. The two that they have \ncalled the most urgent--that is, the most time sensitive to act on--a \nstrong national intelligence director, and a national counterterrorism \ncenter, form the centerpiece of the legislation we put before the \nSenate today.\n  We owe a deep debt of gratitude as well to the courageous families of \nthose who died on September 11. We are here today because they turned \ntheir personal grief into an inestimable force for change, playing a \nvital role in getting the 9/11 Commission established in the first \nplace, working relentlessly to help the Commission through the rough \npatches it faced, and embracing and championing its final \nrecommendations. They are a mighty moral force. I continue to be awed \nand inspired by them in this debate. I will not forget their loss and \ntheir commitment to make sure that we reform our Government so that no \nother Americans face similar losses from 9/11 type attacks.\n  When the Commission released its report on July 22, very few would \nhave predicted that legislation would be on the Senate floor today and \nthe Senate would be poised to debate the most far-reaching reforms of \nour Nation's intelligence community in half a century. In fact, many \npredicted it would never happen. Most people thought it certainly \nwouldn't happen this year. Maybe next year. But the 9/11 Commission \nconfirmed what we knew--the work of protecting our Nation from \nterrorist attacks cannot wait and must not be delayed. Business as \nusual on these matters is not an acceptable option.\n  During August and early September, in fact beginning at the end of \nJuly, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee held, as Senator \nCollins said, eight hearings on the Commission's recommendations and \ndrafted a bill on their work. Last week we held a 2-day markup, \nconsidered more than 40 amendments, and voted the measure\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\nout of committee unanimously, with amendments adopted, good give and \ntake, thoughtful discussion, negotiation on wording that in the end \nstrengthened the authority and the position of national intelligence \ndirector.\n  Following the example of the 9/11 Commission, our committee members \ndid work, not as partisans, though we are in the midst of an election \ncampaign; we worked as Americans, concerned about the security of our \nfellow Americans and the responsibility we have to protect them. That \nis a much more compelling interest than any partisan political interest \nthat any one of us may have.\n\n  Although we have acted with speed, we have also acted with \ndeliberation. Our legislation is based not only on the comprehensive \nwork of the 9/11 Commission I have described but on the earlier work of \nthe joint House and Senate Intelligence Committees in their inquiry \ninto matters of intelligence, on the expertise of scores of experts who \nhave been thinking about this subject for decades, and on critical \nreports, as Senator Collins indicated, that date back not 10 or 20 \nyears but 50 years, making similar recommendations to the ones we have \nmade. It is a tragedy that it took 9/11 to shake us out of our \nbureaucratic lethargy to be on the edge of doing what should have been \ndone 50 years ago.\n  The fact is, we are not moving too fast. Three years have passed \nsince the devastation of the attacks of September 11. The 9/11 \nCommission has stated--and I think this says it all--``We are safer. \nBut we are not safe.'' That is why we are moving so swiftly in this \nproposal to modernize the management of our intelligence agencies, to \nmake sure we get the maximum in national security for the billions of \ndollars we are investing. Our enemies continue to plot against us, and \nintelligence is the first line of defense against these plots.\n  As the Commission report noted:\n\n       Not only does good intelligence win wars, but the best \n     intelligence enables us to prevent them from happening \n     altogether.\n\n  These are not ordinary times. Our citizens are still at risk. Our \nmilitary is on a wartime footing and in action, deployed abroad. So, \ntoo, we must be on wartime footing and deployed here at home.\n  September 11, 2001, reminds us that we can no longer afford to put \noff reform. In its extensive report, the 9/11 Commission literally \nindicted the status quo in America's intelligence community and \ninsisted on change. The report said:\n\n       As presently configured, the national security institutions \n     of the United States Government are still the institutions \n     constructed to win the Cold War.\n\n  The Cold War is over. We are now engaged in a wholly different \nconflict: a long-term war on terror. That is why the old systems of \nintelligence, the old structures must give way to new and more \neffective ones that meet our current threat.\n  A big part of the problem with the old structure, the Commission \nfound, is that it has no leader. Lee Hamilton, vice chair of the \nCommission, said:\n\n       A critical theme that emerged throughout our inquiry was \n     the difficulty of answering the question: Who is in charge? \n     Who ensures that agencies pool resources, avoid duplication, \n     and plan jointly? Who oversees the massive integration and \n     unity of effort to keep America safe? Too often, the answer \n     is no one.\n\n  Our intelligence community is like an army without a commanding \nofficer, a football team without a quarterback. It doesn't work; it is \nnot acceptable, not with the challenges we face.\n  No one below the level of the President is charged today with the \nresponsibility of overseeing a diffusion of organizations spread across \n15 agencies in our intelligence community. No one today has the \nauthority to knit together the efforts of these disparate elements; \ntherefore, no one is accountable for mistakes.\n  Senator Collins showed a chart which portrays the changes our reform \nproposes. For comparison, here is our best effort to show the current \nsystem. You see the President, but then you see stovepipes--CIA, \nDefense, Homeland Security, State, et cetera--without a leader. We \ncan't expect the President, with all the demands on the highest office \nin our Nation, to be on a daily basis coordinating this community which \nspends billions and billions of dollars every year--so stovepipes but \nnot coordination.\n  That leads to some of the shortcomings that Senator Collins so ably \nand eloquently dramatized.\n  In fact, the Commission's report describes over and over again the \nconsequences of the absence of a leader of our intelligence community \ntoday.\n  Senator Collins referred to George Tenet's call to war against \nterrorism, a directive sent to all of the agencies of the intelligence \ncommunity on December 4, 1998. What was done in response to that call \nto war? Nothing. Why? Because most of the members of the intelligence \ncommunity didn't think they had to do anything. The Commission \nconcluded that Tenet's declaration ``had little overall effect on \nmobilizing the CIA or the intelligence community'' because he didn't \nhave the power. He was not in control. The fallout, as we all know, was \na frustrating series of missed opportunities and an agonizing failure \nto piece together good information that different agencies had \ngathered--the failure to connect the dots.\n  We have a lot of able people and extraordinary capacities in our \nintelligence community. Nobody in the world can do all that we can do \nin intelligence. But if you don't bring it together in one place, if \nyou don't have coordination and leadership, literally one arm doesn't \nknow what the other is doing, and the national security suffers and the \nterrorists gain.\n  At its core, the configuration of the intelligence community today \nprevents us from drawing upon the experienced people, the ample \nresources, and the extraordinary information that are available within \nthe community. Some of the problem is this lack of leadership I have \ntalked about. Some of it is the top-to-bottom bureaucratic organization \nthat the stovepipes on the chart show. Too often, each of the 15 \nintelligence agencies reside in their own universe, walled off from \nalternative points of view, failing to share information, and adjusting \ntoo slowly to new and emerging threats. As the commissioner put it on \npage 353 of the 9/11 report:\n\n       Information was not shared, sometimes inadvertently or \n     because of legal misunderstandings. Analysis was not pooled. \n     Effective operations were not launched. Often, the handoffs \n     of information were lost across the divide separating the \n     foreign and domestic agencies of the government.\n\n  I depart from the quote. Even though the terrorists don't make that \nforeign and domestic divide, they are coordinating their activities; \nthey are at war against us without regard to bureaucratic or foreign \nand domestic divides.\n  The Commission said that:\n\n       The Agencies [of the intelligence community] are like a set \n     of specialists in a hospital, each ordering tests, looking \n     for symptoms, and prescribing medications. What is missing is \n     the attending physician who makes sure they work as a team.\n\n  Today, the head of the intelligence community--whom we call the DCI, \nDirector of Central Intelligence--only has effective control over the \nfunds of one agency within the entire community, and that is the CIA. \nThat means that roughly 80 percent of the national intelligence budget \nis not even controlled by the Director of Central Intelligence. We may \nhave won the Cold War with that structure, but as has been made \npainfully clear, it is not enough for the war on terror, if we are to \nlearn many lessons the hardest way possible. And agencies are doing a \nbetter job now sharing information and better coordinating their \nactivity, but the system is still not organized--certainly not as well \nas it should be to get maximum security from the billions of dollars \nAmerican taxpayers invest every year in the intelligence community.\n\n  Listen to this story. Philip Zelikow, the executive director of the \n9/11 Commission, spelled out the problem before our committee. He told \nof traveling to Pakistan and Afghanistan to visit representatives of \nvarious U.S. agencies working in the border areas there to determine, \nhe said, how they were working together, how they were integrating \ntheir hunt for Osama bin Laden. Surely, it is one of our most critical \nnational goals since September 11 to find bin Laden. So Zelikow asked \nhis host:\n\n       Well, where is the joint strategic plan for the hunt for \n     bin Laden? Where is the person who is in charge every day of \n     the integrated strategic plan, [who] updates that plan every \n     day of how we're hunting bin Laden?\n\n  What Zelikow found was that 3 years after September 11, ``there is no \nsuch\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\njoint plan. There isn't a joint integrated planner for that hunt.''\n  I imagine that will shock and unsettle the American people as much as \nit did the members of the Commission and the members of our committee. \nThat is why we want to put this national intelligence director and \nnational counterterrorism center in charge.\n  The legislation we are presenting today deals with these deficiencies \nby adopting two of the three critical Commission recommendations. Under \nour proposal, the national intelligence director would be the \nPresident's primary intelligence adviser but also the leader of the \nnational intelligence community, with strong budget, personnel, and \ntasking authorities to break down the stovepipes and knit the agencies \ntogether into a powerful, agile, effective network. Tom Kean and Lee \nHamilton told our committee they recommended a national intelligence \ndirector:\n\n       Not because we want to create some new ``czar'' or a new \n     layer of bureaucracy to sit atop the existing bureaucracy. We \n     come to this recommendation because we see it as the only way \n     to effect what we believe is necessary: a complete \n     transformation of the way the intelligence community does its \n     work.\n\n  The national intelligence director will have strong authority to \nreprogram and transfer money and people, so that he or she may react \nquickly to changing threats, and direct intelligence resources when and \nwhere they are most needed.\n  We heard from many witnesses before our committee about how critical \nit was to give the new national intelligence director budget authority \nif we wanted that director to forge the unity of effort we are looking \nfor. The Director of Central Intelligence currently has authority to \nreprogram funds but not real budget authority, and even the \nreprogramming authority is not exercised frequently because the process \ntakes from 3 to 5 months to complete. Imagine that. The threat of \nterrorism is daily, and it requires agility, quick action, and \nreprogramming funds to fight it, but reprogramming can take 3 to 5 \nmonths.\n  We heard from the former Director of the CIA, Jim Woolsey. He \ndescribed what he called the Washington version of the Golden Rule: \nWhoever has the gold makes the rules. That is why we want to give the \nnew national intelligence director real budget authority. Let me quote \nWoolsey:\n\n       If budget execution authority is given to the national \n     intelligence director, he will or she will have a much better \n     ability to say to the Secretary of State or Secretary of \n     Defense, ``Look, I sympathize, I understand. I know this \n     fluent Arabic language linguist is a very rare asset. But you \n     didn't hear me. I really need her or him.''\n\n  Unlike the current DCI, the new director would not run the CIA, while \nsimultaneously trying to manage the entire intelligence community. We \nare going to separate them. The 9/11 Commission told us you cannot be \nboth the President's principal intelligence adviser, the head of the \nintelligence community, and also run the CIA every day. So we have \nseparated those two functions.\n  Our proposal thus puts the director in charge of the national \nintelligence program, which will encompass all programs and \nintelligence activities concerned with ``national'' intelligence--the \ninterests of the entire nation rather than just one department.\n  Remember that our intelligence community ultimately serves the \nPresident as Commander in Chief, but the President is the head of our \nGovernment overall, representing the public interest. I know there are \nconcerns about how these changes might affect the American military, so \nlet me be very clear about this. Intelligence for use by the military \nservices must continue to be a top priority of the national \nintelligence director and of our intelligence community. Support of our \nwarfighters will always be a primary concern of our intelligence \ncommunity, but it is not the only concern. Under this organization, the \nwarfighter will benefit because as the national intelligence director \ntakes charge, our overall intelligence will become more effective, \nincluding for the warfighter.\n  As Senator Collins made clear, the Department of Defense will retain \ncontrol totally over the tactical military intelligence budgets.\n  Finally, the national intelligence director will have the assistance \nof a newly created Cabinet-level joint intelligence community council--\nSecretary Powell, when he appeared before us, compared this to the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff in the military--headed by the intelligence \ndirector as well as the Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, \nEnergy, and Homeland Security, as well as the Attorney General. This \ncouncil will advise the Director of Intelligence and ensure that the \ntimely execution of the Director's priorities within each member's \nrespective Department occurs. That reform, we believe, will bring \ndirection and focus to the intelligence community's work.\n  The national counterterrorism center, the second urgent major \nrecommendation made by the 9/11 Commission, is designed to overcome the \nfailure to share information, to break through the stovepipes, to \ncoordinate activities to make sure, to the best of our ability, that \nnever again does 1 agency of our Government see 2 terrorist suspects \ncoming into our country and not tell the border security agencies and \nthose 2 end up as 2 of the 19 who attacked us on September 11.\n  Our legislation establishes the center with two key functions: First, \nto build on the Terrorist Threat Integration Center now housed at the \nCIA and ensure that intelligence from all sources in our Government is \nintegrated and analyzed. In other words, this is the place where we can \nbe sure the dots will be connected. Second, it will develop interagency \ncounterterrorism plans and assign agencies responsibilities and monitor \nand report on implementation of the plans.\n  The obvious point here is if we are going to have everybody at the \nsame table sharing the intelligence they collected, the analysis they \nmake of it, it makes every bit of common sense to authorize them to \nplan together what to do about it.\n  This counterterrorism center--and I note the occupant of the chair is \na member of the Armed Services Committee--would be comparable to the \ncombatant commands, the joint commands that were created pursuant to \nthe Goldwater-Nichols Act of the mid-eighties. These operations that \nwould be planned could be on the larger strategic level, such as how do \nwe win the war on terrorism, how do we win the hearts and minds of \npeople in the Muslim world, and, of course, they also should be on the \nmore tactical level: What can we do together to more quickly capture or \nkill bin Laden? What can we do together about this terrorist cell we \nsee in some American city?\n  Here is what the Commission chairman and vice chair said about this:\n\n       Today, we face a transnational threat. That threat respects \n     no boundaries and makes no distinction between foreign and \n     domestic. The enemy is resourceful, flexible and disciplined. \n     We need a system of management that is as flexible and \n     resourceful as is the enemy. We need a system that can bring \n     all the resources of Government to bear on the problem--and \n     that can change and respond as the threat changes. We need a \n     model of Government that meets the needs of the 21st century. \n     We believe that the National Counterterrorist Center will \n     meet that test.\n\n  So, too, of course, Senator Collins and I and the members of our \ncommittee, whose bill we put before you today, would establish such a \ncenter.\n  This is a critical reform. It will triumph over the bureaucratic \ninaction and failure to share information described by the Commission \nthroughout its report. Let me just give this example from the report.\n  In late 1999, the National Security Agency, which overseas the \ncollection of signal intelligence, analyzed communications to and from \nand about some people they were watching who turned out to be future \nterrorist hijackers of September 11. NSA correctly concluded that \nsomeone named ``Nawaf'' and his accomplice named ``Khalid'' were part \nof ``an operational cadre,'' and that ``something nefarious might be \nafoot.'' But the NSA, and that particular analyst and others, did not \nthink its job was to pursue further the identities of these men because \nit saw itself as a support agency that should energetically respond to \nrequests for information, listen to conversations, et cetera, but not \ninitiate investigations. It turns out there was additional valuable \ninformation right in the NSA computers regarding these two terrorists \nwhich, had it been checked, might well have thwarted the 9/11 plot.\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\n  The Commission tells us how the CIA tracked Nawaf and Khalid to Kuala \nLumpur and then lost them when they traveled to Bangkok. The evidence \nis that one of the men's passports indicated that a possible \ndestination and interdiction point was the United States. Yet no one \nalerted the Immigration and Naturalization Service or the FBI, and so \nthese 2 arrived in Los Angeles unhindered on January 15, 2000, and \nbecame 2 of the 19 September 11 terrorist attackers.\n  The Commission report notes the response of different officials to \nthis information. There was confusion about who was supposed to do \nwhat. The head of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center at the time did not \nrecall why the case fell through the cracks or off the radar. The \nDirector of the al-Qaida unit in CIA did not think it was his job to \ndetermine what actions should or should not be taken in a case such as \nthis.\n  Under our proposal, the national counterterrorism center will put in \nplace interagency orders to make sure rules and responsibilities for \ncounterterrorism missions are clear. It will monitor the implementation \nof those plans to make sure information so critical does not fall \nthrough the cracks of bureaucratic stovepipes again and that no one \ndrops the ball again and that the American people are never left \nunprotected again.\n  As the Commission recommended, the national intelligence director \nwill also have authority to create new national intelligence centers \nbeyond the Counterterrorism Center to integrate capabilities across the \nintelligence community to focus on other threats, such as weapons of \nmass destruction, or geographic areas, such as North Korea. You can \nimagine a national intelligence center on North Korea or Iran or, more \nspecifically, on what we are so worried about today: the development of \na potential nuclear weapons capability in Iran. This would bring \neveryone in our Government who knows anything about such a capability \ntogether to share information and analysis, and develop plans.\n  Senator Collins talked about the information-sharing parts of our \nreport, and I will not go over that any further except to say that I am \nproud of what we have done here. We built on some excellent work done \nby the Markle Foundation which, quite rightly, suggested the old need-\nto-know standard in intelligence ought to be broken to allow more \nsharing at every level of our Government to maximize protection of the \npublic.\n  I do want to say that Senator Durbin has for years championed the \nidea that we need a concerted effort to make sure that information is \nshared throughout our Government in a systematic way, using the best of \nmodern information technology to gather, pool, and understand \ninformation--a Manhattan Project, as Senator Durbin likes to call it, \nfor information sharing. His ideas are reflected in substantial parts \nof this report, and I thank him for it.\n  We have a very important section on civil liberties. Again, Senator \nCollins referred to this, and I will just say briefly that throughout \nour history, America has always balanced the joint concerns and \ncommitments to security, without which there is no liberty, and \nliberty. We seek security for a purpose, which is to protect our \nliberties so as not to compromise the liberties that define us as \nAmericans.\n  As the 9/11 Commission said, we are at a stage in our history, after \nhaving been attacked as we never were before on September 11, where the \nGovernment will have to play a more active role in American life. We \nwant to make sure as that happens that the liberties of the American \npeople are not compromised.\n  There is a broad section on independence--which in some senses goes \nbeyond what the 9/11 Commission was specifically responding to, and \nresponds to other concerns that people in both parties and both \nChambers have had--to make sure that the intelligence product the \nPresident gets and that we in Congress get is independent and \nobjective.\n  Senator Rockefeller brought to this matter his extraordinary \nexpertise as ranking member of the Intelligence Committee. He deserves \nspecial thanks from our committee for the many contributions he made to \nthe bill that we put before the Senate. I mention him because he had \nuniquely the idea of creating an ombudsman within the National \nIntelligence Authority who will serve as an independent counselor for \ncomplaints, but more than that, an independent reviewer of analytical \nproducts throughout the intelligence community to ensure that the \nintelligence advice the President and Members of Congress get is free \nof bias of any kind, political or otherwise.\n  In private industry, there is not a business I know that can afford \nit, that does not have some kind of quality control system. In some \nsense we do not have a quality control system for the $40 billion-plus \nwe spend on intelligence, and this office of ombudsman will be the \nquality control office for American intelligence.\n  Senator Rockefeller is also the author of the national intelligence \nreserve corps idea. It is a great idea, allowing in these demanding \ntimes for temporary reemployment of retired intelligence community \nemployees with specialized skills to help us meet emergency mission \nrequirements.\n  Senator Levin helped improve Congress's access to intelligence, and \nto require that the information is free from bias, with substantial \ninput to this bill as a member of our committee.\n  Senator Pryor, too, added significantly to the bill. Because of his \nefforts, we will have reports from the Government Accountability \nOffice, the GAO, providing us with an assessment as to how this \nlegislation is actually being implemented, enabling Congress to be more \neffective in our oversight. I hope it will give some sense of assurance \nto those who wonder how this will all work that we have built in look-\nbacks to make sure that if it is not working in all of its particulars \nas we want it to, we will know that and we will act on it.\n  The 9/11 Commission report tells us:\n\n       Our biggest weapon of defense is our intelligence system. \n     If that doesn't work, our chances of being attacked are so \n     much greater. So our major recommendation is to fix that \n     intelligence system and do it as fast as possible. Chairman \n     Tom Kean said:\n       Not only does good intelligence win wars, but the best \n     intelligence enables us to prevent them from happening \n     altogether.\n\n  Intelligence has always been critical to warfare. In many ways, it is \neven more critical to the war on terrorism because we face an enemy \nunlike any we faced before, whose basic mode of operating is to strike \nundefended targets, to strike not at the military but to strike at \nundefended, innocent civilians. Intelligence is critical so we can see \nand hear what our terrorist enemies are planning so we can stop them \nbefore they strike at us again.\n  Senator Collins and I have taken the words of the Commission to heart \nand are offering this historic and transformational reform in direct \nresponse to those words. We have hewn very close to the Commission's \nintelligence reform recommendations and are proud and grateful to have \nthe explicit support of the chairman, vice chairman, and the members of \nthis extraordinary bipartisan Commission.\n\n  Yes, we are moving quickly but we are moving quickly for a reason. As \nI have said, our terrorist enemies are not mired in bureaucratic \ntradition. They are flexible. They are agile, brutal, and inhumane. We \nmust be, in all of our humanity, with all of our values, as powerful, \nagile, and quick to change as they are. If we hesitate, we will truly \npay the consequences again.\n  The Deputy Director of the CIA's counterterrorism center, Philip \nMudd, summed it up when he told our committee:\n\n       We need clear, clean, short lines of command and control. \n     Opportunities to roll up a terrorist or prevent an attack \n     demand immediate action. This is a war of speed.\n\n  Those are important words to remember.\n  I expect some of the most significant amendments that will be \npresented on the floor will be those that I am afraid will blur the \nclear, clean, short lines of command and control.\n  Preserving the strength of the national intelligence director is one \nof the critical aims that Senator Collins and I have as we go forward \nwith this debate.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller said:\n\n       Don't create a national intelligence director with no real \n     authority, because you will have the worst of all worlds \n     then.\n\n  Interestingly, that was echoed by the now former Acting Director of \nthe CIA,\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nJohn McLaughlin, when he said, and I paraphrase with apologies, the \nonly thing worse than doing nothing is to create a national \nintelligence director without real authority. Then it is just another \nlayer of bureaucracy.\n  We have to establish that 21st century management system we have \ntalked about.\n  So in a Congress that unfortunately over the years has grown \nincreasingly partisan, in the middle of an election season which is \ninherently political and partisan, Senator Collins, the members of our \ncommittee, and I, on a bipartisan basis, putting aside our partisan \nlabels to work exclusively for the national security interests, present \nthis proposal to the Senate. Every member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee worked hard, with some disagreements, and ultimately \nsupported the proposal.\n  There is now a significant political consensus for change. Momentum \nis building and I am confident our colleagues in the Senate will rise \nto the challenge and take strong action in the national interest. We \nare, after all, a nation at war, a war like none we have ever fought. \nWe must maximize and transform our ability to defend our Nation to meet \nthis new threat. We cannot do that without the best intelligence \npossible.\n  Senator Collins and I are confident that the proposal we put before \nour colleagues today will result in just that, the best intelligence \npossible. It deserves the support of our colleagues in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise in support of the National \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004, the bill that Senator Collins and \nSenator Lieberman have discussed. I speak not only as the Senator from \nWest Virginia but also as the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I begin by expressing my thanks for the bipartisan cooperation of \nChairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman, their staffs, and \nmembers of their committee for the way in which they worked and reached \nout across the intelligence community. It was an extraordinary thing, \nsomething one does not see around here very often.\n  I lend my voice as strongly as I can to theirs in saying that \nCongress--and by that I mean both the Senate and the House--should pass \nand enact this critical legislation before we recess.\n  I certainly am committed to making that happen, as I know Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman are. With an equal level of commitment \nfrom the Senate leadership, the House leadership, and the President of \nthe United States, we can meet this ambitious goal, a goal about which, \na month ago, even 3 weeks ago, people would have said is absolutely \nimpossible. This has to not be put off. Distinguished statesmen from \neras gone by have said we can't do these things, we have to take our \ntime.\n  I say, from time to time, when you give Congress the time to do \nsomething, we may not. If you give us a little bit of time to do \nsomething very important, we may very well. I believe this is one of \nthose cases.\n  In just the past 2 years, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \nhas put forth not one, but two, frankly, quite devastating \ninvestigative reports about what surely rank among the greatest \nintelligence failures in the history of our country, to wit, the \nterrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the intelligence estimates \nprior to the war in Iraq, particularly those that related to weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  In December of 2002, after 2 years of painstaking work by a \ncongressional joint inquiry--it was the House and Senate Intelligence \nCommittees acting together as one, for a very long period of about a \nyear and a half, where we worked side by side and we also issued a \nreport and series of recommendations reflecting the suggestions about \nthe 9/11 attacks. It is extraordinary when one reads that and one reads \nthe 9/11 Commission Report, how much is familiar, as between the one \nand the other; more eloquently expressed by far in the 9/11 Commission \nReport but nevertheless in both reports.\n  In early July of this year, less than 3 months ago, we released a \nreport on the collection and analysis and dissemination of prewar \nintelligence leading up to the war in Iraq, as I have indicated. That \n511-page investigation, reported out of our committee by a unanimous \nvote of 17 to nothing, thoroughly detailed how the analytical judgments \nabout Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs were flawed, \nexaggerated, and misleading. And there were no doubters. There were no \ndoubters. There were different points of view, but there were no \ndoubters on those central premises.\n  It showed in plain terms that the intelligence community had failed \nto provide intelligence assessments prior to the war that were timely, \nobjective, and in this Senator's opinion, independent of political \nconsiderations, as is legally required under the National Security Act \nwhich defines so much of what we do.\n  Then, a few weeks later, the independent national 9/11 Commission, \nled by Governor Tom Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton, himself a former \nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee, published its findings \nand recommendations, and in so doing took our work a much needed, a \nvery critical step down the road.\n  The 9/11 Commission not only very powerfully described the individual \norganizational and systematic failures prior to the attacks, but they \nalso set forth a very specific agenda for reform in what I thought were \nclearly readable, logical, and understandable ways. They addressed our \nintelligence shortcomings and proposed restructuring the intelligence \ncommunity so that it would be more effectively managed, better prepared \nto deal both offensively and defensively with the terrorist threat that \nfaces our Nation.\n  By the end of July, mere days before this Senate was scheduled to \nadjourn for a lengthy recess that is called August, the case for \nreforming the intelligence community had been described in more \nconvincing detail than ever before, and the question suddenly became no \nlonger should the intelligence community be reformed, but when. Most \nMembers of Congress understood this. The American people certainly \nunderstood this. Even the leaders of the Central Intelligence Agency \nand other intelligence agencies seemed to have concluded on their own \nthat the intelligence communities, after 57 years of largely static \nexistence, denigrating nothing that they have done following its Cold \nWar birth, rooted in that tradition and in that culture, is in need of \nan overhaul. One does not simply say let us have an overhaul. One \nproduces legislation to create it, and that is exactly what the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has so brilliantly done, which is not to \nsay that this is all new, or even a reflection of only recent events.\n\n  I am aware of no fewer than 46 significant studies, reviews, and \ncommissions on the organization of the U.S. intelligence community, \ndating back to 1949. Nearly half of those were completed in the past 10 \nyears, each proposing ways to improve and restructure our intelligence \noperation.\n  The issue of reforming the intelligence community has been swirling \nabout Capitol Hill for decades now. The concept of creating a position \nsuch as a national intelligence director, in fact, dates back to the \nNixon administration. These past commissions' recommendations were \nnever enacted, for a whole host of reasons, some of which we will not \ndiscuss at the present time, not the least of which was that there was \nreally no momentum. There was no sort of galvanizing event or series of \nevents and the will, therefore, in the Congress, joining with the \nadministration, never came to be.\n  Today we have that commitment, largely and sadly because we are \ngripped by present and growing signs of terrorism around the world and \nat home, true terrorism in which violence is not merely a means but \nalso an end unto itself. I am talking now beyond even the tragedy of \nthe 9/11 event itself.\n  Madam President, 95 percent of the population growth in this next \ngeneration throughout the world will take place in precisely the 5 \npercent of the land on the Earth which is poorest. If that is not a \nprecalculated formula for the unleashing of people who want to find a \ncause or reason for justifying themselves as young men and women--I \ntalk about 14- and 15-year-olds. One looks at the average age of people \nin\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\nIraq, which is 19. 40 percent of them were born either during or after \nthe Persian Gulf war. They have known nothing but violence.\n  So it is a part of our future. Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman \nunderstand that, and they have created legislation to help us deal with \nthat from the intelligence perspective. As Senator Lieberman said, \nintelligence has taken on a new role because terrorists, jihadists, \nthose who misinterpret good doctrine in the Koran, religious doctrine--\nthey are not afraid in the same way of military might as they used to \nbe. Still very much so, still very much in play, the attempts to find \nOsama bin Laden have shown us, in a peculiarly unpleasant way, that it \nis not just airplanes and bombs and laser bombs and smart bombs and the \nrest of it that can find the people we must find. It is, indeed, \nintelligence or the lack of intelligence which has made that \nimpossible.\n  So we have now the best chance in at least a generation, thanks to \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman and their committee, for getting \nat the heart of the problem in the intelligence community. It is past \ntime to get the work done. The Senate bill we are considering is \nserious, comprehensive, and careful. On the other hand, I must say I am \nsomewhat dismayed at reports of the efforts in the House--I must be \nfrank; I mean to offend nobody--where I understand the bill which is \nunder consideration may be much weaker, perhaps by design, and contains \nunnecessary and highly controversial items meant to slow debate. I pray \nthat I am wrong on that. But we must have that in mind.\n  If reports are also true that the minority has been shut out of the \nprocess, with exactly the opposite of what happened in the Collins-\nLieberman approach to crafting this bill, then the House leadership has \na great deal of work to get things back on track.\n  I think the President will face a great test of his leadership. Will \nhe step forward to encourage full and far-reaching intelligence reform, \nas he has partly done so far already, taking steps which some were not \nsure that he would be willing to take? Or will he look the other way, \nand let things happen as they will? We need him and his influence in \nthis Chamber and in the House Chamber, and I am confident that will \nhappen.\n  If the Senate and the House and the President squander this \nopportunity to allow the momentum behind the reform to lapse in the \nnext year, we will have failed--and we will not fail. Other things will \ngrab our attention even as exacting and devastating as this problem is. \nSo we must not fail. We must not fail the American people. They expect \nreform, and we are not going to fail them.\n  As to the substance, briefly: The Governmental Affairs Committee's \nwork embraces the key principles of the 9/11 Commission except in a few \ninstances where they saw things otherwise, such as the 9/11 Commission \nsuggested locating the new national intelligence director inside the \nExecutive Office of the President. The Commission felt that was a good \nidea. The committee felt that was not such a good idea, so it is not \nhappening. They dealt in the same way with the suggestions made by \nparamilitary activities ongoing by the CIA, with respect to changing \nthose. And once again the Collins-Lieberman committee made those \nchanges.\n  As my colleagues know, the lead recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission are the creation of a national intelligence director and a \nnational counter-terrorism center. Senators Lieberman and Collins have \nboth explained those very thoroughly here today. The Commission \ncorrectly saw in the intelligence community's current organizational \narrangement a fragmented array of budget, personnel, and tasking \nauthorities that inhibit the sharing of information and prevent \ncoordination of efforts under a single accountable individual. This \nlack of consolidated authority undercuts the ability and the willing \nability of the intelligence community to function as a true community, \nand more specifically prevents America from bringing the maximum force \nof intelligence, military, and law enforcement weapons to bear against \nal-Qaida and other terrorists both here and abroad.\n  I have had a chance to carefully review the bill. I don't enjoy \nreading bills, but I have read this bill of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. And it is, so far as this Senator can say, and many others, \nfaithful to the 9/11 Commission's most important recommendations, and \ncreates many of its own.\n  The bill creates a national intelligence director, of course, and a \nnational counter-terrorism center with unified authorities that will \ncorrect the inefficiencies and lack of accountability that exists.\n  That was the beginning. Some will say--it is important to say these \nthings--that the national intelligence director established in this \nlegislation is too strong because the position will manage the budget \nand operations of three national intelligence agencies currently under \nthe Pentagon's control. Here we get onto somewhat sacred ground. I \nspeak of the National Security Agency, the National Reconnaissance \nOffice, the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.\n  Others will criticize the bill by saying that the national \nintelligence director is too weak because the position does not have \nso-called ``day-to-day operational control'' over these three agencies \nI have just mentioned which also serve important combat functions \ninside the Pentagon. These critics are advocating in effect the \ncreation of a new department of national intelligence. Senator \nLieberman indicated that was not what they wanted to do, and thankfully \nthat is not what they have done. In my view, the bill that was reported \nout unanimously by the Governmental Affairs Committee strikes precisely \nthe right balance between these two positions.\n  The budgetary, personnel, and management tasking authorities \nconsolidated under the national intelligence director are substantial \nimprovements over those now at the disposal of the current Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  I remember asking George Tenet when he was Director of the CIA, on \nseveral occasions--I think he was not happy with the question, but he \nwas forthright with his answer--if you could control, don't you want to \ncontrol what goes on at NSA, or NRO, or the Geospatial folks--it wasn't \ncalled that then--and he said, I can only and will only seek to have \nauthority over what in fact I have budgetary authority. I cannot \nexercise control beyond that.\n\n  The committee has reached that point to say that we have to have one \nperson who has the budgetary control to do these things. The budgetary \ncontrol of personnel, management, and tasking authorities consolidated \nin the national intelligence director is an enormous improvement over \nthose now at the disposal of the current Director of Central \nIntelligence.\n  Moreover, the bill recognizes that the national intelligence director \nwill have to rely on the expertise of the newly created deputies and \nthe agency heads beneath them to manage the intelligence collected from \ndomestic, foreign, and military forces. It acknowledges implicitly and \nexplicitly the connection of the time and attention between military \nand intelligence. Chairman Collins addressed this very directly. It \naccommodates the military's legitimate need to control its own \noperations without giving short shrift to all of the nonmilitary \nconsumers of intelligence, one of whom, incidentally, happens to be \nPresident of the United States.\n  To put it another way, this bill achieves the fundamental \nrestructuring of the intelligence community while preserving an \nunderlying management arrangement that can implement the new director's \ndirectives in a coordinated way which is altogether missing today. \nFifteen pairs of oars pulling at the same time under the direction of \none captain--that is the concept at the heart of this legislation.\n  I would also like to highlight a couple of additional items the \ncommittee made which I feel very good about. Both have been mentioned \nby Chairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman.\n  The communitywide ombudsman to handle concern from the analysts--we \nheard a great deal about this--over the shaping or politicalization or \npotential, referring to the future, of intelligence, such as were \nvoiced by analysts in the preparation of intelligence reports on Iraq \nin the fall of 2002.\n\n[[Page S9709]]\n\n  Creating this ombudsman, which the bill does, is an important way to \nensure that policy considerations do not compromise the independence \nand objectivity of the intelligence community's judgment.\n  Second, Senator Lieberman referred to this--I believe we need an \nintelligence reserve corps. The intelligence community can get \nstretched very thin. It was, for example, during Kosovo. We saw that \nduring that time. Currently, in Afghanistan and Iraq, we see it now. We \nsimply stop doing other important intelligence work, which in fact must \ncontinue in other parts of the world because resources are moved from \nsome important place which is evolving into the current situation. One \ncan't afford to do that in intelligence. We need to support the war \nsite foremost at all costs, but we need to have the backup to make sure \nwe are looking at intelligence on a worldwide basis. The intelligence \nreserve corps will do that. We don't want to miss a nuclear test. I am \nsorry; we have in the past. The intelligence community has missed it. \nWe don't want that to happen again.\n  Finally, I do think that our reform bill should establish a permanent \nanalytical red team under the national intelligence director to test \nthe key underlying--I use the word ``assumptions'' in analytical \nreports.\n  The legislation before us includes a review unit under the office of \nthe new ombudsman which is helpful but, if I may be allowed to say so, \nI don't think goes quite far enough and simply will be a matter of \ndiscussion for the floor. I believe we need a red team unit to work \ninside the analytical process before it has produced a product. In \nother words, as intelligence reports are being formulated, not after \nthe fact of their formulation into a product. I hope we can work on \nthat concept as we debate the legislation.\n  In closing, I believe the bill before the Senate has taken an \nextremely complex and in certain respects arcane subject matter, the \norganization of the U.S. intelligence community, and proposed a \nsensible approach to long overdue reform. This bill will make \nconsiderable headway toward learning from the mistakes of the past and \nstrengthening our national security.\n  I again thank Senator Collins, Senator Lieberman, and their staff for \nworking in the highest tradition of this body.\n  I also want to extend my appreciation to Majority Leader Frist and \nMinority Leader Daschle for making the national intelligence reform the \ntop priority of the Senate in the waning days of this Congress.\n  Two weeks from the third anniversary of the September 11 attacks, we \nstand on the threshold of passing landmark legislation that few would \nhave thought possible even 3 weeks ago. The planets are aligned. Let's \nfinish our work and pass this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his eloquent statement of support for this legislation. As vice \nchairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, he brings extraordinary \nknowledge to this debate. We are very grateful for his contributions to \nthe Collins-Lieberman bill.\n  As both Senator Lieberman and I mentioned, Senator Rockefeller \nresponded to our request for input and advice. We incorporated into our \nlegislation several of the suggestions he provided. We are very \ngrateful to have his support. It means a great deal as we proceed with \nthis debate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, let me join Senator Collins in \nthanking Senator Rockefeller across the board--most immediately, to say \nhow significant it is to Senator Collins and me that Senator \nRockefeller has joined as a cosponsor of this proposal. Senator Collins \nand I happen to not only be on the Governmental Affairs Committee, we \nare on the Armed Services Committee, so we know something about \nintelligence. Truthfully, we do not claim expertise, and the Senator \nhas expertise.\n  As we have discussed, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle were very \nwise in giving our committee jurisdiction because we are the committee \non governmental reorganization without a particular interest. But to do \nour job well we depended on the members, the leaders of the other \nsubject matter committees to counsel with us and to help turn out the \nbest product we could. We sent letters to all the relevant committees, \nand the Senator responded magnificently. The Senator's imprint is all \nover this bill.\n  His statement today was eloquent and rose to the national \nresponsibility. I appreciate it greatly.\n  The problem for Senator Rockefeller is that Senator Collins and I are \nnow not going to let him leave the Senate floor for the remainder of \nthe debate--well, occasionally. The Senator's informed involvement in \nthis legislation will help the Senate do the right thing, which is to \npass this bill and hopefully get it enacted before we leave so we can \nget it going for our intelligence services.\n  I thank the Senator for all he has done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I begin by commending the leadership \nfrom both sides of the aisle for working together to allow critical \ndebate to begin today on legislation to implement the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations. In my view, this debate is perhaps one of the most \nimportant that will be held during the 108th Congress.\n  I acknowledge the great leadership of the bill managers, Senators \nCollins and Lieberman, for their bipartisan work in reporting the \npending legislation, reform legislation to the Senate. It is my \nunderstanding the bill was reported out by unanimous vote through the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which is a significant accomplishment. \nThey have developed sound legislation following the numerous hearings \nthey held during the last 2 months. I commend them for their dedication \nto this very important legislation. Also, I point out that Senator \nCollins and Senator Lieberman, their staff, and members of the \ncommittee gave up a significant part of their August recess in order to \nhold a sufficient number of hearings in order to be able to frame this \nlegislation.\n  We have come a long way since 2001 in enhancing this country's \nability to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, but, as the 9/11 \nCommission said in its final report, we are not yet safe. Increasing \nour safety against terrorist attack requires new strategies, new ways \nof thinking, and new ways of organizing our Government. That is what \nthis legislative debate will be all about.\n  The 9/11 Commission's underlying goal was to determine where we went \nwrong and what we can learn from identified failures, weaknesses, and \nvulnerabilities in order to make necessary systematic corrections to \nbetter protect our Nation. I firmly believe the Commission accomplished \nits enormous assignment. It carried out a far-ranging and candid \nassessment in order to account for the failures of vision, threat \nassessment, and policy actions that preceded the attacks. I again thank \nGovernor Kean and Congressman Hamilton for their commendable leadership \nof the Commission and the other Commissioners and their staff as well. \nThey performed a tremendous service for our country while leaving \npolitics at the door. Now it is the turn of the Congress to act on the \nCommission's report.\n  Earlier this month, I joined with Senator Lieberman and others in \nintroducing comprehensive legislation to implement all of the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. The bill before the Senate, developed by \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, S. 2845, the National Intelligence \nReform Act of 2004, addresses the Commission's recommendations \nregarding intelligence reform, information sharing, and civil \nliberties. It is Senator Lieberman's and my intent to ensure the \nCommission's other recommendations--those not already addressed in the \nunderlying bill--are fully debated; therefore, we will be offering \namendments we hope will be adopted in order for the Senate to send to \nconference a comprehensive bill addressing the full range of the \nCommission's recommendations.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3702\n\n       (Purpose: To add title VII of S. 2774, related to \n     transportation security)\n  I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3702.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this amendment is designed to address \nthe transportation security-related recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission. The amendment is almost identical to title VII of S. 2774, \nthe 9/11 Commission Report Implementation Act of 2004, which Senator \nLieberman and I introduced earlier this month.\n  It is important that during this debate we acknowledge the progress \nthat has already been made since September 11 in improving \ntransportation security, especially for aviation. However, as the \nCommission points out, significant challenges remain. For example, the \ncomputer systems and protocols used to vet passengers before they board \na plane are not substantially different than the systems that failed to \nprevent the terrorists from boarding the planes on September 11.\n  The Commerce Committee held a hearing on August 16, 2004, to examine \nthese recommendations and heard testimony from the Commission and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. This amendment reflects both the \nCommission's recommendations and that testimony.\n  The amendment implements the Commission's recommendations on \ntransportation security in the following three ways: One, establishing \na national strategy for transportation security; two, assigning \nresponsibility for the no-fly list to the Transportation Security \nAdministration; and three, enhancing passenger and cargo screening.\n  I will briefly discuss each of these recommendations.\n  The Commission found that TSA had no comprehensive strategic plan for \nthe transportation sector or plans for the various transportation \nmodes--air, sea, and ground--and, therefore, called for such a plan to \nbe developed. This amendment would require the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to develop a strategy that includes identification and \nevaluation of homeland transportation assets susceptible to attack; \nanalysis of methods and technologies associated with transportation \nsecurity methods; the development of risk-based priorities and \ndeadlines; a plan that assigns roles to the Federal Government, State \ngovernment, local governments, and public utilities while encouraging \npublic sector cooperation and participation; an outline of response and \nrecovery responsibilities; prioritization of research and development \nobjectives; and recommendations for a budget and appropriate levels of \nfunding. The amendment also requires the strategy to be developed and \ntransmitted to Congress no later than April 1, 2005, and subsequent \nsubmissions would be required not less frequently than April 1 of each \neven-numbered year.\n  We must indeed make sure our skies are safe. But we cannot focus only \non the so-called last war. Recent events around the world have shown \nthat other modes of transportation are vulnerable to terrorist attacks. \nWe must ensure that we are aware of threats aimed at any and all modes \nof transportation as we determine how best to manage our resources to \ndefend our homeland. This comprehensive plan, calling for specific \ncriteria to be considered, will be a strong step in that direction.\n\n  Understandably, aviation was the subject of our immediate reaction to \n9/11. I think it is clear events such as the Madrid rail bombing and \nother events throughout the world indicate that we must be equally \nattentive and equally committed to addressing those threats as well.\n  The 9/11 Commission also recommended that the process of screening \npassengers against the no-fly list be performed by TSA and should \nutilize the larger set of watch lists maintained by the Federal \nGovernment. It further suggested that air carriers should be required \nto supply the information needed to test and implement this new system. \nBased on the Commission's recommendations, this amendment directs the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to implement a procedure under which the \nTSA compares information about passengers aboard all passenger aircraft \nwith a database containing known or suspected terrorists and \nassociates, commonly known as a no-fly list. This procedure is \ncurrently performed by individual air carriers, meaning each air \ncarrier has its own separate no-fly process.\n  By placing the burden squarely on the TSA, we will ensure there is a \nsingle database used to check the names of passengers against. I might \nadd that I hope the TSA moves forward with its assessment on how best \nto develop a prescreening program that will assess the risk of \npassengers even if they do not appear on the no-fly list.\n  The Commission also concluded that further improvements are needed in \npassenger and cargo screening. For example, currently there is no \nwidespread use of technology to screen the actual passengers for \nexplosives at passenger checkpoints, but only for screening passengers' \nchecked luggage and carry-on luggage. Based on the recommendation of \nthe 9/11 Commission, this amendment directs the Secretary to take \naction in improving passenger screening checkpoints to detect \nexplosives. Within 90 days after the implementation of this act, the \namendment would call for the Secretary to transmit a report and \nschedule to the Senate and the House of Representatives on how to \nachieve the objectives previously mentioned in this section.\n  This amendment also directs the Secretary to take action to help \nimprove the job performance of airport screening personnel, as well as \nto conduct a human factors study to better understand problems with \nperformance. The Secretary is further directed to expedite the \ninstallation and use of baggage-screening equipment and to ensure that \nthe TSA increases and improves its efforts to screen cargo.\n  The amendment also would direct the Secretary to initiate a pilot \nprogram for air carriers to deploy hardened cargo containers on \npassenger aircraft that also carry cargo. This requirement is modified \nfrom the one we introduced on September 7, which would have required a \nhardened container on every passenger aircraft. Upon further review, it \nis apparent there are certain technical and implementation issues that \nhave to be addressed before the use of these containers can be \nuniversal. Therefore, I have modified this proposal to require TSA to \ninitiate a pilot program to further explore the feasibility of this \ntechnology.\n  Madam President, this amendment is the next step in fulfilling the \nmandate of the 9/11 Commission recommendations and ensuring that we \nmove forward in addressing the vulnerabilities in our transportation \nsystems. These provisions should not be controversial, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n\n  I would also like to add there will be further amendments that will \ncome before the body, particularly on rail as well as port security. I \nremind my colleagues that some of those may be very expensive and have \na very high price tag associated with them. I hope, while supporting \nefforts to improve rail and port security, we would also be cognizant \nof the fact that we cannot do all things to all means of transportation \nat all times.\n  However, this is a great opportunity for all of us to improve all of \nour security, whether it be aviation, port, rail, bus, or other areas \nof vulnerability, and I urge my colleagues to bring forward those \namendments as quickly as possible so we can dispose of them and, \nperhaps this week, bring forth a product all of us can support.\n  Madam President, I again express my appreciation to Senators Collins \nand Lieberman for the incredible amount of work that they, their \nstaffs, and other members of the committee have performed, which has \nresulted in an incredibly laudable product, supported by every member \nof the committee. I hope we will proceed in that same spirit as was \nexhibited in the Governmental Affairs Committee on both sides of the \naisle so we can make sure we debate thoroughly and address the further \nchallenges that we face, including addressing in one way or another all \n41 recommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, for his \ncontributions to this entire enterprise. I am very grateful to have his \nsupport for the underlying bill drafted by Senator Lieberman and \nmyself. And I very much appreciate his offering of the first amendment \nto strengthen the bill still further, by adding one of the \nrecommendations made by the 9/11 Commission.\n  As the Senator indicated, the Governmental Affairs Committee largely \nconfined its review to the major recommendations of the Commission that \nhad to do with the reorganization of our intelligence community. That \ndoes not mean, however, that we slight in any way the many other \nrecommendations made by the Commission. The amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arizona would implement the transportation security \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission.\n  It is my understanding the Senator's amendment was drafted in \nconsultation with officials from the Department of Homeland Security. I \nbelieve it will help make our Nation more secure. Specifically, the 9/\n11 Commission recommended establishing a national strategy for \ntransportation security, assigning responsibility for the no-fly list \nto the Transportation Security Administration, and enhancing passenger \nand cargo screening.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator will require the Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security to develop and implement a national \nstrategy for transportation security and to revise and update that \nstrategy as necessary to improve or maintain its currency.\n  I particularly want to comment on the provisions of the McCain \namendment that task the TSA with the responsibility of developing the \nno-fly list and comparing the names of air passengers against the \nGovernment database containing the consolidated terrorist watch list.\n\n  I think recent incidents in the news show why it is a good idea for \nthe Transportation Security Administration to have that authority \nrather than vesting it in the airlines, as is now the case. I would \nindicate to my colleagues that the Department of Homeland Security \nagrees with Senator McCain that it is the more appropriate entity to \nperform this matching of names against the Government's database.\n  Two incidents which come to mind are, first, one of our colleagues, \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts, finding that he had difficulty \nboarding flights because of confusion with the names listed on the \nterrorist database. I have a similar case of a retired physician in \nCamden, ME, whose name, unfortunately, including his middle initial, is \nvery similar to a name that is on the terrorist watch list. As a \nresult, this retired physician, who is no more a terrorist than you or \nI, Madam President, has an extremely difficult time every single time \nhe flies. That shows me that we need to do a far better job of \nimproving the quality of that watch list to make sure it is \nconsolidated but also to make sure it is accurate and that people who \nhave similar names are not needlessly subjected to an in-depth search \nor even denied boarding privileges altogether.\n  The second incident involves the singer formerly known as Cat \nStevens, who was allowed to board an air flight from London to the \nUnited States recently because the airline was using a list that did \nnot include all of the names on the terrorist watch list. So clearly we \nhave a problem in that direction as well. There are too many watch \nlists. They need to be consolidated.\n\n  The quality of information on those lists needs to be improved to \nmake sure innocent Americans are not needlessly targeted, and it should \nbe a Government responsibility--that of the Transportation Security \nAdministration--to maintain and check these databases against the lists \nof airline passengers. It is really not fair to ask the airlines to \naccept that responsibility, particularly when they may not have access \nto the entire database that the Government has compiled.\n  The McCain amendment appropriately vests in the Transportation \nSecurity Administration the responsibility for the no-fly list and for \nchecking airline passengers against this list. I again emphasize that \nthe Department of Homeland Security agrees that TSA should assume that \nresponsibility and it should no longer be carried out by the airlines.\n  For these reasons, I urge adoption of the McCain amendment. I believe \nit strengthens the Collins-Lieberman bill by incorporating some \nworthwhile and commonsense recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission \nin the area of airline security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman, \nSenator Collins. I would like to have a rollcall vote on this, but that \nrollcall vote would be held at the discretion of the majority and the \nDemocratic leaders. I ask for the yeas and nays, and I ask unanimous \nconsent for the yeas and nays at a time agreed to by the majority and \nDemocratic leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank Senator McCain for proposing this amendment as \na part of the package that he and I introduced a while back as a full \nbill implementing all of the recommendations of the September 11 \nCommission. This is not in any sense a detraction from the bill Senator \nCollins and I have brought out. It is in addition to it and would make \nit stronger.\n  I wish to speak at length on the proposal, but I note the presence on \nthe floor of Senator Feinstein who I am proud to say is a cosponsor of \nthe proposal that Senator Collins and I have put before the Senate. She \nhas been a leader on intelligence matters, one of the first in this \nChamber to offer a proposal for reform and reorganization of the \nintelligence assets of the American Government. Her ideas greatly \ninformed the proposal that we put before the Senate today. I am \ngrateful, as is Senator Collins, for Senator Feinstein's support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished ranking \nmember.\n  Let me begin by thanking the chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maine, the ranking member, Senator \nLieberman, and the Governmental Affairs Committee for a very good bill. \nAs a member of the Intelligence Committee, one who has been for the \nconcept of a strong, independent director of national intelligence for \n3 years now, I was surprised to see the strong quality of the product \nthat came out, because this committee has actually entered into some of \nthe nitty-gritty and tried to come up with solutions that would stand \nthe test of time. I thank them for their work. It has been excellent \nwork, and it puts a product before the Senate that we can all be proud \nto discuss. It contains no poison pills. It is a straight bill. It \ndeals with the subject at hand in a very meaningful way.\n  As I mentioned, I have believed for sometime now that the way in \nwhich our intelligence community is structured is really fundamentally \nflawed. It is unsuited for the 21st century, when we are not talking \nabout intelligence agencies of large powers but we are talking about \nasymmetric terror.\n  In the context of intelligence, we have seen three comprehensive \ninvestigations into recent failures of the intelligence community. \nSenator Collins, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Rockefeller have \nmentioned many of them. Certainly, there was the joint inquiry of the \nHouse and Senate Intelligence Committees into the attacks of September \n11. There was the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \ninvestigation, resulting in a 300-page report that we recently \ncompleted, which investigated and reported on the intelligence, the \nfindings, and the recommendations--all related to weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq. Then, of course, there was the 9/11 Commission, \nwhich investigated the attacks on 9/11, a very comprehensive report and \nreview, which has, frankly, brought most of the decisionmakers, as well \nas the\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\ncountry, into alignment with the concept that we do need a strong \nnational director of intelligence.\n  In each of these cases there were explicit and implicit findings that \ntouched on how our intelligence community could fail so badly. Issues \nof funding, of education, of risk taking, and, frankly, of plain \nincompetence surfaced. Even today, there is still denial that many of \nthe findings of weapons of mass destruction were simply wrong, deeply \nflawed, or bad. This will need to be remedied.\n  In my view, these failings were symptoms of a failed structure; \nagain, of a structure that was built for the last century's conflicts \nand unsuited to this new war of asymmetric terror.\n  I believe the most important steps needed to address these structural \nfailings revolve around the office of the Director of Central \nIntelligence, known as the ``DCI.''\n  Up to this point, there has been a nominal head but a head of the \nIntelligence Community without the necessary authority. That post \ncarries two handicaps. Those are built into its structure and, I \nbelieve, lead that structure to fail.\n  First, the individual serving as DCI has two basic, incompatible \njobs: leader of the intelligence community, which includes 15 often \nfractious Agencies and Departments, and in that role is the principal \nintelligence adviser also to the President; and leader of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, which is, of course, only one of the 15 agencies \nwhich make up that big fractious community.\n  These two jobs are not compatible. They each take up far too much \ntime. They each require a laser-like focus on its own unique mission. \nWorse yet, they can be in direct conflict, because the needs of the \nintelligence community in terms of mission, resources, and strategy may \nnot be exactly what is wanted by the Central Intelligence Agency. The \nproblem is that the Intelligence Community and the Central Intelligence \nAgency both need and deserve full-time leaders. That, of course, is the \nheart of the argument for this bill.\n  Secondly, even under the current structure, the DCI lacks basic tools \nneeded to run any large institution in Washington. And what are they? \nBudget, personnel, and statutory authority.\n  Under current law, the DCI nominally is charged with administering \nthe money and people who make up the intelligence community and for \nformulating a budget presented to us in the Congress.\n  Today, in reality, the DCI has little control of much of that budget, \nwith more than 80 percent actually controlled by the Secretary of \nDefense. He is unable to move personnel, or shift strategic focus, in \nan effective way. One chilling example was revealed by the \ninvestigations into 9/11, where DCI Tenet issued an order declaring war \non al-Qaida in 1999, only to find in 2001 that few outside the CIA even \nheard about it, much less listened to it.\n  The solution to the second problem is to ensure that the position of \nintelligence community director is provided with real budget authority, \nreal personnel authority, and real authority to set strategy and \npolicy, and this bill does that. I am very thankful for that.\n  The bill before us today builds on these earlier efforts and I \nstrongly believe accomplishes the basic and necessary goals.\n  The bill creates a national intelligence director, separate from the \nCIA Director. The bill invests this director with meaningful budget \nauthority, effective personnel authority, and the ability to set \nstrategy for the entire intelligence community. And it ensures that the \nnational intelligence director can set priorities for intelligence \ncollection and analysis, and manage tasking across all 15 agencies to \nensure that it gets done and done right.\n  One of the Senate Intelligence Committee's findings in our report was \nthat the collection and analysis that went into the compilation of the \nnational intelligence estimate was deeply flawed, and that there were \ndifferences of opinion between agencies, whether it was aluminum tubes, \nwhere the Energy Department's intelligence and the CIA's differed, or \nwhether it was with the unmanned aerial vehicles, where the \nintelligence agencies of the Air Force and the CIA differed, or whether \nit had to do with biological mobile labs, where the Secretary of State \nwent out before the United Nations with deeply flawed intelligence. But \nthe analysis and collection of that intelligence had deep flaws, which \nmade it bad intelligence.\n  This bill provides the national intelligence director also with a \ngeneral counsel, inspector general, chief financial officer, human \nresources officer, and chief information officer, who together can \nensure that effective organization and guidance can flow through the \nentire community. That is a good thing.\n  I will support the bill because I believe it accomplishes the task at \nhand: making necessary changes to our intelligence community structure.\n  That said, I believe there is some room for improvement. I want to \ntake a few minutes to talk about that, and I want to offer to continue \nto work with my colleagues to improve this bill during this next week. \nLet me give you some of the things I am concerned about.\n  First, I am concerned that the bill leaves ambiguous the relationship \nbetween the new national intelligence director and the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation. Let me give you some specifics. The bill \nincorporates, with no change, current law, which defines the role of \nthe FBI's intelligence activities into this new bill. However, the \ncurrent law is confusing, it is internally inconsistent, and it is a \nsource of many of the problems that beset the FBI as a part of the \nintelligence community. I believe we must clarify this to do three \nthings: First, we have to make it absolutely clear that \ncounterintelligence investigations that involve the ``plans, intentions \nand capabilities'' of foreign nations and organizations, including \nterrorist groups, are part of the National Intelligence Program and \nthus under the overall supervision of the National \nIntelligence Director. This bill does not yet do that. For instance, \nthe investigation of suspicious individuals taking flight lessons prior \nto September 11, which resulted in the ill-fated Phoenix memo, should \nclearly be a part of the intelligence community's responsibilities.\n\n  Second, we should establish in law the FBI's Office of Intelligence. \nThe office of intelligence is created on page 7, with a mention under \nthe programs of the bill. But it is not further defined anywhere in the \nbill. I suggest that it be defined on page 127, line 20, of the bill, \nand that it be defined to make it crystal clear that within the FBI \nthis office is the source of authority and guidance for the \nintelligence activities of the FBI.\n  Third, we should recognize in law that old, rigid divisions between \nlaw enforcement and intelligence make no sense. This can be \naccomplished by clarifying the definition section of the bill to remove \nthe old ``carve out'' for ``counterintelligence and law enforcement'' \nactivities within the FBI.\n  For example, an FBI investigation into the activities of individuals \nsuspected of illegally providing funds to overseas terrorist groups is \nboth a law enforcement investigation and an intelligence effort.\n  So I hope to offer an amendment, and would like to work with both \nSenators, the chairman and the ranking member, to clarify these \ndefinitions and remove the poorly worded ``carve out'' for \n``counterintelligence'' investigations; to ensure that the Office of \nIntelligence is defined in law, with clear responsibility for foreign \nintelligence; and to ensure that the new ``National Intelligence \nDirector'' plays a guiding role in the FBI's efforts to improve its \nability to function as an intelligence agency.\n  Next, I am concerned that the bill leaves a similar ambiguity in the \nrelationship between the authorities of the National Intelligence \nDirector and the Secretary of Defense. This problem flows from the fact \nthat the bill refers to ``tactical'' military intelligence, but does \nnot define it. I believe we can remove a potential source of contention \nbetween the director of national intelligence and the Secretary of \nDefense by incorporating a set of definitions, so everyone knows \nexactly what is tactical intelligence and, thus, outside the scope of \nthe National Intelligence Director's review. So we have that language \nand I would like to pass it by the chairman and ranking member before I \noffer it, which would includes a clarifying definition.\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\n  Finally, I must say--and this I have gone back and forth on--I remain \ntroubled that under this bill the Director serves at the pleasure of \nthe President. When I introduced my first bill in 2002, the Director \nserved at the pleasure of the President. When I introduced the second \none in 2003, the director served at the pleasure of the President. Then \nI began to think about policy and intelligence and recognized that the \ntwo should remain separate, and I recognized that it is necessary to \ngive this new National Intelligence Director some separation from the \nPresident's policies, or the Congress's policies. The only way to do \nthis is with a term. I know that the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, offered in committee a 5-year term. I believe he was not \nsuccessful in pressing his case at that time. I have thought about a \n10-year term.\n  I remember the Casey days. I do not think we want to go back to those \ndays, but I also think we need to keep policy and intelligence \nseparated. So I hope Senator Lautenberg will offer his amendment, and I \nwill support it if he does.\n  Before I end, I want to say a few words about practical \nconsiderations related to the bill.\n  It is my understanding that the House of Representatives may pass out \na bill containing extremely controversial provisions unrelated to \nintelligence reform. I am concerned that this is a thinly veiled effort \nto introduce ``poison pills'' into desperately needed legislation. One \nHouse Member even referred to having Democrats ``over a barrel'' in a \ndescription of this strategy. This is no strategy at all. I think if \nthis were to happen, and I certainly hope it does not happen, Americans \nare going to see right through it.\n  The Senate, in this bill, has set the tone, and the tone is a well-\nconsidered, well-crafted bill which deals solely with the issue at \nhand. In my view, that is what should be passed by both parties and \nboth bodies.\n  I am hopeful that our leadership--the majority and the minority \nleaders--will be able to make every effort to resist this. I think to \nget into PATRIOT Act items--this is under the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee. We have held several hearings. We will hold more \noversight hearings. There are 156 sections of the PATRIOT Act; 16 of \nthem sunset in December of next year. We will do our due diligence, and \nI say that as someone who has supported the PATRIOT Act, supported \nthose 16 sections, and made some of the amendments.\n  It is extraordinarily important that we be able to work in a careful \nmethod of oversight responsibility. I think something coming from the \nHouse which pushes in this direction would not be welcome.\n  In conclusion, I, once again, compliment Senators Collins and \nLieberman and the Governmental Affairs Committee for a job well done. I \nthink we can pass this bill, and I hope we continue--I was going to say \nan ``aroma of bipartisanship.'' I am not sure ``aroma'' is the right \nway to say this, but in the bipartisanship model both the chairman and \nthe ranking member have set forward. If we do, I think we deliver for \nthe people of this Nation a very fine work product.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia for her longstanding expertise in this area. I know the \nSenator presented a bill to create a national intelligence director \nlong before it was popular to do so. She has been a leader in \nintelligence reform. She has made several very constructive and helpful \nsuggestions and recommendations to the committee. We very much \nappreciate her leadership, and we consider it a great coup to have her \nsupport for our legislation.\n  I thank her for her hard work and her leadership. We look forward to \ncontinuing to work with her.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I join with Senator Collins in \nthanking Senator Feinstein for her leadership over the long term on \nmatters of national intelligence, but also for a very thoughtful \nstatement today and to express, again, not just gratitude but our real \npleasure that she has made a judgment that the proposal we have made to \nCongress deserves her support as a cosponsor. That means a lot to \nSenator Collins and me, and I know it will to all the members of our \ncommittee.\n  I also thank her for the suggestion she made in her statement about \nsome areas of the bill she would like to work with us to strengthen. I \nknow we would be delighted to do that.\n  Finally, it may have been inadvertent, but I like the idea of the \nsweet smell of bipartisanship that may overwhelm this bill. Aroma is a \nbetter term.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I know the Senator from Oregon is in \nthe Chamber. If he has a moment or two, I would like to go forward with \na statement I intended to make in response to the amendment Senator \nMcCain laid down, which is the pending amendment.\n  I rise to support that amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3702\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, in the aftermath of September 11, we have obviously \ntaken some very aggressive steps to improve airline security. Those \nwere critical improvements and, in some sense, inevitable after \nairplanes were used to attack us on September 11. But there is a lot \nmore to do, and not just in aviation. We have to confront threats \nfacing all modes of transportation.\n  I continuously meet people who express to me worries about one or \nanother mode of transportation they use--trains, buses, et cetera--\nbecause they are now in some sense reassured by the presence of \nsecurity around air travel but miss it and are unsettled when they do \nnot find similar measures in other modes of transportation. So we have \nto confront the threats from terrorists facing all modes of \ntransportation. Otherwise, we are going to be fighting the last war \nwhile our enemies probe for other weaknesses that we have left \nundefended.\n  Before I go into a little more detail on this amendment, I want to \nsay this is the first of a series of amendments that Senator McCain, \nmyself and others will offer on the Governmental Affairs Committee's \nNational Intelligence Reform Act of 2004, the proposal Senator Collins \nand I put before the Senate. Obviously, the underlying bill contains \nseveral critical reforms and focuses on matters of intelligence, which \nour committee took to be the charge we were given by the bipartisan \nleadership of the Senate.\n  I am very proud of the way in which the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee addressed the issues that fell within that mandate that \nSenator Frist and Senator Daschle gave us. Obviously, there were other \nimportant recommendations of the 9/11 Commission that fell beyond the \ncommittee's purview. In fact, it made 41 recommendations to help detect \nand prevent terrorist attacks on the United States or on American \ncitizens, wherever they might be.\n\n  Some of these were quite broad. Obviously, what the Committee focused \non is the restructuring of the intelligence operations of the executive \nbranch. As I indicated in an earlier statement today, those \nrecommendations are the ones the Commission felt were most urgent \nbecause we are under the threat of attack, and we need to reorganize \nand focus our considerable intelligence resources. But there were other \nrecommendations the 9/11 Commission made. For example, they urged \ndiplomatic outreach and educational grants to the Muslim world because \na realistic offer of hope and freedom to the hundreds of millions of \npeople living in countries that are primarily Muslim can be a much \ngreater force, a much more appealing force, than the radical extremist \nterrorists called to Jihad.\n  Other recommendations were to tighten and coordinate the screening \nand identification systems we use to admit people into the United \nStates of America or when we give them access to transportation systems \nand other key facilities within our country.\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\n  Other recommendations deal with the distribution of homeland security \ngrants or increasing security for all forms of transportation.\n  All of those, and others, went beyond the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's mandate.\n  Two or three weeks before the 9/11 Commission made its report, \nSenator McCain and I met with Governor Kean and Congressman Hamilton, \nand we said to them--at that point we had no idea what the pace of the \ncongressional reaction to the Commission report would be. We said: We \nare going to make you a promise. After you issue your report, our \nstaffs and we will work hard to translate every recommendation of your \nreport into legislative language, and introduce it so there could be a \nvehicle around which we could concentrate our support.\n  We did not know at that time the Governmental Affairs Committee would \nbe asked to take on this role by Senator Frist and Senator Daschle and \nthat the congressional pace of reaction would quite appropriately be \nquick, leading us to set aside our normal August recess, have a number \nof hearings, and now have the bill before the Senate.\n  Still, there are parts of the Commission report that, as I say, are \nnot explicitly within the purview of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee's work and that is what the amendments of Senator McCain, \nothers and I are intending to address; to complete the full package of \nreforms recommended by the 9/11 Commission after its own 20 months of \nhard work. Put all of this legislation together and there will be a \npackage of reforms, both broad and deep, that will make America and \nAmericans, wherever they are, safer and lead us to the victory in the \nwar on terrorism that we all seek and know first must come with the use \nof force and any and all efforts we can make to capture and/or kill \nterrorists, but will take more than that as well.\n  The amendment Senator McCain introduced today, the first of these \namendments to go beyond intelligence reform in the Committee bill, \ndeals with transportation security. It comes from our conclusion and \nthe Commission's conclusion that we need to look at protecting our \ntransportation systems the way a general looks at protecting supply \nlines. A well-coordinated attack on our transportation systems, or the \nkey infrastructure that supports them, would be staggering to our \nhomeland security and, of course, to the personal security of many \nAmericans.\n  Imagine a major city being crippled because an attack had rendered \nmass transportation unusable, or imagine not even being able to \nresupply our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan because we cannot move the \ngoods from warehouse to port.\n  As we look worldwide, we know terrorists often target transportation \nsystems. We are not imagining these threats. As we know from the news, \nthey have not only used airplanes for their inhumane, cruel purposes, \nto express the extent to which they hate anyone who is not like them, \nthey have used buses, trains, and shipping vessels. With the exception \nof aviation, the fact is in the United States of America we are still \ndangerously behind in our efforts to secure our own vital \ntransportation networks.\n  As the 9/11 Commission notes, ``over 90 percent of the Nation's $5.3 \nbillion annual investment in the TSA goes to aviation.'' Important? Of \ncourse. Critically important after September 11, but its not enough to \nmeet all of the threats in transportation that face us.\n  This amendment requires the Transportation Safety Administration to \nat least evaluate the threats, vulnerabilities, and risks faced by all \nmodes of transportation, and then set priorities and deadlines--\nincluding budget and research and development priorities--for \naddressing those needs; investing in new technologies that can help us \ngain the security in all modes of transportation that we need. This \nkind of transportation security strategy has been talked about for many \nmonths but it just never seems to happen, and that is why this \namendment requires the TSA to complete this critical work under the \ndirection of the Secretary of Homeland Security by April 1, 2005.\n  The Transportation Research Board, the Government Accountability \nOffice, and other independent experts have all called for this exact \nvital step. It will set the stage for critical new initiatives that \nmust follow to better protect rail, transit, ports, and other key modes \nof American transportation.\n  There is still more to do in the area of aviation security. That is \nwhy this amendment calls on TSA to step up efforts to detect explosives \non individuals trying to board planes. Currently, as most of us who \ntravel know but probably do not think about, only checked bags are \nroutinely screened for explosives. This amendment would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to implement plans to screen all \npassengers for explosives.\n  The amendment would also direct the TSA to begin comparing passenger \nlists against the Government's new consolidated terrorist watch list. \nThis is not happening yet; not happening to the extent we want it and \nneed it to happen. It makes such common sense that it is frustrating to \nthe point of being infuriating that we are not yet doing it. That we \nare not using the capacity of information networks and computers to \ncheck passenger lists against terrorist watch lists so none of us is on \na plane with someone who intends to use that plane for an attack or to \nbring the plane itself down.\n\n  This is the first of several amendments Senator McCain and I will be \noffering. Again, I believe it is important we act on all of these as \nwell as, of course, the underlying Governmental Affairs Committee \nintelligence reform proposal.\n  We find ourselves at one of those rare moments in time, certainly in \ncongressional time, when both the moment to act and the momentum for \naction have come together in a truly bipartisan way in Congress, in the \nexecutive branch and, of course, most importantly of all, among the \nAmerican people to whom we owe the greatest responsibility.\n  With that kind of general agreement nationally, passing a complete \npackage of legislation responding to the strong compelling arguments in \nthe bipartisan 9/11 Commission report is within our grasp, and adopting \nthis amendment will be yet another step toward achieving that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3704\n\n(Purpose: To establish an Independent National Security Classification \n                     Board in the executive branch)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of myself, \nSenator Lott, Senator Bob Graham, and Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself, Mr. Lott, \n     Mr. Graham of Florida, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3704.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. WYDEN. Without turning this into a bouquet-tossing contest, I \nwill say how lucky I think we are to have Senator Collins and Senator \nLieberman, who have long practiced good government, handling this \nlegislation. This is going to be a long and arduous task and to have \nthis bipartisan duet at the helm is what is going to make this \npossible. I have enjoyed working with them on this and so many other \nissues in the past. We are going to get this done. The country is going \nto be safer and stronger for it, and I am very grateful for the work of \nthe Senator from Maine and the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Governor Kean, the chairman of the 9/11 Commission, said three-\nquarters of the classified material he reviewed for the Commission \nshould not have been classified in the first place. I think Governor \nKean's comments reflect the state of where we are with respect to how \nGovernment documents are classified today, and it is for that reason \nthat a bipartisan coalition has spent a considerable amount of time on \nthe Intelligence Committee. Senator Lott and Senator Snowe and I serve \nthere now.\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\n  Senator Bob Graham, of course, chaired the committee, and the four of \nus, two Democrats, two Republicans, have teamed up so as to try to make \nsure that in this important reform legislation some common sense is \nbrought to the way that information is classified for national security \npurposes.\n  The ability to make documents secret is one of the most powerful \ntools in our Government. It is a power wielded generously by those in \n18 agencies that deal with intelligence. My concern is that the Senate \ncould spend weeks debating flowcharts and organizational changes and \nmoving the boxes around with respect to where people in the \nintelligence community sit, but if the underlying way in which \ninformation is classified is not reformed, it is going to be very hard \nto make information sharing throughout the intelligence community \neffective. Very little will have been accomplished if information \ncontinues to be classified for purposes of protecting somebody's \npolitical career rather than our national security or if classification \ndecisions continue to deprive the American people of their ability to \njudge the effectiveness of their Government on national security \nmatters.\n\n  The 9/11 Commission report says the need to restructure the \nintelligence community grows out of six problems. One of them, the \nCommission says at page 410, is that, in their words, ``The \nintelligence community is too complex and secret.''\n  The Commission states:\n\n       Over the decades, the agencies and the rules surrounding \n     the intelligence community have accumulated to a depth that \n     practically defies public comprehension. . . . Even the most \n     basic information about how much money is actually allocated \n     to or within the intelligence community and most of its key \n     components is shrouded from public view.\n\n  The bipartisan amendment Senator Lott, Senator Bob Graham, Senator \nSnowe, and I offer today is premised on the belief that it is time to \nclear the fog of secrecy and that it is possible to do that so as to \nprotect this country's national security. Our legislation establishes a \nthree-person board with the President and the bipartisan leadership in \nthe House and Senate each recommending one member, subject to Senate \nconfirmation. Our board would have two tasks: first, to review and make \nrecommendations on the standards and processes used to classify \ninformation for national security purposes, and, second, to serve as a \nstanding body to act on congressional and certain executive branch \nrequests to reexamine how a Government document has been classified.\n  As entities, from the traditional intelligence community to the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, now have the power to classify \ndocuments, the board would look at national security classification \nacross our Government. Its creation would give the Congress, for the \nfirst time, an independent body to which it can appeal a national \nsecurity classification decision.\n  President Truman noted that the Nation's primary intelligence agency, \nthe CIA, was created, ``for the benefit and convenience of the \nPresident.'' But the United States cannot preserve an open and \ndemocratic society when one branch of Government has a totally free \nhand to shut down access to information. The lack of an independent \nappeals process for Congress, in terms of the view of the four of us, \ntwo Democrats and two Republicans, tips the scale too far toward \nsecrecy for any administration, and our bipartisan group of four \nSenators seeks to correct that imbalance.\n  The 1946 Atomic Energy Act established the principle that some \ninformation is born classified. There are certainly important sources \nand pieces of information that must never be compromised. But over the \nyears, millions and millions of documents that weren't born classified \nhave inherited or adopted or married into a classification. Keeping \ninformation secret for political purposes or horse trading intelligence \ndata, especially during this critical time, a time of heightened \nsecurity, is unacceptable.\n\n  Our Government must begin to be more accountable to its citizens. \nHaving all appropriate information about national security is essential \nto Congress's congressionally prescribed oversight role. Access to \ninformation about their own security is the people's right. It is time \nto stop hiding the facts they deserve to know. Our bipartisan proposal \ndoes just that in a fashion that protects America's national security.\n  According to the late Senator Moynihan, who was an expert on secrecy \nin Government:\n\n       . . . much of the structure of secrecy now in place in the \n     U.S. Government took shape in just 11 weeks, in the spring of \n     1917, while the Espionage Act was debated and signed into \n     law.\n\n  Eighty years later, Senator Moynihan would note that 6,610,154 \nsecrets were created in just 1 year alone. In fact, only a small \nportion, or 1.4 percent, was created pursuant to statutory authority, \nthe Atomic Energy Act. Senator Moynihan labeled the other 98.6 percent \n``pure creatures of bureaucracy,'' created via Executive orders.\n  The Secrecy Report Card issued in August by a coalition of groups \nincluding the American Society of Newspaper Editors found the American \nGovernment spent $6.5 billion last year creating 14 million new \nclassified documents. This is a 60-percent increase in secrets since \n2001. These numbers do not even include CIA documents. The Secrecy \nReport Card also points out that agencies are becoming more creative in \ntheir classification systems.\n  In addition to the traditional ``Limited Official Use,'' ``Secret'' \nand ``Top Secret,'' some agencies now have something called ``Sensitive \nSecurity Information,'' ``Sensitive Homeland Security Information,'' \n``Sensitive But Unclassified,'' or ``For Official Use Only.'' It has \ngotten to the point where Mr. William Leonard of the National Archives \nInformation Security Office--the gentleman who oversees classification \nand declassification policies; he is known to some as the secrecy \nczar--believes that the system defies logic in many respects. He has \ncalled today's classification system ``a patchwork quilt'' that is a \nresult of ``a hodgepodge of laws, regulations and directives.'' In \nreality, the Federal Government has so many varieties of classification \nthat it can make Heinz look modest.\n  In Mr. Leonard's view, the classification system for national system \nhas lost touch with the basics to the point that some agencies don't \nknow how much information they classify or whether they are classifying \nmore or less than they once did or whether they are classifying too \nmuch or too little.\n  The executive branch exerts almost total control over what should or \nshould not be classified. The Congress has no ability to declassify \nmaterial. So there is no self-correcting mechanism in the system. Even \nif Members of Congress wish to share information with constituents, it \nis so complicated for the Congress to release information to the public \nthat no one has ever tried to use this convoluted process. The \nexecutive branch has a little-known group that can review \nclassification issues, but it is seldom used and open only to executive \nbranch employees and not to Members of Congress.\n  What all this means in practice is that with the thump of a stamp \nmarked ``Secret'' some unelected person in the belly of a Federal \nbuilding has prevented Americans from gaining access to information. \nThat decision cannot be appealed, even by the Congress. There is no \nindependent review of classification decisions by the executive branch. \nWith no chance of unbiased review, classification decisions are ready \nand ripe for abuse. Agencies wishing to hide their flaws and \npoliticians--and I emphasize this, Mr. President--of both political \nparties who wish to make political points can abuse the classification \nguidelines to their advantage. And four Senators, two Democrats and two \nRepublicans, wish to change that.\n  I, for one, do not subscribe to the view that there is an inherent \nconflict between the executive branch's accountability to Congress and \nthe American people on the one hand and the constitutional role of the \nPresident as Commander in Chief on the other. I believe that a balance \ncan and must be struck between the public's need for sound, clear-eyed \nanalysis and executive desire to protect the Nation's legitimate \nsecurity interests.\n  I believe we can fight terrorism ferociously without limiting the \nrights of our citizens to information. That is what the sponsors of \nthis legislation seek to do.\n  There should be no room in this equation I have described for the use \nof\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\nclassification to insulate officials and agencies from political \npressure. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have had \nlengthy discussions with my colleagues on a bipartisan basis about how \nto strike such a balance. It is the view of Senator Lott, Senator \nGraham, Senator Snowe, and I that in proposing this amendment we have \nan opportunity to make the broad overhaul of the national security \nclassification system and to do it in a way that will strengthen the \noverall reform effort that the Senate is working on.\n  Finally, the independent board would review and make recommendations \non overhauling the standards and process used in the classification \nsystem for national security information. The board then submits \nproposed new standards and processes to both Congress and the executive \nbranch for comment and review. It would then implement the new \nstandards and processes once there has been full opportunity by the \nexecutive branch to comment. The board would then begin on an ongoing \nbasis to implement a system, continue to review and make \nrecommendations on current and new national security classifications \nsubject to executive branch veto that must be accompanied by a public, \nwritten explanation.\n  The balance in this legislation ensures that the public and the \nCongress have access to an independent board for national security \nmatters while ensuring that the Commander in Chief maintain the \nconstitutional prerogative that the Commander in Chief must have with \nrespect to military and foreign policy matters.\n  For far too long, the executive branch has adhered to the motto, \n``When in doubt classify.'' Withholding information to protect \npolitical careers and entrenched bureaucracies is a disservice to the \nAmerican people. It is a perversion of a policy intended to save lives, \na perversion that weakens our democracy, and one that could even \nendanger our people. It is time to throw open the curtains and let the \nsun shine on American democracy and on the governmental processes we \nutilize today.\n  That is what this amendment does.\n  I see both the chairman and ranking member in the Chamber. Both of \nthem have had an opportunity to see this amendment. I know both of them \nhave a lot on their plates as we try to deal with this important \nlegislation.\n  I think I can speak for Senator Lott, Senator Bob Graham, and Senator \nSnowe in saying we are anxious to work with the two of them. I know \nstaff has some ideas, some of which strike me as very good, for ways in \nwhich we can improve this legislation. I wrap up only by way of saying \nthat I think, with the excellent work they have already done as relates \nto the organizational structure and the flowcharts and all of the \nthings that we are going to be debating over the next, I hope, few \nweeks rather than months--but I only say that to maximize the changes \nwhich will be made organizationally--we need to find a new way to \nstrike a balance between protecting the country's national security and \nthe people's right to know. I think that balance is out of whack today.\n  If you look, for example, even at the exceptional work done by \nSenator Roberts and Senator Rockefeller with our committee's report on \nthe Iraq situation with respect to intelligence, had Senator Roberts \nand Senator Rockefeller not dug in as aggressively as they have, my \nsense is that well over 50 percent of that report would have been \nclassified. In fact, the most important sections would literally \nreceive black ink. We have to do better. I think we can do it on a \nbipartisan basis. I think doing it will ensure that the important work \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman are steering the Senate to will \nbe better. I am anxious to work with both of them and staff. They have \nboth been very gracious as always. I know my cosponsors join me in \nsaying that as we look at various ways to refine this, we are anxious \nto continue to work in a bipartisan way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I appreciate the commitment of the \nSenator from Oregon to work with us on this issue. I certainly \nunderstand his frustration at a tendency to overclassify information \nthat it is not warranted to be classified, that is not necessary to \nprotect intelligence sources and methods.\n  I note a couple of points. One is that the Collins-Lieberman bill \nvests in the national intelligence director the authority to establish \nrequirements and procedures for the classification of intelligence \ninformation.\n  Another portion of our bill requires the national intelligence \ndirector to establish intelligence-reporting guidelines that maximize \nthe dissemination of information, while protecting intelligence sources \nand methods.\n  In addition, the administration has expressed grave reservations \nabout the amendment as it is now drafted.\n  What I would like to suggest and what the Senator from Oregon has \ngraciously offered to do is have our staff on both sides of the aisle \nsit down with the Senator, see if we can address some of the \nadministration's concerns, see if we can look at language that is \nalready in the bill, and understand how that interacts with the \nSenator's proposal.\n  I thank him for his commitment to this area. He has identified a very \nreal problem. I hope, perhaps, we can come up with an approach that \nwill address his concerns.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I also thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Oregon for a very thoughtful statement and a very thought-\nprovoking amendment that he has offered. I know it comes out of his \nservice and the service of the other bipartisan cosponsors on the \nIntelligence Committee and some experiences they have had, shall we \nsay, which have not been satisfying, in which they have believed they \nand the public have been deprived of information in a timely way that \ndid not allow them to make informed judgments.\n  I want to say a few things after thanking Senator Wyden. One is there \nare members of our committee who both shared the experience of \nmembership on the Intelligence Committee and brought it to bear on the \ndeliberations of our committee in presenting the Collins-Lieberman \nproposal which is now before the Senate. That all goes to the priority \non sharing of information and the independence and objectivity of \nintelligence, and on the responsibility of the intelligence community \nto Congress to provide timely and objective information. And the \nproposal that the committee brought out is full of provisions aimed at \ndoing just that.\n  Senator Collins has just indicated the central provision for which \nthe national intelligence director is responsible is reviewing and \nestablishing standards for classification of intelligence.\n  Remember, in the original 9/11 Commission proposal, the national \nintelligence director was in the Executive Office of the President. We \ndecided--and the Commission ultimately agreed with us--that was a bad \nidea; that we wanted to establish a standard of independence, openness, \nand objectivity. We took the position out. The national intelligence \ndirector will now be an independent agent setting these standards for \nclassification.\n  We have broadly adopted a transformational approach to information in \nwhich we quite explicitly say we want to go from the Cold-War-era \nnotion that there was a need only to have information if you really \nneeded to know, and that the priority here is on a need to share unless \nthere is a reason not to share. That goes in some cases not to the \npublic but to the other intelligence agencies of our Government and to \nState and local law enforcement intelligence agencies.\n  Senator Levin, a member of our committee, greatly strengthened \nbuilding on our requirement in the underlying bill that the national \nintelligence director must provide national intelligence to Congress \nand the President that is ``timely, objective, independent of political \nconsideration and based on all sources available to the intelligence \ncommunity.'' Senator Levin extended that to cover the director of the \nnational terrorism center, the other national intelligence centers, the \nCIA Director, the National Intelligence Council, and restated the \nmandate to require national intelligence be timely, objective, \nindependent of political considerations, and not shaped to serve policy \nconsiderations.\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\n  We are asking that the national intelligence director have \nresponsibilities to ensure that the appropriate officials of the U.S. \nGovernment, including, of course, Members of Congress, have access to a \nvariety of intelligence assessments and analytical views; likewise, \nthat the national intelligence centers have similar access.\n  In response to the specific recommendation of your colleague, the \nranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, Senator Rockefeller, we \ncreated the office of ombudsman within the national intelligence \nauthority to serve as an independent counselor, an independent reviewer \nof analytical product, to address any problems of bias or lack of \nobjectivity or politicization in the intelligence community. The same \nis true of national intelligence estimates, that they be provided in a \nway that distinguishes between analytical judgments underlying \nintelligence.\n  We have a very strong provision about congressional oversight. The \ncommittee included provisions to strengthen the ability of \ncongressional oversight to ensure independent and timely intelligence \nanalysis; that the director of the counterterrorism center, for \ninstance, may testify and submit comments to Congress without clearance \nfrom anyone else in the executive branch. The heads of the \ncounterterrorism centers must provide intelligence assessments and \ncertain other information to appropriate Members of Congress. Employees \nare explicitly authorized to report directly to Congress any evidence \nshowing false statements to Congress and to an intelligence estimate.\n  There is a real congruence of purpose here in opening up, to the \nextent allowed by our national security needs, the intelligence that is \nin the possession of our Government.\n  I understand this amendment pushes this a step or two forward in \nfocusing beyond what our proposal does in authorizing the national \nintelligence director to deal with classification standards to create \nthis board. This is the first time I have seen the amendment. I \nappreciate the work that has been done on it and the purpose behind it, \nand with Senator Collins, I offer to sit and reason together with our \nrespective colleagues, leaders in this field, who are the proponents of \nthe amendment, and see if we can come to some agreement that is \nprogressive but does not take the bill in a direction that might make \nit hard to adopt everything else we want to adopt.\n  That is the practical last word I want to offer.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I could take perhaps an additional 2 \nminutes to make a quick comment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. And then one of our cosponsors, the former chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, wants to speak on behalf of the bill, as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Cornyn of Texas be \nadded as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, very briefly, first I express my thanks to \nSenator Collins and Senator Lieberman for their help. They always go \nout of their way to help me and I am very appreciative of it.\n  My only substantive point, because we are going to work very closely, \ntouches on the matter that our distinguished Chair made with respect to \nthe executive branch having concerns about this issue. Every executive \nbranch, whether it be controlled by Democrats or Republicans, will be \nconcerned about this issue. What troubles the four of us is, whether a \nDemocrat is President or a Republican is President, is that there are \nemployees who can take a big old stamp, mark something ``secret,'' and \nthen there is no independent review at all. That has been abused, in \nour view, on a bipartisan basis. It has been abused by administrations \nwhen they were run by Democrats. It has been abused when there have \nbeen administrations run by Republicans.\n  What the four Senators seek to do--now five, with the gracious help \nof the distinguished Senator from Texas--we seek to strike a balance \nbetween the President and the Congress.\n  What I say to the distinguished chairman of the committee, who makes \na good point as to the executive branch, as the four of us talked about \nthis issue--Senator Lott, Senator Snowe, Senator Graham, and myself--we \nfelt we would give the President, the executive branch, the first word \nand the last word on an issue with respect to classification. It is \npossible under our bipartisan proposal for a President to have the last \nword with respect to whether a document is classified. What we do, \nconsistent with that principle, is allow for a broad swath of \ncongressional involvement in between the President having the first \nword and the last word.\n  I only say to the distinguished chair of the committee, I will work \nvery closely with you and Senator Lieberman. My guess is we can never \nmake the executive branch completely happy on this issue, whether it is \ncontrolled by a Democrat or controlled by a Republican. It is in the \npublic interest now to strike a better balance with respect to how \nGovernment documents are classified with respect to the Congress and \nthe President. We do that by giving the President the first word and \nthe last word. But without any opportunity for congressional appeal, \nwhat we will have is what Senator Moynihan started talking about years \nago, which is that in every executive branch, whether controlled by \nDemocrats or Republicans, people in these agencies in the belly of some \nbuilding somewhere will keep stamping stuff secret because there is no \nindependent review. It is just in the political interests of those \npeople to do it.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues. They have been very \nkind.\n  I see the former chairman of the Intelligence Committee. My \ninvolvement in this issue really stems from the superb work Senator \nGraham has done. I hope everyone buys his book in hardback. It is a \nwonderful piece of scholarship with respect to intelligence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I thank my good friend Senator \nWyden for his thoughtful work on this amendment, for his always \ngenerous personal relationship, and for his commercial reference to the \nbook ``Intelligence Matters.'' I will be using some of the material \nfrom that book in my comments this afternoon as I rise to speak in \nfavor of the amendment which addresses our Government's dangerous \ntendency toward excessive secrets.\n  From the very beginning of our Nation, the American people have been \nconcerned with the Government's attempts, almost an irresistible \nattempt by any government, to hide or to fail to disclose issues that \nproperly should be available to the public.\n  President John F. Kennedy said in his first year as President:\n\n       The very word ``secrecy'' is repugnant in a free and open \n     society; and we are as a people inherently and historically \n     opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret \n     proceedings . . .\n       We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and \n     unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the \n     dangers which are cited to justify it.\n\n  In a free, open, democratic society, we must always begin with the \nbelief that the people should have access to all of the information \nwhich the Government holds on their behalf. The only exceptions to this \nrule should be those made for necessary personal or corporate privacy \nreasons, such as tax returns, and for legitimate reasons of national \nsecurity.\n  Now, of course, there are occasions when the national security of the \nUnited States is best served by the withholding of certain information, \nsuch as when we conceal the sources and methods of gathering extremely \nsensitive information to protect the sources themselves. However, our \ncurrent system of classifying information is being abused to an extent \nthat borders on the absurd. But there is nothing comical about this \ndevelopment.\n  In my judgment, the two key issues we are going to have to face if we \nare going to overcome the many fundamental problems which are facing \nour intelligence community are, first, the inadequacy of our human \nintelligence to be able to confront the threats that we now face, and, \nsecond, this issue of secrecy.\n  Now, I know that much of our analysis and focus will be on the \nspecific problems identified by various groups which have looked into \nthe events leading up to 9/11, including the Joint\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\nHouse/Senate Inquiry. However, there are some other issues which are \nembraced in 9/11 but which go well beyond 9/11. One of those which has \nbeen a recurring failure of America's intelligence is the failure to \nsee the big issue. Why was it that our intelligence did not see the \nfact that although it had stated there were precisely 550 sites where \nweapons of mass destruction were being either produced or stored in \nIraq, once we got to Iraq, the number was actually zero? Can you \nimagine that we have an address book of 550 sites that were supposed to \nbe the dangerous locations, and as soon as we occupied the country we \nstarted knocking on 550 doors and did not find any of it? Think of the \ndamage that failure has meant to the United States as a fundamental \nrationale for going to war in the first place and to our international \nreputation.\n  A second example of the failure to see the big issue is the one \nSenator Moynihan used as a centerpiece of his book ``Secrecy,'' and \nthat was the fact that our intelligence community failed to predict the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. As Senator Moynihan pointed out, \nindicators that the Soviet Union was on the brink of economic collapse \nwere available years in advance of the end of the Cold War. Yet our \nintelligence community, and specifically the CIA, greatly misperceived \nthe strength of the Soviet economy and, therefore, did not realize that \ncollapse was imminent.\n  Unfortunately, the CIA and other intelligence agencies insisted on \nclassifying nonsensitive information about the state of the Soviet \neconomy. If this information had been disclosed to the public and to \nexperts outside the Government, we could have seen the CIA was working \nwith flawed data. That flawed data would have been subject to \nchallenge. And perhaps before the collapse of the Berlin Wall we would \nhave concluded that the Soviet Union was not internally stable in order \nto maintain its position in the military, space, and scientific \ncompetition with the United States. Had we done so, this undoubtedly \nwould have allowed us to develop smarter, more effective strategies \nregarding the Soviets and their allies.\n\n  To give one example of that, during the period when it was widely \nknown by many that the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, but \nwhere we were being told by our intelligence agencies, with information \nnot available to the general public, that in fact the Soviet Union \nremained a competitive force, we were providing the resistance fighters \nin Afghanistan with some of the most sophisticated military materials, \nparticularly items such as the Stinger missile, to use in the war \nagainst the Soviet Union.\n  If we had known how close the Soviet Union was to collapse and had \nthought about the consequences of having hundreds if not thousands of \npieces of some of the most lethal military equipment in the world in \nthe hands of those who were resisting the Soviets in Afghanistan, we \nmight have rethought whether that was a wise policy or whether we were \npursuing a short-term victory at the expense of arming a part of the \nworld which was going to be our long-term adversary.\n  Those are the consequences of failure to see the big picture. I \nbelieve one of the principal reasons we repeatedly failed to see the \nbig picture is exactly the secrecy which we have imposed upon material, \ntherefore denying the opportunity for a wide range of Americans to see \nthe information, challenge the information, and, if it is unable to \nsustain that challenge, force the information to be corrected.\n  One of the more recent failures that was disclosed by both the House/\nSenate Intelligence Committees Joint Inquiry and the recent 9/11 \nCommission related to some of the evidence that there was a connection \nbetween the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and at least some if not all of the \nterrorists inside the United States. This, in my opinion, was one of \nthe most significant findings of the inquiry. Its significance is that \nif a foreign government is providing support to terrorists embedded \ninside the United States, it contributes substantially to the ability \nof those embedded operatives to maintain their anonymity while they are \nplanning, practicing, and executing very complex terrorist plots.\n  That is what happened prior to 9/11. It was our conclusion that in \nfact these terrorists were not here alone, that they were receiving \nthat type of support. We raised the question, if it was happening \nbefore 9/11, what is our level of confidence that it is not happening \nafter 9/11?\n  Details of our findings that led us to this chilling possibility were \nincluded in the Joint Inquiry's final report.\n  Let me read from a section of that final report which was made \navailable to the public. But I note the brackets around these \nparagraphs. Those brackets indicate that while this information was \nmade available to the public, it was only done so after it was \nsanitized, rewritten by the agencies which had scrutinized this report, \nparticularly the CIA and the FBI. But here is what they would allow to \nbe made available to the American people:\n\n       [Through its investigation, the Joint Inquiry developed \n     information suggesting specific sources of foreign support \n     for some of the September 11 hijackers while they were in the \n     United States. The Joint Inquiry's review confirmed that the \n     intelligence community also has information, much of which \n     has not yet been independently verified, concerning these \n     potential sources of support. In their testimony, neither CIA \n     nor FBI officials were able to address definitively the \n     extent of such support for the hijackers globally or \n     within the United States or the extent to which such \n     support, if it exists, is knowing or inadvertent in \n     nature. Only recently, and at least in part due to the \n     Joint Inquiry's focus on this issue, did the FBI and CIA \n     strengthen their efforts to address these issues. In the \n     view of the Joint Inquiry, this gap in U.S. intelligence \n     coverage is unacceptable, given the magnitude and \n     immediacy of the potential risk to U.S. national security. \n     The intelligence community needs to address this area of \n     concern as aggressively and as quickly as possible.]\n\n  What happened was that even with that sanitized version of the \nintroduction to that section, then the intelligence community proceeded \nto censor the rest of the section, page after page. Twenty-seven pages \nwere completely blank so that the American people were never given the \nopportunity to know what we knew about the role of foreign \ngovernments--specifically, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia--in support of \nthe terrorists. Does it make America safer that this type of \ninformation is withheld? What an absurdity.\n  Of course, this puts Americans at greater risk. Why was this done? \nWhy was this withheld from the American people? I believe it was \nwithheld not for national security reasons. And I might say I am joined \nin that assessment by my colleague, Senator Dick Shelby, who reviewed \nthis information, as I had, and concluded that 95 percent of the \ninformation which had been censored was not of a national security \nnature.\n  Obviously, it was embarrassing, embarrassing to the CIA, to the FBI \nthat such an infrastructure of support could have been allowed to exist \nand grow in the United States and then be used by people who killed \n3,000 Americans.\n  I believe this information is just one example of the tendency toward \nexcessive secrecy, including the most recent example of that, which is \nthe refusal to declassify any portion of the recently released national \nintelligence estimate regarding the scenario of future events in Iraq.\n  This report, which represents the consensus view of all our \nintelligence agencies, outlines several possible scenarios for the \nfuture of Iraq and combines the best information and analysis available \nwithin the executive branch. While a few of the sources of information \nprobably should continue to be concealed, the national intelligence \nestimate itself should not be. As the Congress and the American public \ndebate the best way to proceed in Iraq, we should have access to the \nbest thinking available on that subject.\n  The administration thus far has characterized the national \nintelligence estimate on Iraq as being guesses. The administration \nshould act immediately to declassify the national intelligence estimate \nso that the American people can determine whether it is a mature and \nprofessional assessment of the range of choices we have in Iraq.\n  Our Joint Inquiry recommended that the President and the intelligence \nagency review the Executive orders, the policies and procedures that \ngovern classification, the withholding from the American people of \ninformation. The purpose of this review would be to ``expand access to \nrelevant information for federal agencies outside the intelligence \ncommunity, for state and local\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\nauthorities, which are critical to the fight against terrorism, and \nfor the American public.''\n\n  If I could comment a moment on that access to State and local \nofficials, there were at least five incidents within a matter of weeks \nof 9/11 in which one or more of the terrorists was under the control of \na State and local law enforcement officer, generally because they had \ncommitted a traffic offense. Yet the State and local law enforcement \nofficers did not have access, because of excessive secrecy, to the \ninformation that these very people who were under their direct command \nwere also listed on a terrorist watch list as being people who, had \nthey been outside the United States, would not have been allowed to \nenter. But now they are in the United States, and the people who are \nthe most likely to encounter them, State and local law enforcement, are \ndenied the information upon which they can protect the safety and \nsecurity of the American people. It is an outrage.\n  Two-thirds of these terrorists spent most of their time in the United \nStates in my State of Florida. I am not proud of that, but it happens \nto be a statement of fact. I have talked with local and State law \nenforcement leadership in my State and I asked: If the same thing that \noccurred in the summer of 2001 were to occur in the fall of 2004, what \nwould the result have been? Do you know what the answer is? Exactly the \nsame, that our State and local law enforcement would continue to be \ndenied access to the information that would allow them to be of optimal \neffectiveness in providing us, the American people, optimal security.\n  Returning to the recommendations of the 9/11 Joint Inquiry, the Joint \nInquiry called on the Director of Central Intelligence, the Attorney \nGeneral, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Homeland Security, \nand the Secretary of State to review and report to the House and Senate \nproposals to protect against the use of the classification process as a \nshield to protect agency self-interest.\n  What has happened in the now almost 2 years since this report was \nfiled? The answer is, nothing has happened. There has been no effort by \nany of those agencies to present to the Congress their ideas of how we \ncan protect ourselves against agency self-interest.\n  The recommendation also called upon Congress to undertake a similar \nreview of classification procedures and consider in particular ``the \ndegree to which excessive classification has been used in the past and \nthe extent to which the emerging threat environment has greatly \nincreased the need for real-time sharing of sensitive information.''\n  Again, sad to say, almost 2 years since the report was filed, no \nexecutive agencies have taken any action to review and report on their \nclassification procedures. This means that we in the Congress, as the \nrepresentatives of the people who are being denied this information, \nmust now step forward and force action.\n  The amendment offered this afternoon by my colleague from Oregon \nwould create an independent national security classification board \nwithin the executive branch to review current classification policies \nand procedures. The board would then propose more coherent, rational \nstandards to Congress and the President and help to ensure that new \nstandards are implemented.\n  Once the new standards are in place, the board will have access to \nall documents classified for national security reasons and will have \nthe authority to review decisions made by employees of the executive \nbranch. The board will be able to recommend that the President reverse \nor alter classifications with which it disagrees. The President will \nhave the authority to ignore the board's recommendation, but the \nPresident will be required to notify Congress and the American public \nthat he or she has done so.\n  Early in our country's history, Patrick Henry argued:\n\n       The liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be, \n     secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed \n     from them.\n\n  Much more recently, Senator Moynihan concluded his book on the evils \nof government secrecy with these words:\n\n       A case can be made . . . that secrecy is for losers, for \n     people who don't know how important information really is. \n     The Soviet Union realized this too late. Openness is now a \n     singular, and singularly American, advantage. We put it in \n     peril by poking along in the mode of an age now past.\n\n  We would do well to heed both the words of Patrick Henry and Senator \nPatrick Moynihan. We would do well, by such heeding of these words, to \navoid the peril of excessive secrecy and its consequences, including \nthe consequence of designating the United States of America as losers. \nWe now have the opportunity to avoid that fate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nFlorida, for a very informed statement.\n  To restate what we said to Senator Wyden, I appreciate the experience \nthat led our colleagues from both parties to offer this amendment. I \nknow I speak for Senator Collins in saying, first, we want to look at \nthe amendment in more detail; second, we want to work to see if we can \ncome up with some way to accommodate your concerns that is agreeable to \nall involved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set aside to allow us \ntime to do the work we are about to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the senior \nSenator from Maine, Senator Snowe, is on her way to the floor to speak \nto the amendment temporarily laid aside.\n  Before the Senator from Florida leaves the floor, I want to thank him \nfor all the work he has done in this area. The Senator recently spent \nabout an hour with me, sharing some of his experiences as chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee. He has a great deal of knowledge and \nexpertise, and I very much appreciated his taking the time to give me \nthe benefit of his thoughts on intelligence reform. I am also the proud \nowner of his book, which is on my bedside table right now and is very \nappropriate reading as we do this debate. I thank him for his \ncontributions. Like Senator Lieberman, I look forward to working with \nhim, Senator Wyden, Senator Snowe, Senator Lott, on the amendment they \nhave proposed.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to tell Senator Graham that \nSenator Collins indicated to me she does have your book on her bedside \ntable and she finds it compelling. She does not use it to induce sleep. \nI want to reassure him of that. I find it compelling as well. I join \nher in thanking the Senator.\n  You two were way out front in recommending quite a while ago some of \nthe reforms that are contained in our committee's proposal. I hope the \nSenator knows his work cleared a path and informed the work that the \ncommittee did. I thank him for that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3705\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Carper, and Senator Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] for herself, Mr. \n     Carper, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3705.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I will not debate this amendment tonight. \nI wanted to alert our colleagues that this amendment represents the \nwork of the Governmental Affairs Committee to reform and improve and \nstrengthen the formula for the allocation of Homeland Security grant \nmoneys. Our committee has held several hearings over the last 2 years \non this issue. This legislation reflects the result of those hearings. \nIt also parallels the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission,\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\nthat the formula needs to be revised so that it is more of a threat-\nbased formula.\n  We worked very hard to come up with a compromise on the committee. We \nmaintained the minimum that each State would get to ensure that every \nState can respond to its preparedness needs. But we also rewrote the \nformula in recognition of the fact that some areas of our country, some \nStates, are indeed high-threat areas.\n  This legislation represents a careful balance that reflects the \nmembership of our committee, which includes both large-State Senators, \nsuch as Senator Levin of Michigan, and small-State Senators, such as \nSenator Carper of Delaware. Senator Levin, in particular, I recognize \nfor his very hard work on revising the formula. As I said--and I see \nmembers of the leadership on the floor--we will not debate this at \nlength tonight. I did want to send the amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to join with Senator \nCollins and Senator Carper in introducing this amendment, and Senator \nCarper played a very active role on the committee, along with Senators \nCollins, Levin, and other members in devising this very balanced \napproach to this controversial question of the Homeland Security grant \nformula. It does reflect the reality of the current terrorist threat, \nthat there are some places that are a higher probability because they \ncontain more potential targets, or because they are just big, prominent \ncities. But the fact is, when you are dealing with an enemy--and we \nhave seen this around the world--that will strike at the most \nvulnerable, undefended targets, not caring about consequences to human \nlife, whoever it is--children in schools, buses, trains, families, et \ncetera--in some sense, every American is endangered and every community \nis endangered. Therefore, every State deserves some proportion of these \nHomeland Security grants.\n  That balance has been struck very well, I think, in this amendment, \nwhich is the bill our committee reported out earlier. So I look forward \nto debating this and hopefully passing it with strong support in the \ncoming days.\n  I want to say two more things before I yield the floor. First, we now \nhave, I believe, three amendments that have been filed this afternoon. \nThis is good news. There will be a lot of amendments on this bill, and \nI am sure we will be on the bill for a considerable number of days. One \nof our colleagues said we might be on this for weeks or months. I \nprefer to speak in terms of days or hours, as Senator Reid prefers. But \nit is good we have these three amendments offered and hopefully we will \ngo to a vote on one or maybe two of them tomorrow and begin to move \nforward on this proposal. That is good news.\n\n  Secondly, I am delighted to ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nDurbin of Illinois as a cosponsor to the underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Senator Durbin is a member of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. He made some very significant \ncontributions to this bill, which we will discuss in more detail during \nthe debate on information technology systems of our Government when it \ncomes to dealing with national security intelligence and the board that \nthe bill creates to guarantee while we are improving the security of \nour people in an age of terrorism that their liberty continues to be \nprotected as well.\n  I am grateful Senator Durbin has joined us as a cosponsor. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are not in a quorum call, are we?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n\n\n                 Orders for Tuesday, September 28, 2004\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:45 a.m., \nTuesday, September 28. I further ask that following the prayer and \npledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings \nbe approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the \nSenate then begin a period for morning business for up to 60 minutes, \nwith the first 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader or \nhis designee and the final 30 minutes under the control of the \nDemocratic leader or his designee; provided that following morning \nbusiness, the Senate resume consideration of S. 2845, the intelligence \nreform bill. I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess \nfrom 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party luncheons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                Program\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \ntomorrow, following morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the intelligence reform bill. I would like to say to \nChairman Collins and Ranking Member Lieberman, I think they had a good \ndebate today and have gotten a good start, and we will continue the \namending process tomorrow. The chairman and ranking member will be here \nto work through any amendments, and we hope to have them begin to be \noffered tomorrow. We encourage all Senators to contact the bill \nmanagers as early as possible and see if we can move forward on this \nvery important legislation which the majority leader and the Democratic \nleader wish us to finish before we go home for the elections.\n\n\n                         Order for Adjournment\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come \nbefore the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in \nadjournment under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator \nSnowe or any other remarks of the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that be amended to the chairman and ranking member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9720-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    CUMBERLAND VALLEY NATIONAL BANK\n\n  Mr. McConnell. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nCumberland Valley National Bank on its one hundredth anniversary as a \npremiere financial institution in the heart of southeastern Kentucky.\n  On October 1, 1904, the East Bernstadt Banking Company, as it was \nknown then, opened its doors with capital stock of $15,000. Within 8 \nyears their capital stock had jumped to $25,000 and they underwent \ntheir first name change, to the First National Bank. This was just the \nbeginning of several expansions and name changes.\n  In spite of the closing of major coal mining operations in East \nBernstadt, the First National Bank remained quite successful and moved \nfrom East Bernstadt to the Catching Building in London, becoming, \nironically, the Second National Bank of London. In the years that \nfollowed, their capital stock continued to rise. By 1951, the bank \nreached a milestone with $100,000 in capital stock. In 1959, the Second \nNational Bank opened its first branch location, the North London Branch \nand added a third location in 1974. Because it was able to establish \nitself as one of the premiere banking institutions in Laurel County, \nthe bank decided to change its name again, this time to its current \nname the Cumberland Valley National Bank.\n  Today, the Cumberland Valley National Bank has twenty locations to \nserve the people of Laurel County. While the bank has changed its name \nseveral times over the last 100 years, it has never changed the \nimpeccable service it provides its customers. This is due in large part \nto the hundreds of former and current employees who have strived to \nmake this bank a cornerstone of Laurel County.\n  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the Cumberland \nValley National Bank, the largest locally owned bank in southeastern \nKentucky, for its one hundred years of business. I wish them another \none hundred years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9720-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9720-S9721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SECURITY FOR JUSTICES--S. 2742\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 2742, which is a short but important piece of legislation that \nSenator Hatch\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\nand I have cosponsored at the request of the Supreme Court. This \nlegislation would renew authority to provide security for the Justices \nwhen they leave the Supreme Court. Recent reports of the assault of \nJustice Souter when he was outside of the Supreme Court highlight the \nimportance of security for Justices. If no congressional action is \ntaken, the authority of Supreme Court police to protect Justices off \ncourt grounds will expire at the end of this year.\n  Another provision in this legislation allows the Supreme Court to \naccept gifts ``pertaining to the history of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States or its justices.'' The administrative offices of the \nCourts currently has statutory authority to accept gifts on behalf of \nthe judiciary. This provision would grant the Supreme Court authority \nto accept gifts but it would narrow the types of gifts that can be \nreceived to historical items. I think this provision strikes the proper \nbalance.\n  Finally, this legislation also would provide an additional venue for \nthe prosecution of offenses that occur on the Supreme Court grounds. \nCurrently, the DC Superior Court is the only place of proper venue \ndespite the uniquely Federal interest at stake. This legislation would \nallow suit to be brought in United States District Court in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9721-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On July 7, 2000 in San Diego, CA, Paul Cain, a 28-year-old member of \nthe Nazi Low Riders, was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison for \nthe beating and strangulation of a gay man in 1995.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the DREAM \nVigil, a national grassroots effort to raise support for the DREAM Act. \nMany New Yorkers participated in a 5-day fast during the National Week \nof Action for Immigrants' Rights. They did this in part to show support \nfor the DREAM Act, an important piece of legislation for immigration \nreform. In a show of solidarity, similar fasts have been organized in \ncities and States across the Nation over the past 2 weeks. The DREAM \nVigil culminated last week and I commend all of the State and local \norganizations, community members, local leaders and students in New \nYork and across the Nation that have participated in this effort.\n  Recently, I stood before you and spoke about the importance of this \nmonth's celebration of Hispanic heritage. Today, Hispanic Americans are \nflourishing in States across the country and I am proud to represent \nthe most diverse Hispanic community in our Nation. Yet, I worry that \nfar too many immigrant children and families continue to suffer under \nAmerica's broken immigration system.\n  This year more than 65,000 immigrant students graduated from U.S. \nhigh schools only to see the doors of opportunity closed to them, \nthrough no fault of their own. The DREAM Act, which I proudly \ncosponsor, will help expand opportunities for our Nation's immigrant \nstudents by placing them on a path to college and U.S. citizenship. Yet \nMembers of Congress and this administration continue to put this \nimportant legislation on the back burner.\n  Over the last few years, immigrant students and advocates across the \ncountry have engaged in an enormous amount of activity in support of \nthe DREAM Act. They have met with members of Congress, held hundreds of \nrallies, gathered more than 100,000 petitions, made tens of thousands \nof phone calls to congressional offices, and more. Just last April, \nover 300 students and advocates came to Washington, DC, from all across \nthe Nation to express their support for the DREAM Act and to urge \nPresident Bush to support this legislation. Nearly half of these \nstudents came from New York, and I was proud to have had the \nopportunity to meet some of them.\n  It is important to understand that these students were brought to \nthis Nation as young children and have been educated in our public \nschool system. They have stayed in school and stayed out of trouble and \nmany are valedictorians, honor students, student leaders, and high \nachievers. Yet, because of their immigration status they are often \neffectively barred from pursuing a post-secondary education and the \nAmerican dream.\n  Over the past several years I have met many of these students. They \nhave also written to me to share their stories of why this legislation \nis important to them. In July, I heard from Alejandra, who came to \nWashington as part of a group of advocates for immigration reform. \nAlejandra also participated in the 5-day fast as part of the National \nWeek of Action in New York. She graduated in June as the valedictorian \nof Renaissance Charter School in Jackson Heights, Queens. Alejandra was \na member of the National Honor Society; a sixth grade tutor; a \nteacher's assistant; an intern with the Global Kids, Human Rights \nActivist Project; and one of 400 students and staff across the Nation \nwho were selected to participate in the National Young Leaders \nConference in Washington, DC, last year. Yet. Alejandra is one of many \nstudents across New York whose high school graduation was bittersweet.\n\n  Alejandra has done everything right. However, she still struggles to \npay for college, a struggle that is not based on her merit, but rather \non her immigration status. Despite all of her hard work, exemplary \nacademic performance, and outstanding record of community service, \nAlejandra remains ineligible for Federal grants, loans or work-study \njobs to help her afford college. Our broken immigration system is \ntrying to force her out of our education system and the American dream. \nBut, Alejandra is determined. She is persistent, and she refuses to \ngive up. In spite of her immigration status and unlike other students \nin her precarious situation, Alejandra has found a way to pursue higher \neducation. She currently attends the City University of new York. But \nstill, the DREAM Act remains her only real hope of achieving that one \nthing that all Americans yearn and work hard for--the opportunity to \nfully contribute to the land we call home--the American dream. Without \nthe DREAM Act, her years of hard work and the education that she has \nstruggled so hard to obtain will be meaningless and wasted since \nAlejandra will never be able to put her skills to work legally.It is a \nwasted investment for her and a wasted investment for the American \npeople.\n  I find it deeply troubling that we allow this to happen in today's \n21st century economy, where a post-secondary education is quickly \nbecoming the minimum requirement for higher-earning jobs. Failure to \nprovide immigrant students such as Alejandra and all students with \nadequate access to post-secondary education will have devastating \neconomic and social consequences for these individuals and our entire \nNation.\n  That is why the DREAM Act is so critical. It ensures that the promise \nof the American dream becomes a reality for our Nation's immigrants--\nmany of whom are Hispanic Americans--and every American. Results of two \nnational public opinion polls demonstrate strong voter support for the \nconcept embodied in the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act deserves our Nation's \nfull support and I urge President Bush and Congress to pass this \nimportant legislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9721-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9721-S9722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MRS. BEATRICE T. JONES\n\n   Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize the \naccomplishments of Mrs. Beatrice T. Jones, a dedicated public servant \nwho has given 22 years of her life to our country. Mrs. Jones began her \ncivil service career on May 30, 1982 with the Department of the Army. \nOriginally from the Roanoke, VA, area, Mrs. Jones is the classic \nsuccess story. Steadily climbing the\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\nladder, Mrs. Jones advanced from a Secretary position to become the \nChief of Protocol for the U.S. Army Military District of Washington. \nOver the years, she gained a reputation among her peers and Army \nleadership as the resident expert in military protocol and etiquette.\n  Mrs. Jones was directly responsible for the success of countless \nceremonial events such as the Army's notable Twilight Tattoo, Spirit of \nAmerica, holiday concerts, numerous retirements and in a special \ntribute to honor America's fallen heroes of September 11. Many of these \nevents gave great solace to our national audience. She was the ever \npresent figure behind the scenes ensuring that all went well. Her \ninvolvement and unique sense of what the United States Army meant to \nher countrymen allowed Mrs. Jones to chart these events so that \neveryone in attendance was enthused with a sense of pride in our senior \nservice.\n  I mention her today because I believe it is important to recognize \nthe type of steadfast trooper we have in Mrs. Jones; she was always \nthere, working the late hours before the event and hustling during the \nevent. She was the person concerned about the smallest detail so that \nthe pride of the Army would be at the maximum level. Mrs. Jones was \nlikely so caught up in these events to ensure success that she had \nlittle time to contemplate the scale and dignity of the grand \nceremonies she brought about. I was pleased to note that the Army \nrecognized that time had come to give Mrs. Jones her own ceremony. On \nJuly 16 of this year, Mrs. Jones was awarded the Superior Civilian \nService Award by Major General Jackman, Commanding General, U.S. Army \nMilitary District of Washington, for her exceptional contributions to \nthe Directorate of Ceremonies and Special Events. This medal reflects \nher superb service and the gratitude of a long gray line of Army \nProtocol Specialists whose lives and careers she has touched, and many \nof whom have become successful in their own right as a result of \ncarrying with them the lessons learned under Mrs. Jones.\n  I am please to report that her future plans include spending quality \ntime with her grandchildren and family.

A bill to provide certain enhancements to the Montgomery \nG.I. Bill Program for certain individuals who serve as members of the \nArmed Forces after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the G.I. Bill \nEnhancement Act of 2004. My legislation would waive the Montgomery G.I. \nbill program's $1,200 enrollment fee for active duty members of our \nNation's military.\n  This legislation covers any member of the United States military, \nincluding Reserve and National Guard members, serving on active duty \nduring the period after President Bush's November 2001 Executive order \nthat placed the military on a wartime footing. This legislation would: \nwaive the G.I. bill enrollment fee until President Bush's November 2001 \nExecutive order is rescinded; allow all servicemen and women to opt \ninto the G.I. bill with no penalty or enrollment fee; and reimburse \nthose servicemen and women covered by this bill who have already paid \nthe $1,200 enrollment fee prior to the enactment of this legislation.\n  The current Montgomery G.I. bill is tailored to serve members of our \nmilitary in a time of peace. Upon enlistment, recruits are given the \noption of enrolling in the G.I. bill. If they choose to participate, \nthey are charged a $1,200 enrollment fee which is deducted from their \nmonthly pay over 12 months. However, we are now in a time of war and \nthe demands on our service members and their families have been \ntransformed and increased. To that end, changes must be made to the \nG.I. bill to ensure that it continues to provide realistic and relevant \neducational opportunities to those who are defending our country.\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness. The men and women serving \nour country in wartime should not have to choose between the long-term \nbenefits of the G.I. bill and the short-term demands of their paycheck. \nThe G.I. bill is one of the great legacies of military service to our \ncountry. Men and women sacrificing for their country in a time of war \nneed to be assured that access to higher education is in their future. \nCongress must do all it can to ensure that education options for our \nveterans are accessible and real.\n  The year 2004 marks the 60th anniversary of the Servicemen's \nReadjustment Act of 1944, better known as the G.I. bill. This bill has \nlong been recognized as one of the most important congressional acts of \npost World War II America. The G.I. bill ensured that all who served \ntheir Nation would not be penalized as a result of their time away from \ntheir careers and communities in service to their country. The G.I. \nbill helped members of our ``greatest generation'' upon their return \nhome by providing them with the educational tools necessary to pursue \nthe opportunities enjoyed by all Americans.\n  Over the last 60 years, the Federal Government has invested billions \nof dollars in education benefits for our Nation's veterans. Over 17.6 \nmillion men and women have benefitted from the G.I. bill, resulting in \na workforce that transformed American society. The bill's far-reaching \nimpact can be seen here today, as Members of this body, including this \nSenator, have prospered as a result of the benefits of the G.I. bill.\n  Every American should be proud of how we have responded to the \nchallenges of terrorism following September 11, 2001.

A bill to authorize the President to posthumously award a \ngold medal on behalf of the Congress to Fred McFeely Rogers, in \nrecognition of his lasting contributions to the application of \ncreativity and imagination in the early education of our Nation's \nchildren, and to his lasting example to the Nation and the world of \nwhat it means to be a good neighbor; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \naccomplishments of Mr. Fred McFeely Rogers and to introduce, along with \nSenator Specter, a measure posthumously award him a Congressional Gold \nMedal.\n  People of all ages across the country were saddened to learn of Fred \nRogers' death last year. Better known to generations of Americans \nsimply as Mr. Rogers, he devoted his life to fostering children's \nimaginations and reinforcing virtues that help serve the greater good \nof society.\n  A student of child development at the University of Pittsburgh and an \nordained Presbyterian minister, Fred Rogers produced various local and \nnational television programs for the enjoyment of America's youth. Most \nnotable among his productions were ``The Children's Corner'' and ``Mr. \nRogers' Neighborhood,'' programs that showcased Rogers' talent as both \nproducer and actor. For his work on programs such as these, Fred Rogers \nwas awarded numerous professional accolades that included four Emmy \nAwards, ``Lifetime Achievement'' Awards from the National Academy of \nTelevision Arts and Sciences and the TV Critics Association, and two \nGeorge Foster Peabody Awards. In 1999, he was inducted into the \nTelevision Hall of Fame.\n  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Fred Rogers was an \nambassador of kindness and compassion to generations of American \nchildren. He infused\n\n[[Page S9725]]\n\nlaughter and life lessons into every episode of his programs. Time \nspent in ``Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood'' taught children to share, care \nfor others, and express their emotions during times of grief and \ntrouble. Above all, he taught children how to be a good neighbor to \nthose in their communities.\n  I commend the work of Fred McFeely Rogers, and I am privileged to \nintroduce this measure on behalf of everyone who had the opportunity to \nwatch and learn from Mr. Rogers--we were truly blessed to have such a \ncompassionate and caring figure broadcast into our homes on a daily \nbasis. He well be greatly missed, but his exemplary life of tireless \nservice will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/27/senate-section/article/S9725-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3702.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Haiti is important to the national security interests \n     of the United States.\n       (2) The United States has contributed significant \n     assistance to support the political, economic and social \n     development of Haiti with limited and uneven results.\n       (3) The Haitian people are currently suffering from extreme \n     poverty, threats from armed groups who control large areas of \n     the country, and violations of human rights, including \n     kidnappings.\n       (4) As of September 22, 2004, Tropical Storm Jeanne killed \n     more than 1,000 people, with many hundreds remaining missing, \n     in Gonaives and other areas of Haiti, and caused severe \n     destruction of property.\n       (5) The Interim Government of Haiti under Prime Minister \n     Gerard Latortue is attempting to initiate much needed reforms \n     and bring political stability to the country prior to the \n     reintroduction of anticipated democratically-elected \n     governance in 2005.\n       (6) On July 19-20, 2004, the international community \n     pledged $1,085,000,000 in assistance for Haiti, including \n     $230,000,000 from the United States.\n       (7) The immediate challenges facing Haiti are (a) \n     addressing the insecurity and instability caused by armed \n     groups who are undermining the ability of the Interim \n     Government of Haiti to combat poverty and create the \n     conditions for free and fair elections; (b) establishing the \n     rule of law; and (c) economic reactivation and job creation.\n       (8) On April 30, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n     authorized the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \n     (MINUSTAH) 6,700 military personnel and 1,622 civilian police \n     personnel, but as of July 31, 2004, only 2,259 military \n     personnel and 224 civilian police personnel had been \n     deployed.\n       (9) MINUSTAH is essential to efforts to restore stability \n     and security, including countering the activities of rebels, \n     ex-combatants and other armed groups.\n       (b) Congress--\n       (1) appreciates the contributions of military and civilian \n     police personnel to MINUSTAH by Brazil and other nations;\n       (2) calls upon the Secretary of State to redouble his \n     efforts to encourage contributions of additional personnel to \n     MINUSTAH;\n       (3) calls upon MINUSTAH to assertively fulfill its mandate \n     under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter to ``ensure a \n     secure and stable environment within which the constitutional \n     and political process in Haiti can take place'', by \n     confronting and resolving security threats to the Interim \n     Government of Haiti and the people of Haiti;\n       (4) calls upon the United States and the international \n     community, including the United Nations and the Organization \n     of American States, to expedite the disbursement of \n     sufficient assistance to enable the Interim Government of \n     Haiti to--\n       (A) address Haiti's urgent humanitarian needs, including to \n     assist Haitians affected by Tropical Storm Jeanne;\n       (B) increase employment and promote economic development; \n     and\n       (C) carry out democratic elections in 2005;\n       (5) calls upon the Interim Government of Haiti to make \n     every effort to ensure that all political parties can \n     participate fully and freely in the electoral process; and\n       (6) notes that the failure to establish a secure and stable \n     environment and to conduct credible and inclusive elections \n     will likely result in Haiti's complete transition from a \n     failed state to a criminal state.\n\n\n             REPORT ON GLOBAL POVERTY AND NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n       Sec. 5107.

(a) The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United Nations General Assembly and United Nations \n     Security Council have over a period of many years engaged in \n     a pattern of enacting measures and resolutions castigating \n     and condemning the state of Israel.\n       (2) Despite the myriad of challenges facing the world \n     community, the United Nations General Assembly has devoted a \n     disproportionate amount of time and resources to castigating \n     Israel.\n       (3) During the fifty-seventh session of the United Nations \n     General Assembly, the General Assembly adopted a total of 80 \n     resolutions by roll call vote, 23 of which related to Israel \n     and were opposed by the United States.\n       (4) The United States has a responsibility to promote fair \n     and equitable treatment of all nations in the context of \n     international organizations, including the United Nations.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the President, the \n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, \n     and other appropriate United States officials should--\n       (1) work to dissuade member states of the United Nations \n     from voting in support of United Nations General Assembly \n     resolutions that unfairly castigate Israel; and\n       (2) promote within the United Nations General Assembly more \n     balanced and constructive approaches to resolving the \n     conflict in the Middle East.\n       (c) Section 406(b)(4) of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law \n     101-246; 22 U.S.C. 2414a(b)(4)) is amended by inserting after \n     ``United States'' the following: ``, including a separate \n     listing of all plenary votes cast by member countries of the \n     United Nations in the General Assembly on resolutions \n     specifically related to Israel that are opposed by the United \n     States''.\n\n\n sense of the senate on violations of religious freedom in saudi arabia\n\n       Sec. 5110. It is the sense of the Senate that, in light of \n     the designation of Saudi Arabia as a country of particular \n     concern under section 402(b)(1)(A) of the International \n     Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)) \n     because the Government of Saudi Arabia has engaged in or \n     tolerated particularly severe violations of religious \n     freedom, the President should--\n       (1) under the authority in section 402(c)(2) and 405(c) of \n     such Act, negotiate a binding agreement with the Government \n     of Saudi Arabia that requires such Government to phase out \n     any program, policy, or practice that contributes to the \n     violations of religious freedom occurring or being tolerated \n     in Saudi Arabia; or\n       (2) take an action described in one of the paragraphs (9) \n     through (15) of 405(a) of such Act or a commensurate action \n     under the authority in section 402(c)(1)(B) of such Act with \n     respect to Saudi Arabia that the President determines is \n     appropriate after consideration of the recommendations for \n     United States policy made by the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom.\n\n\n           support for the political independence of Lebanon\n\n       Sec. 5111.

The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak to the monumental \nissue before us, the most profound, sweeping reform of our entire \nintelligence community in nearly 60 years, 3 years after the worst \nattack ever on American soil. As a member of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, I welcome this opportunity to discuss \ncritical issues I believe must be addressed this year.\n  First, I thank the majority leader for his timely action and \nsteadfast leadership ensuring that we have this legislation before us \nand we will complete action before we adjourn.\n  I also want to recognize my colleague, the chair of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, for her \nexceptional and tireless work over the past 2 months to produce this \ncomprehensive legislation to reform our intelligence community, to \nrightly reflect the sense of urgency that this legislation deserves and \ncertainly one we should consider. I applaud her for undertaking this \nhistoric effort and for guiding this legislation through her committee \non a bipartisan basis.\n  As well, I want to express my appreciation to the ranking member, \nSenator Lieberman, for his efforts in bringing us to this day. It truly \nwas an enormous undertaking that was assigned to the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, and I want to thank them for all they have done to \nbegin this debate this week on the intelligence reform bill.\n  As we begin these deliberations, I cannot help but be reminded that \nwhile the intelligence community reform has unquestionably taken on a \nnew urgency, it is simply not a new issue. Since the first Hoover \nCommission in 1949, studies have been conducted, commissions have been \nestablished, and reports have been issued on how best to structure our \nintelligence community. Yet in spite of the over 50 years of debate on \nthis issue, it was the morning of September 11 and all that followed \nthat has resulted in us being where we are today on the Senate floor \ndebating reform legislation and poised to accomplish what has alluded \nso many for so long.\n  To say that September 11 is a seminal moment for our Nation certainly \nwould be an understatement. Indeed, that day will forever be etched in \nour minds and our national consciousness, just as it always will \nforever change the way we view the world. It was that day, more than \nany before, that catapulted us into a new era in which our Nation faced \nvery different, more pervasive and inimical threats. It was a day that \nrevealed in the starkest terms the truism that intelligence is now and \nmust always be our best and first line of defense against a committed \nenemy who knows no borders, wears no uniform, and pledges allegiance \nonly to causes and not states. It was a day that has proven that the \nintelligence community's old structure and old ways of doing business \nare insufficient for confronting the challenges of the 21st century.\n  But if September 11 provided the catalyst for reform, the failures in \nthe prewar intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs \nprovided even greater impetus for a major overhaul of the U.S. \nintelligence community, and that time for change is now upon us.\n\n  For over a year, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has \nfocused intently on reviewing the prewar intelligence of Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction program, the regime's ties to terrorism, Saddam \nHussein's human rights abuses, and his regime's impact on regional \nstability. After the indepth analysis of 30,000 pages of intelligence \nassessment, source reporting, interviewing more than 200 individuals, \nthe committee produced a report in early July that indisputably begs \nfor intelligence community restructuring.\n  The report revealed a stunning lack of accountability and sound \nhands-on management practices throughout the community's chain of \ncommand. This lack of leadership and poor management allowed \nassumptions to go unchallenged, contributed to mischaracterizations of \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction programs, and led to significant \nlapses in the intelligence community's responsibility to convey the \nuncertainties behind their assessments. In short, there was a lack of \nanalytic rigor performed on one of the most critical and defining \nissues spanning more than a decade.\n  During our review, we learned that much of what analysts knew about \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction program predated the gulf war, \nleaving them with little direct knowledge of the current state of those \nprograms. The ``group think'' mentality that dominated analysis is just \none of the intelligence failures this report illuminates.\n  Intelligence community managers, collectors, and analysts believed \nthat Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, a notion that dates back to \nIraq's pre-1991 efforts to retain, build, and hide those programs, and \nin several circumstances the intelligence community made intelligence \ninformation fit into preconceived notions about Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction programs. From our review, we know the intelligence \ncommunity relied on sources that supported its predetermined ideas, and \nwe also know that there was no alternative analysis or ``red teaming'' \nperformed on such a critical issue. We also now know that most of the \nkey judgments in the national intelligence estimate were overstated or \nwere not supported by the underlying intelligence.\n  For example, the intelligence community insists that Iraq had \nchemical weapons. Yet this was based on a single stream of reporting. \nThe intelligence community based its assessment that Iraq's biological \nwarfare program was larger and more advanced than before the gulf war \nlargely on a single source to whom the intelligence community never had \ndirect access and with whom there were credibility problems. The \nintelligence community judged that Iraq was developing a UAV probably \nintended to deliver biological weapons. Yet there was significant \nevidence clearly indicating that nonbiological weapons delivery \nmissions were more likely.\n  The committee's report also notes the lack of human intelligence on \nthe Iraqi target and reveals, as the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence \nCommunity Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of \nSeptember 11, 2001, also documented, that our intelligence community is \naverse to undertaking higher risk human intelligence operations, \ncompelling our analysts to rely on inadequate, outdated, or unreliable \nintelligence.\n  The points raised form an inescapable indictment of the status quo. \nThe facts speak for themselves, and they are a significant reason we \nare here today to debate issues of intelligence community reform. The \nmen and women, the dedicated professionals of the intelligence \ncommunity, who toil every day to protect our national security, must \nhave a decisive, innovative, and centralized leadership and management \nstructure as well as the requisite resources to perform this vital and \noften daunting task. While I acknowledge the need to be cautious and \ndeliberate, in this era of unprecedented challenges, we must ensure our \nintelligence community is poised to confront these challenges, and we \nmust act now. The status quo is clearly not an option.\n\n  On that note, I do happen to believe that we must create a national \nintelligence director and certainly that it\n\n[[Page S9757]]\n\nwould be a significant leap forward, and that is why I commend the \ncommittee for embracing this type of reform.\n  I also commend Senator Feinstein for her leadership on this issue, \nand I am pleased to have joined with her several months ago, before the \nrelease of the September 11 Commission Report, in championing this idea \nof establishing a critical position, to be filled by a single person, \nindependent from the day-to-day responsibilities of running a single \nintelligence agency and whose sole responsibility is to lead and manage \nthe intelligence community. I believe our perspectives on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee and the work we did for more than a year and a \nhalf on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction program gave impetus to this \nnotion and this idea that we clearly had to embark on major \nrestructuring of the intelligence community.\n  I happen to believe that creating this central position is a \nsignificant component in the larger imperative of overall intelligence \ncommunity reform because it simply just does not make sense today to \nhave one person who is the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency \nalso responsible for the entire intelligence community of the other 14 \nagencies. Rather, we need a national intelligence director whose \ndedicated leadership will ensure that consistent priorities are set and \nimplemented, and that all the gears of our intelligence gathering, \nanalysis, and reporting are synchronized and not ad hoc.\n  In fact, Dr. David Kay, who is the former director of the Iraq Survey \nGroup, said such management changes in the intelligence community could \nhave resulted in a very different national intelligence estimate than \nwe received on Iraq weapons of mass destruction program. He noted that \nfailures of analytic tradecraft, culture, management, and mismanagement \nof the information flow could have been alleviated with proper \nmanagement and leadership.\n  Indeed, I asked Dr. Kay when he came before the committee in August:\n\n       We know what went wrong. Could it have been a very \n     different product?\n       Could we have had a very different product in the NIE, if \n     we had changes, organizationally, that we are speaking of?\n\n  That is a question posed of Dr. Kay. He responded:\n\n       It could have been a very different product, in my \n     judgment.\n\n  That is a very telling and significant statement. He said the \nnational intelligence estimate, the estimate upon which we predicated \nwar, upon which we made our decisions, based on the assessments that \nwere included in that national intelligence estimate, could have been a \nvery different product if we had an entirely different type of \norganization within the intelligence community.\n  I happen to believe that creating a national intelligence director \nwould also facilitate a better atmosphere of objectivity, an element \nthat has been sorely lacking in the intelligence community. Separating \nthe Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from one specific \norganization would better allow the other 14 intelligence community \nagencies to be heard in the debates about the validity and veracity of \nintelligence information and analyses that have a direct effect on our \nnational security.\n  A director of national intelligence would level the playing field \nwhen it comes to the competition of ideas and intelligence analysis. \nCurrently, as the head of both the CIA, as well as the intelligence \ncommunity, the DCI is the principal intelligence adviser to the \nPresident. This provides the CIA with unique access to policymakers. \nAlthough the goal of this structure was to coordinate the disparate \nelements of the intelligence community in order to provide the most \naccurate and objective analysis, this report reveals that in practice \nthis arrangement actually undermines the provision of objective \nanalysis.\n  Indeed, this committee's report on Iraq concluded:\n\n       The CIA continues to excessively compartment sensitive \n     human intelligence reporting and fails to share important \n     information about [human intelligence] reporting and sources \n     with Intelligence Community analysts who have a need to know.\n\n  Further the report concluded that:\n\n       The CIA, in several significant instances, abused its \n     unique position in the [intelligence community], particularly \n     in terms of information sharing, to the detriment of the \n     [intelligence community's] prewar analysis concerning Iraq's \n     [weapons of mass destruction] programs.\n\n  One agency should not be able to control the presentation of \ninformation to policymakers, nor should an agency be able to exclude \nanalyses from the other agencies. As the committee's report on the \nprewar intelligence on Iraq reveals, the Director of Central \nIntelligence was not aware of dissenting opinions within the \nintelligence community on the potential use for the aluminum tubes, \ndespite the fact that the intelligence community had been debating the \nissue for well more than a year.\n  Since the Director was not aware of all the views of the intelligence \nagencies, he could only pass on the CIA's view to the President. This \nhas to change. Policymakers must be aware of all views of all \nintelligence agencies on such crucial matters.\n  Some might say consolidating the leadership of the entire \nintelligence community under a national intelligence director might \nactually stifle healthy competition, that central planning will deprive \ndecisionmakers of a full range of intelligence. I echo what Chairman \nKean and Vice Chairman Hamilton have said:\n\n       Competitive analysis is very important . . . no one can \n     claim that the current structure fosters competitive \n     analysis. Look at the Senate report on group-think with \n     regard to Iraq. The current system encourages, we believe, \n     group-think. . . .\n\n  In my view, to accomplish the task we have just discussed, the \nnational intelligence director should be equipped with the authority \ncommensurate with the responsibilities with which he is vested. We can \nno longer afford to have the Intelligence Committee unable to direct \nthose resources.\n  As the Chairman of the 9/11 Commission indicated--he said in response \nto another question I posed when he testified before the Intelligence \nCommittee with regard to George Tenet raising the red flag about the \nthreat from al-Qaida:\n\n       . . . a problem we have of communication between agencies . \n     . . one of the best illustrations that hit me when I first \n     heard about it is in 1998, when [the Director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency] George Tenet got it. What we are \n     suggesting, I guess, is if you had that coordination and that \n     declaration of war had been made under the system we \n     recommend, the military, the diplomatic side, the \n     intelligence side, they all would have gotten it.\n\n  If you can imagine when the Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency had been talking about a major threat to the United States back \nin 1998, raising a red flag, going around Washington talking to \nwhomever in order to get attention, to draw attention to this \ntremendous threat that al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden posed, that they \nwere declaring war on the United States, and he could not get anyone's \nattention, never, ever again should we be in a position where the \nDirector of Central Intelligence, now the director of the national \nintelligence community, should not be able to get the attention of the \nexecutive branch or of the Congress or of policymakers across the board \nwithin the intelligence community because he doesn't have the power to \nredirect resources or to redirect the attention or to make sure there \nis a collective focus on such a major threat.\n  There are a number of authorities that this legislation before us \nwill provide the national director of intelligence. I think it is \nabsolutely vital and critical that the national intelligence director \nhave strong authority to redirect resources with respect to budget and \npersonnel. There is no question that we must have a director of \nnational intelligence who is vested with the kind of power and \nauthority to command a centralized organization. This is not just about \nmoving boxes around. It is vesting the authority within this individual \nto command the direction of the resources and the decisionmaking that \nis absolutely vital to establish the kind of strategic thinking across \nthe intelligence community that heretofore has not been present.\n  Some have argued that providing the national intelligence director \nwith these authorities equates to the loss of intelligence support to \nour warfighters.\n\n[[Page S9758]]\n\nI do not dispute the fact that any successful intelligence reform must \nrespect the military's necessity to maintain a robust organic tactical \nintelligence capability and to have rapid access to national \nintelligence assets and information.\n\n  I would argue that providing the national intelligence director with \nthe authorities commensurate to his responsibilities, by providing him \nthe ability to better coordinate and manage the entirety of our \nNation's intelligence operations, could improve national support to our \nmilitary operations, both strategically as well as tactically.\n  One of the national intelligence director's greatest responsibilities \nwill be to secure national intelligence support to our warfighters and \nensure that strategic information of tactical importance is \nexpeditiously delivered to our soldiers, seamen, airmen and marines. \nThere is no question but that the men and women of our Armed Forces \ndeserve and must continue to receive the best, most timely actionable \nintelligence. So I believe that creating this position will also \nimprove the accountability within the intelligence community, an issue \nthat also has been a focus of mine for the past 20 years.\n  I saw firsthand the consequences of serious inadequacies in \naccountability during my 12 years as a member of the House Foreign \nAffairs International Operations Subcommittee and as chair of the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  During the 99th Congress back in 1986, I worked to bring to the State \nDepartment an accountability review board as part of the Omnibus \nDiplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986. I think about those \ntimes because accountability becomes a critical component as we ensure \nthat our agencies are responsive to the threats that are posed to \nAmerica, to Americans, to American interests here as well as abroad.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I look back to that \ntime. That is why I think it so critical to ensure that in every phase \nof the new challenges that we are facing we also incorporate the kind \nof accountability that compels our policymakers, our officials, and \nagencies responsive to those threats. As a member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, I continue to see that there is a stunning lack \nof accountability within the community.\n  The committee's review of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction is replete with information-sharing failures, \nanalytic failures, and collection failures. It is imperative that these \nfailures, many of which were identified in the Joint Inquiry into \nIntelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist \nAttacks of September 11, are not repeated. As former United Nations \nweapons inspector Dr. David Kay told the Intelligence Committee at one \nof our reform hearings, `` . . . intelligence reform without \naccountability will not achieve the objective we all share to avoid \nrepeating the clearly avoidable tragedy of 9/11 and the equally \navoidable failures in analysis that marked the Iraq WMD program.''\n  That is why back in 1986 we created an accountability review board in \nthe State Department because of embassy security, because of the threat \nposed by terrorists back in the 1980s. We had the Inman Report in 1983, \nand we responded to that. We redesigned embassy security, both \nphysical, perimeter security, intelligence security, and we didn't want \nany more lapses and failures in that regard. That is why we set up the \naccountability review board--so we can ensure that these measures put \nin place are implemented and strongly enforced.\n  I think the same is true here. We have to ensure there will be \naccountability. In the aftermath of the World Trade Center bombing in \n1993, there was a failure of information sharing among the agencies. \nAgain, it was another lapse in failure among agencies. Even after 9/11 \nwe are now examining failures again of information sharing--replete \nwith failure.\n  It seems to me that we have to redesign the system to ensure that we \nhave the kind of accountability we should demand rightfully of those \nwho are in positions of authority to implement these responsibilities \nand obligations. That is why I think it is critical that we incorporate \nthese types of reforms which will be essential.\n  I concluded after my examination of what went wrong with our pre-war \nassessment concerning Iraq's WMD program and the reality posed to the \nmilitary phase of Iraq that one way to prevent these lapses in the \nfuture is to inject more accountability into the intelligence \ncommunity. That is why I introduced legislation in June to create the \noffice of inspector general for intelligence.\n  The intelligence community lacks a single, overarching intelligence \ncommunitywide investigative entity that bridges the gap between and \namong all the various agencies in order to identify problem areas to \nensure critical deficiencies are addressed before they become crises or \ntragedies, and to develop and ensure the implementation of the most \nefficient and effective methods of intelligence gathering and \ninterpretation.\n  What is required, in my view, is an inspector general for the entire \nintelligence community. The agencies now have their own individual \ninspector generals. But I happen to believe that this newly created \noffice would assist in instituting better management accountability and \nwould help the national intelligence director resolve problems within \nthe intelligence community.\n  I am very pleased that the legislation we are debating today \nincludes--again I thank the leadership of the chair of the committee, \nSenator Collins, for including a provision to create an office of \ninspector general for the entire community. That inspector general has \nthe ability to initiate and conduct independent investigations, \nincluding investigating current issues within the intelligence \ncommunity, not just conduct ``lessons learned'' studies, not just a \nretrospective, but prospective to identify the problems that may be \nthere, may be present in the intelligence community, and to have that \nstrategic view of what is going wrong and make sure we can also prevent \nand preempt the problems before they take place.\n\n  This new office will seek to identify problem areas and identify the \nmost efficient and effective business practices required to ensure that \ncritical deficiencies can be addressed before it is too late, before we \nhave another intelligence failure, and before lives are lost.\n  In short, an inspector general who can look across the entire \ncommunity will help improve management and coordination, and \ncooperation and information sharing among the intelligence agencies--\nagain, another dynamic that will help to ensure and enforce the kind of \ninformation sharing that clearly has been lacking up to this point.\n  The inspector general also will help break down the barriers that \nhave perpetuated the parochial, stovepipe approaches to intelligence \ncommunity management and operations.\n  Again, I commend the work of the authors of this underlying bill, \nSenator Collins for her dedication, and Senator Lieberman for working \ntogether to include this recommendation of creating the inspector \ngeneral in the office of the national intelligence director.\n  The authors of this bill have crafted extensive language creating and \ndefining this vital agent of accountability. I look forward to further \nworking with them to complete the creation of an independent IG, and to \nensure that proper accountability to the director of the national \nintelligence, to the President and to Congress, and ultimately to the \nAmerican people is carried forward.\n  In addition, I hope I can work with the committee on several other \nissues and amendments to enhance this legislation.\n  For example, as I have been reviewing this legislation, and as we \nlook at the pre-war intelligence, it was apparent that the intelligence \ncommunity relied on forces that supported this predetermined idea and \nfound there was no alternative analysis or ``red teaming'' performed on \ncritical issues, allowing assessments to go unchallenged year after \nyear, and certainly for more than a decade with respect to Iraq.\n  While this bill includes provisions for an analysis review unit, I \nalso think we must consider the ability for the community to look at \nalternatives in that\n\n[[Page S9759]]\n\narea as well. It is very important to have that type of dynamic within \nthe intelligence community, to think out of the box, to think \ncreatively and innovatively and not just be confined to the assumptions \nthat have been carried over, to preconceived notions that were so \ninherent in all of the pre-war assessments with respect to Iraq's WMD \nprogram.\n  This bill also mandates that the national intelligence council \nproduce national intelligence estimates. I believe this process must be \nmade a little more automatic and transparent and a little ad hoc. I \nbelieve that the national intelligence council should report to us what \nthey can do to streamline that process.\n  I also believe we should have the National Counterterrorism Center \nreport to us in a year about what they are doing and whether they are \nmeeting the mark. This bill already requires a report from the national \ndirector of intelligence. But I think it would also be important to \nhear from the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center the \nlessons learned in the establishment of capability before we move to \nset up other centers. The creation of a national intelligence director \nand improving the community's accountability through the creation of an \ninspector general are but two of the many issues in the ongoing debate \non intelligence community reform. Indeed, it has been an extremely \nchallenging year for the intelligence community and those who work in \nit, one in which we saw every aspect of the intelligence process come \nto the fore at one time or another.\n  From the tactical collection and analysis of on-the-ground \nintelligence by our battlefield commanders in Iraq that led to the \ncapture of Saddam Hussein, to the global search for the information \nthat led to the exposure of Aq Khan's nuclear proliferation network, to \nthe decision to commit troops to the field in Iraq, it became obvious \nto every American that timely and quality intelligence is imperative if \nwe are to be successful in defeating the forces that have pledged \nthemselves to the destruction of America.\n  I think all of these events highlight how abundantly crucial it is to \nensure that we have the leadership with the requisite authority to \nensure that the collection, analysis, and dissemination of intelligence \ninformation is as synchronized, accurate, and as comprehensive as it \npossibly can be, and that it represents the very best judgment of the \nintelligence community when it is provided to the national policymakers \nwho rely on that information to make the most profound of decisions.\n  Of course, intelligence reform must include reforming oversight of \nnot only the intelligence community. Ideally, this should have occurred \nin tandem. Congress must not abrogate its responsibility to seriously \ntackle the oversight issue. As 9/11 Commissioner Lehman said, it is \nlike one hand clapping, if you only do the executive branch this year. \nHopefully we will be able to pursue those initiatives shortly as well.\n  In the final analysis, it is apparent to me that the intelligence \nstructure put in place over 50 years ago was one that focused primarily \non developing intelligence to counter a military threat that is no \nlonger sufficient for confronting the asymmetrical threats we are now \nconfronting in the 21st century--a century in which our enemies no \nlonger make distinctions between our battlefields and our backyards.\n  So, therefore, we must develop a lighter and more agile intelligence \ncapability that can keep pace with the kind of enemy we are now \nfighting--one that is elusive, one that does not need a large land-\nbased military capability to bring the fight to us.\n\n  This legislation will bring America the agility we require, the \nability to reform our intelligence apparatus into an adaptable \norganization prepared to anticipate and prepare for future threats.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague again, the Senator from \nMaine, who I congratulate again for bringing this most timely, this \nmost forthright, comprehensive, very sound framework for intelligence \nreform and working with them on the issues I might propose with my \nrefinements and enhancements to the underlying bill.\n  I hope in due course of this week or the following week, however long \nit takes before we adjourn, to complete this process, to pass this \nlegislation, not only in the Senate but the overall Congress, so the \nPresident can sign this legislation because clearly it must be done \nforthwith. This is something the American people and the future of this \nNation deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I congratulate the senior Senator from \nMaine for her comments and her work on this issue. As a member of the \nIntelligence Committee she has understood very early the need for \nsignificant intelligence reform. The provisions included in the \nCollins-Lieberman bill that created an inspector general for the new \nnational intelligence authority are the direct result of the \nlegislation sponsored by the senior Senator from Maine.\n  I thank the Senator for her expertise and her leadership.
