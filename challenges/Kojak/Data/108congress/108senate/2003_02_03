Res. 41) honoring the mission of the space \n     shuttle Columbia.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 41) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 41\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate commemorates with deep sorrow and \n     regret the fate of the Columbia space shuttle mission and \n     when it adjourns today, it do so as a further mark of respect \n     to the astronauts who lost their lives.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, initially we planned to come in for a pro \nforma session today and not have further remarks made. But in light of \nthe great national tragedy, a time when all of our thoughts in this \nbody and of all Americans converge on the families and the loved ones \nof the Columbia crew members, both the Democratic leader and I would \nlike to take just a couple minutes to make a statement. Then we will be \nadjourning at that point.\n  I join all Americans in expressing our deepest sympathy for the \nevents that have occurred and extend our deepest sympathy to the \nfamilies of the crew members, and want to take this opportunity to \nsalute the courage of the crew.\n  The events of 2 days ago have caused all of us to go back and look \ninto both our own lives but also the lives of other great explorers who \nso willingly have taken the risk with that ultimate goal of making the \nworld a better place. Indeed, the heroes that we all celebrate in terms \nof their lives, of which we have been reviewing over the last 24 hours, \nare very much the focus of not just us in this body but, indeed, the \nworld.\n  Each Columbia crew member was a pioneer. They would want us to \nrecognize their sacrifices through our comments and through our review \nof their lives and through our comforting of their families. But I also \nknow they would want us to determine the cause of this tragedy, to fix \nwhat caused it, and then to move on in that same spirit of exploration.\n  I, in closing, do extend my own personal sympathy and the sympathy of \nthis body to those families, and to those great pioneers and heroes of \nthe American spirit.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader in expressing, \nas he has, our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the astronauts, to \nNASA, to the people of Israel, and to all of those responsible as we \ncontemplate the tragic loss.\n  There is no way one can adequately express in words the sense of \nsorrow, of regret that we would like to be able to convey to the \nfamilies themselves. But as they contemplate these losses, we wish them \ngreat strength, strength in knowing that their loved ones committed \nthemselves to a great cause, and, in so doing, created the path to a \nfuture that we will continue to celebrate.\n  Neil Armstrong, when he landed on the moon, made note of that fact \nthat it was: One small step for man, one giant step for mankind. I \nbelieve these astronauts made one giant step for mankind--in better \nrelations, in finding ways with which to pursue science so \nsuccessfully; and, in so doing, it has created their footprints not \nonly in the path once begun by the pioneers, such as Neil Armstrong, \nbut that of future astronauts as well who will carry on\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\nthis great experiment in space recognizing its importance to all of \nmankind.\n  So as we contemplate this loss, we celebrate their lives, we \ncelebrate their accomplishments, we celebrate the fact that they gave \nall they could for their country.\n  At times such as this, the word ``hero'' is appropriate. Indeed, they \nwere just that; they were and are heroes, role models, committed \nAmericans, patriots, and pioneers.\n  We thank them. We applaud their accomplishment. And we wish their \nfamilies Godspeed during this difficult time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/03/senate-section/article/S1846-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
