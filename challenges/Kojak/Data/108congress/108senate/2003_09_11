Before we begin, on behalf of myself, the Democrat leader, \nand all of my colleagues, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for \nits consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 224) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the second anniversary of the terrorist attacks \n     against the United States on September 11, 2001:\n\n                              S. Res. 224\n\n       Whereas on the morning of September 11, 2001, terrorists \n     hijacked and destroyed four civilian aircraft, crashing two \n     of them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New \n     York City, and a third into the Pentagon in Arlington, \n     Virginia;\n       Whereas the valor of the passengers and crew on the fourth \n     aircraft, which crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, \n     prevented it from also being used as a weapon against \n     America;\n       Whereas thousands were killed and injured as a result of \n     these attacks, including the passengers and crew of the four \n     aircraft, workers in the World Trade Center and in the \n     Pentagon, rescue workers, and bystanders;\n       Whereas September 11, 2001 stands as the deadliest \n     terrorist attacks ever perpetrated against the United States;\n       Whereas by targeting symbols of American strength and \n     success, these attacks were intended to assail the \n     principles, values, and freedoms of the United States and the \n     American people, to intimidate the Nation and all who stand \n     with us, to weaken the national resolve; and bend our will to \n     their grotesque cause;\n       Whereas in the darkest moments after the attacks, American \n     men and women demonstrated extraordinary courage and \n     compassion;\n       Whereas local, State, and Federal leaders set aside \n     differences and worked together to provide for those who were \n     attacked and to protect those who remained;\n       Whereas nations around the world provided material support \n     and moral support to the United States as it recovered from \n     the terrorist attacks; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate--\n       (1) recognizes September 11 as both a day to remember those \n     taken so suddenly and so ruthlessly, and a day for Americans \n     to recommit themselves to our great national purpose;\n       (2) extends its deepest sympathies to the countless \n     innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, their families, friends, and loved ones;\n       (3) honors the heroic actions of first responders, law \n     enforcement personnel, State and local officials, volunteers, \n     and others who aided the innocent victims and, in so doing, \n     bravely risked their own lives and long-term health;\n       (4) extends its deepest gratitude to the members of the \n     Armed Forces serving both at home and abroad who are \n     defending the United States from future attack;\n       (5) praises the people of the United States for their \n     patriotism, compassion, prayers,\n\n[[Page S11366]]\n\n     and generosity in donating time and money to support the \n     innocent victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks, their families, friends, and loved ones;\n       (6) expresses thanks and gratitude to the foreign leaders \n     and citizens of all nations who have assisted and continue to \n     stand in solidarity with the United States against terrorism \n     in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks; and\n       (7) reaffirms that the United States Senate will honor the \n     memory of those who lost their lives as a result of the \n     September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and will act to defend \n     the citizens of the United States in the face of all future \n     challenges.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today we honor the memory of the victims of \nthe September 11 attacks. Many Americans will bow their heads in \nsilence. Many will kneel before the Almighty in prayer. Others will \ntake time from the regular course of their day to reflect in their own \npersonal way upon the terrible events of 2 years ago.\n  Regardless of how we pay tribute to those who perished, we all share \na profound sense of sadness for their families and sincere hope that \nthe wounds of those who still hurt may heal.\n  We press on--we press on--because it is our nature to do so. Life is \na precious gift. As long as God wills us to have it, we have a purpose. \nAnd as long as God wills this Nation to exist, we have the liberty to \nrealize that purpose and make of our lives what we wish.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I will ask the Democratic leader to join \nme at the bell of remembrance for the first moment of silence.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the hour \nof 8:46 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will observe a moment of \nsilence in honor of the victims of the tragedy on September 11, 2001.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is a day to honor the memory of the \nvictims of September 11, 2001. The essence of September 11 was and \nremains apparent to us all. The victims were innocent. They were simply \ngoing about their everyday lives--working at the desk, coming into \nwork, answering the telephones, maybe answering an emergency call, \nchecking on the children to make sure they got off to school, traveling \non business, or possibly on vacation. All had families who loved them \nand all had futures yet to be lived. And now there is emptiness, not \nonly for those 3,000 women and men and children affected on that day \nbut for what they could have and would have become if that event had \nnot occurred.\n  There is little one can do to fill the immense void that is created \nby such a loss. We can remember. We must remember. But even the fondest \nand most vivid memory is but a whisper. Simply nothing--nothing--can \nreplace a loved one's absence from the very special moments in life \nand, above all, the simple everyday pleasures.\n  I recall the story of a woman whose husband was killed in the \ncollapse of the World Trade Center Tower One. In the months after \nSeptember 11, she did what so many of us would understand--she \ncontemplated suicide.\n  She said:\n\n       When I lost my husband, I had no bottom, no basis to get up \n     in the morning. I knew I was going to do something terrible \n     if I didn't define a reason.\n\n  Now she is an advocate for other families who lost loved ones in the \nSeptember 11 attacks. She has found not only new strength but she has \nbecome the source of strength for others.\n  In a recent interview, she said:\n\n       The best legacy for all of the people who died is that \n     something better comes out of all of this, even with the \n     pain.\n\n  The crumbling of the World Trade Center's towers into a massive cloud \nof black dust still haunts us. The explosive thunder of a plane \nslamming into the side of the Pentagon still haunts us. The image of a \ncrater filled with the debris of embattled flight 93 in Shanksville, \nPA, still haunts us.\n  All of these, and other horrific memories, will continue to haunt us \nfor decades to come. They have become an inescapable part of our \nnational conscience. But so must be the love, so must be the charity, \nso must be the caring, so must be the compassion, so must be the unity, \nand so must be the grace that poured and continues to pour from the \nAmerican people in the aftermath of September 11.\n  Remember the thousands of volunteers who rushed into lower Manhattan \nfrom all across America to help with those rescue and recovery efforts? \nRemember when we gathered just several yards from here on the steps of \nthe Capitol to sing in unity with our colleagues from the House ``God \nbless America''? Remember the flood of letters and drawings \nschoolchildren sent and continue to send out of feelings and out of \nsympathy for the victims, out of love and patriotism for their country?\n  I brought with me this picture drawn by Sara Deatherage who is a \nthird grader from Knoxville, TN. She wrote:\n\n       I chose the American Flag because I love America.\n\n  Those of us who have the opportunity to serve in public office \nreceived scores, hundreds, thousands, and continue to receive scores, \nhundreds, and thousands of these signs, these signals of patriotism.\n  Did September 11 change our lives and the course of our Nation \nforever? It, of course, did. It most assuredly did, and it did it in a \nhorrific and still painful way. But it also brought forth the very best \nin the American people--an abundance of kindness, an abundance of \ncaring, an abundance of compassion that is really unparalleled in our \nhistory.\n  So let us fittingly and appropriately honor the memory of the victims \nof the September 11 attacks. Let us, again, express our deepest regrets \nto the families who lost loved ones. But let us also hew from the pain \nof that horrific day, September 11, 2001, a lasting and a better \nAmerica.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last night, family members and friends of \nthose who perished in the World Trade Center held a candlelight vigil \nat Ground Zero, creating what they called a ``circle of hope'' around \nthat hallowed ground. Tonight, twin towers of lights will stretch once \nagain from the ruins of the Trade Center up to the heavens. In a few \nmoments, here in the U.S. Senate, we will observe the first of four \nmoments of silence marking the exact moments, 2 years ago today, that \nthe four hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center, the \nPentagon, and that lonely field in Shanksville.\n  Later this afternoon, a new playground will open at Leckie Elementary \nSchool, here in the Nation's capital--a memorial to three bright sixth-\ngraders from Washington, D.C. and four district teachers--all lost when \nAmerican Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. This evening, in \nMitchell, SD, people will gather to honor the firefighters and other \nemergency workers who perished on September 11, and those who toiled in \nthe rubble for months after the attacks to try to bring order out of \nchaos. In countless other ways, in communities across our Nation and \nthroughout the world--in churches, parks, town halls, and in the \nprivacy of their own thoughts--people will pause to remember, to mourn \nand to honor the victims, the survivors and the heroes of September 11.\n  Two years later, the enormity of the tragedy remains nearly \nincomprehensible. Just 3 days ago, a vial holding the blood of a young \nBrooklyn firefighter who died at Ground Zero was placed in a coffin, \nalong with his uniform, at a Mass, making him the last of the 343 \nfirefighters killed at the World Trade Center to receive a memorial. A \nyear ago, on the first anniversary of September 11, the names of all \nthose who died at the World Trade Center were read aloud. It took 2\\1/\n2\\ hours just to recite the names. First on the list was Gordy Aamoth, \na 32-year-old investment banker who grew up in Minneapolis and always \nknew that he wanted to work on Wall Street. The last name on the list \nbelonged to Igor Zukelman, a 29-year-old naturalized American who moved \nto this country from the Ukraine. The day he became an American, he \ncalled his mother and told her, ``You can congratulate me now, I'm a \ncitizen.'' The terrorists of September 11 meant to strike at the heart \nof America. Yet their crime was more than an attack on America. It was \nan attack against humanity. Ninety-one nations lost citizens in the \nattack on the World Trade Center. Today, we remember and honor all of \nthem.\n\n[[Page S11367]]\n\n  We also pray for those who were injured, especially the many who \nstill suffer, and for the families and friends who lost loved ones, \nparticularly the children who lost parents. We pray for ourselves and \nour Nation, that we may seek justice for the victims of September 11 \nwith wisdom. And we are also filled today with an abiding sense of \ngratitude for the heroes of September 11, especially the courageous \nfirefighters and other rescue workers. In the countless acts of heroism \nand compassion, they inspired a stunned and wounded nation and showed \nus how to go on.\n  This morning, the sky bears an eerie and almost disconcerting \nresemblance to that cloudless blue sky on this morning 24 months ago. \nPilots have a term for visibility conditions like that. They call it \n``severe clear.'' In our memories, we all see with severe clarity the \nhorrific images of September 11. Today and always, let us strive to \nremember, with equal clarity, the many acts of sacrifice and compassion \nwe witnessed that day. Let us remember the unshakable unity we felt as \na nation in the aftermath of that terrible day. Even more than that, \nlet us resolve to continue to demonstrate that same commitment to our \nnation and to each other as we saw that day. In that way, we can defy \nthe terrorists. We can honor those we lost. And we can keep their \nspirits alive.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will observe a moment of \nsilence.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on this day, 2003, September 11, we \nremember the horrific events of September 11, 2001. We mourn the \nvictims. We pray with the families who lost loved ones and we focus on \nredoubling our efforts to make sure that September 11, 2001, never \noccurs again, and to redouble our efforts to fight terrorism.\n  We all recall the horrors of watching those planes crash into the \ntrade centers, the plane which crashed into the Pentagon, and then the \nplane which struck my State, Pennsylvania, going down in Shanksville, \nSomerset County, a rural setting. No one will ever know for sure \nwhether the plane which went down in Shanksville, PA, was headed for \nthis Capitol. My own personal view is that it was, and this Capitol was \nspared because of the heroic efforts of the passengers who took matters \ninto their own hands and saw to it that the terrorists were overwhelmed \nand the plane crashed.\n  We remember those who perished and we console, to the extent we can, \nthe families and loved ones of those who perished. On this day, we \nought to focus on our responsibilities as Members of Congress to see to \nit that we do not have a repetition of 9/11. In my view, had we put all \nof the dots on the so-called board we might well have prevented \nSeptember 11. Whether that is so or not, we ought to be absolutely sure \nthat our intelligence agencies are working coordinately to do their \nutmost to prevent any recurrence.\n  Then there is the fight against al-Qaida. I believe we are waging a \nsuccessful worldwide fight in attacking al-Qaida and in bringing key \noperatives to justice. I believe the time is not too far away when we \nwill find Osama bin Laden. As President Bush said, he will bring Osama \nbin Laden to justice or bring justice to Osama bin Laden.\n  There is more we can do to fight terrorism, where Americans are still \nbeing killed--for example, in Israel by Hamas. We ought to reintensify \nour efforts to bring back the Palestinian terrorists to the United \nStates and try them in our courts since we have an extraterritorial \njurisdiction to do so, and to impose the death penalty.\n  These are only a few of the thoughts which ought to be focused upon \ntoday as we pay solemn tribute to the victims of September 11 and \ndedicate ourselves to fighting terrorism and to prevent any further \nrecurrence in the future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I was struck when we took this moment of \nsilence to remember the second plane slamming into the World Trade \nCenter. Thinking back to that day and recalling the events when the \nfirst plane crashed, there was confusion and no one knew what was going \non. No one understood. It was an accident. Who knows. But with the \nsecond plane came understanding. We knew this was not a plane that got \noff course, an accident, but there was a stunning realization that the \nworld had changed. It was that second crash.\n  In the next half hour now, there will be another moment of silence, \nand then another roughly a half hour after that. Within that hour's \ntime of that realization, America mobilized. America did not fall back \non its heels. We obviously saw the response of the firefighters and the \npolice, of the average citizen in New York. We quickly would see that \nreaction at the Pentagon. Then we will have forever etched in our minds \nthe realization that came over the passengers of flight 93 that America \nwas under attack and they were in a position to do something about it.\n  They did not hesitate. They were ordinary people, as all of the \nheroes of September 11 were, ordinary people who did not sign up to \nfight a war, who did not even know until the moment they were pressed \ninto service that a war was about to happen. Virtually without \nhesitation, at the moment they realized that what they loved so much, \nso much that they without flinching were willing to commit everything--\neverything, to a mission for which the only preparation was living in \nthis country, was experiencing the freedom, was recognizing the \nprivilege of being in America. And that privilege, that honor, and that \nfreedom were worth that sacrifice.\n\n  That is what they had been taught in their history courses. But more \nimportant, that is what they had seen in their common, ordinary \nAmerican experience: That which we cherish so dearly in this country is \nworth sacrifice; if, by some odd set of circumstances, you are placed \nin a position to respond to protect that freedom, that you have an \nobligation to do so.\n  That is really remarkable. It is really remarkable to think of these \nordinary people, as Senator Frist said, going about their jobs, \ntraveling on a plane, going on a vacation, riding to work, sitting in \ntheir offices answering the phone, responding to an emergency call--\ngoing about their typical American lives--that within an instant they \nwere able to put on the armor of defending this country.\n  We are a blessed nation, and the people who represented us that day, \nthe heroes that day, we can thankfully say were like us. That is the \ngreat pride I think all of us can take from the events of that day \nbecause they were not any different from the rest of us, and these \nordinary people did extraordinary things to protect us.\n  God bless them. We thank them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think the words of the two leaders \nof the Senate and the two Senators from Pennsylvania have been poignant \nreminders of the day, 2 years ago, that rained terror on our country, \nand the different perspectives, just like the different perspectives \nall over our country, about that tragedy.\n  This morning, the Senators who had constituents who were most \naffected in their States will have priority, speaking on the floor of \nthe Senate, to talk about the effect on their constituents and their \nStates, so the two Senators from Pennsylvania started our day of \nremembrance in a beautiful way.\n  It is one of those days that you will always remember where you were \nand what you were doing. When the bell rang at 9:03, I remembered \nvividly that I was in my office, getting ready to go into a meeting. \nSomeone told me there had been a plane going into one of the World \nTrade Center towers, so I turned on the television thinking it must be \na pilot in trouble, maybe a small plane, maybe even a pilot in training \nmakes a mistake. And as I watched the recap, I saw the second plane hit \nthe tower, and the realization just chilled me to the bone because it \nwas clear this was intended, which means, of course, that it was a \nterrorist.\n  But even in that horrible moment of realization, none of us ever \nexpected that those two towers would eventually crumble under the heat \nof the fire. None of us would have anticipated the next 5 hours of \nhorror and then, in the thousands of hours following, what\n\n[[Page S11368]]\n\nwould happen to our country, because in fact 9/11/2001 will forever \nrecall the worst that could happen to our country but, also, the best. \nThe stories of hope and heroism that emerged from the rubble of Ground \nZero, the Pentagon, and that Pennsylvania field continue to serve as \nreminders of all that is good and true in the human spirit.\n\n  Mr. President, 9/11 evoked the pride and patriotism we felt as \npolice, firefighters, and airplane passengers gave their lives to save \ncountless others. It inspires us. It drives us. And it continues to \nguide our actions today.\n  Our Nation is embroiled right now in a global war on terror, starting \nwith 9/11/2001. We are fighting to ensure that no such attack is again \nvisited on us or any other nation. This war is a direct, decisive \nresponse to the attacks that murdered nearly 3,000 innocent people 2 \nyears ago today.\n  Our mission is clear. We must choke the life out of the terrorist \nnetworks that seek to promote extremism and derail democracy. We have \ntaken the battle to the mountains of Afghanistan, the sand dunes of \nIraq, and to Main Streets in the United States of America and abroad \nwhere terrorists have burrowed in. We know we must destroy them where \nthey breed their hatred before they ever again visit terror on our \nhomeland.\n  Today, Iraq is the central front in that war. It is in that country \nwhere the enemies of freedom are making their stand. They have \ncongregated in Iraq to thwart our efforts to bring a taste of democracy \nto an oppressed and battered people. They think they can shake the will \nof the civilized world. They are mistaken. Once again they have \nunderestimated the American people and our allies.\n  Last month, I visited with our men and women in uniform who are on \nthe front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan. Day in and day out, they \nbattle the enemies of freedom. Danger lurks around every corner, but \nfor every ambush and every threat they face, they also see the liberty \nthat is beginning to take root. They see the hope they are bringing to \nthe Iraqi people.\n\n  Our soldiers are committed, determined, and proud. Our country has \ncalled them to duty, and they have bravely answered the call. And they \nknow their daily sacrifices are helping to build a safer world and a \nsafer America--an America that is free of tyrants and terrorists. They \ndeserve our unwavering support.\n  As Congress contemplates the cost of our efforts on the war on \nterror, we must not be shortsighted. The financial cost of 9/11 has \nbeen estimated at a staggering $300 billion. But that pales in \ncomparison to the immeasurable toll of human lives lost that day. This \nwar, our just response to 9/11, has not and will not be fought on a \nshoestring budget. Failure is not an option. Success in rebuilding Iraq \nand Afghanistan is essential to eliminate terrorism and the threat it \nposes to our freedom and our way of life.\n  We cannot do it alone. The nations of the world must join this fight. \nTheir support financially and militarily is critical to eradicating \nterrorism from our society. This is not an American war. We have led \nthe charge, but the cause of liberty does not benefit us alone. I am \ncommitted to working with my colleagues and the President to get the \nnecessary funding up front and secure contributions from other \ncountries that benefit from the campaign to root out terrorism.\n  The victims of 9/11 from 86 nations around the world deserve no less.\n  Today, as we honor the memory of those lost on September 11, know \nthat our Nation is indeed more secure. Our vulnerability was exposed, \nbut we responded with a steely resolve that has made us stronger, \nricher, and better. We will never be the same. But the Americans we \nhave become will be the shining example of liberty and democracy for \nall the world to see.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the terrorists who attacked us 2 years \nago were not only lashing out at people and buildings, they were \nattacking who we are as Americans. And since that day we have had an \nextraordinary amount of attention paid in this country to just that \nquestion. I know in my Senate campaign when I said I thought it was \ntime to put the teaching of American history and civics back in its \nrightful place in our schools so our children could grow up learning \nwhat it is to be an American, people responded to that. There was a \nhunger for thinking more about what makes this country special. Why \nwere we attacked? What were the terrorists attacking?\n  There are many ways to remind ourselves of what it means to be an \nAmerican. One way is discussions like this. One is the speeches of our \nPresident, who has done a beautiful job of that. But another way is our \nschools.\n  The late Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of \nTeachers, once was asked: What is the rationale for a public school? \nMr. Shanker's answer was that public schools were created--the common \nschool--to teach the three R's, and what it means to be an American to \nimmigrant children with the hope they would go home and teach their \nparents.\n  Earlier this year, this body, by a vote of 90 to 0, passed a piece of \nlegislation to create Presidential academies for teachers and students \nof American history and civics. I know that across America last night \nthere were thousands of teachers who were thinking about this morning \nand what would they say to their students today about what happened 2 \nyears ago.\n  If I were teaching today in school in America, these are four or five \nof the questions that I would ask my students.\n  I would ask them: Is 9/11 the worst thing that ever happened to the \nUnited States? Of course, the answer to that is no. It helps to know \nAmerican history to answer the question.\n  Many of the Pilgrims died in the first winter. Soldiers walked \nbarefooted across the Delaware River in our Revolutionary War. African \nslaves were thrown into the bellies of slave ships and brought in the \nmost horrible conditions to this country. Those were really bad things. \nThe Civil War saw families killing one another. Our World Wars say \nmillions killed. Twenty percent of Americans stood in line for a job in \nthe 1930s.\n  When I was a boy in our hometown in eastern Tennessee, we had an \nairbase nearby with jets there to defend us from missile attacks which \ncould be launched by the Soviet Union, and those missiles could arrive \nin 45 minutes.\n  So 9/11 wasn't the worst thing that ever happened to the U.S. It was \na terrible, challenging thing. It was a tragic thing, but we can \nrecover from it. The fact that we have done what we have over the last \n2 years reminds us of that.\n  I would ask my students today: What makes America exceptional?\n  I taught a course in American character at Harvard University during \nthe last couple of years. I began the course by asking the student to \nlist 100 ways our country is exceptional. They are not all good. We \nlock up more people in prison than any other country. We have more \ndivorces and broken families. But many of the things are \nextraordinarily good. That has been recognized all throughout our \nhistory.\n\n  One of the greatest--perhaps the greatest--is the fact that we have \ntaken all of this variety and diversity and turned it into one country. \nNo other country is able to do that. Diversity is magnificent. But \nJerusalem is diverse. What is different about the United States of \nAmerica is that we have united all of that diversity into one country.\n  That needs to be taught as well.\n  I would ask my students: Why is it if you move to Japan or France, \nyou cannot become Japanese or French; but if you come to the United \nStates and want to be a citizen you have to become an American? It is \nbecause our identity is not based on our race or ethnicity or religion \nor background.\n  The historian, Richard Hofstadter, wrote: ``It is our fate as a \nnation not to have ideologies, but to be one.''\n  I would ask our students: What are the principles that unite us as a \ncountry? If it is not our race, and if it is not our religion, what is \nit? E pluribus unum, equal opportunity and liberty usually comes first; \nindividualism, rule of law, free exercise of religion, no state church, \nlaissez faire, and a belief in progress.\n  Someone needs to teach these principles. Our schools can do it.\n  We agree on these principles.\n  I would ask our students: Why, if you were watching C-SPAN last \nnight, were\n\n[[Page S11369]]\n\nSenators arguing so much with each other? Why wasn't it unanimous?\n  It is because most of our politics is about applying principles we \nagree on in ways that conflict. We believe, for example, in God we \ntrust. But on the other hand, we don't trust government with God. We \nhave an argument when we put Federal money into faith-based \ninstitutions.\n  I would suggest that the schools across America might consider an \nidea called ``Pledge Plus Three.'' Why not start each school day with \nthe Pledge of Allegiance, as we do in the Senate, followed by a teacher \nor student sharing for 3 minutes their own idea about what it means to \nbe an American?\n  In the course I taught at Harvard, the student who best understood \nAmerican identity was the student from the Ukraine. She had the best \nidea about what it meant to be an American.\n  Finally, I would invite those students in my class today to go with \nme down to the Federal courthouse--say in Nashville, but it could be in \nany city in America where there is a Federal court--and watch, as I did \n2 years ago, 77 students from all over the world raise their right hand \nand take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States. It is quite a \nweighty thing to see them say that they ``absolutely and entirely \nrenounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, \npotentate, state, or sovereignty.'' That is the first part of the oath.\n  It reminds us who we are as Americans.\n  September 11 was a tragic day, but it brought out the best in us. One \nof the great lessons is that it helps us remember to teach one another \nwhat is exceptional about our country, and what it means to be an \nAmerican.\n  Thank you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today we mark the second anniversary of one \nof the darkest days in our Nation's history from the initial attack on \nthe Twin Towers and the Pentagon, to the forced plane crash in \nPennsylvania. Each moment of September 11, 2001, is forever etched on \nour minds.\n  Although our wounds are still too fresh for us to view the date from \nthe perspective of history, the last 2 years have given it a certain \ndistance.\n  When terrorists attacked the symbols of our Nation's unity and \nstrength, they failed to realize that they are just symbols of our \nstrengths. The real strength of our Nation comes from our people--not \nour buildings. By attacking us on our own soil, they served not to \nweaken but to strengthen our resolve that this and other acts of terror \nwould not stand, and we would answer with great and awesome strength.\n  On this September 11, 2 years after, we remember those who died on \nthose three battlefields, as well as the brave soldiers from Wyoming \nand across the Nation who have given their lives since then to end the \nthreat of terrorism wherever it is found.\n  We will all continue to remember September 11 in our own way. Some \nwill join family and friends at public memorials to pray for peace. \nOthers will honor this day by remembering it in the silence of their \nhearts. However we remember this fateful day, we will never forget the \nlessons learned and their terrible cost. For me, it was the realization \nthat we are truly one nation, under God, indivisible, and that we must \nremain so in the face of any threat to ensure our country remains \nstrong, united, and free.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there are moments in our lives in the \nSenate that we shall never forget. This morning is one I am privileged \nto share with my beloved colleagues in this Chamber on both sides of \nthe aisle a few moments to draw from our hearts and from our memory and \nreflect upon September 11, 2 years ago.\n  We were here that day, prepared to go into our regular routine, when \nwe were told to evacuate. We did that in an orderly and calm way. \nWherever we could gather, we tried to follow the situation as best we \ncould.\n  Several hours later, after the plane had crashed into the Department \nof Defense, I called the Secretary of Defense. I spent over 5 years of \nmy life in that building. I wanted to come over and join him and the \nmen and women in uniform of our country to do what little I might be \nable to do to bring about a reassurance not only to those on site at \nthe Pentagon but around the world. I did that, joining the Secretary \nand then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Shelton, in the command \nand control center deep into the basement of the Pentagon. We talked to \nthe President on two occasions. I remember so well he had a firm hand \non the situation, as did those in the Department of Defense.\n  We observed firemen, policemen, Red Cross workers and all doing the \nbest they could to remove the bodies and care for the wounded. Military \nand civilian alike in that building showed extraordinary heroism that \nday. I was deeply humbled to stand there and observe that.\n  Later, the Secretary and the Chairman of the JCS went in to address a \nvery large gathering of press. As they concluded their remarks, they \ninvited me to say a word. I had nothing prepared but simply spoke from \nthe heart. As I go back over the written text of what I said, I am \nreminded of how this has come true.\n\n  I said:\n\n       This is indeed the most tragic hour in American history, \n     and yet I think it can be its finest hour, as our President \n     and those with him, most notably our Secretary of Defense, \n     our Chairman, and the men and women of the Armed Forces all \n     over the world stand ready not only to defend this Nation and \n     our allies against further attack but to take such actions as \n     directed in the future in retaliation for this terrorist \n     act--a series of terrorist acts, unprecedented in world \n     history.\n       We call upon the entire world to step up and help, because \n     terrorism is a common enemy to all, and we're in it all \n     together. The United States has borne the brunt, but who can \n     be next? Step forward and let us hold accountable and punish \n     those who have perpetrated this attack.\n\n  I believe those words have proven to be true. Certainly great \nleadership from our President and the men and women of the Armed \nForces, indeed, the world, has gathered to join us on the battlefields \nof Afghanistan, where I and many Members have visited, as well as the \nbattlefields of Iraq where just weeks ago I accompanied Members of this \nChamber to be with our men and women of the Armed Forces.\n  Our Nation stands tall. It has been and will continue to be our \nfinest hour.\n  Now, Mr. President, we observe a moment of silence in reverence for \nthose men and women, civilian and military, who lost their lives at the \nDepartment of Defense in the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the hour \nof 9:38 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will observe a moment of \nsilence in honor of the victims of the tragedy on September 11, 2001.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I at this time yield the floor to my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Allen.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call attention to the fact that I \nhave been on the floor waiting. I will follow the instructions of the \nChair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Virginia had the floor.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, for yielding.\n  I wish to share my views, my sentiments 2 years after these events. \nThe fact is, we are 2 years exactly to the minute after American \nAirlines flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.\n  I keep the remembrance with me of Captain Chic Burlingame, who was \nthe captain, who fought the terrorists on that plane. I think of him. I \nthink of the passengers. One of the passengers was the father of a \nyoung boy who lived in our neighborhood and played with our kids.\n  This is a tragic and vile act that hit the World Trade Center, that \nhit Virginia at the Pentagon, 2 years ago to this moment. Also, at this \nvery time, there was another plane coming from the north that was \nundoubtedly going\n\n[[Page S11370]]\n\nto be hitting either this Capitol Building right here, maybe the CIA, \nmaybe the White House, and there was great bravery on that plane to \navert further loss of life.\n  I heard my good colleague, Senator Warner, who has had such a life \nexperience in a variety of conflicts, and everyone was talking about, \nHow does this fit into history? When he says this is a moment, dire \nmoment in our history, it means a great deal. It struck us all that \nthis was like Pearl Harbor; and it was. Pearl Harbor brought the United \nStates into World War II. The attacks on New York City, on the World \nTrade Center, on the Pentagon in Virginia brought the United States of \nAmerica into the War on Terrorism.\n  We reflect back on these fresh memories, but it has been a long 2 \nyears. We reflect back on the bravery, on the courageousness, and on \nwhat has transpired. We work to make sure we are more secure here at \nhome as well as abroad.\n  If you look at the legislation we have passed in this body for the \nlast 2 years, on issue after issue, we have worked to make Americans \nmore secure, whether it is port security, whether it is securing \ngreater communications in the DC area, with the Northern Virginia \ncommunities and Maryland and DC working together so the first \nresponders have better communication, as they position themselves in a \nsituation that hopefully will never occur again, such as at the \nPentagon.\n  We worry about procurement matters and making sure the technologies \nthat are available in the private sector are made available and \nutilized by our Federal and State and local agencies to analyze the \nvolumes of data.\n  We care about our port security. We care about our pilots. We care \nabout our airports, Metro, and so forth. All of those things do matter.\n  Indeed, in this war we, of course, appreciate things we once took for \ngranted on September 10, 2001, the concepts that have propelled this \ncountry, of individual rights, of life, of a strong national defense to \nmeet the ever-changing dangerous world threats.\n  We have appreciated them now more than ever. And it is not just in \nNew York City and in this area, but everywhere. You can be in \nIndependence, VA, you can be in Jackson, WY, you can be in Sioux City, \nIA, and you know people appreciate the firefighters, volunteer \nfirefighters, rescue squad people, because of the inspiration of those \nnot just at the Pentagon but particularly the thousands who went in to \nsave thousands of lives in New York City.\n  In fact, you see the letters ``NYPD'' or ``NYFD,'' and that means \nsomething to everyone, no matter where you are in the country, for \nthose courageous acts.\n  It does remind me of what the Bible tells us, that:\n\n       Greater love hath no man than this, that he would lay down \n     his life for his friends.\n\n  That is what those firefighters and rescue personnel were doing in \nNew York City in those Twin Towers. That is why there is an \nappreciation for those wonderful people whom we salute and remember \ntoday and forever with their bravery. Those acts of heroism are always \non our minds.\n  We have made our country more secure. We are taking the war to the \nterrorists abroad. We still have work to do. We have to persevere in \nmany ways in securing and sustaining our country.\n  We have also seen in the days following September 11, 2001, a \nredefinition of this country and a respect for what makes this country \ngreat while we also track down the terrorists.\n  We also are a compassionate country, caring for the families who lost \nloved ones in these tragic attacks. Here on the Senate floor, Louise \nKurtz is an individual whom I have brought up. Senator Warner brought \nup those working at the Pentagon.\n  Louise Kurtz is a woman from the Fredricksburg area of Virginia. She \nwas severely burned. Her ears were burned off. Most of her fingers were \nburned off. Last year at this time we were at the Phoenix Project of \nthe rebuilding of the Pentagon. She was there. She is recuperating. She \nwants to get back to work. Because of Federal laws, though, she gets \ndiminished retirement benefits.\n  So working with Kay James at the Office of Personnel Management, we \ncrafted a bill last year. The Senate passed it. The House didn't take \nit up. We passed it again this year, with the help of my colleague, \nSenator Warner, and particularly Senator Collins of Maine. We passed it \nagain, and I am happy to say, finally, the House took it up yesterday \nand passed that bill to help out folks like Louise Kurtz and others who \nare serving our country. If they are injured in the line of duty, while \nthey are recuperating they should not have their retirement benefits \ndiminished. I am hopeful some time today this measure will get to the \nPresident's desk, to get it finally acted upon in a way that, on the \nsecond anniversary, those brave civilians will be properly treated.\n  More importantly, the thing that has really inspired, I think, all \nAmericans is the great American spirit that has guided our Nation \nthrough this time of terror and tragedy. We now, of course, are so \nappreciative of the men and women in uniform who are in dangerous, \nprecarious places in Iraq and Afghanistan taking the war for our \nsecurity to the terrorists overseas.\n  We are grateful for those who are active, those who are in the Guard, \nthose who are in the Reserve, and their families and their employers \nback here at home, who are all patriots, as they send their sons and \ntheir daughters abroad to protect us.\n  One of Virginia's most prominent sons, George Washington, our \nNation's first President, knew the strength of America's spirit and \nordered his Army to be encouraged by saying:\n\n       Let us therefore rely upon the goodness of the Cause, and \n     the aid of the supreme Being, in whose hands Victory is; to \n     animate and encourage us to great and noble actions.\n\n  We saw great and noble actions on September 11, 2001, and we have \nseen great and noble actions over the past two years.\n  We must be mindful, appreciative, and grateful for those patriots who \nlost their lives on September 11, 2001, and we must be equally grateful \nand appreciative for those who are serving us now.\n  So I thank my colleague, Senator Warner, for his sage and steady \nadvice. We have worked together. This is a day that actually brings all \nAmericans together, regardless of which region, which State, or which \npolitical party you come from, in remembering what is good and \nwholesome about this country and uniting us for the benefit of the \npeople.\n  As we remember those whom we lost on September 11, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in saluting those heroes, the family members, and \nthe survivors who remain. And let us be encouraged, as was President \nWashington, to higher goals, ``to animate and encourage us to great and \nnoble actions.''\n  Let's be encouraged to those greater actions because we will always \nremember, and we will always stand strong for freedom. Because together \nwe must make sure liberty and justice not only endure but prevail.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. How \nprivileged, how humble we are to stand here in these 200-plus years of \nthis Senate, and to be here on behalf of the people of the Commonwealth \nof Virginia. It is a great privilege.\n  I thank my colleague and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues from Virginia \nfor their comments and for the recall of their memories regarding that \nterrible day.\n  Today we commemorate the second anniversary of the terrorist attacks \nwe now refer to as 9/11. It is a day heavy with sadness for me \npersonally. Before I became a Senator, I was a commissioner on the Port \nAuthority of New York and New Jersey, and had offices on the 67th floor \nin the Trade Tower. The Port Authority lost 84 of its people on 9/11, \nincluding 37 brave police officers who gave their lives as they tried \nto save the lives of others.\n  Fifty-one of those Port Authority employees lived in the State of New \nJersey. I knew many Port Authority employees and others who died on \nthis date 2 years ago. And I know many more families who lost a loved \none. One of my oldest daughter's dearest friends perished that day. \nThey had worked together on Wall Street before she went\n\n[[Page S11371]]\n\nto Cantor Fitzgerald. That firm lost nearly 700 people out of the 1,000 \nwho worked for it on the morning of 9/11. The husband of my daughter's \nfriend searched hospitals for 3 weeks looking for a sign that perhaps \nhis wife had escaped death in that terrible calamity.\n  Because of its proximity to New York, my home State of New Jersey \nsuffered catastrophically. Of the 3,025 innocent people who lost their \nlives on 9/11, nearly a quarter of them--700 in all--came from my home \nState.\n  Thirty-seven of them came from a single town, Middletown, NJ. \nYesterday, a 2-acre memorial garden next to the train station was \ndedicated in a private ceremony for the victims' families.\n  The author Gail Sheehy just published a book entitled ``Middletown, \nAmerica: One Town's Passage from Trauma to Hope.'' For the past 2 \nyears, she has followed the lives of survivors and widows, of parents \nwho lost children and children who lost parents. She has spoken with \nthe town's religious leaders, with mental health professionals, and \nothers in the community. I have not had a chance yet to read her book, \nbut it is described as a wonderful testament to individual acts of \nheroism and kindness and to the courage and hope and resilience of \npeople who have suffered a terrible loss and grieve but who, somehow, \nare soldiering on.\n  As we remember 9/11, we remember people such as Fire Department \nChaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed by falling debris in the lobby of \nTower 1. Father Judge was the first official casualty at the World \nTrade Center and one of 343 New York City Fire Department casualties.\n  We remember people such as a fellow named Abe Zelmanowitz, a computer \nprogrammer who might have been able to escape from the 27th floor of \nthe north tower, where he worked for Blue Cross/Blue Shield, but he \nrefused to abandon his friend, Ed Beyea, a quadriplegic confined to a \nwheelchair, who could not make it down the stairs. Abe stood by his \nside until the end came.\n  We remember people such as Todd Beamer, Tom Burnett, and Jeremy \nGlick, and the other passengers and crew of United Flight 93, who \ncrashed their airplane in a field near Shanksville, PA, rather than \nallow the hijackers to crash it in Washington--perhaps into this very \nbuilding where we now stand.\n  So 9/11 revealed the very best in people. But, of course, we have to \nremember what caused it also. And that reveals the very worst in \npeople--19 of whom had the insane belief that their suicidal/homicide \nactions would send them straight to paradise.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 did more than that; 9/11 shocked us to our very \ncore. We suffered terrorist attacks before 9/11, including one on the \nWorld Trade Center itself. But not since Pearl Harbor has the \ncollective psyche of our country been so shocked out of its \ncomplacency.\n  The results of that shock are plainly visible. Terrorism has scarred \nAmerica--permanently. People are mourning their loved ones, and they \nwill do that for the rest of their lives. We endure long lines at the \nairports. Washington looks like a fortress. Our civil liberties have \ntaken a beating reminiscent of the Palmer Raids after World War I, \nJapanese-American internment during World War II, and McCarthyism \nduring the Cold War. And tens of thousands of our young men and women \nare in harm's way in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  Mr. President, 9/11 shocked us into learning that our \n``invincibility'' had been pierced. We crave the sense of security we \nenjoyed before 9/11, but deep down we know we are not likely to get it \nback soon.\n  We now know to take our security more seriously. There are terrorists \nwho glory in the maiming and killing of innocent men, women, and \nchildren. They hate everything about us--our families, our country, our \nway of life--so much that they would deprive their own families of \ntheir presence as a beloved son, brother, or father, so they can act on \ntheir murderous desire.\n  9/11 shattered illusions we had about our safety. But being stripped \nof our illusions, we have the opportunity now to forge ahead truly \nknowing that the war against terrorism will be long and tough. We have \nthe opportunity now to forge ahead truly knowing that the struggle here \nat home to preserve our civil liberties, the very things we are \ndefending, will be a challenge.\n  For the better part of the last century, we fought against fascism \nand totalitarianism. I had the privilege of serving in Europe during \nWorld War II. I was so young that I didn't understand the big picture. \nBut I understood very clearly my obligation and my role.\n  When the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union was dissolved, \nmany Americans thought the conflict was over; they thought we had won. \nThat was an illusion. The conflict is not over. It has simply shifted \nto a new front.\n  We now know we are fighting a new enemy--an utterly ruthless enemy--\nthat wants to make our home front the front lines, an enemy that \ndeliberately targets noncombatants, and an enemy that has absolutely no \nsense of propriety or decency while it wages war against innocent \npeople.\n  It is important to fight this enemy without any illusions if we want \nto win. That means no premature declaration of ``mission \naccomplished.'' That means a full accounting of what the cost of the \nwar is going to be. That means an honest acknowledgment of the limits \nof our power and the humility to enlist our allies in our cause.\n  What we experienced on 9/11 is a permanent wound on our society. \nPeople struggling to face the future will never stop mourning the past. \nOur daily lives have been forever altered. But we are survivors. It \ntakes courage to survive. Armed with that courage, we endure the pain \nand look beyond the smoke, rubble, and grief to rebuild--rebuild \nsomething that is stronger than what went before.\n  We will defend ourselves, our country, and our liberties--the things \nthat terrorists despise. Despite the difficulties, despite the \ncasualties, despite the setbacks that we will suffer, this war against \nterrorism must be fought and is worth the fight.\n  Even though he wrote in an earlier age, the poet Archibald MacLeish \nsummed up what is at stake when he said:\n\n       There are those who will say that the liberation of \n     humanity, the freedom of man and mind, is nothing but a \n     dream. They are right. It is the American dream.\n\n  America is the last, best hope for mankind. That is the dream. It is \nup to all of us to make sure it is not an illusion. This is the best \nway to honor the memory of those who perished 2 years ago and assuage \nthe grief we feel when we reflect on that terrible day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know we have a moment of silence to be \nobserved at 10:06. I will make a few remarks preceding that and, if \nnecessary, I will complete those following the moment of silence.\n  Mr. President, I wish to say a few words to supplement the eloquent \ncomments made by the Senator from New Jersey, the two Senators from \nVirginia, and the others who have spoken today on the second \nanniversary of the tragedy of September 11.\n  I was not serving here in Washington at that time, as many were, but \nas were so many Americans, I was at home in Texas preparing for work \nwhen I heard the terrible news and then saw the terrible images--the \nclouds of flame from a plane that ripped a hole in the bright, blue sky \nand took down the World Trade Center in New York. I will never forget \nthat site as long as I live, nor should any of us forget it.\n  I know many of my friends and colleagues who were here on that \nhorrific day feel a very deep and personal debt to the heroes of \nSeptember 11, particularly those on Flight 93. As was noted, the brave \npassengers on that flight did more than just save the lives of their \nfellow citizens. Absent their courageous sacrifice, it is likely that \nFlight 93 would have reached its final destination in this very \nbuilding, an attack that would have virtually eliminated an entire \nbranch of the United States Government.\n  Even as we dedicate ourselves to fighting terror at home and abroad, \neven as we hope and pray that the tragedy of September 11 will not be \nrepeated, we must always remain conscious of our oath as Senators, as \nrepresentatives of the people, to support and defend the Constitution \nand laws of the United States, and make sure the Constitution has \nrepresentatives\n\n[[Page S11372]]\n\nhere arguing for laws and appropriations and defense that is needed on \nbehalf of the American people.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, it is clear that our current system \nof providing for the continuity of our Government in the event of a \ndisaster is inadequate to address the reality of a post-9/11 world. As \nunthinkable as another attack of that magnitude might seem, we in this \nbranch must be ready for the worst. We must provide for the stable \ncontinuance and function of Government, despite all possible \ncalamities.\n  Even if we in this body fall, we should not leave our Nation's \ncitizens without representation, without order, without defense. We owe \nit to the American people to ensure that our Government remains strong, \neven in the face of disaster.\n  Two years ago, our Nation was attacked by evil men who wanted to \nleave us weak, vulnerable, and divided. Instead, they saw a world \nstrong, determined, and united. They gravely underestimated America's \nresolve. America will never surrender to tyrants or terrorists. We will \nnot cut and run in the face of danger.\n  Instead, we are taking the fight to freedom's enemies, fighting in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and wherever else necessary so that terrorists can \nno longer export their evil to our streets or those of our allies. Many \nchallenges lie ahead, but now is not the time to stop or show a lack of \nconfidence or resolve.\n  While we mourn our dead and wounded in the war on terror, we must \nremain dedicated to finishing the job in Iraq and Afghanistan and \nwherever terrorists or their allies spread their doctrine of hate. Here \nat home, we must support our brave men and women in uniform who put \ntheir lives on the line every day for the cause of security and \nfreedom.\n  Two years later, it is clearer now how the world grew so much smaller \non September 11. We can no longer allow for the evildoers to plot and \nscheme in nations on the other side of the globe. We cannot wait to be \nattacked again. We cannot allow for another tragedy.\n  We must hunt down the enemies of freedom wherever we find them, or we \nrisk the spilling of blood again on our own soil. Like the passengers \non Flight 93, we must not sit back and allow our destiny to be \ndetermined by freedom's enemies. No, we must take the fight to them. \nThe minions of terror have shown their capability for inhumanity, and \nwe cannot underestimate their desire to do so again.\n  In July, Prime Minister Blair, speaking before a joint meeting of \nCongress, reminded us of our duty as a powerful nation to take great \ncare regarding what kind of world we leave for our children. I believe \nthat task falls to us at this moment in history to continue spreading \nthe blessings of liberty.\n  Mr. President, I understand in 1 minute we will observe a moment of \nsilence, and certainly I will pause in my remarks to do so. But I will \nsay before then that I believe now that the task falls to us at this \nmoment in history to continue making sure that others may enjoy the \nblessings of liberty that we in this country even on occasion take for \ngranted.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the hour \nof 10:06 a.m. having arrived, the Senate will observe a moment of \nsilence.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and in our own \nstreets and cities, we must labor on undeterred, always confident in \npursuit of our ultimate goal. We seek not domination, not occupation; \nwe seek a just, free, and peaceful world for ourselves, for our allies, \nand for future generations, no matter where they may be found on this \nplanet.\n  The passengers on Flight 93 were everyday Americans, men and women \nwith jobs, with families and dreams. Like all of us, they made promises \nto their loved ones before they boarded that plane; perhaps promises of \nvacations and baseball games, of presents and anniversaries, \nbirthdays--small promises and big ones.\n  We know that some promises don't come cheap. Some cost us nothing. \nOthers require that we risk all, even our very lives.\n  The crash site of Flight 93 in the quiet hills of Pennsylvania is \nfilled with memories of the promises those heroes made and will, sadly, \nnever keep. But we have made a promise that we are dutybound to keep--\nwe, the living--a promise to the Nation we love and to all our \ncountrymen and to the loved ones these heroes left behind: a promise \nthat says the story of freedom will not end here in the violent acts of \nevil men. It will persist, it will endure, and it will not be \ndestroyed.\n  Those of us left behind must fulfill that promise. We must prepare \nfor all contingencies as we continue to hunt the agents of terror and \ndedicate ourselves, once again, to ensuring that the promise of freedom \nshall not perish from this Earth.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I really do appreciate the opportunity to \ncome this morning and say a few words about this momentous event that \nis in the minds and hearts of every American today. I thought rather a \nlot about what I ought to say. I certainly do not want to be guilty of \npresumption to lecture to the American people about what they ought to \nreflect upon as we all remember this attack upon our Nation that today \nis 2 years old.\n  We are going to talk about it tonight at our dinner table. I have \nthree children. We are going to spend a few minutes--which is about all \nthat young children spend thinking about anything, I guess--talking \nabout this. I think it is important, and I thought maybe what I could \ndo and would be appropriate to do is to share what our family is going \nto talk about tonight, at least if the dad in that family has anything \nto say about it.\n  I think this is a good opportunity for us to reflect upon what a \nnation is and what America is as a nation. We are not just a place \nwhere 250 million people happen to live together. We are not like a big \napartment complex, where the only thing people have in common is the \nproximity of their living arrangements. Any nation, especially America, \nwhich, as rich as we are in cultural and ethnic diversity and different \ntraditions that have added to our national life, is also a nation that \nis held together by some common beliefs. We don't have a monarchy here, \nthank God. We don't have an established religion that defines us as a \nnation. We do have a commitment to certain shared values, certain \ntranscendent codes about how people should live in a decent and \ncivilized country.\n  Those codes have a claim, by common recognition, on our actions. Each \nof us, even if we don't realize it, makes hundreds of decisions every \nday in response to those shared beliefs. Maybe at the core of those \nbeliefs is a common recognition on the part of the people of this \ncountry that human beings have an inherent dignity. As the Framers of \nthe Declaration of Independence said: They are endowed by their Creator \nwith certain inalienable rights.\n  Inalienable means you can't give it away, you can't sell it, and it \ncan't be taken from you. The rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness--we are equal in the possession and the enjoyment of these \nrights. Pursuit of happiness is just the right to participate in an \norderly fashion in the institutions of private, social, and economic \nlife, and in the political activities of the day.\n  One thing Americans recognize is that we as a people, and indeed \npeople all over the world, are, by virtue of our humanity, in \npossession of these rights and they cannot be taken away.\n  I believe very strongly that we were attacked 2 years ago precisely \nbecause that is what we believe. It was an attack upon this common \nheritage and because we stand for that in this world. It is because we \nstand for that, that hundreds of millions of people around the world \nlook to this Nation as a beacon of hope--what Lincoln called the last \nand best hope of all mankind. I\n\n[[Page S11373]]\n\ncertainly agree with that, in the secular sense of it anyway. That is \nthe reason we were attacked.\n  I want our family tonight to reflect upon three things. First, I want \nus to take satisfaction as Americans--and I hope all Americans will \ntake satisfaction--in what we as a nation have achieved in the war \nagainst terrorism this last year. We are safer than we were 2 years \nago--not in the sense that attack is impossible; that is not true. But \nin the sense that it is less likely to succeed than it was 2 years ago. \nThat is because of the resolution of the American people which has \nmotivated this Congress, in a bipartisan way, and the President of the \nUnited States to conduct this war against terrorism with vigor.\n  We have put thousands of these terrorists in places where they cannot \nhurt us and our families anymore. We have built a great international \ncoalition, in which we are at the center, that is every hour of every \nday organizing its intelligence and its police forces with the utmost \nvigor to track these people down and put them away. We have taken the \nfight to the enemy in Afghanistan and now in Iraq, where our men and \nwomen are heroically defending this Nation.\n  It is hard to plan an attack on us here at home when you never know \nwhen the 101st Airborne may be descending on you in Iraq or the FBI may \nbe descending on one of your cells or one of our Allied Nations with \nour police forces may be chasing you around the corner.\n  I want us as a nation, and we will as a family, to resolve to \ncontinue this fight until we win. I believe we are winning. I believe \nwe will win. I do not believe this Nation is going to quit.\n  We are going to have our squabbles about how we ought to conduct it. \nOther people are going to look at us and wonder how we can continue \nwith all this in-fighting. There are many people around the world who \nconsider us to be, as Winston Churchill quoted somebody referring to \nus, as ``a numerous, remote, and talkative people.''\n  We certainly are numerous, sometimes we are remote, and we are often \ntalkative. But no one should mistake the resolve of every American, and \nevery Member of this body, to continue this fight until the end, until \nwe remove the shadow of this tyranny, this ruthlessness, and this evil \nnot just from this country but from the lives of everybody around the \nworld who loves freedom.\n  The third thing I want our family to do, and I hope America will do, \nis reflect on the sacrifice of those who are fighting this war on the \nfront line. There is a sense in which we are all fighting this war. I \nwas asked by the press a couple of days ago how it has affected the \nlives of people on a day-to-day basis. I said, you know, in your \npersonal lives it has, to some extent, every time we go into a Federal \nbuilding or fly on an airline. But in people's business or trade or \njobs, it has affected it a lot. Almost everybody's job has been \naffected to some degree, if you stop to think about it. The computer \nsystem is different because you or your employer may be cooperating \nwith Federal authorities in some way, or tightening up security.\n  There are just all kinds of ways in which our lives are different. \nThere is a sense in which we are all fighting this. But I want us to \nthink about the sacrifices of the people on the front line and \nespecially to reflect upon those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, those \nwho gave everything they had to give: the firefighters who fell in the \ntowers, the men and women who have given their lives in the battle \nagainst terrorism in Afghanistan and now in Iraq.\n  I often--not often, but too often, I guess, in the sense it happens \ntoo much--have occasion to communicate with somebody from Missouri who \nhas lost a loved one in that struggle. I think a lot about what to say \nto them. In a sense, there is no way in which words can possibly begin \nto assuage the grief they feel. But one of the things I do try to \nremind them is to take comfort from what this sacrifice of their loved \none says about the things their loved one held dear. These men and \nwomen who have died in this fight knew when they went into it that they \nwere putting their lives on the line. I am not saying they talk about \nit all the time. I don't think they do. They are not the kind of people \nwho wear their feelings on their sleeves. But they know why they are \ndoing what they are doing. They know the risks. They know the potential \ncost. And they know, and have resolved in their hearts, why it is worth \nit.\n  In conclusion, I hope that those who are close to those who died--\nand, indeed, all of us--will reflect today that the sacrifice of those \nwho have fallen is a measure of the love they have for their families \nand the value they place on the freedom of their country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, today we remember the thousands of people \nwho so tragically lost their lives in the September 11 attacks. It was \njust 2 years ago today that terrorists launched an assault on America \nand everything she stands for--her freedom, her liberty, her democracy. \nOur hearts were broken, our lives were ever changed and left with the \njarring memories of that day, those moments which seemed to last \nthrough eternity. We will never forget.\n  Because these tragedies, those centered in New York, Pennsylvania, \nthe Pentagon, touched the hearts of each and every American across the \ncountry, together we mourn. In our collective grief we became the \nembodiment of an American family, from New York to California to \nMississippi to my home State of North Carolina, where we struggled to \ncome to grips with the deaths of several of our own.\n  Today we pause to remember these men, women, and children and honor \ntheir lives--the mothers and fathers, the sons and daughters. I recall \nsomething that was said shortly after the attacks by Fred Cranford, of \nDrexel, NC. He and his wife lost their 32-year-old son, LCDR Eric \nCranford, at the Pentagon. Yet even in the midst of a grief most of us \ncannot even imagine, Fred Cranford said: Even out of evil, God can \nbring good things.\n  Two years ago, the very personification of evil sought to tear us \napart, but today the United States stands strong, dedicated, committed, \nand more than ever we are a nation united against terrorism.\n  We are the most powerful country on the face of the Earth, but 2 \nyears ago our lives changed forever. September 11 and its aftermath \nhave demonstrated that America cannot ignore events in far-flung places \nsuch as Afghanistan and Iraq. We can and must act when our security is \nthreatened. Our leadership was decisive and our leadership will \ncontinue to be necessary as the war on terror proceeds.\n  This Nation dedicated itself to winning the global war on terror. We \nmust remain dedicated. And that means continuing to work with the \ninternational community to help the Iraqi citizens stabilize their \ncountry and establish their government.\n  Recently, in an editorial in the Washington Post, Ambassador Paul \nBremer outlined a clear and well-defined course of action in Iraq. As \nhe noted, there will be bumps along the way, but it is critical for us \nto stay the course--stay the course. One particular paragraph stood out \nto me, and his poignant words bear repeating:\n\n       Gone are Saddam Hussein's torture chambers. Gone are his \n     mass killings and rape rooms. And gone is his threat to \n     America and the international community.\n\n  As we go forward, it is this that we should keep in mind. Certainly \nthe operation in Iraq is proving to be a dangerous and more grinding \nconflict. The President addressed the fact candidly and resolutely in \nhis address to the Nation Sunday night. But eliminating terror is more \nthan removing the leaders of an evil regime from power. Terrorism must \nbe torn out by its roots, ensuring that there is no toehold for its \nsponsors to reestablish their violent ways.\n  More than words, more than negotiations, the President's supplemental \nspending request sent an unmistakable signal to these sponsors of \nterror, to the liberated Iraqi citizens, and to the world that the \nUnited States of America is staying the course. Attacks on United \nStates troops and other targets in Iraq are aimed at undermining the \nefforts of democracy. But these will not cause us to shy away from our \ncommitment because we know that failure to follow through in our \nmission could leave a lethal void, a void that would rapidly be filled \nby terror and its supporters.\n\n[[Page S11374]]\n\n  A routine criticism, even from the start of actions in Iraq, is that \ninadequate resources were dedicated to the Iraqi theater. The \nsupplemental requested by the President not only gives our men and \nwomen in uniform the resources they need to succeed in their mission in \nIraq and in Afghanistan and elsewhere in the war on terror, it also \ntargets funds to help build safe, stable, and self-governing societies \nin nations that have been torn apart by the self-serving regimes of \nrogue leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden.\n  For our soldiers engaged in these military operations, the \nsupplemental must equate to equipment that will ensure their safety, \nsupplies that will make their mission achievable, and something else \nwhich is essentially priceless--time, even if only 2 weeks, to get away \nfrom the tireless effort necessary to maintain peace in Iraq.\n  These men and women in uniform deserve our highest respect and \nadmiration for the often difficult and dangerous jobs they do. Our \ntroops deserve the very best--the best equipment, the best training, \nthe best housing, and the best leadership.\n  I have a great deal of confidence in our current leaders--President \nBush, Vice President Cheney, National Security Adviser Rice, General \nMyers, and my old colleagues Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Powell. \nThey understand how and when to ask our military to go into action. But \nour men and women in uniform must be given the tools to do the jobs we \nask of them. To them I say, Congress will not let you down.\n  Also, it is clear we cannot transform Iraq without more help from the \nIraqi people themselves. That is why it is so important that sufficient \nfunds are dedicated to training and equipping an Iraqi police force and \nhelping the Iraqis establish a strong judicial system.\n  I look forward to hearing how the State Department plans to work with \nthe United Nations to jointly provide assistance and further these and \nother goals. The evolving Iraqi Government needs the support of the \nentire international community to gain a credible foothold. While it is \nimportant in the near term for the United States to retain control over \nthe military forces to ensure this fledgling government can grow strong \nwithout the fear of terrorist sabotage, it is just as important for the \nlong term that a sound structure is put in place so that the Iraqis can \ngovern themselves and ensure their citizens' security when coalition \nforces leave.\n  While it has fallen off the front pages of the daily news, \nAfghanistan remains a key component to peace in this region. In the \nmost recent military operations, United States troops engaged fighters \nin the southern part of the country who were suspected of being \nTaliban. Members of this military operation are part of a campaign to \ncombat a major Taliban regrouping effort.\n\n  Again, we cannot afford to leave a void for terror--not for a lack of \npatience or a lack of resources. The war against terror continues in \nAfghanistan and Iraq, and it will require a sustained commitment of \ntime and resources similar to our commitment in rebuilding Germany and \nJapan after World War II--a commitment that resulted in the hard \nlessons learned after World War I.\n  This effort will be difficult and costly, but it is critical to our \nnational security here at home. We must continue fighting the war on \nterror in Iraq and Afghanistan lest the fight return again to American \nsoil.\n  Two years ago, more than 3,000 innocent lives were lost in a terrible \nstrike against America. We must vow in their honor that our spirit will \ncontinue to triumph and ensure those families that America will not \nshrink from those who seek to destroy our values. We will continue to \nbe a good and great Nation, because we are a good and great people.\n  God bless this great land of the free--America.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of the \nvictims of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on our country. On \nthis second anniversary of that fateful day, many of the emotions we \nfelt are still very real. We continue to feel grief for those who were \nlost. We continue to feel admiration for the bravery of our policemen \nand firefighters. And we continue to feel shock over that day's \ninconceivable violence. The reality is that these emotions may be at \nthe front of America's conscience for years to come, but it is my hope \ntoday that for those families who lost loved ones, each passing day \nbrings with it some measure of healing.\n  In addition to the emotional impact of the attacks, September 11, \n2001 also had a profound effect on U.S. national security policy. The \nuse of asymmetrical means by terrorists to inflict mass casualties \naltered our traditional view of who terrorists are and how we must \nconfront them.\n  No longer do we view terrorist acts as isolated events committed by a \nfew extremists. Rather, 21st century terrorists have shown themselves \nto be organized, well-financed, and deeply committed to a doctrine of \nviolence. We know this doctrine is aimed at undermining our economy, \nour infrastructure, and our sense of personal security. We also know it \nis based upon a willingness to employ weapons of mass destruction \nagainst civilian targets.\n  This reality has forced both our political leaders and military \nplanners to rethink the American premise about where and how to use \narmed force. And the result is that the specter of another WMD attack \nagainst our population means we can no longer subscribe to the long-\nheld principle that the United States will attack only after being \nattacked. Instead, we must act preemptively to best protect innocent \nAmericans from a replay of the 9/11 tragedy.\n  Preemption means taking the offensive. It means taking the battle to \nthe terrorists before they attack us. It requires good intelligence and \ncooperation from our friends and allies from around the world. And \nimmediately after the terrorist attacks of September 11, many nations \npledged such cooperation and actively supported our actions in \nAfghanistan.\n  For example, President Chirac of France was the first head-of-state \nto visit the United States after the attacks, pledging to join in the \nfight to defend civilization from the scourge of terrorism. Indeed, no \ncountry showed a greater outpouring of sympathy for the United States \nin the immediate aftermath of the attacks than did France. Similarly, a \npoll conducted in Germany in the autumn of 2001 showed that after the \nattacks in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania, an increased number \nof Germans, 58 percent, saw the U.S. as Germany's most important \npartner. To be sure, this solidarity was greatly appreciated during our \ndark time of September 2001.\n  The tragedy that America experienced, and that elicited such \ninternational sympathy, was the same tragedy that prompted us to adopt \nthis preemptive military doctrine. It was the tragedy of September 11 \nthat made us say to governments who would sponsor terrorism and supply \nterrorists with weapons of mass destruction, ``disarm or we will act to \ndisarm you before your weapons can hurt our people.'' And this is what \nled us to act against Saddam Hussein, a proven killer who steadfastly \nrefused to prove he no longer had WMDs that the world knew he had after \nthe Gulf War.\n  Many of our coalition partners understood the imperative of acting \nagainst a thug like Saddam Hussein in a post 9/11 world. They \nremembered the pain we endured and knew our actions in Iraq were a \ndirect response to preventing a similar tragedy. But other nations did \nnot recognize a link between illegitimate regimes like Iraq's and the \nterrorist threat facing the civilized world. The war on terror will \ncontinue to be difficult and will require tough decisions like those \nfaced in deposing Saddam Hussein. It is my hope that all of our allies \nwill join in a unified front in this war both in good times, and in \nbad.\n  I want to say in closing how proud I am of many of the contributions \nthat my home State has made in executing the war on terror. It was our \nF-117 stealth aircraft pilots who answered the President's call to take \nthe first action against Saddam Hussein's regime. Furthermore, New \nMexicans have fought and died heroically in both Afghanistan and Iraq. \nFor that, we owe our deepest gratitude and respect.\n  Our national laboratories have also made immense contributions to the \nwar against terrorism, both ahead of 9/11 and with increasing emphasis \npost-9/11. They provided critical support in identifying strains of \nanthrax, and a biothreat detection system that was fielded at the \nOlympics as well as locations around the District of Columbia.\n\n[[Page S11375]]\n\n Sandia invented the material that was heavily used in ridding the Hart \nbuilding of anthrax concerns. Both labs have led the national efforts \nto control materials suitable for weapons of mass destruction. From \nweapons grade materials to materials suitable for dirty bombs, the labs \nhave developed detectors and technologies to help secure and dispose of \nthese materials. The systems used in monitoring international trade for \nany radioactive materials that could become weapons against us are \nlargely from the New Mexico labs. They are providing computing \nresources through the National Infrastructure and Analysis Center of \nNISAC to model complex events that could threaten our Nation and \ndevelop mitigation strategies.\n  I close by again remembering all the brothers and sisters we lost on \nSeptember 11, 2001, and all those who have sacrificed in the ensuing \nwar. Let our enemies not doubt that we will continue to pursue them \nwherever they may hide and will not stop until our victory is complete. \nGod bless our soldiers and their families, and may God bless America.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the images of September 11, 2001, remain \netched in our minds and our hearts. On this second anniversary of the \nattack, we commemorate those who died in the attacks and the unwavering \nspirit of those who survived. We remember the true heroism that emerged \nout of tragedy, how strong and united we can be, how we can set aside \ndifferences for the greater good and work together.\n  Californians were part of each tragic moment of that day. Some were \ntrapped in the World Trade Center. Some were at work in the Pentagon. \nAnd the fates of others were sealed as they boarded planes bound for \nSan Francisco or Los Angeles. All four planes used by the terrorists on \nSeptember 11 were headed for my State of California.\n  I want to remember the more than 50 Californians who were victims of \nthe September 11 attacks. Their memories will live on and their \nlegacies will live on, as will the memories and legacies of every \ninnocent victim who we lost on that tragic September day.\n  The people of California join the Nation in mourning the loss of \nthese Americans:\n  David Angell; Lynn Angell; David Aoyama; Melissa Barnes; Alan Beaven; \nBerry Berenson; Dr. Yen Betru; Carol Beug, Mark Bingham; Deora Bodley; \nTouri Bolourchi; Daniel Brandworst; David Brandhorst; Ronald Gamboa; \nCharles ``Chic'' Burlingame; Thomas Burnett; Suzanne Calley; Jeffrey \nCollman; Dorothy DeAraujo; Lisa Frost; Andrew Garcia; Edmund Glazer; \nLauren Grandcolas; Andrew Curry Green; Richard Guadagno; Stanley Hall; \nGerald Hardacre; John Hart; John Hofer; Melissa Hughes; Barbara \nKeating; Chad Keller; Christopher Larrabee; Daniel Lee; Dong Lee; Joe \nLopez; Hilda Marcin; Dean Mattson; Dora Menchaca; Nicole Miller; Laurie \nNeira; Ruben Ornedo; Marie Pappalardo; Jerrold Paskins; Thomas \nPecorelli; Robin Penninger; Marie-Rae Sopper; Xavier Suarez; Alicia \nTitus; Otis Tolbert; Pendyala Vamsikrashna; Timothy Ward; Christopher \nWemmers; and John Wenckus.\n  As we reflect on the horror and the pain of September 11, we embrace \nour Nation and our freedom. We must continue to work together to \nstrengthen democracy in the world, and we must redouble our efforts to \nerase terrorism's shadow from our lives.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, two years ago today, our world changed \nforever. At 8:45 a.m., EST, on Tuesday, September 11, 2001, the first \nWorld Trade Center was attacked. Shortly thereafter I remember seeing \nthe chaos on the streets in Washington after the Pentagon was hit. I \nwill never forget the sights and sounds from that day.\n  On that day, we lost a feeling of security. And we felt a little \nexposed. We lost mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, \ngrandparents and grandchildren. But as we united as a nation, we gained \nstrength. What terrorists sought to destroy, what they thought they \ncould topple, is the unbreakable American spirit.\n  ``September 11'' will never again just be a date on the calendar. It \nis a day that marks the largest attack on American soil in our Nation's \nhistory. It was a day of confusion, a day of fear, a day of loss. But \nit was also a day of heroism--a day of standing together.\n  On the 2-year anniversary, it is important to remember the events and \nemotions of September 11. As Americans, we are still living in \nuncertain terms. As Montanans and Americans, we must continue to be \ndetermined and steadfast in our dedication to win the fight against \nterrorism. We must lead an unprecedented effort to eliminate the \nterrorist networks that threaten our Nation. We must remain committed \nto defending the rights and freedoms that make us proud to be \nAmericans. From our freedom to express our thoughts and determine our \nreligious beliefs--to our right to openly vote for and elect our \npolitical leaders.\n  Today we stand as one to pay respect and express our gratitude to our \nNation's heroes: the countless firefighters, the policemen and women, \nthe emergency medical technicians, doctors, nurses, as well as everyday \ncitizens who risked their lives to save others on September 11.\n  I remain dedicated to working together with Congress and the \nadministration to protect America and the principles this Nation stands \nfor and to bring those responsible for the September 11 attacks to \njustice.\n  On the two-year anniversary of September 11, and in the weeks, \nmonths, and years that follow, I call on every Montanan to remember the \nlessons learned on that fateful day. Remember the solidarity. Remember \nthe countless America flags that flew across the State and the Nation. \nRemember the generosity with which people donated to charities and \nvolunteered in their communities. Remember the support we received from \nthe international community.\n  While September 11 is a horrific day in our Nation's history, it \ntaught us a tremendous amount about ourselves, as Montanans, as \nAmericans, and as a Nation. We must never forget these lessons.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to share my thoughts on the \nsecond anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  None of us will ever be able to forget where we were when we first \nheard the terrible news of that day. As the day went on, we were \nriveted to our television sets and saw incomprehensible images of \ndestruction at the World Trade Center, the serious damage at the \nPentagon, and the crash site of Flight 93 in rural Pennsylvania. Yet \nbeyond the destruction we also saw remarkable demonstrations of \nheroism. From the first responders who unhesitatingly rushed into the \nWorld Trade Center and Pentagon to rescue survivors, to the passengers \nand crew of Flight 93 who chose to crash their plane rather than allow \nthe terrorists to complete their plan, September 11 showed us the \nstrength of our country.\n  The terrorists had hoped to paralyze us with fear, but the American \npeople were somber and resolute in their commitment to honor those who \nhad died, to rebuild from the destruction, and to ensure that we would \nlessen our vulnerability to future terrorist attacks. Bearing in mind \nthe example provided by the heroes of September 11, people throughout \nthe country began to look for ways that they could contribute to the \nrelief and recovery effort.\n  I am particularly proud of the contributions made by thousands of \nSouth Dakotans in the days following the attacks. Schoolchildren led \ndrives to collect clothing and blankets for those left homeless. \nStudents from Augustana College spent their 2002 spring break in New \nYork serving food to Ground Zero workers. Experts from the Disaster \nMental Health Institute at the University of South Dakota went to New \nYork to help counsel family members and relief workers and to assist in \nthe recovery process. Ranchers from my State sold cattle so they could \nmake donations to the victims and their families. And countless South \nDakotans lined up at the Red Cross to donate blood. Each of these \npeople, in large and small ways, was doing their part to help our \nNation.\n  As we take this time to look back on how our country responded to the \nattacks, I want to say a special word about the men and women of our \nArmed Forces. The members of our military have made extraordinary \nsacrifices over the last 2 years in the war on terrorism to make our \nNation safer. We can never forget the debt of gratitude we owe to those \nwho have fought\n\n[[Page S11376]]\n\nand to those who have died in defense of our freedoms.\n  South Dakota is privileged to be the home of Ellsworth Air Force \nBase, and on behalf of all South Dakotans I would like to thank the men \nand women of Ellsworth Air Force Base for their dedicated service and \ndecisive contributions to both Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \nIraqi Freedom. I also acknowledge the important work of the members of \nthe South Dakota National Guard and Reserves, many of whom are still in \nthe middle of lengthy deployments away from their families and friends.\n  The National Guard is the oldest component of our Armed Forces. Since \nits earliest days, the Guard has served a dual, Federal-State role. \nFollowing the September 11 attacks, members of the National Guard and \nReserves were called on to provide additional security at our Nation's \nairports, to assist at critical U.S. border checkpoints, to fly \nprotective missions over U.S. cities, and to maintain disaster \npreparedness in the States. In addition, National Guard units have \nplayed a crucial role in the war on terrorism; several units from South \nDakota continue to serve in Iraq and Kuwait. I know my colleagues join \nwith me in thanking all of our Armed forces, both Active Duty and \nReserve, for their continuing service to our Nation.\n  Rather than defeating us, the September 11 attacks demonstrated our \nstrength and resiliency. In New York, planning and design for a \nmemorial and the future use of the World Trade Center site is well \nunderway. In Somerset County, PA, there are ongoing efforts to erect a \npermanent memorial to the crew and passengers of Flight 93. And at the \nPentagon, reconstruction has been completed for several months.\n  While our Nation has moved forward, September 11 will always be a day \nfor quiet reflection and an opportunity to honor those who were lost.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this September 11, we pause once again to \nremember those we so tragically lost in the horrific attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon, and those aboard United Flight 93 \n2 years ago.\n  For people in all of our States, there are individual connections \nthat bind us to that terrible day. In my home State of Maine, families \nwill again mark a tragic anniversary for the victims they knew and \nloved: Anna Allison, Carol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Jacqueline and \nRobert Norton, James Roux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward. Today, \nthe greatest tribute we can offer is to remember their names, their \nlives, and their contributions. They are indelibly branded upon our \nnational consciousness.\n  We feel a pain that will never fade, withstanding even the tempering \nnature of time. But as we gather around the country on this second \nanniversary of the attacks, we can see we have been changed \npermanently, in ways that stand in shining testament to who we are as a \nnation.\n  More than 150,000 Americans--from my home State of Maine and across \nthe Nation--continue their brave service overseas, on a mission to \nensure the freedom of the people of Iraq and Afghanistan, and to reduce \nthe threat of future terrorist attacks worldwide. In Maine and \nelsewhere, thousands more are working countless hours to enhance our \nphysical security. That vital work continues to this day. Indeed, we \nare safer than we were 2 years ago because of those efforts--and we \nmust remain ever vigilant, always identifying ways we can do more.\n  But 9/11 has had an impact on our society that is perhaps less \nobvious, yet equally powerful.\n  Quite simply, we have witnessed the full force of the indomitable \nspirit with which this Nation has been blessed. The evidence exists in \nevery town and city in America. We all know countless stories of \nbravery and of quieter but no less significant acts of kindness and \ncompassion--all the more beautiful when viewed through the prism of \nsuch incomprehensible inhumanity as was visited upon us.\n  I cannot help but think of New York City and how her people reacted \nto the recent blackout. In echoes of 2 year's past, New Yorkers pulled \ntogether to face the adversity, relying on each other and looking out \nfor a city that will be forever scared, but also forever proud--and \nstrong. They are changed--not because they were broken but because they \nare now more united than ever before in the cause of defending that \nwhich they love.\n  It is the same for our entire Nation. America's indomitable spirit \nshines at events in my home State as it does in all of yours. It shines \nin Portland and Bangor, Lewiston, and Augusta. It shines in many \nsmaller ways. In the town of Freeport, two women began a simple tribute \nright after 9/11. They would wave flags each morning, and their fellow \ncitizens would acknowledge--honking their horns and waving. Last year \non this date, that simple tribute blossomed into a parade of patriotism \ndown Main Street. And this year, they are organizing a weekend-long \nevent, ``The Freeport Freedom Festival.''\n  Our spirit will shine in innumerable other small but heartfelt \ngestures we make on this second anniversary, just as it shined when \npeople in Maine and across the country lined up at blood banks and \ndonated millions of dollars and tons of food and equipment in the days \nafter the attacks. It is a spirit fueled by freedom, polished with \ncompassion and burnished by pride in our country and the men and women \nwho are risking their lives to protect ours, both here and abroad.\n  Clearly, even as we have achieved successes, our mission to eradicate \nterror at its roots--and to secure our homeland--will continue. And \njust as we did not foresee the tragedies of September 11, 2001, we \ncannot foretell what will happen next. But we can and must work \ntogether to remember those who have come before us, to maintain our \ncollective vigilance in the face of continued threats, and to remind \neach other of the principles and people in which we believe.\n  By working together to help change the world, we are paying the \nhighest possible honor to the more than 3,000 people who lost their \nlives on September 11, and to those who have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in the fight against terror in the following days and years. \nIt is a tribute that will resonate throughout the freedom-loving world \nas we remember. And there should be no mistake--we will always \nremember.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise, as I did 2 years ago, to \nponder the terrible events that had occurred only a day before. I rose \nto express my anger and my sadness, my disbelief, and my disdain for \nthe situation. I rose, as did most of my fellow Senators from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I spoke of the strength and resolve of this great Nation. I spoke of \nthe sad reality that thousands of families were directly affected and \nwould never be the same; that some fathers and some mothers would never \nbe coming home again; that some young sons and daughters would grow up \nto pictures of parents and grandparents lost in New York, Pennsylvania \nand across the Potomac at the Pentagon.\n  I also spoke of the horror yet to be seen and I spoke of our \ndetermination, as a country, to face whatever challenges lay ahead and \nI spoke of our President and the strength of character he would need to \nwithstand such an attack and keep this Nation strong.\n  I rise today and speak of the same issues and my respect and \nadmiration for the men and women of our military, proud of our \nPresident's resolve to stand up to such a challenge and leadership \nduring these 2 years of conflict and proud of our country to rally \naround the cause of liberty and the defeat of terrorism. I am also \nproud of this body's dedication to support the ongoing war on \nterrorism.\n  It was popular and ``good press'' to support the initial tide of \npatriotism and rise against the actions of September 11, 2001. We all \nstood and swore to the world we would not be bowed or broken. We \nrallied to the cause and professed dedication to righting this most \negregious wrong.\n  Two years have passed and some among us are starting to lose focus \nand the resolve necessary to wage this battle--and yes this is a \nbattle. I can understand how that could happen. The more time passes \nthe easier it is to allow other challenges, others programs, and other \nagendas to take center stage and we get back to the daily business at \nhand. But we, like our President and our military, must do our part to \nconquer this foe. We must remember the War on Terrorism does not have \none lone face or name attached to it nor is it contained to the field \nof battle.\n\n[[Page S11377]]\n\n  This war is being waged in Iraq and Afghanistan as we try to wage \npeace and raise those countries to when they can stand on their own \nwith self-leadership and rule of law by their own people. The war on \nterrorism is being waged through the financial institutions, diplomatic \narena, and the fields of conflict.\n  What this country and this Senate needs is the same kind of resolve \nto continue to support the efforts of this administration in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and whatever lands this fight takes us. Let us not be \nconfused, the cost of freedom is high but the loss of our freedom and \nfreedom of all nations is a much greater cost. Our only choice is to \nwage this battle and wage it fully. Our only choice is to wage this \nbattle no matter where it takes us. Our only choice is to wage this \nbattle through the courts and the banks, through the intelligence \nagencies and the embassies, through our combat capability and the \nUnited Nations.\n  In 2001 I spoke of our President and how he prayed the evening of \nSeptember 11, 2001. As I close, I offer a suggestion to each of my \ndistinguished colleagues. This evening before bed I will take time to \npray. I will pray for all of the victims of September 11, 2001 and \ntheir affected families. I will pray for all of the victims of \nterrorism throughout the world whether by the hands of organized \nterrorism or random acts perpetrated by despicable men with warped \nideas. I will pray for all of the men and women of our military \nespecially those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of \nthis Nation. I will also pray that our military is successful in \ndefeating our foes in this war. I will pray for our President that he \ncontinue to lead this country during these trying times as he has done \nso honorably. Lastly I will pray for this body to continue to have the \nstrength of character and fortitude to continue to support this cause \nthrough to completion no matter how long it may be.\n  Let this day be a day of remembering and a day of pride as well as \nsadness. Let this day be the day that we gain renewed resolve, clarity \nof thought and strength of purpose. May God bless this day and may God \nbless the United States of America.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in the morning hours of September 11, \n2001, our Nation endured a terrible tragedy. In the wake of that \ntragedy, the response from our ``Last Frontier'' was overwhelming. Two \nyears ago, Alaskans volunteered their time and their resources to \nassist the victims of the attacks. One year ago, the people of our \nState found unique ways to commemorate our Nation's loss. This year we \njoin the Nation once again in mourning and remembrance.\n  Since the September 11 attacks, the United States has led the \ncampaign to wipe out terrorism and those who support it. John F. \nKennedy once warned the world ``. . . that we shall pay any price, bear \nany burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to \nassure the survival and the success of liberty.'' The bravery and \ncourage our troops demonstrated on battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq \nconfirmed that Americans will make the ultimate sacrifice to preserve \nfreedom.\n  Here at home we are a safer Nation. We have established the Homeland \nSecurity Department, changed our laws so that agencies can share \ninformation, ensured better communication between State and Federal law \nenforcement, and provided better protection for ports and other points \nof entry. But the war on terror requires more and we must stay the \ncourse.\n  In his speech on Sunday night, President Bush reaffirmed our \ncommitment to this cause and called upon the Congress and the Nation to \nonce again prove our resolve. I urge all Americans to support the \nPresident. History has taught us that freedom always comes at a cost; \nwe mut pay the price. New coalitions have formed among terrorists. \nThose who wish us ill present us with an almost world-wide burden. \nNevertheless, we cannot neglect our responsibilities.\n  I hope all Alaskans will remember the victims of September 11 today \nby attending a memorial service or prominently displaying an American \nflag. The victims of September 11 and the volunteer soldiers who gave \ntheir lives in the campaign against terror gave what Lincoln called the \n``last full measure of devotion.'' Today, we honor their memory and \ntheir sacrifice.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak about this day \n2 years ago and what it signifies to our country. There is not a soul \nin this country who does not remember exactly where they were and what \nthey were doing on that fateful day that was so much of a watershed \npoint in our country.\n  I will tell you where I was. I was with the Senator from North Dakota \nand a number of others in a leadership meeting about 30 yards from here \non the west front of the Capitol. We had broken up our meeting and were \nwatching the television, watching the World Trade Center, when someone \nburst in the door and said, ``The Pentagon has been hit.'' We \nimmediately looked to the window looking out across The Mall and saw \nthe black smoke rising.\n  In times such as that, it is interesting how you react. Since my wife \nand I had just moved into an apartment overlooking the southwest corner \nof the Pentagon, my instinctive reaction was to leap to a telephone and \nto try to get word to her to get out of the apartment and get to the \nbasement garage. Of course, I did not know what was happening on that \nside of the Potomac River.\n  I went back to the meeting room, and it was vacant. I walked into the \nhallway and saw everyone pouring down the stairs. I will never forget \nwhat I heard at the bottom of the stairs. I heard the Capitol Police \nshouting at the top of their lungs: ``Get out of the building. Get out \nof the building.''\n  The memories of that day are seared in the minds of so many of us. \nAnd here we are 2 years later still confronting the terrorists and \nstill conducting the war against terrorism.\n  I am going to close with this because still people come up to me in \nmy State of Florida, as they did so frequently in the aftermath of that \nfateful day 2 years ago, and they say: ``Bill, what can we do?''\n  Let me tell you what my advice is, and it is the same now as it was \nthen. Loyal, hard-working Americans, what can you do? You can go on \nabout your lives being faithful and hard-working and productive \ncitizens of this country because in defense of this country and our \nvalues and our way of life, it is not only that we need military \nstrength for that, we need to continue our moral strength, and we need \nto continue our economic strength.\n  It is the strength of that and many other values, if we continue in \nour normal everyday productive selves that we will overcome. I \nparticularly use that word ``overcome'' because that is what America \nis. Our character as a people is that we are overcomers to the \nobstacles that are put in front of us, to the setbacks with which we \nare faced. We are overcomers, and our history shows that time and time \nagain. Likewise, this time it will be also.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, our Nation \nexperienced a daunting tragedy. It touched every single one of us. Our \npeople came together and we spoke with one voice as we mourned the \nterrible loss of family, friends, neighbors and fellow Americans, and \nas we paid tribute to the heroes who sacrificed their own lives to save \nothers. We found a new and rich meaning in the phrase, ``I am an \nAmerican.''\n  At the same time, we resolved to move forward, to bring the \nperpetrators of those terrible attacks to account and to put an end to \nthe scourge of terrorism, so that our people remain free to live \nrewarding and productive lives. We made a major and fundamental \ncommitment to our homeland security.\n  Now, however, our rapidly expanding commitment in Iraq threatens to \novershadow our commitment here at home.\n  Earlier this year, I supported a series of amendments to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security appropriations bill to increase funding \nfor homeland security needs. These included firefighter and first-\nresponder assistance grants, port security, transit security, border \nsecurity and chemical security protections. Regrettably, these \namendments were all defeated, primarily on party-line votes.\n  If this administration is prepared to ask for nearly $90 billion in \nadditional funding for our operations in Iraq, it should and must be \nprepared to provide\n\n[[Page S11378]]\n\nthe funds we must have to strengthen the security of America's shores \nand protect the American public.\n  The terrible losses of 2 years ago will never be forgotten. But the \nmost enduring memorial we can raise to those we lost is a future of \nfreedom and opportunity, a future without fear. Our response to the \nevents of September 11, 2001, is a demonstration of the great and \nabiding strength of America. We must be prepared to pledge our \nresources as well as our words.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, 2 years have past since the tragedy of \nSeptember 11, 2001, but the visions of smoke rising out of the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon, and the pain and terror on the faces of \nthose who lost family members, friends and colleagues remain vivid in \nour minds. Within seconds, America realized that it was not invincible.\n  More than a thousand of miles away from Manhattan's ground zero, the \nPentagon, and the field in Shanksville, PA, Arkansans felt the \nvibrations of this tragedy. Families in Batesville, Pine Bluff, \nJonesboro and throughout the State learned about the deaths of friends \nand family members. Just a few months later, thousands of families \nwould celebrate Thanksgiving and Christmas without the moms, dads, sons \nand daughters who had been deployed in the fight against terrorism. \nSoldiers began to guard the Little Rock National Airport and Arkansas \nNuclear One. And we all began to care for our neighbors a little bit \nmore. On September 11, 2001, life for Americans changed forever.\n  September 11 is made bearable only by the true heroism displayed on \nthat day and everyday thereafter. We will never forget the selfless \nacts demonstrated by our firefighters who ran into burning buildings; \npolice officers who went the extra mile to help the frightened and \nfrail; EMTs, doctors and nurses who cared for the injured; and everyday \nindividuals who raised money for the victims of this tragedy.\n  Along with these heroes, we have hundreds of thousands of servicemen \nand women who continue to risk life and limb in places such as \nAfghanistan, Turkey and Iraq in the name of democracy and all it \nembodies. They put themselves in harm's way not for personal \naggrandizement or advancement but for immense love of country, liberty, \nand family. I ask all Arkansans to join me with continued support for \nour men and women in uniform.\n  I ask also that Arkansans pray for the families who lost their loved \nones in the tragic terrorist attacks. The healing process is a long and \ndifficult road, and these families need our support and compassion.\n  Finally, we must ensure that the more than 3,000 innocent Americans \ndid not die in vain on September 11. We must continue taking those \nsteps necessary to protect our homeland. This means ensuring that our \nfirst responders have the tools they need to confront terrorism at \nhome. It means ensuring that our servicemen and women have cutting-edge \nequipment, training and technology they need to complete their mission. \nIt means working together by placing our safety and our children's \nsafety above politics.\n  Americans have endured great hardship and heartbreak as a result of \nthe terrorist attacks, but this has not broken our faith, courage and \nan unshakable commitment to freedom, democracy and each other. Today, \nwe remember the tragedy of September 11, and we honor its victims. We \nwill never forget them.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, 2 years ago, our world \nchanged forever. The terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centers and \nPentagon were a painful wakeup call to our Nation that we must remain \never vigilant in protecting our freedom. We must confront evil where it \nexists and defeat it. We must battle the terrorists where they live \nbefore they are able to carry out their missions of death and \ndestruction on our homeland. Our hearts still grieve for those who lost \nloved ones in the terrorist attacks, and we must never forget the \npainful lessons learned on September 11.\n  September 11 was a dark day in America history.\n  While the terrorists were carrying out their evil our national \ncharacter as a strong, proud people showed through as it produced a new \ngeneration of American heroes. The memory of the firefighters who \nrushed into the Trade Centers before their collapse to save their \nfellow citizens showed us the best in our Nation, as did the passengers \non Flight 93 who decided to storm the cockpit and sacrifice their own \nlives to prevent the terrorists from carrying out their deadly mission. \nSeptember 11 was a stark contrast between the best and worst of \nmankind.\n  On this September 11, may God continue to protect and bless the \nUnited States of America.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \npay tribute to those in New York, at the Pentagon, and in the skies \nover Pennsylvania who lost their lives 2 years ago today.\n  None of us in the Senate will ever forget the events of that terrible \nmorning, nor will we forget the courage and compassion displayed by \nAmericans everywhere in response to the attacks.\n  Today my thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their families, \nand all of those who risked their lives to save others on that awful \nday.\n  We faced the worst terrorist attack in our Nation's history on that \nday and we told ourselves that we would not let our guard down. We have \nnot let our guard down and we will not let our guard down.\n  The world has changed dramatically over the past 2 years. Under the \nPresident's leadership, we have taken on our enemies abroad so that \nAmericans can live in peace at home. With the help of our allies \nabroad, our brave soldiers have dismantled the Taliban in Afghanistan \nand defeated Saddam Hussein's evil regime in Iraq.\n  We have killed or taken into custody nearly two-thirds of senior al-\nQieda leaders. We have chosen to take on al-Qieda on its battlefield to \nprevent terrorists from choosing the time and place of battle.\n  Terrorists across the world have been given notice that the U.S. will \ndo whatever it takes to prevent another terrorist attack.\n  America will triumph and those who want nothing less than to destroy \nour way of life will fail.\n  They will fail because of the American spirit. They will fail because \nof our faith in freedom and democracy. They will fail because of the \nstrength and character of the American people.\n  I believe that Americans have emerged from the attacks of September \n11, 2001, even stronger and more dedicated to our beliefs and to our \nNation.\n  We are safer now than we were 2 years ago, but the enemy will \nundoubtedly try again and we must be ready. And we will be ready.\n  it has been said many times before, but it bears repeating again--it \nmight not seem like it, but we are at war. Al-Qaida and its terrorist \nallies may be on the run, but they are still plotting against peace-\nloving people across the world.\n  It's a different kind of struggle than we have fought before. The war \non terror will not end next month or even next year. It will take \npatience and it will take perseverance. But let the world know that \nthis is a war that we will win. This is a war that Americans and our \nfreedom-loving allies will not allow us to lose.\n  The President has done a superb job leading our country in the war on \nterror. And we have done our best in Congress to provide him the \nresources necessary to prosecute and to win that war.\n  People often ask me how things have changed in Washington since 9/11.\n  Some things on the surface certainly have changed. There are more \nconcrete barriers, roadblocks, and security precautions. But looking \nbeneath the surface I think the better question is to ask what did \nSeptember 11, 2001, reveal about us.\n  It showed that we are still a good and compassion people. And it \nshowed that we have many friends around the world that also love \nfreedom.\n  It showed that under the worst of circumstances we will come to the \naid of not only our friends and neighbors but complete strangers.\n  It showed that America is still the greatest nation on Earth. And it \nshowed that in the war on terror, we will prevail.\n  I thank the Chair. May God grant strength to those that mourn the \nloss of their loved ones in this war on terror and may God continue to \nbless this great Nation.\n\n[[Page S11379]]\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, 2 years ago, our Nation was brutally \nattacked by terrorists. Thousands of innocent men, women, and children \nlost their lives on September 11, 2001, in New York, the Washington, \nDC, area, and Pennsylvania. This week, we honor the memories of those \nlost, and remember the mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and \nother loved ones who will never return to their families.\n  Yet in the midst of that tragedy, we were reminded about what makes \nAmerica strong. Firefighters raced into the doomed towers of the World \nTrade Center, saving thousands of lives, although they would be unable \nto reach safety themselves. At the Pentagon, even as part of their \nbuilding burned, the men and women of the military command stayed at \ntheir desks to help coordinate information and keep the country's armed \nforces on high alert. Over Pennsylvania, a group of strangers joined \ntogether to fight back against their attackers and saved countless \nlives by giving their own.\n  Our strength has always come from the capacity of average Americans \nto rise to acts of heroism to protect neighbor and stranger alike. Now, \nour security derives from regular people in a wide range of jobs, in \naddition to the brave men and women of the armed forces. From Customs \nagents, to cops on the beat, to baggage screeners, million of U.S. \ncitizens have important roles to play in keeping our country safe.\n  Today, the fight against terror continues. We face an elusive enemy, \nwilling and eager to take any measure and to murder innocent civilians. \nTo them, the freedoms we enjoy represent opportunities to attack our \nsociety and way of life.\n  This week we remember why we have been drawn into this fight--so that \nno more families must mourn the loss of loved ones to terror attacks. \nAs we continue this struggle, it is imperative that we do so in a \nmanner befitting a nation of laws. By doing so, we will send a powerful \nmessage to the rest of the world: America will not yield to terrorists, \nand the principles of freedom and democracy will not be bowed by their \ncowardly tactics. Together, we will prevail.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Barbara G. Edwards of Las Vegas, NV, Wilson \n``Buddy'' Flagg, a part-time resident of Las Vegas, Lieutenant Colonel \nKaren Wagner, a 1982 graduate of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, \nwhere she was in the Army ROTC--these three people were killed in the \nterrorist attacks 2 years ago. Mrs. Edwards and Mr. Flagg were \npassengers on the American Airlines flight that crashed into the \nPentagon and LT Wagner worked in the Pentagon. They were the first \nthree heroes from Nevada to die in the war on terrorism, but sadly they \nwere not the last.\n  Private First Class Matthew Commons, Boulder City, Staff Sergeant \nKerry Frith of Las Vegas, Army Specialist Jason Disney of Fallon, First \nLieutenant Fred Pokorney of Tonopah, Marine Corps Lance Corporal \nMichael Williams, who lived in Phoenix but had extended family in Reno, \nMarine Corps Lance Corporal Donald Cline, Jr., of Sparks, Army Captain \nJosh Byers, Sparks, Staff Sergeant Bryan Sarno, Las Vegas--these eight \nbrave soldiers have also given their lives in the war on terrorism. The \nmost recent was 10 days ago. Sergeant Sarno was killed in Iraq on \nSeptember 1. Most of these Nevadans died wearing the uniform of our \ncountry. Others were simply going about their every-day lives.\n  We have a duty as Americans to remember every one of them, not just \nfor their sake but also for our own, because, as painful as those \nmemories might be, they will always remind us of important truths. \nRemembering September 11 reminds us we have the greatest system of \ngovernment on Earth. For more than 2 centuries, no nation has held the \nflame of freedom higher or opened the doors of opportunity wider than \nthe United States of America. The cowards who struck America on \nSeptember 11 understand this. That is why they chose targets that \nsymbolize our free economy and our strong Armed Forces. Those cowards \nhad no reason to hate the people they murdered. They didn't even know \nthese people. But they hated America because we stand for freedom, \ntolerance, and opportunity. That is why we must never let time cloud \nour memory of what happened and why we must never forget those who gave \ntheir lives in the war against terror.\n  In this body we are privileged to freely debate the important issues \nfacing our Nation. That means we often disagree with one another. But \nwe have no disagreement today on these issues regarding September 11. \nToday we stand as one to honor our fallen heroes and to pledge that we \nwill never stop fighting until we have won the war against terrorism.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of \nthe men, women, and children who lost their lives in the terrorist \nattacks on our country on September 11, 2001.\n  The morning of September 11, 2001 will forever be remembered as the \nday America came face to face with the forces of evil and prevailed. \nInnocent men, women, and children lost their lives and families \nsuffered. Police officers, firefighters, rescue personnel, and \nAmericans from every walk of life rose to the occasion to save others, \nin many instances losing their own lives in the process. That day, we \nlearned about a new kind of American hero.\n  In the aftermath of these attacks, our country put aside our \ndifferences and came together as one nation to mourn our loss, \ncelebrate our liberty, and demonstrate to the world the strength and \ncompassion of a free people. We united behind a single cause: to root \nout and destroy those responsible for terrorism around the world.\n  Two years later, America is still leading that fight. The men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces stationed throughout the world are defending \nour way of life, our principles, and our freedom. They do so because we \nwill never forget the loss to America on September 11, 2001.\n  Today, I ask all Americans to pray for those who lost their lives, \npray for their families, and pray for those who have given their lives \nin the war on terrorism. I also ask that you not forget our uniformed \nmen and women still stationed overseas in harm's way.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator \nReid for his brief remarks regarding this day, and for myself merely \nsay I am among those Americans who never thought it could happen to us. \nWhile I sat in my den with my wife on the morning it happened, I was \nabout as incredulous as anyone could be. After I heard more about it, \nand they told me it was real, I was still disbelieving. I was still \nincredulous.\n  But now we look back and we know we are no longer invulnerable. We \nare no longer so powerful that we can say anything of danger to us will \nbe fought far away. We know the kind of enemy that confronts us is very \ndifferent than the enemies we have confronted during the lifetime of \nour Nation.\n  This is a tough one. This is a unique one. This is one run by crazy \nmen, by people who do not understand or reason as we do.\n  So I am very pleased, with all the politics at home, that I can stand \nhere and say I feel pretty confident we are doing better, that we are \nbetter off than the day this happened, that we are safer than the day \nit happened, that our big cities are safer. Certainly we are not \ntotally safe. But I wonder whether anybody will ever be able to tell us \nwe have done everything, we have spent every nickel, we have done every \nprogram, and we are totally safe from terrorists. I doubt that very \nmuch.\n  In some regards we are lacking. Let us hope we have the wisdom so on \nthe third anniversary we can stand here and say we have even done \nbetter, and it is more farfetched that they would succeed. Let's hope \nwe can do that.\n  For now, I am very proud of an open and free society that made \nchanges to accommodate to this scourge of venom. We had to change a few \nthings, but we did it. We had to spend some extra dollars, but we did. \nWe had to make some cities much safer, but we helped them do it. And \nthen we fought a war for it.\n  Clearly, when you look back at it all, we did pretty well. For a free \nnation, we did pretty well. It is pretty easy to mobilize when you are \nnot free. It is pretty easy to fight when you are a dictator. It is \npretty difficult to fight against terrorism when you are a democracy \nand you have to do it openly, in public, and fight them openly, in \npublic, and be criticized openly and in public. It is very hard, but we \nhave done it.\n\n[[Page S11380]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the resolution \nis agreed to, the preamble is agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nis laid upon the table.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 224) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we mourn the many lives lost 2 years \nago today, both the victims of terrorist attack and the heroes, the \nfirst responders who rushed to try to save them. In various ceremonies \naround the country today people are contemplating once again what the \nwar on terrorism involves.\n  Mr. President, only two years ago, we awoke to the threat that global \nterrorists posed to the security of the American people and, for that \nmatter, freedom-loving people around the globe, and Americans resolved \nto fight back against these enemies of freedom.\n  Our Nation committed to fighting terrorism knowing full well it would \nrequire risks, and sacrifice, and time, and, yes, money. We committed \nto fighting terrorism because the terrorists had already committed to \nfighting us.\n  Fortunately, America does not stand alone, because the same \nterrorists who target the United States also plotted and carried out \nattacks against European, Asian, and moderate Arab governments who do \nnot share their violent ideology or rationalized interpretation of \nIslam.\n  We are now only 24 months into a global war against terrorism and \nthat fact alone is worthy of some reflection.\n  For 53 months, between June 1914 and November 1919, World War I \nengulfed Europe. More than 110,000 Americans lost their lives in \ndefense of global security.\n  For 72 months, between September 1939 and September 1945, World War \nII raged across the globe, and required years of peacekeeping and \nreconstruction efforts afterwards. During this tragic conflict nearly \nhalf a million American troops gave their lives not only to bring \nsecurity to America but also to liberate millions of innocent victims \nsuffering under the jackboot of totalitarianism.\n  For 37 months, between June 1950 and July 1953, American troops \nbattled Communist forces on the Korean Peninsula. American troops \nremain in South Korea today to maintain a sometimes fragile cease-fire \nand defend a democratic ally in a war that has yet to end. More than \n30,000 Americans were killed while defending against North Korean and \nChinese Communist aggression.\n  And for nearly 50 years of cold war conflict, American troops were \ndeployed to the edges of the Earth in support of our country's efforts \nto protect free societies from the threat posed by Soviet \ntotalitarianism. During these tense and difficult decades of cold war, \nAmerica did not shirk its responsibility to defend its people and the \nrights of all freedom-loving people. Nor did American politicians put \nprice tags on the defense of democracy and liberty.\n  The global war against terrorism requires, like the Cold War, a \nsustained level of commitment by the United States that is equal to our \nmoral commitment in all of these previous conflicts--perhaps even more \nso--because the terrorists who now confront America do not seek merely \nterritory in a far-off land but are dedicated to the destruction of the \nUnited States and the elimination of free societies wherever they may \nexist. We are fighting an enemy which seeks weapons of mass \ndestruction, not to blackmail democracies but to destroy them.\n  Under the leadership of President Bush, America has made tremendous \nprogress over the last 24 months. We have jailed or otherwise dealt \nwith nearly two-thirds of al-Qaida's leadership and have dismantled \nterrorist sleeper cells, severely curtailing al-Qaida's ability to plan \nand carry out terrorist attacks.\n\n  We have cooperated with international police organizations to arrest \nthousands of terrorists throughout the world, to freeze terrorist \nassets, to increase surveillance of terrorist organizations, and to \nkeep terrorists on the run.\n  We routed al-Qaida from Afghanistan and destroyed its many terrorist \ntraining camps. Under the Taliban government in Afghanistan, terrorists \nfreely plotted the destruction of our cities and the mass murder of our \ncitizens, while an evil government tortured, raped, and killed those \nwho dared to oppose its misrule. The Afghan people are now building a \ndemocratic government and terrorists are no longer welcome in \nAfghanistan.\n  In addition, we ended the regime of Saddam Hussein, a long-time \nsponsor of terrorism and a potential terrorist clearinghouse of weapons \nof mass destruction. We liberated nearly 25 million Iraqis, who for \ngenerations had suffered under Hussein's brutal regime. Now we are \nhelping the Iraqis build for themselves a multiethnic and moderate \ndemocracy in the heart of the Middle East.\n  All these efforts have helped to prevent another terrorist attack on \nAmerican soil despite al-Qaida's unremitting desire to carry out such \nan attack.\n  However, despite our successes, more challenges lie ahead. The \nterrorists are making a desperate stand in Iraq and Afghanistan and we \nmust be firm in our resolve to defeat them. As President Bush said to \nthe Nation this very week:\n\n       The terrorists have a strategic goal. They want us to leave \n     Iraq before our work is done. They want to shake the will of \n     the civilized world. In the past, the terrorists have the \n     examples of Beirut and of Somalia, claiming that if you \n     inflict harm on Americans, we will run from the challenge. \n     They are mistaken.\n\n  For 24 months we have fought to keep America safe from terrorists, \nand with Osama bin Laden calling for American troops to return home, we \nmust not shrink from our responsibilities now.\n  We must confront the terrorists where they live and train; otherwise, \nthey will face us in the streets of our cities. We must continue to \nbring the fight to the enemy or surely he will bring it to us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11380-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today is a day for remembrance and \nreflection. The attacks of September 11, 2001, affected all Americans \nas individuals, as families, and as a Nation. On that day, 2 years ago, \nI told the Omaha World Herald: ``America is forever changed.''\n  We remember today those who died 2 years ago in New York, at the \nPentagon, and in Pennsylvania, as well as those who have since lost \ntheir lives to terrorism in Iraq, Afghanistan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, \nIsrael, Jordan, Pakistan, the Philippines, Yemen, and elsewhere. Their \nsacrifices and service should reinforce our commitment to defeating \nthis new scourge of mankind.\n  History has allowed America no quarter from the heavy burdens of \nleadership. The post-cold-war era of the 1990s now seems like an \ninterlude between two epoch challenges: the cold war and the war on \nterrorism. Just as previous American generations defeated Nazi tyranny \nand contained Soviet expansion, today's war on terrorism requires new \nthinking, commitments, sacrifices, and responsibilities by a new \ngeneration of Americans.\n  Americans can take pride in the courage and determination we have \nshown over the last 2 years. Our young men and women have participated \nin the liberation of Iraq and Afghanistan from brutal tyrannies, and we \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S11381]]\n\nto kill and capture al-Qaida leaders and terrorists and disrupt their \ncells and networks worldwide.\n  Our Foreign Service officers, policemen, firefighters, and health and \nimmigration professionals are on the front lines, at home and abroad, \nin keeping our homeland safe. Their roles have been redefined, along \nwith our understandings of personal and collective security. These are \nbattles joined but not yet won.\n  Two years is but a blip in the span of generations. America is still \nfinding its way, seeking a new center of gravity and balance between \npower and purpose in world affairs. America must approach its foreign \npolicy with a principled realism that reflects our values, acknowledges \nthe realities and challenges we face worldwide, and conveys an \nawareness of the costs and consequences of our actions. Decisions made \ntoday will have global implications for years to come, at a time when \nthere is very little margin for error.\n  America is playing for the next generation around the world. The \nbattle against terrorism cannot be considered in a vacuum from the \nbreeding grounds of poverty and despair in the Islamic world. We need \nto turn the tide in our favor. Our military power and policies must be \nbalanced with a nobility of purpose that conveys America's commitment \nto helping make a better world for all people.\n  The perception of American power will either enhance or diminish our \ninfluence, trust, and respect in the world. America's success will be \ndetermined not only by the extent of its power but by a judicious and \nwise use of it. America must enhance its relationships, not just its \npower. And America should not meet those world challenges alone.\n  At these historic junctures, international alliances and institutions \nwill change and be redefined, as events unfold and realities demand. \nAmerica must lead in reshaping these alliances, institutions, and \nrelationships that have helped support peace and prosperity since World \nWar II. America's interests are not mutually exclusive from the \ninterests of our friends and partners. Our actions abroad cannot be \nseparated from our priorities at home.\n\n  I have spoken across the country and to many Nebraskans about their \nconcerns of the costs of the war on terrorism and building Iraq and \nAfghanistan at the expense of America's economy, health care, \nagriculture, and environment. But we have to understand all of this is \nconnected. Our commitments abroad will require resources and \nsacrifices. But America cannot prosper at home in the absence of \nsecurity and stability abroad. Issues critical to Nebraskans, to \nAmerica, such as trade and economic growth, do not flourish in \nconflict; they wither and die.\n  In thinking of the post-9/11 world, I think of my children and the \nworld that they and all of our children will inherit. The stakes could \nnot be higher.\n  Today America looks upon a world of danger, of risk, but yet \nopportunity. The world looks upon an America that stands astride the \nglobe as no other nation in history. How will the future of the world \nplay out? That is up to us. The world is made up of 190 nations. These \n6.2 billion people represent many religions, cultures, traditions, \nhistories, and ideas. But there is a fundamental common denominator \namong all people--the desire to be free. America's course in the world \nwill be guided by the hallmarks of our national character: courage, \ncompassion, humility, and respect for others.\n  The memory of September 11, 2001, will focus our prayers, lift our \nspirits, and renew our purpose. That is the way those Americans who \ngave their lives on that day would have wanted it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask to speak in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in a period of \nmorning business.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to add my words to those of my \ncolleagues as we take time to remember those who died and who were \ninjured 2 years ago on this very day and at this very time.\n  America will never be the same again. The changes are visceral and \nthey are real. So many innocents were killed by a vicious and evil act. \nWe still can't really comprehend how people could do this kind of \nthing.\n  It has truly been a living nightmare for so many children, wives, \nmothers, fathers, and loved ones. There have been so many candles, so \nmany shattered dreams. September 11, 2001 was a true day of infamy.\n  But the rebuilding has begun and the page is turned. I cannot imagine \nwhat the survivors and family members and friends of those killed have \nendured. My sorrow, my sympathy, and my condolences go to those who \nlost so very much. I hope they understand that they still have the love \nand respect of a sympathetic nation.\n  Here in the Capitol, in the wake of\n9/11, we have come to see that many loopholes exist in the security of \nthis great and free Nation. Some of these are the very result of what \nwe have treasured as part of our freedom, our openness, our democratic \nway of life. And while acknowledging this fact, we in the Senate have \nparticipated in plugging a number of these loopholes in ways we hope \nare designed to protect our country from another catastrophic terrorist \nattack.\n  First, we passed the USA PATRIOT Act, which is legislation that aims \nto make it easier for the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to \nmonitor terror suspects and investigate their financial and personal \nrecords, to improve the sharing of information between law enforcement \nand intelligence-gathering agencies, and to bring Federal law up to \ndate with recent advances in communication technology.\n  It is still amazing to me to realize that 19 terrorists were able to \ncome into this country--most of them on legal visas--and launch an \nattack that killed thousands of our people. But we should also be very \nmuch aware that the 9/11 attacks were no anomaly. In fact, there are \nthousands of other terrorists, just like those 19 hijackers, who are \npoised to strike at the United States and our interests.\n  The CIA Counterterrorism Center estimates that 70,000 to 120,000 \nindividuals trained in Afghanistan terrorist training camps between \n1979 and 2001. Think of that. The Center also says that between 15,000 \nand 20,000 are believed to have been trained by Osama bin Laden. These \npeople are now spread all over the world and in many areas of this \ncountry now.\n  The number of terrorist cells in this country is classified. I cannot \nshare this on the floor of the Senate, but if I did, many people would \nbe both shocked and surprised. So there is no question that the danger \nis real and, unless we find out who the enemy is and stop them before \nthey try to kill us, only suffering and death can result.\n  The USA PATRIOT Act was aimed at helping solve some of the problems \nthat led to missed opportunities before 9/11. This legislation was \nspurred by the fact that key agencies in our Government had bits of \ninformation that, when viewed together, may have revealed details about \nthe hijackers and their plans and prevented 9/11. Unfortunately, these \nbits of information were often held by different law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies and not widely shared--or, in some cases, not \nshared at all.\n  Given the urgency of the war on terror and the inevitability of \nfuture attacks against our country and our interests, I believe there \nis a compelling need for our law enforcement and intelligence agencies \nto be able to gather intelligence to prevent attacks. But the challenge \nis, how can we do this without violating cherished civil rights and \nliberties?\n  Now, the PATRIOT Act was passed with the knowledge that it had been \ndrafted and negotiated quickly. Mr. President, you yourself serve on \nthe same committee I do--Judiciary--and I think it was about 6 weeks \nfrom start to finish that we held hearings, debated the bill, and then \nfinally enacted it. Congress needs to exercise vigorous oversight to \nprevent abuse and to solve\n\n[[Page S11382]]\n\nunintended problems with the legislation. That is one of the reasons \nsome of these sections in the PATRIOT Act are scheduled to sunset in 5 \nyears.\n\n  The USA PATRIOT Act was also passed with the expectation that the \nexecutive branch would limit its new powers to the intended purpose of \nfighting terrorism. Indeed, the breadth and depth of these new powers \nin the act demand careful application and close oversight. And the jury \nis still out as we evaluate the actions taken under this new law.\n  Secondly, after September 11, I learned at a hearing on the \nTechnology and Terrorism Subcommittee of Judiciary that the security \ncontrols for anthrax, smallpox, ebola, and 33 other deadly pathogens \nwere too lax. The FBI and the CDC could not tell us at that time how \nmany people were working with these deadly agents, how much they \npossessed, where these agents were, or where they were being used or \nstored. Moreover, labs conducted no background screening of workers who \nhandled these dangerous agents. As a result, Senator Kyl and I \nintroduced legislation to heighten security and restrict possession of \nthese pathogens. Ultimately, Congress incorporated many of these \nprovisions into the comprehensive bioterrorism bill that was passed in \nJune of last year.\n  Thirdly, Senator Kyl and I also coauthored the Enhanced Border \nSecurity and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002, which seeks to plug \nloopholes in our border security. We have seen over the years that our \nborders are like swiss cheese. This legislation enhances border \nsecurity by, among other things, putting more Federal officers on the \nborder to try to stop possible terrorists from entering our country.\n  Last month, for example, two Pakistani nationals at Seattle-Tacoma \nInternational Airport paid cash for one-way tickets to John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport. The customer agent at the desk checked a \nterrorism-related ``no fly'' list and found both men's names on it. \nLocal police then detained the two men and handed them over to the FBI.\n  The new border security law requires the Federal Government to take \nconcrete steps to restore integrity to the immigration and visa \nprocess. It requires that all visas, passports, and other travel \ndocuments to be fraud- and tamper-resistant and contain biometric data \nby October 26, 2004.\n  Word has reached me that the administration may be requesting a delay \nin this deadline. I hope they will not. I hope that, instead of taking \nthe easy course and saying let's delay that deadline, they take the \nmore constructive and important course and say let's find out what we \ncan do to comply with the law. It is critical and important that they \ndo this.\n  This law also requires all foreign nationals be fingerprinted and, \nwhen appropriate, to submit other biometric data to the State \nDepartment when applying for a visa.\n  These provisions should help eliminate fraud, as well as identify \npotential threats to the country before foreign nationals gain access \nto the United States. That is why that October 26, 2004, deadline is so \nimportant.\n  Now, when we put deadlines into the border security bill, we actually \nconsidered the need to come up with the new technology and the time it \nmight take. We believed that the 2004 date was one that could be \nmet. I, for one, think we should meet it.\n\n  Finally, this law tightened up two programs that were highly \nunregulated and ripe for abuse and have been abused by terrorists: the \nVisa Waiver Program and the Foreign Student Visa Program.\n  Much other work remains to be done. We know all of our ports, all 361 \none of them, are the soft underbelly of homeland security. To emphasize \nthis point, ``ABC News Primetime'' tonight will have a segment \nannouncing the results of an investigation that shows just how porous \nour borders are.\n  As a test, they shipped a suitcase with 15 pounds of depleted uranium \nfrom Jakarta to Singapore to Hong Kong to mainland China, and finally \nto the port of Los Angeles--all without being detected. The suitcase \nwas in a 20-foot container filled with teak furniture.\n  This investigation demonstrates how easily a terrorist could put a \ndirty bomb on a container, ship that container to a port in the United \nStates, then place the container on a train unopened, and move it out \nanywhere into the heartland of our country.\n  To help solve this sort of problem, earlier this year, Senator Kyl \nand I introduced the Antiterrorism and Port Security Act of 2003. This \nbill is still pending. Our distinguished colleague, Senator Schumer, is \na cosponsor, and we are grateful for his support.\n  This legislation would close loopholes in our criminal laws that \nwould allow terrorists to strike against our ports to escape \nappropriate punishment. Many criminal laws don't deal appropriately \nwith port security and were never even contemplated as deterring and \npunishing a terrorist attack on a port, so there are enormous loopholes \nin them.\n  The bill would also help safeguard ports by strengthening security \nstandards and requirements and ensuring greater coordination, and it \nwould better focus our limited cargo inspection resources by improving \nthe existing shipment profiling system and substantially bolstering \ncontainer security.\n  The ``ABC News'' show airing tonight will show that our container \nrisk profiling and inspection system is inadequate. Today, the \nadministration is putting a handful of Customs agents in other \ncountries, to try to push the borders out, and using a risk profiling \nsystem that includes much less information and intelligence that it \ncould. Moreover, fewer than 2 or 3 percent of the containers that come \ninto our country are searched.\n  I would add that over 40 percent of all imported containers in the \nU.S. come through two big ports in my State. I would hate to see a \ndirty bomb come in through the port of Los Angeles, the port of Long \nBeach, or the port of Oakland and be detonated somewhere in the United \nStates. That is all too easy to do still today.\n  Rather than criticize ABC for this show, we should be grateful to \nthem because, once again, their investigative efforts have shown \ndramatically a loophole in the homeland security of this great, free \nsociety.\n  I have also come to truly believe that we need to look deeply at our \nentire intelligence structure in this country. I have been privileged \nto serve on the Select Committee on Intelligence now for a couple of \nyears, and I have seen many indicators that our intelligence structure \nneeds dramatic improvement.\n  Some recommendations for improvement are in the report by the joint \ninquiry into intelligence community activities before and after the \nterror attacks of September 11. One of the most important of these \nrecommendations is the creation of a statutory Director of National \nIntelligence who shall be the President's principal adviser on \nintelligence and have the full range of management, budgetary, and \npersonnel responsibilities necessary to run the entire United States \nintelligence community.\n  Our intelligence community is so big--more than a dozen separate \ndepartments--and yet the individual who is head of the CIA is also \nsupposed to be the head of this entire community. Yet he does not have \nbudgetary and statutory authority over all of the departments. \nConsequently, he cannot transfer positions, and he cannot set \nstrategies among the more than a dozen departments.\n  I believe this is a shortcoming. And I have been joined by others in \nthis belief. I am pleased that the joint inquiry report included the \ncreation of a Director of National Intelligence as one of its \nrecommendations. I am also pleased that Senator Graham of Florida makes \nthis one of the provisions in his bill implementing the report's major \nrecommendations.\n  The current structure of our intelligence community was designed for \npost-cold-war intelligence-gathering agencies in a symmetrical world \nwhere two world powers--the Soviet Union, and the United States--\ndominated. That structured world is no more. We are now in an \nasymmetrical world where intelligence-gathering agencies have to move \nto entirely new and different dimensions. Our current intelligence \nstructure is not set up to allow that to happen.\n  One of the things that has concerned me greatly is that many people \nhave shied away from considering real reform in this area. If I ask \nquestions about restructuring our intelligence community, I am told: \nWell, now is really not the time.\n\n[[Page S11383]]\n\n  I proposed the Director of National Intelligence bill in June 2002 \nand have introduced it again in this Congress. Yet we still have not \nhad a hearing on that bill. It still has not moved. When I make \ninquiries, I am told: Now is really not the time. When is it going to \nbe the time?\n  The Intelligence Committees of both the House and Senate are charged \nwith oversight of the intelligence structure. But I do not believe we \nare doing our job in that respect with respect to the organization of \nour intelligence community.\n  One of the things, also, that I have learned is that man is capable \nof unspeakable violence, and in the case of 9/11, violence was the \nproduct of learned hatred--hatred that was conscientiously taught, that \nwas drummed into tens of thousands, maybe millions, of people. Such \nhatred sows a field of violence and now this violence is all over our \nworld.\n  As The New York Times points out today, in the 2 years since 9/11, \nthe view of the United States as a victim of terrorism deserving the \nworld's sympathy has changed. Remember the Le Monde headline right \nafter 9/11 in France? It was: ``We are all Americans today.''\n  That view has given way to a widespread vision of America as an \nimperial power that has defied world opinion through unjustified and \nunilateral use of force. We must take heed of this and move to remedy \nit. We must listen more; we must build alliances; we must move \nmultilaterally; and we must recognize that we need the help of others. \nYes, we need the help of the United Nations.\n  In a world of asymmetrical warfare and terror, unilateralism is a \nflawed and unworkable doctrine. I believe the last 2 years have \ndemonstrated that point.\n  I hope we take heed, I hope we listen. And I hope as we commemorate \nthis very solemn day that we will dedicate ourselves to that listening, \nto working with alliances, to building partnerships, to encouraging the \nUnited Nations to work with us, and to dispelling arrogance and \nbecoming the humble nation that we said we were going to be.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, we remember the victims of the attack on \nthis country 2 years ago today. Last year, Congress held a special \nsession in New York on this day. As part of those proceedings, the poet \nlaureate of the United States, Billy Collins, read a poem written for \nthe occasion entitled ``The Names.'' He dedicated it to the victims of \nSeptember 11 and to their survivors. I believe it appropriate to reread \nthat poem again here today:\n\n                               The Names\n\n     Yesterday, I lay awake in the palm of the night.\n     A fine rain stole in, unhelped by any breeze,\n     And when I saw the silver glaze on the windows,\n     I started with A, with Ackerman, as it happened,\n     Then Baxter and Calabro,\n     Davis and Eberling, names falling into place\n     As droplets fell through the dark.\n\n     Names printed on the ceiling of the night.\n     Names slipping around a water bend.\n     Twenty-six willows on the banks of a stream.\n\n     In the morning, I walked out barefoot\n     Among thousands of flowers\n     Heavy with dew like the eyes of tears,\n     And each had a name--\n     Fiori inscribed on a yellow petal\n     Then Gonzalez and Han, Ishikawa and Jenkins.\n\n     Names written in the air\n     And stitched into the cloth of the day.\n     A name under a photograph taped to a mailbox.\n     Monogram on a torn shirt.\n\n     I see you spelled out on storefront windows\n     And on the bright unfurled awnings of this city,\n     I say the syllables as I turn a corner--\n     Kelly and Lee,\n     Medina, Nardella, and O'Connor.\n\n     When I peer into the woods,\n     I see a thick tangle where letters are hidden\n     As in a puzzle concocted for children.\n     Parker and Quigley in the twigs of an ash,\n     Rizzo, Schubert, Torres, and Upton.\n     Secrets in the boughs of an ancient maple.\n\n     Names written in the pale sky.\n     Names rising in the updraft amid buildings.\n     Names silent in stone\n     Or cried out behind a door.\n     Names blown over the earth and out to sea.\n\n     In the evenings--weakening light, the last swallows.\n     A boy on a lake lifts his oars.\n     A woman by a window puts a match to a candle,\n     And the names are outlined on the rose clouds--\n     Vanacore and Wallace,\n     (let X stand, if it can, for the ones unfound)\n     Then Young and Ziminsky, the final jolt of Z.\n\n     Names etched on the head of a pin.\n     One name spanning a bridge, another undergoing a tunnel.\n     A blue name needled into the skin.\n     Names of citizens, workers, mothers and fathers,\n     The bright-eyed daughter, the quick son.\n\n     Alphabet of names in green rows in a field.\n     Names in the small tracks of birds.\n     Names lifted from a hat\n     Or balanced on the tip of the tongue.\n     Names wheeled into the dim warehouse of memory.\n     So many names, there is barely room on the walls of the \n           heart.\n\n  Our thoughts and prayers are first and foremost with all those who \nsacrificed their lives on September 11 2 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11383-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 17, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A Senate Joint Resolution 17 (S.J. Res. 17) disapproving \n     the rules submitted by the Federal Communications Commission \n     with respect to broadcast media ownership.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me begin with a brief opening \nstatement about why we are here and what brings us to this point. My \ncolleague from Arizona, who will speak in opposition to this resolution \nof disapproval, is here to make a presentation and my colleague with \nwhom I have worked on this resolution of disapproval, Senator Lott from \nMississippi, is here and will make a statement. I believe others will \narrive as well.\n  Let me describe what we are doing. There is a provision in Federal \nlaw that allows the Congress to effectively veto a rule offered by a \nFederal agency under certain circumstances. This is called the \nCongressional Review Act. I call it a legislative veto. It is rarely \nused. In fact, this is only the second occasion on which it will be \nused. It requires 35 signatures of Senators to discharge a proposition \nfrom a committee and bring it to the Senate floor, with 10 hours of \ndebate. Following the 10 hours of debate, there is then a vote on the \nresolution of disapproval.\n  The specific rule that brings us to the floor today with a resolution \nof disapproval is a rule by the Federal Communications Commission \ndealing with broadcast ownership rules. This is an issue that is \ncontroversial. It is highly charged and very significant. Some\n\n[[Page S11384]]\n\nMembers believe very strongly that what the Federal Communications \nCommission has done is horribly wrong for the interests of this \ncountry.\n  I said at the Commerce Committee when we discussed this, especially \nin the aftermath of the FCC making and announcing its rules, never have \nI seen a Federal agency that is supposed to be a regulatory agency cave \nin so quickly and so completely to the large economic interests. That \nis exactly what I think has happened. It has happened at the expense of \nthe public interest.\n\n  The foundation of our democracy is information. The free flow of \ninformation is what nourishes and refreshes this democracy of ours. \nWhen what the American people see, hear, and read is controlled by \nfewer and fewer interests, in my judgment, it is detrimental to this \ngovernment and to our country.\n  The ruling by the Federal Communications Commission says, among other \nthings, this will be just fine in the future; in America's largest \ncities, one single company can own the dominant newspaper, the dominant \ntelevision station, and two other television stations, eight radio \nstations, and the cable company in that same town. It is just fine. And \nthey can do it in that town and another town and another town and \nanother town, and that is just fine, according to the FCC rule.\n  Pardon my expression, but I think that is absolutely nuts. It is not \nfine--not fine with me, not fine with a good many of my colleagues. \nWhat we design to do is to pass a resolution of disapproval in the \nSenate to say to the Federal Communications Commission: Do it over, and \ndo it right.\n  The Federal Communications Commission held only one public hearing \nbefore embarking on the largest rule change in the history of this \ncountry with respect to ownership of broadcast properties. Having held \nonly one hearing, they then said: Well, let's do this Katie-bar-the-\ndoor approach to allowing the additional concentration and this new \norgy of mergers that almost certainly will occur as a result of this \nrule. They said: Let's allow newspapers to own television stations in \nthe same town, have the same television stations and radio stations \nmarry up.\n  We know what has happened since the 1996 act. Ownership rules have \nchanged; we have seen galloping concentrations. One company in this \ncountry now owns nearly 1,300 radio stations. In one city in North \nDakota, we have eight radio stations. One of them is a religious \nstation, one is a public broadcast station, and six are commercial \nstations. All six are owned by the same company.\n  I ask my colleagues, does anyone think there is a public outcry in \nthis country for the need to have more concentration in broadcast \nownership? Has anyone heard that public outcry? I have not.\n  The airwaves in this country belong to the American people. They do \nnot belong to the broadcast companies. They do not belong to a \ntelevision or radio company. They belong to the American people. We \nlicense them for use by companies that want to send a television or \nradio signal and we say that, attendant to that use, you have certain \nresponsibilities and obligations: Competition, diversity, and localism.\n  What does localism mean? It means we anticipate that when you have a \nproperty to broadcast radio or television signals in your local \ncommunity, you have a responsibility to that community to broadcast \nsome of those local basketball games, talk to the people in the \ncommunity about the local charity event this weekend, tell them about \nwhat is happening on Main Street. That is localism.\n  What do we have these days? All too often we have the concentration \nthat has developed in all broadcast media. Now we have something \ninstead of localism; it is called voice tracking.\n  Do you know what voice tracking is? With this massive amount of \nmergers, with one company owning many stations, voice tracking is that \nwhich occurs when you drive down the street in Salt Lake City, UT, and \nturn on your dial on the radio station and hear someone saying, ``It is \nsunny out here in Salt Lake City this morning,'' and that person may be \nin a basement in Baltimore, MD, broadcasting from a broadcast booth. Do \nyou know what that is called? Voice tracking; ripping a sheet off the \nprinter from the Internet that shows the sun is shining in Salt Lake \nCity so they can pretend they are broadcasting from Salt Lake City, UT, \nfrom a Salt Lake City station, when in fact they are not 1,000 miles \nnear Salt Lake City, they are halfway across the country pretending \nthere is some local element to that radio station.\n\n  That is not moving in the public interest.\n  As we engage in this debate, I want someone to tell me that localism \nis old fashioned. I want someone to tell me that what I consider to be \na transcendent truth about the value of requiring localism in exchange \nfor being able to use the airwaves with a radio or television license \nis somehow an old-fashioned value. For me, it is not.\n  There is so much to say about all of this, and I will speak at great \nlength, but I have a chart that shows where we are with respect to \nthese broadcast properties these days. I will not attempt to tell you \nabout all of this, but the News Corporation, of course, is Fox and \nRupert Murdoch; Clear Channel; Viacom; Disney; AOL/Time Warner. Let me \nuse Disney as an example: Ten television stations, including in New \nYork, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Houston, \nRaleigh, Fresno, Flint, Toledo; 53 radio stations. The ABC Network, \nDisney Channel, ESPN, A, SoapNet, History Channel, Lifetime, Disney \nPictures, Touchstone, Hollywood, Caravan, Miramax. It goes on and on \nand on.\n  People say: What is the big deal here? We have so many more outlets \nin which you can get information. We now have the Internet. We didn't \nused to have that. You have so many different outlets. Do you know \nsomething. Go to your cable system and find out who owns the major \nchannels. The same people. Go to the Internet and find out who owns the \ntop sites on the Internet. The same people.\n\n  So you have many different voices; yes, from the same ventriloquist. \nMany voices, one ventriloquist or two or three or four--at least fewer \nventriloquists in terms of what the American people see, hear, and \nread.\n  I do not accuse the Federal Communications Commission of bad faith. I \nhappen to like the Federal Communications Commissioners. I believe I \nknow all of them personally. The chairman is someone I have had lunch \nwith a couple times. I like him a lot. I just think they have made a \nhorrible mistake, and I think they did it without the due diligence \nthat is required of those in a regulatory commission position.\n  We expect them to be the referees of sorts. We expect them to wear \nthe striped shirts with the whistles that say: We are here to call the \nfouls. We are here on behalf of the public interest to call the game. \nThe fact is, this regulatory agency did exactly what the big economic \ninterests and the broadcasting industry wanted. And they did it cleanly \nand quickly, with minimum nuisance of public participation. There was \nonly one hearing in Richmond, VA.\n  Well, they did get three-quarters of a million pieces of mail and \ncommunications over the Internet saying: Don't do this. It is against \nthe public interest. But it did not matter to the FCC. They did it \nanyway.\n  As a result, I hope this Senate will send a message to the Federal \nCommunications Commission: This rule is a bad rule. This rule opens the \ngates to massive additional concentration, mergers, and acquisition to \nfewer and fewer companies owning more and more properties, at least in \nthe circumstance with respect to broadcasts and newspapers. And, by the \nway, they also eliminate the ban on cross ownership. At least in this \ncircumstance, we don't think it is in the public interest. That is what \nI hope the Senate will tell the Federal Communications Commission \ntoday.\n  By this vote, it will be the first step--a big step--in a process of \nsaying to the Federal Communications Commission: We in Congress veto \nthis rule. You must go back and do it again. Do it over and do it \nright.\n  Mr. President, I have a lot to say today, and I know my colleagues do \nas well. But I think in the interest of time, having described why we \nare here, and the origin of this effort, I will yield the floor. My \ncolleagues from Arizona and Mississippi want to make presentations, \nfollowing which I will again then amplify my remarks.\n\n[[Page S11385]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota \nfor, as always, informing, and sometimes with very startling \ninformation. I still find it very difficult to understand the situation \nthat happened in his State. When there was a toxic spill, and the radio \nstations were attempted to be contacted to alert the population, the \ncitizenry, there was not a single soul in any of the six radio \nstations. All the broadcasting was done from somewhere else. That, \nobviously, was not the intent of the law, the intent of Congress, nor, \nindeed, the intent of the Federal Communications Commission. But these \nexamples happen today.\n  I rise to speak in opposition to S.J. Res. 17, which has already been \ndescribed by my colleague from North Dakota. As a result, pursuant to \nthe Congressional Review Act, these rules would have no force or \neffect, and the FCC would not be able to adopt any similar regulations \nuntil Congress authorized the Commission to do so.\n  I share many of the concerns expressed by my friends from North \nDakota and Mississippi. I oppose the resolution because I believe that \nrejecting the rules without providing further guidance is not an \nappropriate congressional response. In addition, the nullification of \nall of the FCC's new media ownership regulations is, in my opinion, too \nsweeping.\n  Whether we agree with them or not, the FCC's actions are a direct \nresult of the direction given to it by Congress in the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, which should have been called ``Leave \nNo Lobbyist Behind Act of 1996.''\n  And might I add, as we are all responsible for our votes, my \ncolleague from North Dakota voted for that bill, as did my colleague \nfrom Mississippi. I voted against it. I voted against it because I \nthought it was an outrageous exercise of lobbying power and special \ninterest power and would have enormous unintended as well as intended \nconsequences; and the unintended consequences we are dealing with \ntoday.\n  So let's be clear, all of my colleagues, what is the genesis of this \nproblem. That is the 1996 Telecommunications Act. I say so because the \nDC Court of Appeals vacated the 35-percent cap and remanded it back to \nthe FCC. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals found that:\n\n       Congress set in motion a process to deregulate the \n     structure of the broadcast and cable television industries \n     [in the act].\n\n  In fact, the court--I think very appropriately--characterized the \n1996 act's deregulatory tone as not subtle but quite explicit, likening \nit to ``Farragut's order at the battle of Mobile Bay--`Damn the \ntorpedoes! Full speed ahead.' '' That is how the court described the \n1996 deregulatory act that my colleagues are on the floor now examining \nand wanting to reverse.\n  Let's at least take responsibility for our action that set this train \nin motion. I agree with my colleagues, particularly on the issue of \nradio. When there is an example such as what happened in Minot, ND, and \ntestimony before our committee that there is an organization, Clear \nChannel--let's say who they are--that owns, as the Senator from North \nDakota mentioned, 1,300 radio stations, the ticket sales, the \npromotions, and the concerts--artists have come to us and stated \nunequivocally that they have been basically blackmailed and told to do \nconcerts at a certain place or their works would not be played on the \nradio stations.\n  Now, I can't prove that. I am only telling you what information was \ngiven us. So we have a tough situation.\n  The resolution offers neither congressional direction for the FCC's \nnext review of these rules nor a remedy for the infirmities of the \nexisting statute that pushed the FCC to its recent decision. Moreover, \nthe resolution would throw out the entirety of the FCC's action, \nincluding some rules that would actually tighten radio ownership \nlimitations. Finally, the resolution could result in significant \nuncertainty about the status of the FCC's media ownership rules.\n  Let me mention one other thing before I go into a little bit more \nabout this process.\n  As usual, unfortunately, tragically, the Appropriations Committee has \nnow gotten into the act. The Appropriations Committee, I understand, on \nthe Commerce, State, and Justice appropriations bill is now going to \nremove the provision of 35 to 45 percent media ownership, but they are \nnot--they are not--going to touch the cross-ownership aspect of the \nrules that the FCC issued. Why? Why would that be?\n  Well, my dear friends and colleagues, I only know one reason: The \nNational Association of Broadcasters supports the 35 to 45 percent and \nopposes the cross ownership. Which is worse, that a conglomerate owns \nnow 45 percent of the television stations in a market, or a \nconglomerate owns three televisions stations, the newspaper--the Los \nAngeles Times--the Internet, the cable company, and 8 radio stations? \nThat is okay according to the Appropriations Committee. But they are \ngoing to take care of the 35 to 45 percent aspect of it and jam it into \nan appropriations bill, by the way, without a hearing before the \nAppropriations Committee, as usual.\n  The Commerce Committee acted with a piece of legislation that is on \nthe calendar. S. 1046, which passed through the committee, addresses \nthe entire issue. Do you think we will get S. 1046 before this body \nbefore this year ends, my friends? No. But we will have to fight like \nblazes a one single shot provision that has been placed in an \nappropriations bill, in clearly a gross excess of their \nresponsibilities, which are to fund authorized programs.\n  So I guess if there is any lack of cynicism amongst my colleagues \nabout this whole process we are undergoing right now, any lack of \ncynicism should be dispelled by the actions of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Whether we agree with them or not, as I mentioned, those actions are \na direct result of the 1996 act.\n  In short, if the Congress is unsatisfied with the result of the FCC \nreview, it should step in to provide new direction. Simply saying, \n``You got it wrong, try again,'' in my view, is not an appropriate \nresponse.\n  Although they are not provided in the resolution before us, new \ndirections to the FCC have been provided and reported out of the \nCommerce Committee. The bill is on the Senate calendar awaiting action. \nThe bill would establish explicit, sustainable media ownership limits \nwhile preserving new radio ownership rules tightened by the FCC in its \nJune 2 order.\n  While I don't support the resolution, I do support S. 1046. I have \nnot always supported retaining strict limits on media consolidation, \nand in the past I have spoken frequently about the merits of \nderegulation of media markets. Over the years, I have written letters \nto the FCC insisting that they deregulate in this area of media \nmarkets. Moreover, even a few years ago, I offered legislation to raise \nthe national television station ownership cap to 50 percent and to \neliminate limits on newspaper and broadcast cross-ownership. I continue \nto believe in the principle of allowing markets, and not government, to \nregulate the way businesses operate.\n  After chairing seven hearings on media ownership and observing \nunprecedented public outcry, it is apparent to me that the business of \nmedia ownership, which can so affect the nature and quality of our \ndemocracy, is too important to be dealt with so categorically. As a \nresult, I have come to believe that stringent, but reasonable, limits \non media ownership may very well be appropriate.\n  It is a testament to the vitality and health of our democracy that \nthe public mobilized to defend what they perceived as a challenge to \nthis democracy. If Congress is displeased with the Commission's new \nrules, however, we must accept some responsibility for them. Congress \nand the courts gave the Commission little choice but to deregulate the \nmedia industry. When the D.C. circuit court of Appeals vacated the 35 \npercent cap and remanded it back to the FCC for further consideration, \nit found that ``Congress set in motion a process to deregulate the \nstructure of the broadcast and cable television industries'' in the \nAct. In fact, the court characterized the 1996 Act's deregulatory tone \nas not subtle, but quite explicit, likening it to ``Farragut's order at \nthe battle of Mobile Bay--`Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead.'''\n  Led by the able chairman, Michael Powell, the Commission followed the \ndirection of Congress and the courts.\n\n[[Page S11386]]\n\nThe commission incrementally increased the network ownership cap to 4.5 \npercent finding that a ``modest relaxation of the cap will help \nnetworks compete more effectively with cable and DBS operators and will \npromote free, over-the-air television by deterring migration of \nexpensive programming to cable networks.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article by Michael K. Powell that \nappeared in the Wall Street Journal this morning be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 11, 2003]\n\n                        And That's the Way It Is\n\n                         (By Michael K. Powell)\n\n       The days of free television may be numbered. We are in the \n     midst of change that is having a dramatic effect on how we \n     watch television. Consider how much the television landscape \n     has altered in the past two decades. It used to be that the \n     ``big three'' networks, ABC, CBS and NBC were just about the \n     only game in town. In those ``glory days'' of television, \n     when Walter Cronkite left us each night with his famous ``And \n     that's the way it is,'' the big three were ``the only way it \n     was''--our only sources of television programming. If you \n     wanted to watch sports you turned to the big three. Want to \n     watch the movie of the week? Turn to the big three. Saturday \n     morning cartoons? Turn to the big three. With over 80% of the \n     viewing audience watching free TV, it was good to be a \n     broadcaster.\n       Today, much of the high-quality sports (ESPN, Fox Sports), \n     movies (HBO, Showtime, Starz, Independent Film Channel), \n     mini-series (Hallmark Channel), documentaries (History and \n     Discovery Channels), children's programming (Nickelodeon, \n     Disney Channel, Cartoon Network), minority-oriented \n     programming (BET, Univision) and breaking news (CNN, MSNBC, \n     Fox News) can be found on pay television. The migration of \n     top programming to pay television is demonstrated by the fact \n     that cable, for the first time, surpassed broadcast \n     television in all-day viewing share and this summer cable \n     claimed an all-time high 60% of the prime-time television \n     audience. And the quality of programming now on pay \n     television is embodied in its unprecedented success in recent \n     Emmy awards and nominations.\n       Why is this happening? For those in the business of pay \n     television, there are two main sources of income, \n     subscription fees and advertising. Free television has only \n     one source--advertising. As the cost of quality programming \n     increases (``Friends,'' for example, costs a reported $10 \n     million per episode), so too does the pressure to place those \n     shows on cable or satellite. To stem these rising programming \n     costs, free television has turned to low-budget programming \n     such as reality shows and daytime talk shows.\n       Moreover, producers and creators of television shows often \n     are lured to the greater creative freedom of pay television. \n     Pay television programmers enjoy greater first amendment \n     protection against government content regulation than their \n     broadcast counterparts. This is why a show like ``The \n     Sopranos,'' too risque for the big three networks who passed \n     on airing the series, can be enjoyed by millions each week on \n     HBO. It also allows the possibility of running a show \n     commercial-free. For us viewers, pay television offers \n     programming that is tailored to our personal interests, be it \n     24-hour tennis, golf, news, history, food or game shows. On \n     free television, we get television created for the masses, on \n     a date and time of the network programmer's choosing.\n       To survive, free TV must improve its competitive position \n     against pay television and find a way to innovate and offer \n     personalized television experiences that today's viewers have \n     come to enjoy and expect. The future of free television is, \n     at best, uncertain and, at worst, in peril.\n       The shift to pay television and the value it has brought to \n     the television viewer over the course of the last 20 years \n     begs a question--do we even need free television? From a \n     public policy perspective, I believe the answer is yes--we \n     absolutely need to maintain a viable free television service \n     for the welfare of our citizens. Free broadcast television \n     remains an important service for those citizens that cannot \n     afford pay television. Additionally, free television \n     continues to play a vital role in informing the public during \n     national and local emergencies and in serving the interests \n     of their local communities.\n       That's why this past June, the FCC passed a new set of \n     broadcast ownership limits, modernizing a regulatory regime \n     that was made for the bygone era of the big three to reflect \n     today's dynamic media marketplace. Those rule modifications \n     were made, in part, to strengthen free television to give it \n     a chance to remain viable for our citizens to enjoy for \n     decades to come. For example, by setting a slightly revised \n     national television ownership limit, the FCC will help the \n     networks attract and maintain quality programming, from the \n     World Series and Olympics to the next great TV series like \n     ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' or ``The West Wing.'' Other rule \n     changes, such as allowing cross-ownership or the ownership of \n     more than one local television broadcast outlet in some \n     markets, will bring consumers more and better quality local \n     news coverage and will help fund the transition to high \n     definition digital television, potentially giving free \n     television the ability to provide new innovative services to \n     the public well into the 21st century.\n       These changes have been under attack from some in Congress. \n     A rush headlong into re-regulating free television is afoot, \n     and if successful, would prove disastrous. Bringing free \n     television into a more hostile regulatory environment will \n     continue to drive investment to pay television and drive more \n     sports and creative programs to pay television. It may just \n     drive free television to pay television altogether, as Bob \n     Wright, CEO of NBC, once suggested that he might shut down \n     NBC and simply move it to cable. Moreover, in its wake, this \n     hostile regulatory climate will stymie the transition to \n     digital broadcast television leaving broadcasters with ill-\n     suited analog tools to work in a digital world--in turn \n     denying the American public the use of a primary spectrum for \n     future wireless innovation and services.\n       Free television will not disappear tomorrow. Many remain \n     profitable with low budget reality shows and other \n     programming. In the face of increasing competition from an \n     ever expanding array of pay television programming, however, \n     the government must be careful not to hasten its demise. Free \n     television has been an important service to the American \n     public for over 50 years. If our efforts do not provide free \n     television with the ability to better compete in today's \n     vibrant media marketplace, we risk losing its services for \n     the next 50 years. And that's the way it is.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, two networks, Viacom/CBS and News Corp. \nhave been operating at almost 40 percent for almost 2 years now due to \nstay from courts and waivers from the FCC. The Commission also relaxed \nits cross-ownership rules by permitting combinations of multiple \ntelevision, radio, and newspaper outlets in more American media \nmarkets.\n  The Commission had limited discretion in its decision-making process. \nWe, however, do not. If Congress is displeased with the results of the \nCommission's review, it should legislate a solution, not just \ndisapprove of the Commission's actions. Unlike the Commission, Congress \nconsists of elected officials who must consider the views of the \nAmerican public, not court mandates and statutory directives, when \ntackling difficult questions like the ones posed here.\n  The public has strongly voiced its dissatisfaction with the new \nrules. The Commission received more public comments about its media \nownership proceeding than any other proceeding. My office continues to \nreceive numerous letters, phone calls, and e-mails from the public \naddressing the new rules. As representatives of the public, Congress \nshould take a lead role in examining these rules, and if necessary, \ncrafting new limits.\n  As William Safire wrote recently in an Op-Ed piece in the New York \nTimes, itself a large owner of several media outlets: ``The effect of \nthe media's march to amalgamation on Americans' freedom of voice is too \nworrisome to be left to three unelected commissioners. This far-\nreaching political decision should be made by Congress and the White \nHouse, after extensive hearings and fair coverage by too-shy \nbroadcasters, no-local-news cable networks and conflicted newspapers.''\n  In discussing this resolution, we must also be mindful that its \npassage would roll back all of the FCC's rules, even those that \ntightened radio ownership limits. The Telecommunications Act eliminated \nthe national radio ownership cap thereby allowing one company to grow \nat an unprecedented pace from 40 to more than 1,200 radio stations, \nincluding ownership of 6 of the 7 commercial radio stations in Minot, \nND. At a hearing before the Commerce Committee, all five FCC \nCommissioners agreed that the consolidation of radio that has occurred \nin local markets has been excessive.\n  This brings me to the issue we must continue to discuss and to which \nI don't know the answer: How much is too much? In my home State of \nArizona, Gannett owns a newspaper and a television station. Is that \nbad? I have seen no ill effects of it. I have seen no consolidation \nproblems, no collusion between the two, no problem with the citizens of \nmy State receiving correct and accurate and unbiased information. What \nif Gannett owned two television stations, or three stations or four \nstations? What is the point, I ask my colleagues--and that requires an \nincredible amount of knowledge, which I admit I don't possess, as to \nwhat the proper degree of media concentration is allowable.\n\n[[Page S11387]]\n\n  Then you have a difference in markets. Minot, ND--with all due \nrespect to the large population of North Dakota--I think has 27,000 or \n37,000 people--higher than that. The valley which I was just describing \nhas over 3 million people. So it is not only a problem of the criterion \nitself for ownership, it also has a lot to do with large or small \npopulations.\n  I don't think a small town is going to have five television stations \nor eight television stations. So should the owner of the television \nstation in Greenwood, MS, be allowed to own the newspaper? Is that \ncontrol there? That may be excessive. But in Phoenix, AZ, ownership of \none television station and a newspaper clearly is not of significant \nimpact.\n  So this is why it is important that we continue to examine these \nissues carefully and try to get the best knowledge and information we \nhave.\n  But I think there is one area of agreement, whether we succeed or \nwhether the proponents of the CRA succeed: There is too much \nconcentration in radio. I know of no credible person who disagrees with \nthat. While it received little credit amid the outcry against the \nregulations, the FCC attempted to address this problem by prescribing \nnew market definitions designed to tighten the limits on local radio \nownership.\n\n  This resolution would therefore have the perverse consequence of \neliminating efforts taken by the Commission to strengthen its radio \nownership rules--a move that surely would be applauded in the corporate \noffices of large radio station groups that hope to perpetuate their \nability to benefit from existing loopholes. Moreover, the resolution \nwould limit the FCC's ability to reinstate its more stringent radio \nmarket definition, because the CRA precludes the FCC from adopting \nrules ``in substantially the same form'' as those that have been \ndisapproved without further direction from Congress.\n  Finally, the use of the CRA in the present case will create a \nregulatory void likely to be filled only by uncertainty about the \nstatus of the FCC's media ownership rules. The absence of an \naffirmative Congressional directive will cast considerable doubt on the \nenforceability of the FCC's previous rules, given that one of the FCC's \nprevious attempts to retain the rules was found by the D.C. Circuit to \nbe arbitrary and capricious, and another was found not to have \njustified that the rules are ``necessary in the public interest.'' In \nboth cases, the D.C. circuit remanded the rules to the FCC and directed \nthe agency to either articulate a justification for retaining the rules \nor modify them. The lack of an enforceable FCC order will leave these \ncourt orders unanswered, risking additional court action that relaxes \nthe rules even further, or even invalidates them entirely.\n  Moreover, passage of this resolution would appear to set up the FCC \nfor failure when conducting its next biennial review in 2004. In that \nproceeding, the FCC will likely have to justify its new rules before a \ncourt that has stated that the Telecommunications Act sets in motion a \nprocess of deregulation, while remaining mindful of Congress' \ndisapproval of its 2002 Biennial Review. Chairman Powell has stated \nthat the courts placed ``a high hurdle before the Commission for \nmaintaining a given regulation, and made clear that failure to surmount \nthat hurdle, based on a thorough record, must result in the \nrule's modification or elimination.'' Moreover, the Commission will \nalso be forced to explain how it reached a different conclusion after \npreviously having made extensive findings that undercut the network \nownership cap and cross-ownership limits. Whatever action the \nCommission takes will be ripe for challenge by an unsatisfied party.\n\n  These rules have been mired in litigation for too long. If Congress \nbelieves that it is appropriate to retain certain ownership \nrestrictions under today's market conditions, then it should pass \nlegislation explicitly stating so. Again, S. 1046 is the appropriate \nlegislative vehicle to achieve this goal.\n  The Commission did its job by promulgating new rules after completing \nan intense twenty-month review. During that time the Commission \nreviewed twelve studies it commissioned to gather empirical evidence on \nthe media industry, and studied over 500,000 public comments to better \nunderstand the media marketplace. As Mr. Safire suggested, it is now \ntime for Congress to do its job. Congress has spent the past few months \nstudying the previous rules, digesting the new rules, and holding \nmultiple hearings on this issue. I have come to appreciate the \nimportance of appropriate limits on media ownership. The media has a \ntremendous impact on the everyday lives of all Americans. By selecting \nand framing issues and ideas and promoting public discourse, the media \nfacilitate a critical function in our democracy. It is now time for \nCongress to offer guidance, not simply reject the FCC's rules.\n  My decision to oppose this resolution has been a difficult one for \nme, in large part, because I hold the senior senator from North Dakota \nin such high regard. I commend Senator Dorgan for his leadership in \nbringing the issue of media ownership to the attention of his \ncolleagues. Earlier this year, he raised the now-famous issue of radio \nownership in Minot, ND, in the Senate Commerce Committee. That issue \nwas the catalyst for the Committee's subsequent review of media \nownership, which included seven hearings this year. Few, if any, \nmembers of the Commerce Committee or the Senate understands the \nintricacies of this issue better than Senator Dorgan.\n  Finally, I thank colleagues for their interest and involvement in \nthis issue--especially three colleagues on the Commerce Committee: \nSenators Wyden, Lott, and Dorgan. They have been incredibly involved in \nthese issues. We have had some of the best hearings I have ever \nparticipated in on these issues. I think we have contributed not only \nto the knowledge of our colleagues but to that of the American people.\n  I want to commit, no matter how it comes out today, that we will \ncontinue to bring the Commissioners before the committee, bring the \nsmartest people we can find before the committee, and move forward in \nan orderly legislative process. I hope one of the things we can do as \nearly as possible is get consideration of the legislation that we \npassed through the committee, after careful deliberation and discussion \nand a very spirited markup.\n  So I thank my colleagues. I think this is an important part of the \ndebate and, for sure, we will be discussing this issue for a long time.\n  I ask Members to vote against S.J. Res. 17 but support passage of S. \n1046.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution which \nwould disapprove the new media ownership rules passed by the Federal \nCommunications Commission on June 2 of this year. I must say, in \nlistening to the chairman of the Commerce Committee, I share a lot of \nhis concerns and questions. I know from my discussions with him, and he \nknows, we need to do more in this area, and he believes the FCC ruling \nmay not have hit the target in every area. He makes a good case about \nthe difference in the size of the markets, from Phoenix to Jackson, to \nMinot, and other areas. Maybe he has touched on the answer. Maybe we \nneed some sort of a tiered arrangement.\n  I think in this case the fundamental policy is the one that really \nmatters; that is, cross-ownership is not good. I think there are things \nyou lose when you have the same newspaper chain owning one or two or \nthree of the local radio stations and the same number of local \ntelevision stations.\n  I have a background, to a degree, in radio. My mother worked for a \nlocal radio station, WPMP/WPMO, which served Pascagoula and Moss Point. \nShe was a bookkeeper. She did the logs, and then she did some \nannouncing. She was the first woman's voice I had ever heard on a \nradio. And I did a program in high school for the local high school. \nThis station was local, personal, and involved in the community. They \nwere part of the community, and they were involved in the Chamber of \nCommerce. They had remotes, and if you opened a new furniture store on \nMarket Street, they would go down there with a remote and would say: \nCome down to see the new furniture store here and maybe win a lamp. It \nwas very personal.\n\n  We have lost that involvement. I have a different attitude than \nSenator McCain in my thinking: It's OK to have these big radio chains, \nbut I have to acknowledge that we have lost something\n\n[[Page S11388]]\n\nin the process. We have lost some localism. We don't have any in my \nhometown anymore. WPMP and WPMO have limited exposure. I don't know who \nowns them. If you want local news, you have to listen to a radio \nstation 19 miles away in Biloxi, WBMI.\n  This is my question: If that has not worked out, if there are \nconsolidations, if one or two companies own an overwhelming number of \nradio stations, do we want that to happen in television? We already \nhave all these chains that gobbled up our local newspapers. I don't \nknow where these people come from or get their ideas that come in with \nthese big chains. They worry me about some of the things they do and \ntheir idea of how they should report the news in local communities.\n  I have a real problem with what happened at the FCC in this instance. \nI want to emphasize this: This is not a newfound position. This is a \nposition I have had for basically 30 years in Congress.\n  First, I am not one who thinks big is always bad. I don't believe we \nhave to keep it small. I want the American people to have more of \neverything--more choices, more opportunities, more diversity, more \ncompetition. That is great. I am all for that.\n  I am also one who has voted many times for deregulation. It has not \nalways worked out perfectly. I am not as theoretically pure on \nderegulation as I used to be. I voted to deregulate trucking and \nderegulate the airlines, and I am for deregulation as much as possible \nin this area. But this is a little different now. This gets into First \nAmendment rights. It does get into the airwaves and who owns them. It \ndoes get into what happened with the networks and the chains.\n  Do the American people really feel good about what is happening with \nthe media in America? No. Check the polls. Check the people.\n  This very morning I talked with my mother. She is 90 years old. She \nsaid: You weren't born in the backwoods.\n  I said: What are you talking about?\n  She said: You were born in Grenada Hospital, a small town, but it \nwasn't the backwoods, and they always make it sound like you are \nAbraham Lincoln coming out of some log cabin, which is fine, I like \nthat politically. But my mother was offended that they had reported \nincorrectly as to my background.\n  I said: Mother, relax, nobody pays attention to that. These people \nwrite stuff they think will make the story sound more interesting, \nembellish the truth. You know that. This very morning we talked about \nthis.\n  This is not about personality. This is not about revenge. This is not \nabout prevailing in a position. This is about doing what is right and \nin the best interest of the American people.\n  I recommended the Chairman of the FCC Michael Powell to President \nClinton for a Republican vacancy when I was serving as Majority Leader. \nThat was my prerogative. That is the way we worked things out with \nPresident Clinton and, by the way, he had been recommended to me by \nSenator McCain. This is not about personality. I like the Democrats and \nRepublicans on the FCC. I find them to be highly qualified, good \npeople. I just think they missed the target this time. By the way, who \nhas the ultimate say for the American people on something such as this? \nShould it be these Commissioners? Should it be this agency? Or should \nthe Congress have a little say in this? Shouldn't we at least have the \nright to say: Wait, this is a dangerous thing for freedom, information, \nand democracy in America. Go back and do it again. We have that right. \nIn fact, I think we have that responsibility.\n\n  This is not partisan. In fact, there are 20 cosponsors, or more, of \nthis disapproval resolution. I know for sure in addition to myself \nthere is Senator Hutchison from Texas, Senator Snowe from Maine, \nSenator Collins from Maine, and Senator Allard from Colorado and \nSenator Chambliss from Georgia both signed the discharge petition for \nthis resolution. So you see there are Republicans and Democrats, small \nState Senators, big State Senators. Colorado, Texas, and Georgia are \nnot exactly small places.\n  By the way, they have seen some pretty interesting examples of what \nhappens in Dallas or Atlanta with that sort of consolidation.\n  What would this disapproval resolution do? If it is passed, if it \ngets through the Senate and House and the President signs it, the FCC \nwill have to take another look. They might come back and say: We will \ndo these modifications or we will go with half of this or not all of \nthis, and they may need more action from the Commerce Committee and \nfrom the Congress. Great, we can do that. The President may veto this \nresolution. I think that would be a mistake.\n  We are coming at this issue on all fronts. We are going after the \nissue with a resolution of disapproval and we will go after it in the \nappropriations bill, if we have to. I prefer we do it through the \nauthorization bill, as Senator McCain said. I don't like the \nAppropriations Committee always having to do our work because we will \nnot or cannot find the time to get it done.\n  The Commerce Committee voted. We reported out S. 1046. I am a \ncosponsor of it. Senator Stevens of Alaska is for that bill. I believe \nSenator McCain said he would be supportive of that bill. If we fail \nhere, we will be back here, there, and everywhere because this is a \nvery critical issue.\n  Let me go back to the process. I was worried when I saw this \ndeveloping. I had a feeling it was not going right. The proof was that \nwe were having trouble getting information about exactly what they were \ngoing to do.\n  On April 9, 2003, I joined a large bipartisan group from Congress in \nsending a letter--most of the signers are on the Commerce Committee--to \nChairman Powell and the Commission saying we were disappointed that the \nFCC-revised ownership rules would be released in final form June 2 \nwithout any opportunity for the Congress or the public to review them \nbeforehand, in effect saying: Wait a minute, have more hearings; come \nsee us about this. They pretty much summarily ignored that letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter to the Commission be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 2003.\n       Dear Chairman Powell: We note with disappointment your \n     announcement that the FCC's revised media ownership rules \n     will be released in final form June 2nd without any \n     opportunity for the Congress or the public to review them \n     beforehand. We believe it is virtually impossible to serve \n     the public interest in this extremely important and highly \n     complex proceeding without letting the public know about and \n     comment on the changes you intend to make to these critical \n     rules.\n       While the Commission and its staff have amassed a \n     significant record of comments to date on current media \n     ownership rules, the Commission has not put forth any \n     specific changes it is planning.\n       Dramatic changes in the structure of our media marketplace \n     could have long-term consequences on the diversity of voices \n     and free expression in our nation. Given the gravity of this \n     proceeding, we are puzzled as to why the FCC would not insist \n     on having a thorough discussion about any proposed changes \n     before these would take effect. Openness in this process is \n     the best path to ensure that Congress and the public support \n     the agency's direction.\n       We again urge the Commission to provide full disclosure of \n     any proposed changes before they are made final.\n           Sincerely,\n         Olympia J. Snowe, Byron L. Dorgan, Ernest F. Hollings, \n           Trent Lott, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Daniel K. Inouye, \n           John D. Rockefeller, Ron Wyden, Barbara Boxer, Bill \n           Nelson, Maria Cantwell, Frank R. Lautenberg, Susan M. \n           Collins, Patty Murray, Wayne Allard, U.S. Senators.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't think they reached out and listened \nenough. I know the committee was worried about it. Then they--poof--\nmade their decisions, and then they came before the Commerce Committee \nto explain it. I have to tell you, I scratched my head at some of their \nexplanations, particularly their explanation of the media ownership cap \nat 35 percent and why it should be raised to 45 percent. The 35 percent \ncap is a position I supported back in the midnineties and earlier. We \nhad a huge debate as to whether it should be 25 or 35. Senator Dorgan \nwanted 25. I think I supported that, but we finally went along with 35 \npercent.\n  When questioned on that issue, the chairman said something to the \nfact that a couple of the networks are above or at this cap now so we \nshould raise it to 45. Does that mean when they get to 45, we are going \nto raise it to 55? I\n\n[[Page S11389]]\n\nadmit we can have disagreements on the cap. Maybe it should be this \nlevel, a little higher, a little lower. I would rather have no caps \nthan have this creeping raising of caps.\n  Should we have some restraint on the reach of one network owned by \nthese corporate giants? I think so. Am I mad at one network or the \nnetworks versus the cable? No. This is ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox--it is \nall of them. I just think that some limits are appropriate, which would \ngive a greater variety of voices--and also I worry about more and more \ndominance by the networks.\n  Local affiliates, if you get them off in a corner, say they don't \nwant the cap to be raised. Local affiliates say: We don't like a lot of \nthe programming; it is trashy, worthless; we would rather have local \nprogramming. Boy, they have trouble now. You don't think the networks \ndon't tell them: You are going to run what we send you in Jackson, \nMississippi, or Portland, Oregon, or a small town in Oregon? I don't \nlike that.\n  Again, localism is good for the people--some choice, some discretion. \nThat is one of the things at risk here.\n  Let me emphasize, we have an unusual alliance on this issue. We have \nthe Actor's Equity Association. I generally don't team up with actors, \nother than in the Senate. We have the AFL-CIO, the National \nOrganization for Women. Then we get over to the Family Research Council \nand the National Rifle Association. This is the far, far, far left and \nthe far right, and everything in between, I think.\n  Here is an interesting thing about this alliance. This is a diverse \ngroup, and they generally represent people, individuals. That is why \nthey have had this avalanche of mail at the FCC opposing these \nregulations. I understand perhaps it is the largest number of comments \nto the FCC of any issue in history. The groups here represent \nindividuals, generally speaking, not big or corporate interests. I like \nbeing identified with those people.\n  I like worrying about what the fishermen in Biloxi, Mississippi, are \ngoing to be able to hear and see, and that they have choices. So this \nis a very important issue and it is one we should act on.\n  The Majority Leader has been very cooperative with this. He could try \nto maneuver this around or push this off, but he was reasonable, as was \nSenator Dorgan, and I am glad to be involved in this effort.\n  I do want to emphasize that personally I am less concerned about the \ncap than I am about the cross-ownership. I think we ought to repeal the \nnew rules as to both, but my major worry is this consolidation of \nnewspaper, television, radio, cable, the works, and how in towns the \nsize of Jackson, Mississippi, one entity is controlling everything. I \ndo not know that it is that dangerous to people. People are smarter \nthan we are, and the media, for sure. They would just watch it, dismiss \nit, and not put much stock in it, but I would still like for them to \nhave that choice.\n  By the way, we should note that the court has also stepped in. The \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia placed an injunction, a \nstay, of the new rules so Congress could have more time to officially \noverride them if we see fit. That is what this is all about.\n  I do not think anybody should be apologetic for supporting this or \nworried about what the impact is. This is part of the process. I do not \nwant to get all caught up in process, but I think what is at stake here \nis bigger than process. This will have long-lasting effects, and once \nwe start down this trail unwinding that Gordian knot we would be tied \nto in community after community in America, it would be difficult, if \nnot impossible, to do something.\n  I urge my colleagues not to worry about the personalities, not to \nworry about the threat of a veto, not to worry about the threat of a \nnetwork or a newspaper or a chain. What can they do to each and every \none of us that they have not already done? Worry about what is at \nstake, and it is really fundamental. This gets to what makes this \ncountry great, and that is the ability to have diversity of opinion and \narguments, different points of view.\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to step up, let us \nvote for this disapproval resolution. We put this process in place for \na reason. We have been very careful about using it. This is only the \nsecond time in the history of this disapproval resolution process that \nit has been used, but this is a good one to do it on. I am delighted to \njoin with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in supporting this \ndisapproval resolution and I thank Senator Dorgan for the courtesies he \nhas extended along the way, and I am glad to work with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution. \nI particularly want to commend my colleague from North Dakota, Mr. \nDorgan, and our friend from Mississippi, Senator Lott, as well, for \ntheir bipartisan efforts.\n  I believe I have sat through every minute of these hearings because I \nbelieve what the Commerce Committee has been looking at is \nextraordinarily important. I want to take a few minutes today to \noutline for the Senate and others who are just beginning to get \ninvolved in this issue what I think is at stake.\n  First, I think it is important to be clear about what is ahead. In my \nview, the big media conglomerates want to make a meal out of the \nNation's small media outlets, and I believe the Senate needs to step in \nand cancel this feast. That is what this resolution would do and why it \nis so important.\n  I would like to begin, in discussing this issue, by talking about the \nfact that the Senate has been down this road before. In the discussion \nwith respect to radio, there was considerable debate about the \nderegulation of radio at the time. Extensive testimony was taken. \nArguments were made that this was an experiment that should be allowed \nto go forward. In 1996, the Congress relaxed the limits on radio \nstation ownership. What we heard during our hearings, and I asked \nChairman Powell about this specifically with respect to radio, was \ntruly alarming.\n  Chairman Powell, under questioning that I engaged him in in \ncommittee, admitted now there was a problem with respect to \nconcentration of radio. Chairman McCain attested to it as well this \nafternoon. So the challenge now for the Senate is to make sure the \nSenate does not allow a repeat of the failed media experiment.\n  What went on in radio is something that has not worked. It is an \nexperiment, where the drawbacks outweigh the advantages. The Senate has \nan opportunity to make sure that the failed experiment that has taken a \ntoll on localism, choice, and diversity across this country is not to \nbe repeated. In my view, it is the centerpiece of the argument as to \nwhy this resolution is so important.\n  There are not a lot of rallies outside the offices of Senators for \nbig media kind of feeding frenzies. All of the input has essentially \nbeen the other way. The public has been concerned that as the \nconglomerates get bigger, the diet of news in particular is going to \nget blander and certainly less diverse and less locally oriented and \nmore mass produced.\n  We have been very troubled about what we have seen in our home State \nof Oregon. In Eugene, OR, for example, a network affiliate wanted to \nshift around program time slots so it could offer the city's first 10 \np.m. newscast. It was not going to cut programming. It was going to \nshift some of the schedules. The network said no, because they wanted \nto maintain what they described as a consistent nationwide distribution \npattern.\n  As a result, Eugene residents still have no 10 p.m. news program even \nthough the local station, a family-owned business, wanted to offer it.\n  The lesson has been clear. For the network, nationwide business \njudgments trump local interests. That is the story of what has happened \nin Eugene. The big networks may claim they are fully committed to \nlocalism, but in practice they behave differently than a truly local \nowner would.\n  When they came before the committee, I asked about this issue and \nthey said, it is a free country. That local network affiliate does not \nhave to take network programming 7 to 8, or 8 to 9, or 9 to 10. It is a \nfree country. They can make their own choices.\n  Essentially, the freedom they have described for a local affiliate is \nthe freedom to go broke. A local affiliate cannot, in effect, write off \nnetwork\n\n[[Page S11390]]\n\nprogramming for most of the evening because they are committed to \npublic service news and the opportunity for citizens to be heard.\n  There has to be a balance. There has to be a balance between national \njudgments and local judgments, and I believe the Federal Communications \nCommission would skew that balance. They would skew it towards a media \nthat was less sensitive to local concerns and local interests, and \nwould be less diverse and offer fewer choices. I believe that is why \nthese rules need to be maintained so as to have a proper balance rather \nthan a skewed approach to media regulation in our country as the \nFederal Communications Commission's approach would do.\n  If we look at the media landscape today, it is pretty hard to argue \nthat the Federal Communications Commission is holding the reins too \ntightly at present. Concentration is already on the rise in television, \nradio, cable, and newspapers. Viacom, News Corporation, AOL/Time \nWarner, Walt Disney, and others have amassed a very broad and extensive \narray of media properties, and it would seem to me that given the trend \ntowards concentration at present, the current FCC's rules are even more \nimportant than before.\n  I think what it comes down to is that the Federal Communications \nCommission's approach is going to take a toll on several vital areas of \nthe public's interest. I believe, for example, that the diversity of \nviewpoints in medium-size towns across the country will be reduced if \nthe same company owns the local newspaper, the most watched television \nstations, local radio stations, and perhaps the cable system, too. We \nheard testimony to that effect in the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  If each of these media outlets at the local level are part of a big \nnationwide chain that is making programming decisions at corporate \nheadquarters thousands of miles away, what is going to be the bottom \nline emphasis? Are those people at distant conference tables thousands \nof miles from our local communities going to put the kind of focus on \nlocal news and local programming that my constituents want? The \nevidence suggests otherwise.\n  With respect to creativity and independent content, if the local \ncable system, the local broadcaster, and the main satellite providers \nin effect are able to control substantial programming interests, we do \nhave a way to preserve the kind of local orientation that our citizens \nfeel so strongly about. If that changes, and I believe it would change \nunder the Federal Communications Commission approach, I think what is \ngoing to happen in the future is everywhere independent programmers \nturn, they are going to be told by the national interests, by these \nnational economic powers: Sorry, but we have to give preference to the \nprograms that we produce in-house, rather than the local cable system, \nthe local broadcaster, the main satellite providers who, today, offer \nso much creativity and diverse programming for local communities.\n  Finally, it seems to me that the Federal Communications Commission \napproach is going to take a toll on objective news coverage. With \nrespect to news outlets reporting independently on issues that affect \nthe parent companies, you ought to begin the discussion just by noting \nthat ABC--and it has already been reported with respect to this \nmatter--that ABC News, owned by Disney, quashed an investigative story \non Disney theme parks. It seems to me that more cross-ownership is \ngoing to create more opportunities for conflicts of interest in news \ncoverage and that will reduce the kind of independent reporting that \nhas consistently been in the public interest.\n  A lot of the advocates for these changes, these powerful \nconglomerates, point to the idea that these are tough economic times; \nthat some media outlets may be hurting. Their argument has been that it \nmay be efficient, as they describe it, from a pure dollars and cents \nperspective, to allow different media businesses to combine their \noperations.\n  I would only say to those who make that argument that efficiency is \nnot the only thing at stake in this debate. Sure, if all anybody cares \nabout in the United States is efficiency, why not just have one single \nnationwide news bureau? They could run everything and people could say \nwe sure have efficiency now. We wouldn't have all these reporters and \ncommentators running around trying to beat each other and scoop each \nother and the like. But I think it is pretty obvious to Senators that \nwould not be in the public interest because it would reduce diversity \nand reduce choice and reduce the kind of robust public debate that \nAmerica wants.\n  So there are other values besides efficiency. That is the point of \nthe current rules, that they help to balance these competing interests.\n  I will wrap up because I see other colleagues waiting to make their \nremarks. I think what has happened in this country, and with the FCC's \nset of initiatives in this area, is that the Federal Communications \nCommission has rung the dinner bell--they have rung the dinner bell for \nthese powerful conglomerates who are out there licking their chops at \nthe prospect of making a meal out of these small outlets.\n  As I said earlier, I hope the Senate, when it looks at the facts, \nwhen it looks at what has gone on in the failed experiment of radio--\nand I want to emphasize that--I think the Federal Communications \nCommission will say: All right, these big media companies are at the \ndinner table. They want to gobble up these small outlets.\n  I hope the Senate votes in favor of this resolution and cancels the \nFederal Communications Commission's feeding frenzy. I hope the Senate \nwill do that when we vote next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, are we under managed time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nof disapproval regarding proposed changes in the media ownership \nregulations by the Federal Communications Commission. I personally \nthank Senator Dorgan for his leadership on this issue, as well as the \nrest of the Commerce Committee for so vigorously exploring the \npotential impact these regulations would have on the nature and content \nof the American media. These issues are of vital importance to the \npublic, and I am pleased to be part of this effort, utilizing the \ncongressional review process to ensure that the rulemaking process \nreflects the public interest.\n  Frank Blethen, the publisher of the Seattle Times, eloquently \ntestified before the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year. Mr. \nBlethen stated:\n\n       The America newspaper, large and small, and without \n     exception, belongs to a town, a city, at the most to a \n     region.\n\n  There is a certain pride and comfort to be taken from the notion that \nthe media that so pervades our lives could be so rooted in focus and \naccountability. That comment reflects a core value that has led me to \nthe position that I take today, that the Federal Communications \nCommission has proposed a series of historically broad rules changes \nthat would make it easier for large media corporations to gobble up a \ngreater share of local media, including television stations, in the \nsame market.\n  The Commission, and those who already hold enormous control over the \ncontent of the press, claim that this will only enhance the ability of \nthe media to meet the needs of the consumer. The world, they claim, has \ngrown so large and so complex that only vast resources and centralized \ncontrol can carry important stories across the globe. I respectfully \ndisagree.\n  Consumers benefit from technology more today than in any time in \nhistory. In an age of satellite television and the Internet, I am not \nas convinced as some that the greatest hole in news coverage is the \nworld beyond our region. The Consumers Union has correctly pointed out \nthat the opposite is the case: Satellite provides no independent local \nnews information and is struggling just to make local stations \navailable to subscribers.\n  Radio provides another acute example. Prior to 1996, there was a 40-\nstation national ownership cap in the radio industry. Today, Clear \nChannel alone owns almost 1,240 stations, and between one-third and \none-half of all independent radio stations have been absorbed or run \nout of business, including many in Colorado. Suggesting allowing \nincreased cross ownership does\n\n[[Page S11391]]\n\nnot strike me as a policy in the greatest interest of the public whom \nthe FCC is chartered to serve.\n  The current generation of Americans has seen the number of \nindependently owned newspapers dwindle from 1,700 to 280. As Commerce \nCommittee Chairman McCain noted this spring, this often equates to a \nloss of diversity of opinion in the pages of those newspapers with a \ncommon owner. I share the Chairman's opinion on this matter and am \nprofoundly concerned with the homogenization of information being \nfunneled in to local communities by multi-market media corporations. As \nMr. Blethen stated in his testimony, the secret of the free press and \nvibrant public discourse depends upon voices in the communities \nthemselves.\n\n  While those facts stand on their own, it is instructive to examine \nwhat we have witnessed in my home State of Colorado in recent years.\n  A number of family-owned newspapers in Colorado have recently been \nabsorbed by a media giant, the Media One Corporation. In Northeastern \nColorado both the Ft. Morgan Times and the Sterling Journal Advocate, \nas well as the Southeastern Colorado paper the Lamar Daily News, have \ngone from being locally owned family papers to being part of an \nenormous media machine headquartered far from those who rely on the \nnews and information of those papers. I ask my colleagues, particularly \nthose from States with large rural areas, what will happen to the \ninformation available in those communities if the rules are relaxed \neven further? Will those in Lamar, CO, receive all of their news from \nnewspapers, radio and television outlets owned by the same company?\n  In my community of Loveland, CO, for example, I have seen a locally \nowned radio station become part of a syndicate of radio stations. We \ndon't have the coverage of the local football games by the radio \nstation anymore. We don't have local newscasters. A new station came in \nwhich was created by the city so you can tune into the station to get \ndriving information in that small community in which I live. All of \nthis was provided by a small radio station at an earlier time, before \nthat larger conglomerate bought up that radio station in Loveland, CO.\n  This represents an enormous fiscal impact on large and small \nbusinesses as well as individuals, infringing on their ability to reach \nthe consumers they relied upon for years. Those who can still afford to \nadvertise are forced to pass these increased costs to consumers. It is \nimportant to note that this is the market today, without the new, more \nloose FCC regulations in effect. What will happen with newspapers and \ntelevision stations are owned by the same corporation?\n  That is legitimate question. Capitol Broadcasting Company makes the \nfollowing estimates for what will happen in Colorado under these \nproposed regulations:\n  One company could own six Colorado television stations.\n  One company could own an unlimited number of both daily and weekly \nnewspapers in the Denver area or a combination of television stations \nand a majority of the print media.\n  The local cable company serving every Colorado home could be owned by \none company.\n  The issue before the FCC and the Senate is not whether we need to re-\ndebate the Telecommunications Act of 1996 or specific Joint Operating \nAgreements. The issue today is whether the public will be well served \nby another round of consolidation, particularly the wisdom of enhancing \nthe ability of a large corporation to purchase broadcast outlets and \nnewspapers in the same market. On several occasions I have contacted \nFCC Chairman Michael Powell to express my concern over the direction \nthe FCC has taken and the speed with which it has moved.\n  In my opinion the FCC did not give the public nor Congress an \nadequate chance to comment on changes of such enormous consequence \nprior to the adoption of the new regulations.\n  I have been impressed and encouraged by the broad coalition of \norganizations expressing similar concerns over the FCC's press for \naction. The Consumers Union, National Rifle Association, Common Cause, \nthe Traditional Values Coalition, CodePink Women for Peace, the U.S. \nConference of Catholic Bishops, and the Future of Music Coalition are \njust a few of the organizations that share my concern for independent \nand diverse media in the United States. Given the actions of the FCC, \nwe must carefully consider the prudence of these rule changes and the \noverall public interest at stake.\n  Reed Hundt, FCC Chairman during the passage of the Telecommunications \nAct, stated well the intention of the Congress. ``The Commission's goal \nin this proceeding is to further competition, just as we seek to \npromote competition in other communications industries we regulate. But \nin our broadcast ownership rules we also seek to promote diversity in \nprogramming and diversity in the viewpoints expressed on this powerful \nmedium that so shapes our culture.'' What we must encourage is locally \ndriven news coverage as opposed to national news that attempts to find \na local perspective. National news for the sake of simplicity or \nsensationalism never gives local communities the in-depth coverage they \nshould have. Do we want top down coverage or bottom up coverage? I opt \nfor local to national.\n  I feel much more comfortable with news stories originating out of my \nhometown in Colorado and then, on their own merits, rising to the \nnational level. I am not particularly comfortable with national news \nbeing created and local stations trying to find a local perspective for \nthe national headline. So I think that the top down is a bad \nalternative; the bottom up is the best approach.\n  It is my hope that this body will listen to the many voices that are \nasking us not to chart a dangerous, wholly business-driven course for \nmedia and consumers in the coming years.\n  The FCC would have been wise to maintain the existing commitment made \nto the public, facilitating greater opportunity for Americans to do \nbusiness, seek information, and enjoy entertainment from a vibrant, \ndiverse, and healthy media. The FCC has failed in doing this by passing \na sweeping slate of rules that will do only one thing for certain: put \nfewer hands in control of the Nation's media. Thanks to the tool at our \ndisposal, the Congressional Review Act, Congress has the opportunity to \nprevent these rules from going into effect.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up and send a loud and clear message to \nthe FCC by voting in favor of this resolution of disapproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, and anyone who may be listening to this ``debate''--\nwhich is really not a debate yet but probably will be a debate when we \nvote on Thursday when the time is allocated for Members to speak to \npresent their positions on the resolution that is before the Senate--\nlet us remind ourselves that the resolution that has been introduced, \nS.J. Res. 17, is a resolution to completely throw out all the work of \nthe Federal Communications Commission that they have spent 2 years in \ncrafting. That is not something this body should consider doing without \na great deal of thought and understanding.\n  The Federal Communications Commission is a body of experts--people \nwho have made careers of understanding the communications industry in \nthis country--who are charged with looking after the best interests of \nthe people of this country with regard to communications policy, and \nalso to make sure that the system they devise, in keeping with what \nCongress has done, is a system that allows American industries to \nprosper, thrive, and to be successful in bringing about good \ncommunications to the people of this country, and at the same time try \nto create a level playing field that really balances the national \ninterest with the public interest and with the interest of legitimate \ncommunications companies.\n  It is no question that it is a public interest we are talking about \nbecause the airwaves do belong to the public; they do not belong to the \ncompanies. The real challenge the Federal Communications Commission has \nalways had is to create the proper balance that protects the public \ninterests for those who use the public airwaves and at the same time \nallows companies to be able to make a sufficient profit to be able to \noperate and provide the services which are expanding at an incredible \nrate.\n\n[[Page S11392]]\n\n  There is no question that America has clearly the best communication \nsystem in the world. We have more services available to more people at \na price that is more affordable than any other country anywhere in the \nworld. You can argue the Internet is not fast enough or we do not have \nenough choices between cable companies or that the rates are too high; \nthose are basically issues we deal with through the commission, and \nthey make recommendations.\n  Congress has enacted overall communication policy and the FCC has to \nfollow what the Congress has said. They have come up, after 2 years of \nstudy and hearings and public debate, with recommendations dealing with \nownership rules as to who can own and in what degree of concentration \ntelevision stations and radio stations and newspapers to try and make \nsure we do not get out of balance; that the American public is \nprotected by having a different choice and fair choices about what they \nwant to watch, what they want to hear, and what they want to read. That \nis what the Federal Communications Commission does.\n  The resolution before the Congress says after 2 years and what has \nbeen presented as rules under the FCC, we will throw all of that out; \nthat the Congress, in its wisdom, will take a couple of hours, debate \nthis issue, and throw out 2 years of work by the FCC, 2 years of \nhearings, 2 years of debate, 2 years of discussion and we will have a \nhearing in the Commerce Committee that will last a couple of hours and \ndebate it 30 minutes apiece on Tuesday and then vote on whether to \nthrow out what the Federal Communications Commission has done for 2 \nyears as a matter of public policy.\n  It is clear the administration says this is not the right thing for \nthe Congress to do. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a statement of administration policy.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 2003.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n   S.J. Res. 17--Disapproving the Rule of the Federal Communications \n                Commission on Broadcast Media Ownership\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes Senate passage of S.J. \n     Res. 17, a resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the \n     Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with respect to \n     broadcast media ownership. The Administration believes that \n     the new FCC local and national media ownership rules more \n     accurately reflect the changing media landscape and the \n     current state of network station ownership, while guarding \n     against undue concentration in the marketplace. S.J. Res. 17 \n     overturns all of the FCC's new media ownership rules--\n     negating almost two years of careful study, detailed \n     analysis, and thorough review; creating significant \n     regulatory uncertainty; and preventing the implementation of \n     important new rules which will improve the quality of local \n     news and support free over-the-air broadcast television. If \n     S.J. Res. 17 were presented to the President, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It says if Congress passes this, we will veto it. It is \nvery clear. The administration says the new FCC local and national \nmedia ownership rules more accurately reflect the changing media \nlandscape and current state of network station ownership, while \nguarding against undue concentration in the marketplace. They point out \nthis resolution throws all of that out the window, replaces it with \nnothing, and says we do not like it. Maybe some people like some of it \nand do not like other parts, but they got rid of everything the FCC \nrecommended.\n  That is bad policy and not something the Congress should do. I \nstrongly oppose the resolution. I hope the Congress, in the wisdom of \nthe Senate, will not adopt this resolution. Or at least I hope we do \nnot adopt it in such a large margin that it prevents it from being \nsuccessfully vetoed.\n  Many of the arguments, when talking about television, newspapers, and \nradio come down to big is bad and small is good. That is obviously a \nsimplistic statement and a simplistic argument.\n  Many of the people who support the resolution talk about three areas: \nlocalism, diversity, and media concentration. In reviewing what the FCC \nhas done in each of these areas, you will see we have a fair approach \nto guiding how the industries operate in the 21st century. This is not \n1930, before we even had television. When Americans finally got a TV, \ncitizens had a choice of maybe one network and then three. We have so \nmany choices now people do not know what to pick. I have 150 television \nstations I can watch with diversity and differences of opinion.\n  When they talk of localism, they say we have to get rid of this \nresolution because of localism, we want to have more local people able \nto own the stations. I remember a group of businessmen came to me and \nargued about localism and how they wanted to make sure the networks did \nnot own all the television stations because if the networks located in \nNew York City owned all the local TV stations, everything would come \nout of New York. I am reminded of the television commercial. When they \nask where they are from and they say New York City, they said, String \n'em up, as if people in New York cannot be fair and make sure that \nlocal people get what they want, because they can.\n  They argued if the networks owned all the local television stations, \nsomehow everything would be directed out of New York by the network \nowners who own the local station down in Louisiana. These people own \nstations in my hometown down in Louisiana. I asked them where they were \nfrom and they were from New York City. The idea that local ownership \nmeans a local group of people in the local town will own the local \ntelevision station is not in keeping with the facts. Stations not owned \nby networks are not owned by a local mom and pop, people in the local \ncommunity. They are, in turn, also owned by a large corporation, many \nheadquartered in Los Angeles or New York or large entertainment centers \naround the country.\n  The argument falls when you talk about localism by saying if networks \ncould own stations, you are preventing local stations from owning a \nlocal station in a community. It is simply not true. It is very rare \nindeed when a group of local owners happen to be from the local \ncommunity as opposed to being very large companies and corporations \nthat own the stations themselves.\n  They say if you have the local owners, you get better local news, \nbecause they will have more interest in providing what the local \ncommunity wants. It is not borne out by the facts. In fact, studies we \nhave received in the committee clearly show--and this is a factual \ndetermination--that the network-owned stations--ABC networks, NBC, CBS \nnetworks that own the local stations--on average present as much as 37 \npercent more local news than the non-network-owned stations. That is \nimportant for those who argue you have to throw the rule out because we \ndo not want the networks to own the stations, because if the networks \nown the station you do not get local news coverage. The actual facts \nshow when you look at the programming, the network-owned stations, on \naverage, show 37 percent more local information programming, more local \ncommunity needs shows and information-providing shows on local events, \nand they provide 37 percent more coverage of local events than the non-\nnetwork-owned facilities. The fact is most of the locally owned \nstations are not locally owned but are owned by corporations all over \nthe United States. The networks do a much better job of providing local \ninput and local news than the network affiliates.\n\n  The argument some make that we need this resolution to throw out this \nrule because we do not want the networks to own the stations because we \nwant to have more localism is clearly not borne out by the actual \nfacts, just by reading the schedules of the local news available on \nnetwork programming and network-owned stations as opposed to non-\nnetwork-owned stations.\n  The other argument is you have to have diversity. I mentioned a \nlittle bit about this in my first argument. They say if the networks \nown the stations, you will not have diversity; you will not have \ndiversity of opinion; you will only have the network's opinion \nbroadcast and no diversity or difference of opinion. What we have to \nlook at is who actually owns the non-network stations. They are, \nindeed, large corporate entities. Nothing wrong with that, but large \ncorporate entities,\n\n[[Page S11393]]\n\nmany of them on the Fortune 500 list of some of the most profitable \ncorporations in America. Nothing wrong with that. But it is not a lot \nof difference, if any, whatsoever, from the networks that own the \nstations.\n\n  The Tribune Corporation, Gannett, Hearst-Argyle, Cox Communications--\nare these mom-and-pop operations? Of course not. They are large \ncorporations that operate all over the United States. They operate \ncable companies, newspaper companies, television stations all over the \nUnited States. They are not going to bring about any more great \nadversity than the networks that own their share of stations.\n  The final contention is media concentration. The argument that some \nwould make is, well, the amount of media concentration is so bad, when \nyou have the network-owned stations, with a rule that says you can go \nfrom 35-percent penetration in the market to 45 percent, it would allow \nthis media concentration to exist to a certain extent that would be \nvery bad for the American public.\n  We have about 1,721 full-power television stations operating in the \nUnited States of America. There are a little over 1,700 of those \nstations. The concentration of the networks owning these stations is \nindeed very small.\n  CBS, through Viacom, owns about 3.4 percent of the total television \nhouseholds in this country. On average, their concentration of the \nnetwork-owned stations is about 2.27 percent of the stations in the \ncountry. Fox--we all know the Fox network--owns about 2 percent of the \nstations. NBC owns about 1.69 percent. ABC owns .58 percent of the \nstations that operate full-time, full-power television in this country.\n  Our hearing in the Commerce Committee showed very clearly that no one \ntried to defend this existing 35-percent so-called cap that we have as \na rule right now; that the FCC moved up to 45 percent because the \nmeasurement of concentration is totally unjustifiable and \nunsustainable.\n  The current rule says if you have a television station in a market or \nin several markets that add up to 35 percent of the population, you \nhave reached the cap. That is absolutely a totally inadequate \nmeasurement of media concentration. It is like saying if I sold cars in \nNew York City, which has 6 percent of the U.S. population, therefore I \nam selling cars to 6 percent of the population of the United States, \nwhen, in fact, I just have one car dealership in a city that has 6 \npercent of the population.\n  If there were no other car dealers in New York, yes, then I could say \nthat I am selling 6 percent of all the cars in America because I am \nselling them in the city and I am the only dealer there. But that is \nthe problem with the measurement we are using today and the reason \nmoving it up to 45 percent certainly makes sense.\n  If I had television stations in Los Angeles, New York, Houston, and \nMiami, I would probably pass the cap--even if no one in those cities \never watched my television station. The current measurement assumes if \nyou have a TV tower and a station in each one of those cities, in those \ncities everyone is watching your station every day, all day, and only \nyour station.\n  Well, some of these cities have 150 television channels that people \nwatch. They don't just watch NBC or CBS or ABC or Fox. They have 150 \nstations they can look to. Yet the current rule says if you have one \nstation in each one of those big markets, and the population of those \nmarkets adds up to 35 percent of the population of the United \nStates, you have reached the cap, and you cannot go over the cap, and \nyou can't have another TV station--when, in fact, no one in the city \nmay be watching your station or maybe only a few people in the city \nwatch your particular station.\n\n  So when you are talking about concentration, it is not where the TV \ntower happens to be located; it is how many of the people in an area \nare watching your station. If you look at the ratings, you see that \nnone of these operations in prime time come anywhere close to having 35 \npercent of the people in the country watch their station.\n  For Viacom, what, 3.4 percent is the amount of people watching. It is \n3.4 percent of total TV households. It is not 35 percent; it is not 45 \npercent; it is only 3.4 percent. But the way the FCC and Congress \nmeasure it, because they have stations in large cities, such as Los \nAngeles, somehow they have reached the cap and they can't go over the \ncap, and, therefore, the idea of raising it to 45 percent some believe \nis so bad because of this media concentration; when, in fact, it has \nnothing to do with concentration. The current measurement is really \noutdated and makes no sense whatsoever.\n  So when people say the FCC is raising the cap to 45 percent, and a \nstation can have 45 percent of the viewing audience in the country, it \nhas nothing to do with that. The measurement only indicates the number \nof people in a city who could possibly be watching the station. If they \nwere the only station in Los Angeles, that may be true, but when they \nhave 150 other TV stations they are watching--you see the highest \nconcentration is CBS with 3.4 percent, Fox is 3.1 percent, ABC is 1.5 \npercent, NBC is 2.8 percent--I think it really does not make the \nargument on the question of diversity and media concentration by saying \nthat because you are located in a large city, you have media \nconcentration merely because there are a lot of people in that city.\n  It is just like back to my example of owning a car dealership in New \nYork. Obviously, just because New York is 6 percent of the population \ndoes not mean because I own an automobile dealership in New York I have \nsold every single car that is bought in New York. If I did, I would \nhave 6 percent of the concentration of car sales in the country. But \nthere are probably 1,000 car dealers in New York, and, obviously, \neverybody has a little piece of the action, but nobody has 100 percent. \nYet the measurement the FCC uses really measures not the amount of \nconcentration, it merely measures the population of the city.\n  So those who say what the FCC did was incorrect because it allows \ngreater media concentration, that is simply not true. So I think the \nresolution should be rejected. If Congress does not reject it, this \nadministration will veto it, and the result ultimately will be the \nsame.\n  But on the three principal arguments of localism, diversity, and \nmedia concentration that are used in order to say why this resolution \nshould pass, I think the evidence and the facts, as opposed to the \nrhetoric, are very clear that those three reasons are not sufficient to \noverturn the Communications Commission that has spent 2 years in \nbringing this to us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my suggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, let me begin with a chart that I had used previously. \nThere is the suggestion that somehow concentration is not of any \nsignificant interest and, gosh, there is nothing wrong. This is all \nlocalism and mom-and-pop operations. I used this chart before. I \nmentioned Disney.\n  Let me just say that although I picked Disney out, I happen to like \nDisney. Disney has given me some of the more rewarding moments of my \nlife when I was young. Disney is a great company. But it is a very \nlarge company doing a lot of things.\n  Let me go to News Corp: 22 TV stations including duopolies in New \nYork, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, Washington, Minnesota, Houston, \nOrlando, Phoenix. They have newspapers: the New York Post, the Times, \nthe Sun. They have books: Harper Collins, Regan Books, Amistad Books, \nWilliam Morrow & Co. They have sports teams: the Los Angeles Dodgers, \nthe Los Angeles Kings.\n  I could go through all of this and describe the largest media \ncompanies, and you would see these are significant concentrations, \ndramatic concentrations in broadcast ownership, newspapers. And I don't \nknow. Maybe some say it doesn't matter much.\n  I think it does matter. Let me describe at least one part of why it \nmatters. The issue of localism, by which we say you may use the \nairwaves--they belong to the American people, but you\n\n[[Page S11394]]\n\nand your radio or television company may use these airwaves--not own \nthem, but use them--in exchange for certain requirements. One of them \nis localism. That means you have to serve local interests.\n  The question is, how do you serve local interests from a thousand \nmiles away, where you create some homogenized music and run it through \na board and play it though your radio or TV operation in that hometown. \nEarlier, I described voice tracking. Someone may be driving down the \nroad in Salt Lake City listening to the radio station, and the \nannouncer, with a sonorous voice, says, ``Good morning, the sun is \nshining here in Salt Lake City; what a wonderful day to wake up and be \nin America.'' You would think, what a great resident to have \nbroadcasting for our radio station.\n  The problem is, that person isn't in Salt Lake City; he is in a \nbasement in Baltimore, MD, in a studio, ripping off a printer something \nthat came from the Internet that says it is sunny in Salt Lake City. It \nis called voice tracking--pretending there is a local announcer on that \nradio station. That is going on all over the country now.\n  There is something called central casting on television. You can turn \non two television stations in two cities and see the same television \npersonality giving the news--homogenized regional news, because they \ncannot quite do it locally. They are trying to convince people this is \na local news person. Let's pretend there is localism. That is what it \nis all about.\n  When you have these concentrations of ownership, this orgy of mergers \nthat has occurred in recent years in both radio and television, it \nhurts there isn't much localism. We have had testimony before the \nCommerce Committee by a man who runs a pretty substantial television \nstation. He said:\n\n       I can't decide that my viewers don't want to watch a piece \n     of trash that will come down from the network. Even though it \n     is awful stuff they say you have to run it.\n\n  Here is an interesting letter. It is dated July 25, 2003, by a \ntelevision station in Kansas City, Missouri, to someone who complained \nto them:\n\n       We received your letter dated June 30, 2003, regarding the \n     content of [a certain show] that aired on [this date].\n       We forwarded your letter to the . . . Network. The Network, \n     not [our station], decides what shows go on the air for [this \n     network-owned station].\n\n  So it says that they don't decide what goes on the air in Kansas \nCity. You can complain to us, but we don't decide. The network does. Is \nthere localism involved in that?\n  One of my colleagues, on the floor of the Senate a number of years \nago, when we were debating all of this, said something interesting. I \ndecided to pull it out and read it today because it relates to this \nissue of localism. Should we care about whether someone in Bismarck, \nND, or Chattanooga, TN, has an opportunity to decide this is not a \nprogram that meets our standards? Or should we say, look, let the \nnetworks decide, and whatever they decide to produce in New York or \nHollywood is going to be shown in Bismarck, ND, or Chattanooga, TN, and \nit doesn't matter what the local folks think. My colleague, Senator Sam \nNunn, in 1995, when we were debating this prior to the 1996 act, talked \nabout violence on television, what was on television. He said:\n\n  To follow up on this issue, one member of my staff voluntarily \nconducted an unscientific survey of the topics on daytime talk shows. \nEvery hour or so, he would scan the television on his desk and see what \nthe day's topics were for the daytime talk shows.\n  The reason I point this out is this:\n\n       The first day, one show was called ``Stop Pretending To Be \n     a Girl'' and featured young boys whose parents were upset \n     that their sons dressed and acted like a girl. Another show \n     offered a show entitled ``Boys Who Only Have Sex With \n     Virgins.'' Yet another show offered a girl dumping her \n     boyfriend on national television and asking her new \n     ``significant other,'' another girl, to commit to her.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Mr. President, I thought that surely the next day's shows \n     would pale in comparison to these. I was wrong. Subsequent \n     days' reviews of these shows found titles such as ``One-Night \n     Stand Reunions.'' Another show was entitled ``I Am Ready to \n     Have Sex With You Right Now.'' And another show was called \n     ``I Cheat and Am Proud Of It. One show featured a woman who \n     chose to tell her fiance on national television that she \n     cheated on him with her sister's boyfriend . . .\n\n  It goes on and on. He said:\n\n       Perhaps the most appropriately titled show of all was the \n     one entitled ``You Look Like a Freak.''\n\n  Localism. Trash on television. Should someone who owns a television \nstation in Tennessee have the ability to say, you know, what you are \nsending us in this time period is a show I don't think represents any \nkind of standard that makes sense for us. The answer is that too often \nthe station are not allowed do that because someone else calls the \nshots, not the local folks.\n  When you have this concentration, local standards no longer matter. \nWill there be more concentration as a result of what the FCC has done \nwith its rules? Of course. In fact, I will read a letter written by \nW.B. Grimes & Company that was written before the FCC even ruled. They \nwrote it to the publisher of a newspaper in Seattle:\n\n       As you know, the FCC is considering elimination of the ban \n     on cross-ownership of media properties within a daily \n     newspaper publisher's given markets.\n\n  They can then buy the television station in the same market.\n  It says:\n\n       In anticipation of that ruling, several newspaper groups \n     are already forging alliances and cutting handshake \n     agreements with both radio and television broadcasters in \n     their markets. If you are considering broadcast acquisitions \n     to bolster your market presence, we believe the time to act \n     is now.\n       We would like to be your broker.\n\n  This was before the FCC acted. Most people thought the FCC was going \nto do what the big interests wanted them to do. Here is a broker \nsaying, let us get involved so we can help you buy television stations. \nOnce again, more and more concentration.\n  I will talk about some of the voices opposed to this. Some of my \ncolleagues talked about this. William Safire, a very conservative \ncolumnist, who worked for President Richard Nixon as a speech writer, \nand for the New York Times for many years, said:\n\n       The overwhelming amount of news and entertainment comes via \n     broadcast and print. Putting these outlets in fewer and \n     bigger hands profits the few at the cost of the many. Does \n     that sound unconservative? Not to me. The concentration of \n     power--political, corporate, media, and cultural--should be \n     anathema to conservatives. The diffusion of power through \n     local control, thereby encouraging individual participation, \n     is the essence of federalism and the greatest expression of \n     democracy.\n\n  U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops:\n\n       Without diversity of ownership, our meaningful alternatives \n     to syndicated shows and info-mercials, and public affairs \n     programs, are in jeopardy.\n\n  NRA's executive VP Wayne LaPierre said:\n\n       Most cities have only one major newspaper to begin with. \n     Add ownership of the dominant local TV station, the top AM \n     and FM bands and the local cable TV provider. Then do the \n     same thing in 20 or 50 cities, and you see how a \n     multibillion-dollar corporation corners the market in the \n     marketplace of ideas.\n       Minority or unpopular causes--think of women's suffrage in \n     1914, or civil rights in 1954--would be downplayed or \n     dismissed to keep viewers watching and advertisers buying. \n     That's no way to run a democracy.\n\n  That is the executive vice president of the National Rifle \nAssociation. That is not a liberal organization.\n  Walter Cronkite:\n\n       The gathering of more and more outlets under one owner \n     clearly can be an impediment to a free and independent press.\n\n  I could go on and on.\n  Parents Television Council:\n\n       Almost 80 percent of families rely on their hometown papers \n     and TV for local information. People can't turn to a national \n     news network over the Internet. They provide one-size-fits-\n     all programming, controlled from an office hundreds, perhaps \n     thousands, of miles from your town.\n\n  Barry Diller, former head of Universal Studios, who has acquired a \nrather substantial enterprise in information:\n\n       The big, bad truth is--and I don't think it is given enough \n     importance--the big four networks have in fact reconstituted \n     themselves into the oligopoly that the FCC originally set out \n     to curb back in the 1960s. They may have controlled 90 \n     percent of what people saw, but they operated with a sense of \n     public responsibility that simply doesn't exist for these \n     vertically integrated media conglomerates, driven only to fit \n     their next piece in the puzzle of world dominance.\n\n  Let me speak for a few moments about my colleague, Senator McCain, \nsomeone for whom I have great respect.\n\n[[Page S11395]]\n\n He gave a statement and I told him I was certainly not going to be \nsupportive of his contention that anything we are doing here or any \nreason to come to the floor of the Senate on this issue has to do with \nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act. That was his contention. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth, in my judgment. I just disagree with that.\n\n  In 1996, when we rewrote the Telecommunications Act, beginning in \n1995, we addressed these very issues. I offered an amendment on the \nfloor of the Senate in 1995 to S. 652 during debate on the \nTelecommunications Act--an amendment by Senator Dorgan of North Dakota: \nTo strike the provisions of the bill that would allow television \nnetworks and other chains to own no more than 35 percent of the \nNation's households and take it back to 25 percent.\n  We had a vote on that amendment. Guess what. I won the vote by three \nvotes. Senator Dole was standing at that chair--at that point he was \nmajority leader--and Senator D'Amato from New York was at the desk in \nthe back. I won the vote by three votes, to roll back the 35 percent, \nwhich was in the telecommunications bill, to say: You can't own more \nthan 25 percent of the reach in this country when you own television \nstations.\n  Guess what happened? Dinner intervened. The worst thing in the world \naround here is dinner because over dinner--we call it supper back in my \nhometown--over that period when you eat your evening meal, although I \nhad won by three votes at 4 in the afternoon, three of my colleagues \nhad some sort of epiphany over their main course, apparently. Senator \nD'Amato came back and asked for reconsideration, and he and Senator \nDole decided to overturn the vote by which I had won at 4 o'clock that \nwould have prevented the 35 percent and gone back to 25 percent. They \nchanged three votes. We came back 3 hours later and I lost. So I won \nfor 3 hours.\n  My colleague--incidentally, Senator McCain made the point I voted for \nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act, which I did, to be sure--my colleague \nSenator McCain voted against my amendment that would have rolled back \nthe 35 percent back to 25 percent.\n  I was fighting then to stop this gross concentration that is going on \nin the broadcast industry, and I won for 3 hours. Then I forgot, when \nyou get people out of this Chamber and get arms twisted, you can have a \nre-vote and several people will apparently come here with a different \nmind-set. Winning is temporary in those circumstances, and it certainly \nwas that day.\n  This is a situation I understood then exactly what was going to \nhappen, and it has happened wholesale. I mentioned earlier we have one \ncompany that has well over 1,200 radio stations in this country. The \nsame is happening in television and happening very quickly.\n  With newspapers, this new FCC rule says: Oh, by the way, in addition \nto allowing more concentration in radio and television, let's let the \nnewspapers own the television stations and more radio stations in the \nsame marketplace. I was taught long ago never argue with anybody who \nbuys ink by the barrel. I guess I never quite understood that lesson.\n  Here we take on the American Newspaper Association and the \npublishers, and they are lobbying furiously because they are opposed to \nwhat we are doing. They want to be able to buy television stations in \nthe same city.\n  I said the extension of what the FCC is going to allow to happen as a \nresult of their rule is this: That in the largest American cities one \ncompany will now be able to own the dominant newspaper, the dominant \ntelevision station, two other television stations, eight radio \nstations, and the cable company, and they can do that in city after \ncity. If you think that is in the public interest, then I say look up \nthe term ``public interest'' in the dictionary or understand the public \ninterest in the context of what we ask of radio and television \nstations, of what we need for the free flow of information in our \ndemocracy. It is not in the public interest.\n\n  I seldom ever come to the floor to say ``I told you so,'' but it is \nalmost too tempting to avoid at this moment. In 1995, following what \nhappened on the floor of the Senate when I was attempting to stop this \norgy of mergers that was going to occur, when I won a vote for 3 hours \nand then lost because my colleagues left to have something to eat, this \nis what I said:\n\n       If these changes are enacted, the media industry in this \n     country will be controlled by a handful of conglomerates in \n     the future. The long-held principles of localism and \n     diversity will suffer.\n\n  I said that on June 15, 1995, when I was fighting then for the same \nprinciple I fight for today, and that is to stop the massive \nconcentration. What the American people see, hear, and read will \nincreasingly be controlled by a very few voices. That is not in the \ninterest of this country.\n  I have more to say. I believe the Senator from Virginia wishes to \nspeak either perhaps strongly supporting this resolution or maybe he \nwill oppose it. Perhaps the latter. What I would like to do is allow \nhim to speak, and I understand the Senator from New Hampshire is also \ngoing to be on the floor. I am going to make some concluding remarks \nthis afternoon.\n  I yield the floor so the Senator from Virginia can make his \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto consume as much time as I may require to speak in opposition to this \nproposed resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to oppose this \nresolution which will essentially throw out six media ownership \nregulations issued by the FCC on June 2. There are a variety of issues \nto cover, and I hope to do that in a coherent and cogent manner.\n  Let me first say to my friend from North Dakota, the issues we are \ntalking about are media ownership of 35 percent versus 45 percent; the \nissue of cross-ownership, whether newspapers and TV stations can be \nowned by the same entity or enterprise; and the other issue is whether \nmedium and smaller sized markets are afforded the same opportunities \nfor working together as are allowed in large media markets.\n  Those are the three issues. A lot is focused on just one issue, but \nthe cross-ownership and the so-called duopoly or multiple ownership \nissues are also very important.\n  It was said by the Senator from North Dakota that the local TV cap \nand cross-media rule are going to allow one company to dominate sources \nof news and information in one community. This is simply not true. It \nis an alarmist argument that may get folks all fired up.\n  The rules the FCC put forward modify the rules that represent long \noverdue reactions to very extensive and well-researched and documented \nchanges in the marketplace. The new ownership rules that are being put \nforward ensure no company can dominate a local media landscape.\n  In reality, the newspaper cross-ownership will continue to be \ncompletely prohibited in all markets with three or fewer TV stations \nwhile only cross-ownership will be allowed in midsized markets with \nbetween four and eight TV stations. Only in the Nation's largest \nmarket, representing approximately 70 out of the 210 TV markets in the \nUnited States, would cross-ownership restrictions be removed.\n  Even in those markets, however, parties will continue to be subject \nto the FCC's separate local television duopoly and radio ownership \nlimits. So any newspaper-broadcast combination thus will be subjected \nto competition from at least three and generally more independently \nowned television stations, numerous radio outlets, not to mention the \nwealth of cable, DSS, the Internet satellite print competitors, as \nwell, that make up the contemporary media ownership spectrum that is \navailable to consumers.\n  From the very beginning, in the 1930s, the core principles that drove \nthe Nation's communications policies were localism, competition, and \ndiversity. Ownership rules are a byproduct of this public interest and \nin constructing rules, our Government seeks to preserve these \nprinciples, and they continue to be preserved with the FCC's \nregulation.\n  After 20 months of decisions, comprehensive, exhaustive analysis by \nthe FCC, they have finally done what the\n\n[[Page S11396]]\n\ncourts and the Congress commanded them to do--to adopt new ownership \nrules that are based on empirical evidence and also the present \nmarketplace.\n  On June 2, the Commission made positive steps in crafting updated \nrules to take into account the new media outlets that are available to \nconsumers for news information and entertainment.\n  Every 2 years, the FCC is required by the Telecommunications Act of \n1996 to review the media-ownership regulations. Over the past 2 years, \nfive of the six ownership rules were challenged in court. In each case, \nthe FCC's prior regulations, or regulations at that time, were \noverturned. Indeed, both Congress and the courts have given the \nCommission a high standard of establishing legally sustainable \nownership limits that most importantly remain in the public interest.\n  Unfortunately, many have turned this important policy debate into a \npolitical one, substituting opinion for fact. Allegations that these \nrules will allow four or five companies to dominate all major sources \nof news and information in one community make for good headlines but \nare simply not grounded in fact.\n  Over 40 years ago, in the era of black and white television, three \nnetworks controlled the TV airwaves, providing only 15 minutes of \nevening news and 5 minutes of brief news snippets throughout the day on \nan irregular basis.\n  Today, the fact is there are more choices available to the consumer \nin terms of how they access information than any other time in our \nNation's history--in fact, more than any time in the history of \nmankind. Even in small towns, the number of media outlets, including \ncable, satellite, radio and TV stations, has increased by over 250 \npercent during the past 40 years.\n  Independent ownership of these outlets is far more diverse with \napproximately 139 percent more independent owners than there were 40 \nyears ago. Today, there are three 24-hour all-news networks, seven \nbroadcast networks, and over 300 cable networks. The multiple news \nprograms, independent commentary, public affairs channels are all \nfueling our democratic economy and opportunities. There is more \nprogramming, more choice and more control in the hands of citizens \ntoday than ever before.\n  Sure, times have changed, changed for the better, and the rules \ngoverning this burgeoning industry also ought to change to reflect the \ncurrent state of innovation and new technologies. Otherwise, the rules \nthat were once designed to help consumers, if this resolution passes, \nhave the potential to harm consumers, limiting quality and \nopportunities for choice programming.\n  Much of this debate gets focused on the 35-percent versus 45-percent \nbroadcast ownership cap and whether that ought to be increased. Our \nopponents maintain that increasing the cap presents a problem because \nthe five major broadcast networks already own 80 to 90 percent of the \ntop cable channels. In truth, the five companies do not control the \nmajority of the channels. Eighty to ninety percent, that statistic, is \nwhat the opponents refer to as actually related to viewership.\n  Now, we heard earlier about Disney and we do not want to be against \nDisney. Well, let's just take last Sunday night's ESPN broadcast of the \nRaiders-Titans game which was played in Nashville, TN. I did not \nparticularly like the results, but it sure did score big ratings, \naveraging 10.8 million viewers, averaging 7.8 million households. \nHowever, this number only amounts to approximately 11 percent of all \nhouseholds that subscribe to cable or satellite programming. This is by \nfar the No. 1 for ESPN for an opening Sunday night game. At any given \ntime, a consumer watching television actually has an opportunity to \nlook at 54 different stations.\n\n  Sunday night's game was the highest rated regular season game in the \nNashville TV market since the Titans moved to Music City. Of the sixty-\neight percent of the televisions that were on in Nashville, two-thirds \nof them were watching the Raiders-Titans game. That is about 48 percent \nof all TVs, so not every TV was on. Nevertheless, those that were on, \n68 percent were watching that game. It was the sixth highest rated TV \nbroadcast overall in Nashville since 1997. The top four, and five of \nthe top six, highest rated TV programs in Nashville since 1997 are \nTitans games. That was led by last January's AFC championship game, in \nwhich case I was more happy in that the Raiders beat the Titans, but \nthat was the No. 1 Sunday game of all-time back in January.\n  With this approach, since people in the Nashville, TN, area, or maybe \nin the Oakland area or elsewhere, two-thirds of them wanting to watch \nthat game, does that mean we ought to be prohibiting or regulating or \npunishing ESPN or ABC or Disney because they have programming that \npeople actually want to watch? What do we want to make them do, watch \nsomething we think is better for them than popular programming?\n  This is a rare situation that there is such viewership, but that will \nhappen. It is consumer choice to see it. In my view, what we ought to \ndo is trust free people. I would never advocate limiting consumer \nchoice or American's ability to access information.\n  We are all concerned about consolidation. We all are opposed to \nmonopolies and care about antitrust. We want to preserve diversity and \ncompetition in the media marketplace, but if we look at the real number \nof options that are available to consumers today across media outlets, \nconsumers have an unprecedented abundance of choices.\n  We get statistics from 1943 to 2000, and there are obviously big \nincreases. Newspapers are about the same or slightly less. In 1943 \nthere were about 1,700 daily newspapers. Now there are approximately \n1,500. In 1943 there were 931 AM stations. In 1978, there were about \n4,500. In 2001--the best statistics we have presently--it has gone up \nto 4,700-plus AM stations. In 1943, there were 59 FM radio stations. In \n1978, there were 4,069. It has doubled since 1978 to over 8,285 FM \nstations.\n  Full-power TV stations have gone from 6 in 1943 to 988 in 1978, and \nin 2001, there were 1,686 full-powered TV stations. In 1978 there were \nzero lower powered TV stations. In 2001, there were 2,212 low-powered \nTV stations. Cable started kicking off in the 1970s, and it had about \n13 million subscribers. Now, in 2001, there are 69 million. DBS \nsubscribers, of course, there were zero if we are talking about to \n1990. In 2001, there were 16 million plus.\n  There are a variety of other areas: Internet access, big difference. \nNobody was using Internet access back in the 1990s. Now there are \nliterally hundreds of millions of people on the Internet, and Internet \naccess is about 72 percent. Broadcast networks in 2001, 7 in English \nand 2 in Spanish; cable networks are now approximately 300; and there \nare over approximately 2,454-plus channel cable systems. That is what \nis in the power, in the discretion, in the choice of the American \npeople. They are the ones who see the competition. They are the ones \nwho have control and are making the choice as to what they want to \nwatch.\n  On the issues of newspaper cross-ownership and the local television \nownership or duopoly issues, if the resolution were debated today and \npassed next week, we would be reverting back to the rules that were \ncreated in the 1970s. In both cases, the rules are outdated and largely \nunnecessary, given the increase in the number of media outlets. In some \ncases, cross-ownership may actually benefit consumers in smaller \nmarkets where broadcast companies and newspaper owners face financially \nchallenging conditions. If this resolution passes, local television \nstations in smaller markets will be prohibited from combining to pool \ntheir resources to provide better programming and more local coverage.\n  We all know local news and reporting is expensive to produce, both in \ngetting digital equipment and quality news staff. Those are major \nexpenses, especially in smaller markets where there is less \nadvertising; therefore, less can be charged but there are still pretty \nmuch the basic same costs as a large market would have. And while the \nlarge market can get all that advertising revenue because they are \npotentially having contact with more people, they can get their costs \nrecouped. In the smaller markets, there are pretty much the same costs \nwith less of a revenue stream, which makes it more difficult to operate \nstations in those smaller markets.\n\n[[Page S11397]]\n\n  I am aware of at least two markets in Virginia--Harrisonburg and \nCharlottesville--that would benefit from the new media rules the \nCommission issued on June 2. Both of these markets are very small in \ncomparison to the big markets of New York City and Los Angeles and \nsimply don't have the same resources available for comprehensive news \nprogramming and so forth that the New York City and LA markets may \nhave. But they still try to make it in a smaller market.\n  Another interesting nuance, ignored in this, is what this does to \nsome markets that were grandfathered, before the 1996 act. In some \nVirginia markets, and one shared with Virginia and Tennessee, back in \n1975 they were grandfathered, or waived, under the ownership rules. If \nthis resolution passes, they potentially will no longer be able to \nprovide local news--if this resolution passes. This is where you have \ncross-ownership. Previously, and currently under the present rules and \nlaw, both the Roanoke and Lynchburg markets as well as the Tri-Cities--\nwhich, as the President knows, are Bristol, Johnson City, and \nKingsport--were grandfathered. If this resolution passes, potentially \nthey will no longer be able to provide local news.\n  You also have in the Lynchburg market the local television station \nand the two local newspapers, the Lynchburg and Danville papers. Both \nof these media sources have been permitted to combine resources, and \nthat has led to expanded news coverage and increased program offerings \nfor their customers and constituents.\n  I am increasingly convinced by these successful examples in \nVirginia--this is not theory but it is fact--that we should be relaxing \nthe newspaper cross-ownership rules and regulations. If this resolution \npasses, it will harm the ability of these voices and these markets to \nbe able to pool their resources for more effective and better reporting \nand production. I think these FCC rules, by the way, preserve the key, \ncore principles of localism, diversity, and competition.\n  A duopoly--local TV cap. I was visited by several constituent station \nmanagers from the Shenandoah Valley, Roanoke area, and Bristol. They \nraised the local television ownership rule which, if this resolution \nwere to pass, would restrict ownership of more than one station in a \nmarket with eight voices or fewer.\n  These small, local television managers confirm that revenue and \nfacility sharing would help keep struggling stations afloat in small \nmarkets and actually, and logically, would improve the quality and \ndiversity of programming currently available to viewers.\n  It is certainly the prerogative of the Senator from North Dakota to \nuse the Congressional Review Act and bring before the Senate this \nresolution of disapproval. At issue are some of the founding principles \nof government: Freedom of speech and the press, freedom to associate \nand to petition the Government, freedom to acquire and hold property in \naccordance with the law.\n  Our Founding Fathers understood that government should not have the \npower to restrict speech without deeply compelling justifications. I \nbelieve the public interest is ill served when Congress forces the FCC \nto revert back to ownership rules that were overturned by the courts \nfor being outdated and not guided by solid factual records.\n  In my opinion, the congressional mandate established in the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act and the court order forced the FCC, in a \npositive and proactive way, to conduct a thorough and exhaustive review \nof the media ownership rules. I am confident that the Commission's June \n2 order established legally sustainable ownership limits that \naccomplished these three goals: No. 1, promoting diversity, localism, \nand competition; No. 2, updating the rules to reflect a multitude of \nnew outlets for news information and entertaining; and, No. 3, striking \na careful balance that promotes the public interest while ensuring no \none company can monopolize any one medium of communications or limit \nany American's ability to access information.\n  I will conclude by asking my colleagues to oppose this resolution, \nstand strong for freedom, and support the FCC. Don't foul up. Look \nforward. Look forward into the reality of opportunity today in America. \nLet's move forward with that rational, logical approach promulgated by \nthe FCC.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Dorgan \nresolution. This is a debate and an issue that does bring us in touch \nwith a number of the important issues discussed by the Senator from \nVirginia: free speech, media concentration, consolidation. It certainly \naffects our media markets and the shape of those media markets for \nyears to come. But, at its heart, this is really a question of \nregulation, a new set of regulations, a different set of regulations \nput forward by the FCC, dealing with who can buy, who can own different \nkinds of media outlets--newspapers, TV, radio stations, and the like--\nand what kind of limits we are going to put on them.\n  So it is a debate about regulation and how much regulation is the \nappropriate amount on the part of the Federal Government. To what \ndegree do we want the Federal Government interfering with, limiting, \nand manipulating the media that we as consumers enjoy and use in our \ndaily lives? What level of regulation is appropriate and is really \nrequired to uphold some very important principles that you have heard \nthe Senator from Virginia and the Senator from North Dakota and many \nothers speak of--principles of localism, competition, and diversity, \nprinciples that we support, that the FCC works to support anytime it \nlooks at a regulatory issue such as this one?\n  How much regulation do we really require to protect these important \nprinciples? This is not a debate about the poor quality of the TV that \nwe might go home and look at, or look away from, every night. In some \nways, I wish this were a debate about improving the quality of \ntelevision because if we could just do that by a simple adjustment of \nthese regulations, then we probably would all feel much better about \nthe quality of television. But we can't.\n\n  To suggest this is about the quality of the television we see in any \npart of the country is to suggest that you believe limiting, say, Fox \nCorporation to the 35 stations it owns today versus the 40 or 42 or 44, \nor some number it might own at a future date with the new regulations, \nthat somehow that would affect the quality of the programming we see. I \nthink that is ridiculous. I don't think that program quality would be \nimproved if we forced NBC to get rid of 8 of its 29 stations or 10 or \n12 stations within the limits that we are talking about that any one of \nthese companies owns. I don't think it would in any way affect the \nquality of television.\n  I am the father of three children. I am as frustrated as any parent \nabout the search for good quality programming. I am frustrated about \nthe poor quality of programming that is often put on television in the \nprime time hour. But that is the nature of modern media--whether it is \ncable or radio or television or even newspapers. We are not all going \nto be happy as Americans with everything that comes across the \nchannels.\n  At the same time, I very much support the process that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota is using here, the Congressional Review Act. I think \nit does bear some emphasis because some people have come to the floor \nand have been somewhat critical of the process being used here--using \nthe Congressional Review Act resolution to repeal a regulation that a \nMember of Congress or a Member of the Senate doesn't like. But that is \nexactly what the law was intended to do.\n  It is a law that was passed, I am pleased to say, when Republicans \ntook control of Congress back in 1995. They said we ought to have as a \nCongress--as a House or as a Senate--a way to register disapproval; to \nrepeal regulations that are put forward all the time\n\n[[Page S11398]]\n\nby very large bureaucracies, or different branches of the executive \nregulating commerce, or regulating the environment, or regulating the \nforestry issues, or, in this case, regulating the media. It is a very \nappropriate use of the act, but it is a resolution with which I \nstrongly disagree. I will talk about those reasons this afternoon.\n  We are here obviously because the Senator from North Dakota has \nsubmitted this resolution of disapproval, or rejection of these new \nregulations, but the regulations were put forward in the first place \nprimarily because of a couple of issues.\n  The first was in 1996. The Telecommunications Act sets the guidelines \nunder which the FCC acts; that calls on the FCC to reconsider \nregulations that do not serve the principles of localism, competition, \nor diversity, and doesn't seem necessary to promote these competitive \nforces, or to serve the public.\n  The 1996 act actually calls on the members of the FCC to do exactly \nwhat they did; that is, reconsider these regulations and modify them if \nthey believe it is in the public interest and the right thing to do.\n  Second, related to that legislation but even more current is the \naction of the courts recently. The courts struck down or remanded \nseveral of the media regulations--in particular, the 35-percent cap \nwhich we will talk about--and called on the FCC to either revise or \njustify the regulations that were on the books.\n\n  So you have two forces coming to bear. I am sure the FCC \nCommissioners weren't dying to throw themselves into the issue, but \nthey were called upon effectively to do so by the courts and by the \nlegislation that this very Congress passed in 1996.\n  These are proposals--I think as the Senator from Virginia discussed--\nwhich were very long in the making. It was not a spur of the moment \nrecommendation or a spur of the moment change in regulations. For 20 \nmonths, there were deliberations, collecting comments, soliciting \ncomments, and several hearings that took place. People came forward and \nspoke for and against different rules and for and against different \nconcepts for changing those rules and to argue their point of view--to \nargue the very reasons they thought a change in the existing rules \nmight be in keeping with the goals of the 1996 act and the three \nprinciples of localism, competition, and diversity.\n  There was a thorough process, not one that was without any \ndisagreement but a great country, a strong country, and one where we \ntake great pride in our ability to debate and discuss these issues with \none another.\n  Let me talk about three of the proposals and the reasons I think at \nthe end of this very thorough and very complete process, resulting in \nthe rules put forward by the FCC, the reason I think the rules make \nsense, and why I don't think we should be rushing to repeal them or \nreject them. I believe there are several negative consequences of \nrepealing these rules, which I will speak about at the end of my \npresentation.\n  First, we are talking about a proposal that will take the current 35-\npercent cap to 45 percent.\n  What does the 35-percent cap mean? Is it 35 percent of the television \nmarket share? It is not 35 percent of the television viewers on any \nparticular night or any particular hour. It is not 35 percent of the \ntelevision station. It is a cap on owning stations that can reach 35 \npercent of the population, the immense concentration that we hear \nabout. Take NBC, for example, which owns 29 television stations. That \nis less than 2 percent of the number of full-power television stations \nin the country. I think they are the largest owner of stations. Perhaps \nFox Corporation may own 35 stations, close to 2.5 percent of the full-\npower television stations. This is just a limit on the amount of \nviewers you can reach if every viewer out there happens to be watching \nyour station.\n  If you look at, as I said, the number of stations that are owned, we \nare talking about a very small number on a percentage basis. Opponents \nof the rules and supporters of this resolution will say, well, let us \ntalk about the six big companies. Those six big companies control 75 \npercent of the television viewers.\n  First, to suggest you are being controlled when you choose what you \nwant to watch on television any given night, I think, misunderstands \nwhat television viewers are all about. But even if you look at those \nnumbers--six companies, 75 percent of the viewers--let us go back 20 or \n30 years; it used to be that there were three companies which had 90 \npercent of the viewers. I think things have changed in that regard for \nthe better. But the numbers are even more striking if you break them \napart further.\n  Those six companies may have 75 percent of the viewers because their \nshows happen to be popular, but they have fewer than 25 percent of the \nchannels that would typically come through your cable or your satellite \noutlet.\n  On that cable dial, all channels are created equal. We used to be \nsegmented in VHF and UHF. But today a majority of people receive their \ntelevision through cable or through satellite. Channel 85 and channel \n42 are just as likely to attract viewers, depending on the quality of \ntheir program.\n  It is a pretty fair fight when you think about it--pretty fair \ncompetition among the dozens of stations on the dial. Those six \ncompanies only control or own fewer than 25 percent of the channels. \nThere is greater competition in that regard and greater diversity in \nthat regard not only than we had 30 years ago but, quite frankly, than \nmost people could have imagined 30 years ago.\n  With all the discussion about localism--it is a very important thing, \nindeed--there has been no connection shown between localism and a \nlarger concentrated owner of these stations. Simply because a TV \nstation is owned by one of the larger corporations does not mean it \nshows less local programming. It is a very important point. This has \nbeen studied. You can look at it empirically, look at NBC, Fox, or ABC-\nowned stations, and measure how much local programming they put on any \ngiven day and compare it to independently owned stations around the \ncountry and measure how much local programming there is on any given \nday. There is no difference. To the extent there is a difference, one \nof the most comprehensive studies the FCC relied upon showed a slight \nincrease in local programming among those owned by the larger media \nentities.\n\n  Localism is important. To be sure, the FCC maintains its ability to \npress for and emphasize localism, diversity, and competition when they \nmake decisions of who can and cannot purchase a license. And all of the \npurchases of licenses--radio, TV--are still subject to FCC review and \nstill subject to antitrust laws that govern monopoly power in this \ncountry. So that is one of their regulations. Probably the one that \ngets the most discussion is the movement from a path of 35 to 45 \npercent of the audience that could be reached by all the stations.\n  The second regulation that received a lot of discussion is the issue \nof cross-ownership, whether you can allow a company that has a \nnewspaper to also own a TV or radio station. Here we actually have \ncases we can look at. The FCC did look at it and asked the question, \nWhere cross-ownership occurs, are localism, competition, and diversity \npoorly served? Do we have problems? Do we have conflicts of interest? \nDo we see a reduction in the responsiveness of the media outlets to \nlocal community needs? We can look at existing evidence because there \nwere 40 markets that were grandfatherd by the FCC, 40 markets where \nentities already engage in cross-ownership. There was no harm found by \nthe FCC. That certainly does not mean everyone is happy with everything \nthat newspaper or radio station or TV that has cross-ownership \nproduced. I am sure we will hear from Members that might in their \nremarks speak to personal experiences where they do not feel they were \ntreated well by a newspaper or radio station. That is unfortunate for \nthem.\n  But that is the nature of the country's free media and free markets. \nIt is something that ultimately, when we get over the personal \nfeelings, every member of this Chamber is proud of, that this country \nallows such a free and open media.\n  Again, where cross-ownership issues come into play and purchases of \nTV or radio station and all spectrum come into play, the principles of \nlocalism, competition, and diversity will be protected, but antitrust \nprovisions still hold. That is important to remember.\n\n[[Page S11399]]\n\n  A third and final area of regulatory change or regulations that has \nbeen discussed in this debate is radio ownership. There is a little bit \nof irony here because this is something that cuts close to home for the \nSenator from North Dakota, the celebrated case in his State where one \ncompany was able to acquire six or seven radio stations that all \ncovered one particular region of the State, a very clear case of \ndominance of radio in a particular region of the State. But with regard \nto radio ownership limits, the FCC actually tightened the regulations. \nThere is no change to the regulations on the number of stations you can \nown in a particular market in an attempt by the FCC to actually tighten \nthe definition of market areas in order to prevent that unfortunate \nsituation from happening again.\n\n  We can critique the radio stations or the large radio station owners, \ntalk about their business practices or things we liked or disliked \nabout them, and there are important points to make, but they do not \nreally have any bearing on this debate because even if this CRA \nprovision offered and were to pass, there would be no significant \nmodification to the radio ownership structures.\n  If the resolution passes, it does have a number of other \ncounterproductive effects that concern me. First and foremost, it would \nsurely send these issues back to the courts. That is one of the \nreasons--not the only reason but one of the reasons--the FCC acted in \nthe first place because the courts had said there is no justification \nfor the regulations as currently structured. So if this resolution \npasses and were to pass the House and get signed into law--which is \nunlikely to happen, and I certainly do not support it--if it were to be \nsigned into law, this would all be thrown back into the courts and we \nwould have a very uncertain environment for ownership, for media, for \nevaluation, and for business. Whether you are an entity large or small, \nindependent or corporately owned, it would create an uncertain \nmarketplace.\n  Second, this resolution turns back the clock. I don't believe that is \na good thing, in that turning back the clock would ignore the enormous \nchanges we have seen to the industry over the last 10 years, let alone \nthe last 20 or 30 years. A number of the regulations that are modified \nor adjusted by the FCC date back 30 or 40 years to their original \ncrafting.\n  I know it is difficult to picture what the state of television was \nfor many of the younger Members of the Chamber, but I amaze my children \nconstantly when I describe it in a world where you had to walk across \nthe room to change the channel on your television. I am old enough to \nremember those days and they seem not so long ago, indeed. Times have \nchanged enormously. Regulations dealing with this industry and with the \nmedia markets need to be updated to keep pace with the evolution of \ntechnology, to protect the values of localism, competition, and \ndiversity, but they do need to evolve with the changes in technology.\n  A third and final concern if this resolution were to pass was raised \nby FCC Chairman Michael Powell in a piece he authored yesterday or \ntoday for publication. That is, it could well portend the end of free \nTV. Rolling back these regulations with the passage of this act could \nresult in the end of free TV. It sounds like a pretty dramatic claim. I \nthink it bears some additional description. How could that be?\n  Free TV depends on advertising for its revenues. Cable TV depends on \nboth advertising revenue and cable subscriptions--monthly fees or per-\nshow fees paid to watch programming. Simply put, that is a better \nbusiness model. Anyone can see that. Pay TV has a better, stronger, \nmore robust business model. If you do not believe it, look at the \nmigration of so-called quality programming--sports, entertainment, even \ncertain forms of news programming from free TV to cable TV over the \nlast 3 or 4 or 5 years, let alone the last 10 or 15 years. Go back 10 \nor 15 years, it is a wholesale migration, but you can see changes in \nthe last 3, 4, or 5 years.\n  If we repeal the rules, we create a tougher competitive environment \nand more restrictive competitive environment for the free TV networks \nor stations. You put them at a competitive disadvantage relative to \ncable and pay TV. So the acceleration and the movement of that so-\ncalled quality programming to cable TV will only accelerate and make it \ntougher and tougher to sustain any level of quality among free TV in \nthe marketplace.\n  I could be cynical and say, That is fine with me. I don't care. I \nhave cable TV and I will still continue to get lots of channels, lots \nof entertainment, lots of news, and lots of sports. Many people would \nargue, and part of me certainly would argue, that there is a value and \na benefit to free TV especially in those areas of our country that are \nat an economic disadvantage, where cable TV does not have the \npenetration of urban areas and where people simply cannot afford to pay \nfor cable TV.\n  Those are serious considerations. The effect of free TV, turning back \nthe clock with regard to the evolution of technology and throwing the \nissues back into the courts, all of those would be cause to reject this \nresolution in and of themselves.\n  But on top of that, we see that the radio ownership regulations are \neffectively untouched. Cross-ownership has already proven its ability \nto work in the marketplace without harming the principles of localism, \ncompetition, and diversity. And the adjustment from 35 percent to 45 \npercent of national ownership cap, I would contend, is modest. It is \nvery modest, indeed, when you look at what the true market share \nnumbers are and the number of channels.\n  This is an important debate. I appreciate being given time to talk on \nthese issues. I do hope my colleagues step forward to reject this \nresolution, although, as I say, I certainly respect the way in which it \nhas been offered and the process the Senator from North Dakota has gone \nthrough to get us to this debate.\n  We respect the ideals of free speech, of democracy, and we work to \npromote the idea of competition and diversity in media ownership. I \nbelieve that is exactly what the FCC has done and attempted to do in \ncrafting these regulations. I hope we will reject this resolution and \ncontinue to move forward in a thoughtful way, and to a world and to an \nage of technology and media that, frankly, we can't quite picture today \nwhich will be exciting, will provide opportunities, and will continue \nto promote the ideals of free speech upon which this country was \nfounded.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this has been an interesting discussion on \nthe floor of the Senate today on an issue that I think is very \nimportant and one that will affect the life of every American citizen. \nIt is complicated and difficult to understand. In some circumstances, \nit deals with cases of law in Federal court, ideals with arcane rules, \nand the history of the Federal Communications Commission with respect \nto broadcast ownership. So it has all of those aspects.\n  I respect the fact there are those who feel strongly on the other \nside of the issue. I believe very strongly, of course, that the Federal \nCommunications Commission has created a set of rules that will benefit \nthe largest corporate interests in this country in broadcasting. I \nthink they will, however, be a significant detriment to the American \npeople.\n  I was sitting here thinking about the issue of radio and television. \nOf course, we have not had radio and television in the lives of \nhumankind for very long. It is a relatively recent phenomenon. And I \nwas thinking of the statement that was attributed once to David \nSarnoff. I don't know for sure that it was his. But he was asked to \ncomment about the advent of the radio when he was presented with this \nnew invention, and he said: ``The wireless music box--which he called \nit--has no imaginable commercial value. Who would pay for a message \nsent to nobody in particular?''\n  That was his vision of radio. But, of course, radio has become a very \nsignificant feature in our lives, and television as well.\n  Television is a central part of the lives of many Americans. I am \ntold that when children go to school in this country, by the time they \nare a senior in high school and graduate from school, they have spent \nsomewhere around 12,500 hours sitting in a classroom in our schools and \naround 20,000\n\n[[Page S11400]]\n\nhours in front of the television set. It tells you a little something \nabout the importance of television in the lives of at least children.\n\n  Let me respond to just a couple of the thoughts that have been \nexpressed by my colleagues. My two colleagues who just spoke are on the \nCommerce Committee, and on the Commerce Committee they supported the \nFCC and believe these rules are appropriate. They indicated, for \nexample, that in many ways these rules are for the purpose of \nprotecting--they don't use the term ``mom and pop,'' but let me use \nit--this is really for mom and pop television stations--you know, the \nlittle guy. It is helping the little television station out there that \nyou know is going to go by the wayside if we don't let the big guys buy \nthem up, I guess is the contention.\n  In fact, Commissioner Powell has an op-ed piece in the Wall Street \nJournal today. He begins his Wall Street Journal op-ed piece by saying: \n``The days of free television may be numbered.''\n  That is Commissioner Powell in today's Wall Street Journal. And he \nuses the title ``And That's the Way It Is.'' I guess that suggests \nWalter Cronkite, who actually opposes what Commissioner Powell is \ndoing. ``And That's the Way It Is.''\n\n       The days of free television may be numbered.\n\n  Interesting. This rule is nothing about free television. It certainly \nis nothing about mom and pop. It is nothing about saving small \ntelevision stations. Its point is that we are in the midst of a lot of \nchange that has a dramatic impact and the only way the television \nindustry can make it is to allow this concentration.\n  Well, perhaps we could just separate some fact from fiction. There is \nno evidence anywhere that the television industry or television \nstations or mom and pop stations are in any kind of financial trouble. \nWe have a substantial amount of evidence, in fact, that that is not the \ncase.\n  Let me quote Barry Diller, who is a giant in this industry. He \nrecently said: ``Anybody who thinks the networks are in trouble hasn't \nread the profit statements of those companies. The only way you can \nlose money in broadcasting is if somebody steals it from you.'' That is \nBarry Diller.\n  The Wall Street Journal reports that:\n  Fox's president for sales said, ``We all knew that it was going to be \nbig, it just turned out to be the biggest year that we had ever had.'' \nThe chairman of Fox Entertainment noted that Fox will generate \nsignificantly more revenue this year than in its previous 17 years, \nwith revenue growth up more than 20%.\n  So free television in financial trouble? I don't think so. It is \ninteresting to hear this discussion, that somehow the rule the FCC has \ndeveloped--that is really just a high dive on behalf of the largest \ncorporate interests--is being done in order to save the little guy. I \nhave heard a lot of things on the floor of the Senate but never \nanything quite as entertaining as that. But it is so far from fact that \nit is almost hard to respond to.\n  The FCC, we are told, in another argument, did what the court said it \nhad to do. The court said: The rules you have on broadcast ownership \ncannot be justified. You must change them.\n  That is not what the court said. I have what the court said in my \nhand. The court said: ``It is entirely possible that the Commission \nwill be able to justify a decision to retain the cap.'' It just said \nthat in the response the FCC provided, it did not provide the \njustification. It did not say: Go change the rule and give the largest \ncorporate interests everything they want. It said: Justify it.\n  The FCC did not even appeal the court's ruling, and now has not tried \nto justify it. It just said: Well, apparently the court said we must \ncave in here and decide that there is a kind of ``Katie bar the door'' \nlimit, and we will do what the big interests want.\n  Again, this is a regulatory agency that ought to be concerned about \nthe public interest but, in my judgment, with respect to these rules, \nis not concerned much about the public interest.\n  My colleagues say: This is all about the market system and the \nConstitution. The first amendment says you have the right of free \nspeech and the right to buy what you want to buy. One of my colleagues \ntalked about being able to acquire property you want to acquire.\n  That is not an inalienable right in this country. We have things such \nas antitrust. We have laws dealing with antitrust. When somebody wants \nto steal from you by creating a cartel and jacking up the price, that \nis called stealing. It violates the law, and we put people in jail for \nit. So you do not have an absolute right to do whatever you want in the \nmarketplace.\n  We have had some experience with this over time. The most recent \nexperience, of course, is the Enron Corporation. And I suppose some of \nthose Enron folks are going to get 2 years of hard tennis at some \nminimum-security institution some place.\n  Some of them are still waiting to see if indictments and charges will \ncome. Hundreds of millions of dollars were bilked from people because \nof concentration in the marketplace monopoly, pricing, and so forth.\n  Look, the point is this: If, in this circumstance, what people see, \nread, and think is controlled by fewer and fewer interests, it is, in \nmy judgment, detrimental to the democratic way of life and system of \ngovernment that we have because the foundation of this system of \ngovernment is the free flow of information.\n  Now, if somebody decided tomorrow, look, we are going to buy up all \nthe hamburger stands in America, and instead of driving down the street \nand seeing a McDonald's or a Burger King or a Wendy's, one company \ndecides we want all the hamburger stands in our name. We just want to \ncall all those hamburger stands ``The World's Best Burger Stands,'' and \nwe are going to buy them all. That would be awful, would it not? It \nwould not affect our lives very much. We might have indigestion once in \na while, and there would be no variety. Somebody would probably say it \nviolates the antitrust laws for a company to own them all, but I \nwouldn't have an apoplectic seizure on the Senate floor because I don't \nstop at those stands much.\n  But what about instead of hamburger stands, we talk about \ninformation? Information is what makes a democracy work. What about the \ncontrol of information in fewer and fewer and fewer hands? Is that \nsomething we should be concerned about? Yes, of course. That is \nsomething that is important. They say, well, but the market system \nshould make this judgment. Look, that market system is wonderful; it is \na great thing.\n  I used to teach economics briefly. I taught about the market system. \nI love the market system. It is a wonderful allocator of goods and \nservices. But it is not perfect. That is why we have regulators and \nregulations. Under the market system--Judge Judy, that woman on \ntelevision with an attitude, gets $25 million a year. Good for her. \nThat is the market system. Judge Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court, gets $180,000 a year. That is the market system.\n  A shortstop for a Texas baseball team makes the same amount of money \nin a year as 1,000 elementary school teachers. Good for him. Is that a \nmarket system judgment that you think makes sense? I don't. But that is \nthe market system.\n  The market system is not perfect. In circumstances where you are \ndealing with ideas, and the free flow of information in a democracy, we \nneed to be concerned about making certain that we don't have fewer and \nfewer people, fewer companies or institutions, determining what we see, \nread, and hear in this, the greatest democracy on Earth. That is what \nthis is about.\n  I mentioned earlier that there are some trashy things in the media. I \ntalked about the television programs that my colleague, Senator Nunn, \ntalked about on the floor of the Senate. I could have updated it and \nused the same things for this year or last year. I should hasten to \nsay, however, there are also some wonderful things. I don't want to \njust tarnish an industry. I think there are wonderful things, gripping \nthings, things with such incredible, utter beauty that you can hardly \ndescribe them, on television and on the radio. It is really quite \nremarkable.\n  Some of the things that we are able to see and experience are great. \nI don't want anybody to think that I am somebody who doesn't watch \ntelevision, doesn't appreciate television, or radio. I just want there \nto be some vibrancy with respect to the use of the airwaves,\n\n[[Page S11401]]\n\nwhich belong to the American people and are licensed to companies. I \nwant there to be vibrancy with respect to serving the local communities \nthey serve. The reason we license a radio station in a community is to \nbe responsive to local needs and interests in that community. It \ndoesn't attach at all when properties are purchased by companies that \nonly want to run homogenized music from a thousand miles away. They are \nselling advertising and making profits, but they don't do anything with \nrespect to the localism requirements in those local communities. That \nbothers me.\n\n  I offered this amendment with my colleagues, Republicans and \nDemocrats. This isn't a partisan or political issue in any way. Senator \nLott from Mississippi and I, and many others, including Senator Kay \nBailey Hutchison and others, have been very concerned about what is \ngoing on with respect to concentration in the media. This battle that \nhas shaped up in the FCC to write a new rule is a battle between the \npublic interest and the special interests.\n  Frankly, the special interests won everything. They won the whole \npot. By that, I mean it was put in the middle of the table and they \nturned over a card and the FCC said: You win, big interests; you get it \nall.\n  We have a procedure called the Congressional Review Act by which we \ncan, as the Senate, vote on whether we want to disapprove this rule. I \nwant the Senate to decide that now in this time we will say to the FCC \nthat we disapprove of that rule. That rule is not in the public's \ninterest. That rule is not what we expect this regulatory agency to do \non behalf of the American people.\n  I mentioned earlier, I come from a very small town. We didn't have a \nradio or television station. I come from a town of 350 people in a \nsouthwestern corner of a sparsely populated State. North Dakota is a \nwonderful place, but we have 640,000 people spread out in a landmass \nthe size of 10 Massachusettes. The nearest television station to where \nI grew up was 125 miles away. The first television in our little town \nwas at a place called the Regent Garage. The people in town--at night, \nespecially, because that is when you can catch disparate signals being \nbroadcast--would gather at the Regent Garage. With this one television \nset--the only one in our town, they would all peer into that set and \nsee this grainy, snowy vision coming from Bismarck, ND, 125 miles away.\n  Occasionally, there would be some sort of a skip and they would pick \nup professional wrestling from West Virginia, or a strange program from \nway out East. The people in my hometown thought it was just incredible. \nThe people began to get television sets. It wasn't just the Regent \nGarage; they got sets in their homes. So it has gone for some 60 years.\n  There wasn't any question years ago about localism. When stations \nwere developed, one developed closer to my hometown. It is still the \nclosest television station now. It was 60 miles away--KDIX television \nin Dickinson. As television stations developed, they were locally \nowned. The only way they got a television station in Dickinson is folks \nin the region put in money. They asked people to contribute $100. So my \ndad contributed $100. He was one of a lot of people who contributed to \nbuilding a television station in Dickinson, ND. So we had localism, \nlocal ownership.\n  But that has changed dramatically. The question is, Do we want it to \nchange more? Do we want most of our properties in broadcast radio and \ntelevision to be owned from a thousand miles away? Do we want, in most \nof our big cities, the dominant newspaper to own the dominant \ntelevision station? Do we want, in most big cities, to have one company \nown three television stations, eight radio stations, the dominant \nnewspaper, and the cable system? Does anybody think that will benefit \nthe consumers of this country? The answer ought to be no to those \nquestions.\n\n  That is not what we want or expect from the FCC. It is not the \ndirection that we anticipated when we created the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot to say. I want to correct one other \nthing with regards to the discussion about the quality of programming. \nSomebody talked about the quality of programming and said network-owned \nstations, where you have one big owner, you get higher quality \nprogramming from those folks because they have the money and they are \nbig shots and they have it all going. They are producing great things.\n  Well, here is something I think is interesting. Two organizations, \nNASA (Network Affiliated Stations Alliance) and the National \nAssociation of Broadcasters (NAB), were highly critical of a study that \nthe FCC did on the quality of news programming between affiliates and \nnetwork-owned stations. While the original study indicated that \nnetwork-owned stations did better than affiliates because they won more \nawards, NASA and NAB demonstrated that the conclusion was untrue once \nthe study was adjusted to take market size into account. After \ncontrolling for market size the data showed that independent affiliates \noutperformed network-owned stations on all measures of news quality. \nAffiliates win substantially more Dupont awards and substantially more \nPeabody awards. In addition, the Project for Excellence in Journalism \nstudy showed that affiliates are superior to network-owned stations in \nterms of news quality. I think that is important.\n  Finally, it is also important in the context of what kind of program \nis going to come into your community. Is it going to be programming \nthat someone in your community can decide they do not want? We see the \nprogramming these days on some of the national shows. It is almost \nembarrassing to read the names of the programming, and yet if you tune \nin some evening, when your television set comes on you will see someone \nstanding in front of a bowl of maggots and they are beginning to eat \nthis bowl of maggots. I forget the name, ``Fear Factor''--it is one of \nthose shows. I have only seen it momentarily.\n  When I saw somebody trying to eat a bowl of maggots, I thought: It is \na good thing there is an off button on the television set. Maybe there \nought to be an off button with the person who owns the local \nbroadcasting company saying: I happen to think that is not the program \nI want to sell in Tallahassee, FL, or Chattanooga, TN. What I would \nlike to do is put on an alternative program that I think is better than \nsomeone eating maggots.\n  You know what. They cannot do that. I described earlier letters from \nlocal stations who say: We can't do that. So the more stations you get \nunder this umbrella, under single ownership, the less opportunity \nanybody anywhere at any time will have to say: I don't happen to like \nthat program. You might have put it together in the recesses of a \ncloset in Hollywood someplace where you thought it was wonderful, but \nback in our hometown, we think it is trashy. I don't want to play it. I \nwant to play something that more reflects the values of our hometown.\n  They cannot change it. If you want more of that, if you want to move \nmore in that direction, then you ought to vote to sustain the FCC. Like \na cheerleader, shake some pom-poms, jump up in the air and say: We \nreally like what you do; bigger is better. Katie bar the door, let them \nhave anything. Let's have one big company give us a crooked smile every \nmorning and say: We are for America, and we decide what you ought to \nsee, what you ought to hear, and what you ought to read from Sunday to \nSaturday. Don't like it? Tough luck, we own it all.\n  If that is your philosophy, then you need to vote for this resolution \nof disapproval. But if you believe in enterprise, in local control, in \nowning up to the responsibility we have given those who own local \nstations, if you believe in that, then you ought to vote for this \nresolution of disapproval.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Federal Communications Commission \nregulations must serve the public interest by guaranteeing that a wide \nrange of local voices can be heard and by promoting competition in the \nmarketplace.\n  As a public trustee, the FCC has a duty and obligation to include the \npublic in its decisionmaking process. That was not done in this case.\n  I support this resolution that has been engineered by Senators Dorgan \nand Lott because the FCC did not hold a single public hearing to \npresent its proposed rules for comment. Chairman Powell refused to hold \na hearing even after Commissioners Copps and Adelstein personally \nrequested such a hearing.\n\n[[Page S11402]]\n\n  Even though the FCC's flawed process makes it impossible for me to \nsupport its action, I am deeply concerned about the situation in rural \ncommunities where many TV and radio stations are struggling.\n  The FCC cross-ownership provisions would enable a newspaper to more \neasily acquire a troubled and failing broadcast station in situations \nwhere it might not be cost efficient for another entity to purchase the \nstation.\n  Newspapers have the business expertise, the financial stability, and \nthe news-gathering resources to supplement local news and informational \nprogramming. If the FCC and Department of Justice have determined that \na transfer of title would serve the public interest and would not \npresent an unfair market advantage, newspapers should be permitted to \nuse these strengths to serve their communities.\n  Although pre-June 2 newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership prohibitions \nprovided for a waiver that would allow a newspaper to purchase a \nfailing broadcast company, only four such waivers have been granted in \nthe past 28 years.\n  Under the current cross-ownership provisions, the smallest broadcast \nmarkets would be protected from monopolies, and a limited cross-\nownership rule will remain in effect in markets of between four and \neight broadcast companies.\n  The FCC newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rules will benefit \ncommunities in Nevada. For this reason, I support the cross-ownership \npart of the FCC's action.\n  I hope the final outcome of this will be to drop the number of \nstations a company can own but allow the cross-ownership. This will not \nonly stimulate competition but will allow rural America to have some of \nthe programming that simply will not be available unless a newspaper \nand/or a TV station join together. This is the way it is all over \nAmerica, not just Nevada.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 17, \nthe bipartisan resolution offered by Senators Dorgan, Lott, and others \nthat would repeal rule changes recently adopted by the Federal \nCommunications Commission that, if allowed to go into effect, could \ndramatically alter the shape of the American media landscape.\n  The foundation of our democracy is based on the free flow of \ninformation guaranteed by the first amendment. As the Supreme Court \nexplained more than 50 years ago, the first amendment ``rests on the \nassumption that the widest possible dissemination of information from \ndiverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the \npeople.'' Unfortunately, the FCC's recent changes to its broadcast \nmedia ownership rules call into question that agency's commitment to \nthis fundamental principle.\n  On June 2 of this year, the FCC voted to significantly relax rules \nthat protect the American people from the ill-effects of concentrated \nmedia power. Already, in television and in print, large media \nconglomerates control an alarming amount of what Americans see, read, \nand hear. In fact, 75 percent of what Americans watch during prime time \nand 90 percent of the top 50 channels on cable are controlled by just 5 \nmedia companies.\n  Against this backdrop, the FCC's decision to allow greater \nconcentration of ownership is clearly a step in the wrong direction. If \nallowed to go into effect, these rules will result in fewer creative \noutlets for independent television and content producers; higher ad \nrates for large and small businesses; fewer antagonistic sources of \nnews and opinion; and less air time for community groups. In addition, \nthere may be growing reluctance by local station operators to take on \nnetwork executives in rejecting nationally produced programming that \nviolates community standards.\n  Some Members contend that ``[t]here should be reasoned debate on each \nof the rules'' rather than disapproving the entire package. I fully \nagree that there should be reasoned debate on each of the rules. That \nis exactly what I, along with 14 other Senators, asked FCC Chairman \nMichael Powell to do--to given Americans the opportunity to review and \ncomment on the specific rule changes before any final decision by the \nFCC. Our request was denied.\n  While recent action by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in staying \nthe implementation of these new rules is an encouraging sign that these \nchanges may not survive judicial scrutiny, we in Congress should not \nrely on court action. Instead, we must act decisively to protect the \npublic interest and to rescind these recently adopted rules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11402-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11402-S11406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.R. 2754, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2754) making appropriations for energy and \n     water development for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2004, and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, while we are now on this energy-water \nappropriations bill, let me first thank my friend, Senator Harry Reid \nfrom Nevada, as the ranking member of this subcommittee, for the hard \nwork he and his staff put into this bill. We have a great bill. The \nSenate will find that out in the next 2 or 3 days. I am hopeful there \nwill only be a few amendments. We kind of know what they are. We do not \nintend to discuss them until those proponents come to the floor and \noffer them, but we know about them and we think we can have a serious \ndebate Monday. I understand maybe we can't vote on Monday. If we can, \nwe will, and dispose of that serious nuclear amendment--antinuclear \ndevelopment amendment. If not, we would do it on Tuesday.\n  But I hope nobody intends to use this bill as a Christmas tree for \nauthorizations. I can assure them they will meet great resistance from \nthis Senator. This is not an authorization bill for electricity. That \nis somewhere else, another bill. It is in the conference. We have \nalready voted. We will not consider that, and if we do, it will not \nmatter because I will not bring back from conference any energy \namendments that belong on the authorization bill, creating the policy \nfor the energy future of our country.\n  With that, I move now to the business before the Senate.\n  Today the Senate is going to consider one of the 13 appropriations \nbills. It is a small one, but it is a very important one. We worked \nvery hard this year to put together what we think is a fair bill under \nextremely difficult circumstances. This fiscal 2004 allocation to the \nsubcommittee is $27 billion, an amount that is only $367 million over \nthe President's request. This situation posed a daunting challenge to \nthe subcommittee.\n  Let me put that in context. All of the Members here know the \nPresident's request dramatically cut water projects. The occupant of \nthe Chair knows that--it cut water projects well below the current year \nlevel and left out many projects we had to do.\n  Furthermore, the President proposed to fund a portion of the Corps of \nEngineers budget, an amount of $145 million, in a way the Congressional \nBudget Office says is not permissible. If it is not permissible and we \ndid it, it would be subject to a point of order--even though the \nCongressional Budget Office gives the President credit for the \nmechanism in this scoring request.\n\n  Thus, we have included a provision that will make an additional $145 \nmillion available to the Corps to spend on the enactment of the \nprovision in authorizing legislation that is required under the rules \nof the Congressional Budget Office. We think that is the way to do it.\n  But for now, the long and the short of all of this is that the \nPresident's request was $530 million below the current year level for \nwater projects, and we only received an increase from the \nappropriations process of $367 million.\n  There is nothing that Senators and House Members are more aware of \nthan water projects in their home States. I do not know if they are as \nimportant as the Members think. But I only can tell you that if you are \nchairman of this committee, you cannot get by without Senators stuffing \nyour pockets with the requests and sending them to your office, saying: \nDon't forget; don't forget. We have a pile of them. I didn't bring them \nto the floor. There are more than a few hundred.\n  The bill spreads the increased allocation generally as follows:\n\n[[Page S11403]]\n\n  An additional $233 million to the Corps water projects; an additional \n$67 million to the Bureau of Reclamation water projects; an additional \n$80 million to independent regional commissions which were badly cut in \nthe President's request, such as the Denali Regional Commission of \nAlaska, the Appalachia Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional \nCommission; and we held the Department of Energy at just about the \nPresident's request level.\n  I believe--and I think Senator Reid will agree with me--that this was \nthe fairest way to distribute the very limited resources. It was the \nfairest in any sense of the word, and also in the sense of the word of \nwhat our Members expect of us and what they can expect of us in doing \nour job correctly.\n  The bill provides $4.43 billion for the Corps of Engineers. That is \n$233 million above the President's request but $212 million below the \ncurrent year's level. We have included no new construction projects and \nhave focused our resources on restoring the cuts to existing \nconstruction projects.\n  For the Bureau of Reclamation and related activities, the bill \nprovides $990 million, which is $67 million above the President's \nrequest but only $17 million above the current year level.\n  For nuclear weapons activities of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration--known as NNSA--the bill provides $6.47 billion, which \nis $96 million more than the President's request and $492 million over \nthe current year level.\n  The budget increases are consistent with a major Defense Department \ninitiative to restore our nuclear weapons complex.\n  Mr. President, I told you when we opened the bill that it was a small \nbill. But it has a lot in it. It pays for the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration. That is the laboratories and the administration. Among \nits charges is making sure scientifically, with the science-based \nStockpile Stewardship Program--meaning these laboratories have to \nengage in all kinds and varieties of science--that they tell us our \nweapons are valid without testing them.\n  For most of our adult life we tested them, so we had no doubt. Great \nscientists hooked them up and the great desert provided the test site. \nAnd we tested them. But we voted to quit it. We didn't vote to stop \nhaving nuclear weapons; we just voted not to test them.\n\n  Somebody has the responsibility when you stop testing them to be in a \nposition of reporting to the Chief Executive and, thus, then to us \nwhether the weapons are still valid. Some of them are 30 or 35 years \nold. I don't know whether they are 40 years old yet. But they are \npretty old for nuclear weapons. So somebody has to do that. That is the \nwork of the National Nuclear Security Administration and the \nlaboratories, and this bill has to pay for that.\n  For nuclear nonproliferation activities, it is important that we \nunderstand this little bill funds $1.34 billion, which is the same as \nthe President's request, and $171 million above the current level. The \ncommittee continues its leadership role in countering nuclear \nterrorism. The budget request, coupled with $148 million added in last \nyear's supplemental, gives a strong boost to this highly important \nprogram.\n  When we speak of terror in the world, we now have almost stopped \ntalking about nuclear terrorism because we speak so much about \nbiological terrorism and chemical terrorism. But we cannot forget that \nthe granddaddy of all terrorist activities is a nuclear terrorist \nactivity.\n  Nonproliferation is the effort of our Government to try to keep the \nthings that people might use for nuclear weapons or to keep them out of \nthe hands of those who might put them together and use them. That is a \nbig job.\n  This is a little bill with a lot of money--$1.34 billion for that \neffort. We have great laboratory people engaged in that.\n  Then there is the ``Isn't good news provision.'' We have been paying \nto clean up energy sites for many years. These are the sites that \nremained from the cold-war era in the development of nuclear weapons \nand plutonium in various parts of America, such as the Savannah River \narea, areas in the west coast and Washington--environmental cleanup \nsites.\n  This bill provides an incredible amount of money--$7.6 billion. But \nbelieve it or not, that is $62 million below the President's request. \nFor the first time in many years, it is less than the previous year--\n$238 million less.\n  The subcommittee was not required to add huge additional amounts to \nmaintain cleanup budgets around the country. This is an unknown--almost \nsecret--success of this Department of Energy. They said they would do \nit when they took office, but they have been saying it as they took \noffice in that Department for 12 years, that I am aware of, and each \nyear it was more--not less.\n  We finally have a couple of projects--led by one in Colorado--which \nhave timeframes for completion which is credible and near at hand. \nThere are some that are going to go on for a long time. But at least \nsince this money comes out of the defense of our country, the Defense \nDepartment might be hopeful that as they increase their defense dollars \nwe will not have to suck away large amounts to pay for this cleanup, \nalthough I am not yet making that as a promise because there are a few \nof these sites for which we are not absolutely certain how long it will \ntake and how much it will cost. But they have become extremely, \nextremely expensive sites with thousands of people employed.\n  The frustration level for a Senator such as me paying for it year \nafter year is very high. I didn't think the cleanup sites were supposed \nto be public works projects. I thought they were supposed to be cleanup \nsites.\n  But there is a lot of justification and a lot of reasoning, and we \nare not responsible for all of them. But some of them we have to fix, \nand we are trying.\n  Then there is a great issue in the State of my friend, Harry Reid, of \nYucca Mountain. The project at Yucca causes the Senate to provide $425 \nmillion for 2004 construction. That is $166 million below the \nPresident's request, and $32 million less than the current level. But \nthis project will be a major point of contention in conference with the \nHouse, which has increased the project by $180 million over the \nrequest.\n  This is a very important matter to many members of the subcommittee, \neach for various reasons, and it will require additional work as we \nmove through the process.\n  For renewable energy research and development, believe it or not, we \neven found the money--$459 million, which is $15 million more than the \nPresident's request and $40 million more than this year--for \nrenewables.\n  The committee funds the President's new hydrogen technology \ninitiative.\n  For nuclear energy research and development, the bill provides $437 \nmillion, which is $447 million above the President's request and $63 \nmillion over a comparable current bill level. The Members know this is \na great priority of mine as we continue to make investments. I believe \nit will eventually result in the construction of a new commercial power \nreactor, or more than one, in the United States. We will provide a \ntotal of $35 million toward the development of a new reactor in Idaho \nthat could produce both electricity and hydrogen. We are not alone in \nthis goal and in this kind of project. Japan is on the way. Japan is \nsubstantially ahead in terms of a timeframe for hydrogen engines in \nautomobiles. Yet it is not something that will happen quickly. It is a \nfew years away even for them, like 10, and, who knows, more than that \nfor us. But we had better get started since we know we are hugely \ndependent upon oil from foreign countries.\n\n  Basic research for the Department of Energy: $3.36 billion, which is \n$50 million above the President and $88 million above this year. We \ntalk about research. We had a big debate last night about research at \nthe National Institutes of Health, a huge debate. We are researching \nthe human body and the ways we might give health where the bodies are \nsick and find solutions to illnesses that besiege us. We are spending a \nhuge amount of money in that field. I think the figure was well over \nthe $25 billion mark.\n  The other agency that does research, but in physics and other \nsciences, is the Department of Energy. We do not treat it right; we \nonly have $3.36 billion. That is $88 million more than last year for \nall of their research.\n\n[[Page S11404]]\n\n  The bill provides $48.5 million for the Denali Commission, $58 \nmillion for the Appalachian Regional Commission, and $7 million for the \nDelta Regional Authority, an increase of $5 million over the \nPresident's request and $1 million below the current year level.\n  The bill also provides a total budget of $619 million for the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, the same as the budget request and an increase \nof $41 million over the current year level.\n  Given the overall constraints, we worked hard but were unfortunately \nlimited to accommodating only the highest priority requests of Members \nwhere possible. This is going to be a difficult year, but I look \nforward to the recommendations of other Members.\n  Finally, the Senate should be fully aware that the committee reported \nbill includes a provision regarding the Middle Rio Grande River in New \nMexico. The provision does two things. First it prohibits the use of \nouter-basin water for endangered species purposes. Second, it \nestablishes how the Endangered Species Act will be complied with for \nthis river and the affected fish. This is a very important provision \nthat has the bipartisan support in the New Mexico delegation and at the \nstate level.\n  Before I yield to the floor and my Ranking Member for his statement, \nI would like to thank him and his excellent staff for all the effort he \nhas put forth in getting this bill put together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I join with Senator Domenici in presenting this 2004 Energy \nand Water Development Appropriations Act. I am pleased with the bill \nSenator Domenici and I have produced. Our relationship extends all my \ntime in the Senate on this committee. We have done this bill seven or \neight cycles. We have worked together a long time and have worked well \ntogether.\n  This has proven to be a difficult bill this year given the very tight \nbudget constraints within which we had to work. Effectively, Senator \nDomenici and I--I hate to use the word ``effectively''--we have worked \nwell together. We have $367 million in new funding, which is hardly \nadequate to pay for the many needs in this bill.\n  We added the first $300 million to the Corps of Engineers in the \nBureau of Reclamation. I am pleased we added $233 million above the \nbudget for the Corps, but I note that we are $212 million below what we \nenacted last year.\n  I realize with respect to staffs, they have done the best they could \ndo with the limited resources. But we need to recognize that by \nunderfunding the Corps of Engineers, we are seriously impacting how \nthey accomplish the mission Congress laid out for them. Project \nschedules will continue to be lengthened, the maintenance backlog will \ngrow, and solutions to water needs throughout the country will be \ndelayed.\n  We must always remember, as many have said, wars in the future are \nnot going to be fought over land but over water. We have wars already \ntaking place within the confines of our country dealing with water.\n  Senator Domenici and I believe over the long term we need to find \nadditional resources for the Corps. The work they do for our Nation is \ntoo important to be underfunded in the manner they are underfunded.\n  Finally, $67 million in funding above the President's request was \nadded to regional commissions which were slashed in the President's \nbudget request. While the funding for the Denali Commission, the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority is \nfar below what is required, we have been able to improve matters \nsignificantly. While we were able to restore current year funding to \nthe Appalachian Regional Commission, I am disappointed we are unable to \ndo more for the Delta Regional Authority. However, our funding \nconstraints simply do not allow more funding to be restored at this \npoint.\n  At some time there will be offered an emergency title fund for \nweather-related, nationwide problems, and that is what we have done \nwhile the bill is on the floor. I am prepared to muster every vote \npossible to support this critical emergency package. There was a debate \nyesterday that took place, but a very cursory glance would recognize \nthis is much different from what was presented yesterday. We try to be \nfiscally prudent. We strive to be fiscally prudent. We were sent here \nto be responsive to the needs of the American people. Devastating \nfloods, hurricanes, tornados, and fires have hit so many parts of the \ncountry this year, requiring a response from the Congress. I am glad we \nare going to do so. We will have bipartisan support for this emergency \nrequest.\n  As for fiscal year 2004 before the Senate, I reiterate, as either \nSenator Domenici or I do every year at this time, we have produced a \nbipartisan bill that addresses the needs of the Nation and accommodates \nmany of the desires of our Members. We cannot give everyone everything \nthey need. That is an understatement. We do the best we can. Our \nsubcommittee has always been known as one of the most collegial on the \nHill. Our staffs have performed this way this year in super fashion. I \nextend to Senator Domenici my appreciation for his leadership in \nhelping produce this bill.\n\n  Additionally, I think it is useful to let everyone know there have \nbeen certain items deferred for consideration when we go to \nconference--that is, with one exception--the same items we defer each \nyear until we know what our final resources will be. We cannot do that \nuntil we complete our conference. So there are no new construction \nstarts or new environment infrastructure projects for the Corps or \nBureau and no university or hospital marks within the DOE's Office of \nScience and no geographically specific renewable energy earmarks. It is \nmy expectation, as every year, that we will emerge with Members' \nprojects in each of the accounts.\n  In my view, we will accomplish three very important objectives with \nthis legislation. No. 1, we have been able to restore many of the \nridiculous cuts made by the administration to the Corps and Bureau. \nThis President, this administration, is not the only one that has made \nthese ridiculous cuts, but that is not the way it is. For reasons I do \nnot fully understand, every administration does such a terrible job of \nunderstanding the importance of the Corps of Engineers. Each year, we \nget a budget from a President that tremendously underfunds these \nprograms.\n  It reminds me of when I was chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee. Every year, we got a request from the President that did \nnot do anything for the Guard and Reserve--nothing. I don't know what \nthis country would have done if we had sent the bill back they gave us. \nEvery year, the Congress bails out the administration on projects, \nprograms relating to the National Guard and Reserve programs. That is \nwhat this reminds me of. I don't know what the country would do if we \nsent the administration back the bill they gave us. But as usual, we \ndon't have the resources to do more.\n\n  We have a construction backlog with the Corps of Engineers and the \nBureau of Reclamation of $40 billion, but we have found enough \nresources to prevent the problem from becoming much worse. The chronic \nunderfunding of the Corps of Engineers prevents it from establishing \nthe critical flood control and navigation infrastructure of this \nNation.\n  In the meantime, rather than me going into a lot of detail, suffice \nit to say that I believe this administration is doing the American \ntaxpayer a tremendous disservice by sending woefully inadequate budget \nrequests to Capitol Hill. In fact, I believe they are putting our \neconomy at risk and putting people's lives at risk.\n  No. 2, in this bill we have fully funded the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, the organization charged with keeping our \nnuclear weapons stockpile safe, secure, and reliable, and with securing \nand safeguarding fissile material abroad, particularly in Russia.\n  At a time when our Nation has never been more concerned about \nhomeland security, these programs are more critical than ever.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we are going to send an amendment to the desk \nat a subsequent time that will provide, on an emergency basis, $125 \nmillion in Corps of Engineers funding to mitigate weather-related \ndamages. Acts of God is the reason we are offering this emergency \namendment. There may be a few who oppose an emergency designation on \nthis portion of the bill, but this funding is absolutely critical to \nthe\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\nparts of our country that have been devastated by floods, hurricanes, \ntornadoes, and fires this year.\n  Senator Domenici did a fine job of describing the bill, so I will not \ntake up everyone's time by repeating it. However, before we close here \ntoday, I want to take a moment to thank the staffs for all their hard \nwork.\n  This bill has never had the resources needed to do what our Members \nwould like us to do. However, the staffs have always done the very best \nthey could with what we had.\n  Senator Domenici has always been well served by his now-former staff \ndirector, Clay Sell. Tammy Perrin and Erin McHale have also done a very \ngood job for the majority staff.\n  Clay left the committee at the end of July to become a Special \nAssistant to President Bush for Economic Affairs. And I don't think it \nis appropriate to blame Clay for the just-announced deficits that we \nhave. But I do say, on a serious note, he is a fine man, and the \nPresident is so fortunate to have someone of Clay's stature working for \nhim.\n  As I have indicated, he has been great to work with. He has been a \ntremendous asset to Chairman Domenici. And my staff and I have nothing \nbut fine things to say about him and the rest of Senator Domenici's \nstaff.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Domenici's former Energy and \nWater staff director, Alex Flint, who is now the chief of staff in the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, of which Senator Domenici is \nthe chairman. Alex Flint is therefore working here on this bill as the \nstaff director of the Natural Resources Committee, but also helping \nmaneuver this bill through the Congress. And he can do that because he \nhas had previous experience being the staff director for Senator \nDomenici.\n  Alex Flint is a fine man. He is of the same caliber as Clay. Senator \nDomenici has been served extremely well by these two fine men.\n\n  On my staff, Madam President, I thank Roger Cockrell. It was very \ndifficult to do, but Roger agreed to leave his lifetime job, really, \nwith the Corps of Engineers and come to work for the Senate, the \nAppropriations Committee. What a wonderful asset he has been to our \ncommittee.\n  Senator Byrd was elated we were able to work this out so that he came \nhere. There is nobody in the Congress that knows more about the Corps \nof Engineers projects than Roger Cockrell. So I publicly thank him for \nmaking this very dramatic change in his personal life, leaving the \ncareer that he has had. And I am sure they are disappointed, the people \nat the Corps, but we in the Senate are elated he has decided to join us \non a permanent basis. He does a wonderful job of handling our water \nissues.\n  There are a handful of Senators who are interested in the NNSA and \nother DOE issues, but every Member has an interest in the Corps of \nEngineers and/or Bureau of Reclamation projects. Those projects are the \nengine that drives this bill, and Roger does a wonderful job of working \nthrough literally thousands of requests.\n  I also thank Nancy Olkewicz, who returned to the subcommittee to \nhandle renewable energy, nuclear energy, the Office of Science, and \nseveral other non-Defense Department of Energy accounts this year after \nhaving worked for the full committee for a number of years.\n  Senator Byrd has spoken highly of Nancy. And I am very happy that she \nhas been willing to come here and work with me on this bill, and also \nfor Senator Durbin on the legislative branch bill.\n  Finally, I want to say a word about my staff director, Drew Willison. \nDrew is one of those people who came to the Senate as a fellow from a \nGovernment agency. This agency was the Environmental Protection Agency. \nHe worked with me, and he worked in the areas that he was not familiar \nwith, but it didn't matter; he was tremendous. The first year he came \nto work for me, we had a highway bill. I had been on the Environment \nand Public Works Committee since I came to the Senate, and he was the \nfirst person who was able to impart to me enough information that I \nfully understood what I was doing.\n  As a result of that, I recognized talent when I saw it, and I worked \nwith him to get him to leave the Environmental Protection Agency. He \nhas had a very busy time working with me. He has graduated from law \nschool while working with me, going to night school, which is very \nhard. He went to my alma mater, George Washington School of Law.\n  In short, let me just say that Drew Willison is a valuable asset to \nnot only me but to our country.\n  And let me say to Senator Domenici, I appreciate many things about \nSenator Domenici, but most of all his friendship. He is a proud \nRepublican. I am a proud Democrat. But first of all, we are proud \nAmericans.\n  He does a tremendous job of representing the State of New Mexico. I \nhave been with him to New Mexico. I have been to New Mexico without \nhim. He is a person who serves that State very well.\n  As I have indicated, I thank Senator Domenici very much for our many \nyears of working on this committee. I heard Senator Specter talk about \nhe and Senator Harkin having a seamless transition when things change \nin the Senate, but so do we. Under the circumstances we have had this \nyear, it has been extremely difficult. I am happy to work with him and \nlock arms and do what we can to push through this most important piece \nof legislation.\n\n  Every dollar we have in this bill is designated. We don't have set-\nasides in this bill. Senator Domenici and I and our staffs work \ntogether to try to come up with a fair bill. These dollar amounts in \nthis bill are not--no one dictates to us what we do. We have to decide \nwhat is best for the country. We are not always right, but we really \ntry to do what is right for the country.\n  I also thank Chairman Stevens and Senator Byrd, who is also the \nformer Democratic leader, for their steadfast support for the work that \nDomenici and Reid do. I have never had either one of these people come \nto me and say: How could you have done this? It is the wrong thing you \nhave done for the committee. It is quite the opposite. They come to us \nand say: How can we help?\n  So they are great to work with, these two men. The President pro \ntempore of the Senate is Senator Stevens, who is the successor of the \nPresident pro tempore when we were in control, Senator Byrd.\n  These two very wise men have very tough choices to make, but I have \ngreat respect for the work they do, which has only been amplified by \nthe way they worked with us on this bill.\n  So I look forward to debate on this bill starting next week. Senator \nDomenici and I are disappointed we are not going to have votes on \nMonday. But, as some know, a terrible tragedy occurred in the Senate \nfamily. The son of Senator Gordon Smith, a wonderful human being, was \ntaken in death this past Wednesday night. So as a result of that, there \nwill be no Senate votes on Monday. The Senate will be in session on \nMonday, but out of respect for Senator Smith, there will be no votes.\n  Senator Domenici and I have asked, and we have received word that \nSenator Feinstein will offer her amendment, which will be cosponsored \nby Senator Kennedy. They can be here at 2:30. We will see if the leader \ncan agree that we can have them debate this matter and set it up for a \nvote Tuesday, at the discretion of the majority leader. I look forward \nto the debate.\n  As Senator Domenici said, we hope people understand this bill is not \na perfect bill. It is the best we have done. If somebody has a problem, \ntheir staff should get ahold of our staff. We feel we have bipartisan \nsupport, and we have pretty much accomplished what we have set forth in \nthe bill. The matter Senator Feinstein will debate is something that, \nas far as we know, is the only real contentious issue on the bill, and \nthat relates to some of the nuclear money in this bill. Other than \nthat, I think we should have a fairly easy time moving this most \nimportant bill through the Senate. We look forward to conference, \nwhich, again, will not be easy. We have our position and we will do our \nbest to protect the position of the Senate in conference with the \nHouse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for his kind \nremarks. I think he knows that for each and every comment he made, I \nhave\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nnothing but reciprocal feelings toward him. I thank him for his hard \nwork and for working with me to get this good bill.\n  There are two things in this bill that are always misunderstood, and \nadministration after administration makes it difficult. One is the \nCorps of Engineers. It is kind of amazing, whenever we get in trouble \nand we want somebody to build something for us someplace overseas, the \nCorps of Engineers is asked to supervise it and manage it and hire the \npeople and the contractors--whether it is in Saudi Arabia or Iraq. And \nthen at home, every President cuts the Corps of Engineers and leaves us \nin a position where we cannot sustain those numbers. So we have a bill \nthat gets more difficult all the time.\n  This year, the President didn't do as badly; nonetheless, the same \nsequence was followed. We are trying to fix it somewhat. It has put us \nin the position where we cannot quite do it. We will be talking with \nother people in the Senate about some very serious emergency matters, \nwhich are not covered here, that we might very much have the Senate \nconsider putting in this bill.\n  Second, people don't know we run three giant nuclear laboratories. \nThat means we have to keep the best scientists in the world and their \nfamilies living in the area, especially Los Alamos, which is a city \nbuilt only for nuclear. That means we have to modernize because \nscientists are living in modern times. They want to work in modern \nfacilities, not 50-year-old buildings. We are in the process of \nmodernizing the workplace in Los Alamos in particular. Some don't \nunderstand that that is a must. We have to spend money to do it. In \naddition, as part of maintaining a rigorous core of nuclear weapons, \nthere are certain scientific activities these laboratories have to do, \nso they are always on the cutting edge in terms of keeping these the \nmost safe weapons. That means they have to do research--the most \ncutting-edge kind. You cannot have scientists at Sandia Laboratory or \nLos Alamos researching in depth a new science called nanoscience in \nshacks or in 50-year-old buildings. We are in the process of rebuilding \nmodern facilities for this kind of science. We are going to bring \ncompanies and individuals to work with these great scientists as this \nnew field of nanoscience is developed.\n\n  The same is true with microengineering, which is another incredible \nfield. We have to do that, too. They need to use some microengineering \naspects in replacing parts of nuclear weapons, to keep them safe. So we \nhave to have facilities. We are in the process of building facilities--\nthe greatest in the world--to take microengineering and develop it.\n  Microengineering, to put it in a simple way, is a wafer we use now \nfor computers. The wafer we are talking about in microengineering \ncontains on it thousands of machines, or engines. These little machines \ncan be formulated to work, one with the other, on a wafer. When you see \nit with a magnifying glass, you say what in the world is next for \nhumankind, and what are they going to do with these? Nobody knows yet, \nbut it will be part of the next generation. Perhaps medical science \nwill use them. Perhaps it will be injected into the human body and \nthese little machines will go to work and do things in the body, or for \nthe body, such as clean out parts around the heart by just eating them \nup. We don't know. But those are things that are in these laboratories. \nWe get excited when we hear and see them.\n  So when we fund these buildings, we are funding something great for \nour country. People don't believe us and they think maybe we should not \nbe doing some of it, but we have been generally prevailing. The Senate \nhas been saying let's do it, let's keep on.\n  Madam President, we are finished for the evening. We have nothing \nelse to do, and we have no indication that anybody else wants to do \nanything. From my standpoint, I am going to finish now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11406-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, September 11, 2001, was a day of infamy \nthat will rank down with the very worst, most cowardly and vile actions \never taken against this Nation or any other nation on this planet, a \nsneak attack, murdering thousands--innocent children, women, and men--\nwith no provocation, no forewarning, with no justification or rational \nreason, just the demented ravings and rantings of a fanatic who has \nperverted the principal teachings of his professed faith, of its \ngreatest prophet, Mohammad. He twisted Mohammad's words into support \nfor wars, with himself to play God and decide who deserved mercy and \nwho did not.\n  Innocent civilians died in the United States as a result of that \nfanaticism. His soldiers died on September 11. And he is off somewhere \nhiding in a cave.\n  Ten Minnesotans or Minnesota natives lost their lives in the attacks \nthat terrible day: Gordon Aamoth, Jr., whose parents are good friends \nof my parents, an investment banker with offices on the 104th floor of \nthe World Trade Center; as did Ann Nelson, a bond trader. Others were \nkilled at work at the Pentagon: Captain Charles Burlingame, III, was \nthe pilot of the hijacked American airlines plane which struck the \nWorld Trade Center. Tom Burnet was a passenger on United Airlines \nFlight 93, and one who led the counterattack against the hijackers on \nthat plane. Tom and the other American heroes could not save \nthemselves, but they may have saved us, as that plane's target was \nreportedly this very Capitol in which I stand with you today--alive, \nall of us, thanks, possibly, to Tom Burnet and the other American \nheroes.\n  These were good, hard-working Minnesotans, good, hard-working \nAmerican citizens, who had the terrible misfortune to be living their \nlives in the wrong places on that day, September 11, 2001. They have \nbeen forever taken away from their families and friends, from their \nlives. So to those families and friends I express my very deepest \ncondolences.\n  I remember leaving the Russell Senate Office Building that morning, \ngoing over to a hotel just a couple of blocks away from the Capitol \nwhere I was residing at the time, and I was asked by the general \nmanager if I wanted to go up on the roof of the hotel, which I did, \nabout 10:30 in the morning. The sky was totally clear except for a dark \nplume of cloud coming up from the Pentagon. There was no air traffic in \nthe sky, no planes going in and out of National Airport, no \nhelicopters, as is usually the case, going across the river.\n  All was quiet there until suddenly this one F-16 fighter plane came \nstreaking down The Mall, seemingly just a few hundred feet right over \nthe top of the Capitol. I thought to myself, I just never imagined in \nmy worst nightmares I would ever see a day where a U.S. fighter jet was \nflying over our Capitol to defend it from whatever foreign enemy was \nattacking us. I pray to God I will never, ever see it again--never \nagain.\n  George W. Bush became our President that week. He hadn't been elected \nour President, not in the traditional way of a democracy, by getting \nthe most votes in the election, but that week he became our President. \nHe rose magnificently to the enormous challenges and burdens which a \nPresident of the United States must bear, and must often bear alone, \nfor all the rest of us. President Bush did that and he did it well, \nvery well. He gained the good will of our entire Nation, and our Nation \ngained the good will of almost the entire world.\n  What priceless silver linings there were for all of us who survived \nthose dark, terrible, black clouds which engulfed us on that terrible \nday. What opportunities those 10 Minnesotans and\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\ntheir fellow citizens gave to their country, at the terrible cost of \ntheir own lives. We gained the support, the good will, and the alliance \nof practically the entire world.\n  The President said, just 4 months later in his State of the Union \nAddress to Congress and the American people, on January 29, 2002:\n\n       As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war, our economy is \n     in recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented \n     dangers. Yet the State of our Union has never been stronger.\n\n  I recall all of us rising up in the House Chamber where we were \nwitnessing that speech, and being stirred--shivers down my spine--by \nthose words: ``Yet the state of our Union has never been stronger.''\n  Today, 2 years later, the U.S. Government, the same Bush \nadministration, does not have the support nor the trust nor the respect \nof the nations of the world--not their governments and not the majority \nof their citizens. That is not surprising. For most of the past year, \nthe administration has scorned most of the rest of the world. It has \ndenounced the United Nations, derided allies of ours who disagreed with \nus, has berated others in order to try to compel their support. And it \nhas proclaimed repeatedly the right of the United States, and the \nintention of the Bush administration, to take whatever military action \nit deems necessary--whenever, against whomever, who threatened or might \nat some time in the future threaten our national security.\n  No one in this country who cares about this country could question \nour right to protect our Nation's or our citizens' safety, not before \nSeptember 11, 2001, and not after September 11, 2001. No one in the \nworld who wishes us well would question our doing so. In fact, the vast \nmajority of the world's governments and people supported our war \nagainst the Taliban in Afghanistan, and against al-Qaida, and our \nstated intention to attack terrorists and terrorist organizations and \ntheir bases of operation wherever they were throughout the world.\n  But instead, the administration chose to go to war against Iraq. That \naction most of the rest of the world did not support. Other governments \nand the United Nations were skeptical about the Bush administration's \nclaim that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction which U.N. \ninspectors could not find last fall and this year. They didn't believe \nthey constituted an imminent threat to our National Security.\n  The Chief U.N. Weapons Inspector, Hans Blix, called the evidence the \nU.S. gave him about Iran's weapons of mass destruction ``pretty \npathetic.'' The rest of the world was skeptical, and the rest of the \nworld would be proven right to be skeptical. There were no weapons of \nmass destruction used, thank God, against U.S. troops when they invaded \nIraq. No weapons of mass destruction were found unused on battlefields \nor command posts or stored in caches anywhere in that country. Not even \nbiological, chemical, or nuclear materials that could have been used to \nmake those weapons have been found. Not even top level Iraqi scientists \nor former government officials, some of whom have been incarcerated for \nmonths now, denied any legal representation, denied chances to visit \nwith their families--in some cases the families don't even know where \nthey are or even if they are alive--not even interrogations under those \nconditions have produced information leading to weapons of mass \ndestruction or supplies of weapons of mass destruction materials of the \nkinds and in the amounts that were claimed by the President and Vice \nPresident and Secretary of Defense and the National Security Adviser.\n  The rest of the world didn't believe our fears, but the American \npeople did. The American people trusted our leaders. They believed \nthem. They supported their decisions. They sent their sons and \ndaughters, their husbands and wives, their friends and neighbors \nhalfway around the world to fight for, and some to die for, that stated \nthreat, that urgent threat that was asserted again and again by our \nleaders.\n  On August 26, 2002, Vice President Cheney said in a speech:\n\n       There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein now has weapons of \n     mass destruction. There is no doubt that he is amassing them \n     to use against our friends, against our allies, and against \n     us.\n  One month later, on September 26, 2002, President Bush stated after \nmeeting with Members of Congress:\n\n       All of us are united in our determination to confront an \n     urgent threat to America. The danger to our country is grave. \n     The danger to our country is growing. The Iraqi regime \n     possesses biological and chemical weapons. The Iraqi regime \n     could launch a biological or chemical attack in as little as \n     minutes after the order were given.\n\n  Ten days later, just before Congress voted on his desire for a \nresolution, the President added that ``Iraq is exploring ways of using \nUVAs--unmanned aerial vehicles--for missions targeting the United \nStates''.\n  Later, the administration officials admitted those vehicles had a \nmaximum range of only about 300 miles and couldn't have been used \nagainst the United States.\n  During the same speech, the President asserted Saddam Hussein could \nhave ``a nuclear weapon in less than a year''.\n  Supposedly the evidence cited and leaked to the press before that \nspeech was that Saddam Hussein was secretly buying aluminum tubes for \nuse in producing nuclear fissile materials. But when our own Department \nof Energy concluded they were the wrong tubes to use for such a \npurpose, the State Department's intelligence bureau concluded and \npointed out they weren't even secret buys and that the purchase orders \nwere posted on the Internet. The question was not made known to \nCongress nor made known to the American people.\n  In two reports to the Secretary of State, the State Department's \nBureau of Intelligence and Research concluded there was no reliable \nevidence that Iraq had restarted its nuclear program at all.\n  That was, in fact, what Saddam Hussein's own son-in-law had told the \nUnited States and United Nations officials when he defected in 1995.\n  As the Washington Post reported on August 10 of this year, a year \npreviously--on August 7, 2002--the Vice President volunteered in a \nquestion-and-answer session at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, \nspeaking of Hussein, that ``left to his own devices, it's the judgment \nof many of us that in the not-too-distant future, he will acquire \nnuclear weapons.''\n  On August 26, the Vice President described Hussein as a ``sworn enemy \nof our country'' who constituted a ``mortal threat'' to the United \nStates. He foresaw a time in which Hussein could ``subject the United \nStates or any other nation to nuclear blackmail.''\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       We now know that Saddam has resumed his efforts to acquire \n     nuclear weapons. Among other sources, we've gotten this from \n     firsthand testimony from defectors, including Saddam's own \n     son-in-law.\n\n  But as the Washington Post goes on to say, the son-in-law's testimony \nwas the reverse of the Vice President's description; the opposite of \nwhat the American people, were told and what Congress was told. But \nthose contradictions were never disclosed to the American people nor to \nCongress. In fact, the President and the Vice President continued to \ninsist right up until the invasion that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear \nthreat that was an imminent and urgent danger to the United States.\n  The Vice President said on a network show on March 16 of 2003 that \n``We believe he--Saddam Hussein--has in fact reconstituted nuclear \nweapons.''\n  The President, in his address to the Nation on March 17, 2003, cited \nintelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves ``no doubt \nthat the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most \nlethal weapons ever devised.''\n  If the Vice President of the United States asserts there is no doubt, \nand if the President of the United States asserts there is no doubt, \nthen what is there to doubt? If you can't trust your own President and \nVice President to tell you the truth about matters of life and death, \nsuch as nuclear threats, wars, and the future of this Nation, then what \ncan you trust?\n  Another thing the American public believes is that Saddam Hussein is \ndirectly linked to al-Qaida and to the terrible events of September 11, \n2001. According to the national surveys, over two-thirds of the \nAmerican public believes that. Why? Because that assertion has been \nmade repeatedly by this administration.\n  In fact, in the President's speech to the Nation last Sunday, he \nmentions\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\nthe word ``terrorists'' or ``terrorist organizations'' 27 times--27 \ntimes. He cited the weapons of mass destruction once, in a rhetorical \nreference.\n  The fundamental basis on which we went into Iraq as proclaimed before \nthe war began was only cited one time in that entire address to the \nNation. But ``terrorism,'' or the connection of terrorists to Iraq, al-\nQaida, and the West dominated the President's remarks, and his \ncontinued assertions to the American people of what the real situation \nis in that country for which Americans are still giving their blood, \nbodies, and lives.\n  On the other hand, as reported in the Washington Post recently, key \nadministration figures have largely abandoned any claim that Iraq was \ninvolved in the 2001 attacks. ``I am not now sure that Iraq had \nsomething to do with it,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said \non August 1.\n  The CIA's report--the administration's main source of information \nabout these connections or lack of them--to the President and the \nadministration, as reported in the New York Times on February 2 of \n2002, found ``no evidence that Iraq has engaged in terrorist operations \nagainst the United States in nearly a decade, and the agency is \nconvinced that Saddam Hussein has not provided chemical or biological \nweapons to al-Qaida or related terrorist groups.''\n  Maybe former Marine General Anthony Zinni, who has been on missions \nrepresenting the administration and the President in the Middle East, \nhas the best analysis of this changing rationale for our actions. He \nsaid:\n\n       Initially, there was at least an implication that Iraq was \n     linked to terrorism. When that link couldn't be made, it was \n     possession of weapons of mass destruction. When that link \n     couldn't be made, it was lack of cooperation. Right now it is \n     about ``we will not let you talk to our scientists,'' and it \n     is the reason we will go to war. We know what the Iraqis \n     have, and we can't tell you. I just think it is too \n     confusing.\n\n  What is not confusing is the casualties mount. The number of \nAmericans being wounded or killed in action in Iraq last month exceeded \nthe previous month by over a third. Director Tenent told us this week \nthat they are averaging 15 attacks a day on United States forces after \nthe victory we won so courageously and magnificently in 3 weeks over 4 \nmonths ago. But we in the Senate owe the American people and those \nsoldiers over there our continued search for and insistence that the \ntruth be told to us and to the American people about the circumstances \nthat got us into this war, the circumstances that exist in this war, \nand how we are going to get out of this war preserving the victory \nwhich was won but also bringing our men and women home. They have \nperformed and continue to perform with patriotism that goes beyond \nanything I can imagine. But they want to come home. Their families want \nthem home. They deserve to come home.\n  In his Gettysburg address, recognizing and paying tribute to other \nAmerican heroes who lost their lives, President Lincoln concluded that \n``we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain--\nthat this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom--and \nthat government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not \nperish from the earth.''\n  A government of the people, by the people, and for the people is a \ngovernment that tells the truth to its citizens. If it doesn't, it is \nnot a government of them, not by them, and certainly not for them. It \nis imperative.\n  Today, in commemoration of those who did not die in vain 2 years ago, \nthere should be once again a rebirth of our freedom and our assertion \nto this Government or any Government of the United States of America to \ntell us the truth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take a few minutes tonight to talk about \nthe issue of gasoline prices. I serve on the House-Senate conference \ncommittee which is now negotiating over how to pass a good and \nhopefully bipartisan Energy bill. I will talk about an issue that is \nclobbering consumers all across this country. It has been devastating \nacross the West--in Oregon, in Washington, Idaho, and California. The \nfact is, this is true all over America.\n  In Los Angeles, the average price for regular unleaded gas is $2.10 a \ngallon. In New York City, the average price is $1.95 for a gallon of \ngas. In Phoenix, it is $2. At present, gasoline costs 30 cents more \nthan it did at this very time last year, and 15 cents of that increase \nhas happened in the last few months. In my home State, Oregon drivers \nare paying a whooping 56 cents more per gallon than they paid for the \nsame gas in September of last year.\n  I don't think anyone is confused about the implications of these \nskyrocketing increases. When Americans have to spend this additional \nmoney on gasoline, they do not have money for other essentials at a \ntime when millions of our families are hurting. They cannot buy those \nback-to-school clothes and groceries and consumer items when they are \npaying an extra 50 cents for gas all across the West and in numerous \ncommunities across the country.\n  It seems to me with so many people hurting, with so many folks out of \nwork, the efforts of the conferees with respect to protecting the \nAmerican people from escalating gasoline prices seems to be especially \nimportant.\n  Artificially inflated gasoline prices shellac our families three \nways: It takes dollars from their pocketbooks; it slows job creation; \nand it often raises the prices of the goods families need to buy due to \nincreased transportation costs.\n  When I was home this summer and I held town meetings across Oregon, \nfrom Elgin in the rural part of our State to the metropolitan areas of \nPortland, I heard again and again: What steps is the Congress going to \ntake to promote competition, use free-market principles to help put in \nplace policies that will promote competition in the gasoline markets \nand provide relief for our consumers?\n  These gasoline price spikes and the escalating cost of gas cannot be \nexplained just by the market. Steps ought to be taken to put in place \nreal procompetitive market-oriented policies to provide relief for our \nconsumers.\n  The Secretary of Energy said recently that he is conducting what \namounts to an informal investigation into this issue. But we have \nexamined the law and the Department of Energy does not have any power \nto do anything about gasoline prices. The Federal Trade Commission, \nwhich we thought could play the role of being on the side of the \nconsumer, says they can only prosecute if they find out-and-out, \nblatant collusion, setting out a standard that is virtually impossible \nto prove in the real world. Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission does \nnot seem to think that tightly documented cases of anticompetitive \npractices such as redlining and zone pricing is a particularly big \ndeal.\n  I come to the Senate tonight because the American people deserve \nbetter and the American people have a right to insist in this House-\nSenate energy conference going forward now, that steps are taken to \nactually put in place new policies to put the Government on the side of \nmarketplace-oriented procompetitive policies that will provide relief \nfor the American consumer who fills the tank at pumps across the \ncountry and is just getting shellacked right now when they try to \nafford those bills.\n  Even the oil companies admit that the market is not going to solve \nthe problem by itself. Last month, a report by the Rand Corporation \nrevealed that even industry officials are predicting a great deal of \nprice volatility in the future. If you look at what the industry is \nsaying--and that is the assessment of people within the energy \nindustry, not critics--even people within the energy industry are \nsaying, for all practical purposes, consumers can expect more frequent \nand larger price spikes in the next few years.\n  I am proposing, and I have shared it with members of the conference, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, and I intend to do so in the days \nahead, a proposal so the energy conference does not\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nwrap up without a concrete package of procompetitive initiatives to \nhelp consumers at the Nation's gas pumps.\n  It seems to me the focus of such a procompetitive package should be \nfor the energy conferees to direct Government regulators to act to \neliminate anticompetitive practices that right now are siphoning the \ncompetition out of our gasoline markets.\n  Specifically, what we have found is that in my home State, and at \nleast 27 other States, there are essentially oligopolies, mini kinds of \nmonopolies, where just a handful of companies--maybe three or so, maybe \nfour, but a tiny number of companies--are controlling more than 60 \npercent of the gasoline supply.\n  That is the case in my home State. It is all over the West, where \nfour of the top six States for high gas prices are located. So, in \neffect, what you have is more than half of our States very highly \nconcentrated as gasoline markets, where, in effect, you have seen the \ncompetitive juices drained out of the gasoline business. It is those \ncompetitive juices that I want to restore.\n  What happens in these tightly concentrated markets--there have been \nnumerous studies to this effect--is that you end up losing a lot of the \nbig sources of competition and price restraint. I am talking \nspecifically about the independent wholesalers and dealers, and we are \nlosing them from these concentrated markets.\n  One way that has taken a huge toll on the consumer is that these \nmarkets often get redlined. In effect, when a market is redlined, you \nhave the independent distributor restricted in terms of where they can \nsell their gas. As a result, the independent stations have to buy their \ngasoline directly from those large companies, usually at a higher price \nthan the company's own brandname stations pay. With these higher costs, \nthe independent stations cannot compete.\n  In my home State, we have lost hundreds of gasoline stations in the \nlast few years. We know many of them are the independent stations that \nare the biggest source of competition that is so beneficial to the \nconsumer.\n  So it seems to me, at a minimum, the Federal Trade Commission should \nact to promote competition in these areas, these 27 States, for \nexample, that have these quasi-monopolies. I believe these highly \nconcentrated markets ought to be designated ``consumer watch zones,'' \nwhere there would be greater monitoring by the Federal Trade \nCommission, and where the Federal Trade Commission would be empowered \nto issue cease and desist orders to prevent companies from gouging \nconsumers.\n  I also think that in these particular areas, where you have quasi-\nmonopolies, the Congress ought to stipulate that redlining and zone \npricing are anticompetitive practices by their very nature, and that \ncompanies that engage in redlining and zone pricing in these tightly \nconcentrated markets should have to carry the burden of proof that what \nthey are doing in those concentrated markets doesn't hurt the consumer.\n  In the past--and, as I say, I have shared these proposals with \nSenators of both parties; I have offered ideas to promote competition \nin the gasoline industry--there have been some who have said, and \nvociferously, that these kinds of proposals are unacceptable; somehow \nthey would create disincentives to production--this sort of thing.\n  Well, I see absolutely nothing here that creates a disincentive to \nproduction. What I want to do is promote competition and freer markets \nfor consumers at the gas pump.\n\n  What I would say to those in the Congress who disagree with the \nprocompetitive proposals I am making today is that I want to issue you \na challenge. To those who think the approach I am offering up today is \nunwise, I would say: Bring your own proposal, give your own proposal to \nthe conferees on the House-Senate committee that is meeting now with \nyour ideas on how to promote competition in the gasoline market.\n  I want people to know I have offered a proposal to colleagues to both \nparties in the conference, but I would like to hear from others who \nhave ideas if they happen to agree that my approach is not the way to \ngo--unless someone is prepared to say there is no problem for the \nconsumer. I defy somebody to say that to people I am hearing from in \nthe West and all over the country, who are paying $2 a gallon for gas.\n  Unless you are prepared to tell those people there is no problem out \nthere, I believe those who disagree with the proposals I am discussing \ntoday to promote competition ought to come forward and put their own \nideas on the table.\n  There are a couple of other points I want to make with respect to \nthis proposal to promote competition in gasoline markets.\n  I see my good friend from Virginia here, who wants to address the \nSenate. I will just wrap up with a couple of additional points.\n  I also believe, Mr. President, and colleagues, that as part of the \nenergy conference, the Congress needs to address the growing gap \nbetween consumer demand for gasoline and what the oil companies can \nproduce. When supplies are tight, and there is no spare gasoline in \ninventories, consumers are especially vulnerable to supply shortages \nand price spikes when refineries shut down unexpectedly or a pipeline \nbreaks, as happened this summer.\n  Congress ought to take steps to ensure that the consumer is not left \nstalled by the side of the road or fuming at the pump, by taking steps \nto keep supplies available in emergencies. It seems to me that here, at \na very minimum, steps ought to be taken to ensure there are inventories \non hand to address unexpected supply crunches. That has been done in \nother areas. Certainly we have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve for \npetroleum and heating oil supplies. I think, given the shellacking \nconsumers are taking with respect to gasoline prices, steps ought to be \ntaken by the Congress conferees to ensure that adequate inventories are \non hand to address unexpected supply crunches and the hikes that so \noften accompany them.\n  Finally, I hope, as the conferees move to complete their business, \nthey look at what is on the record today with respect to \nanticompetitive practices in our gasoline markets. These are practices \nthat have driven prices up and have driven consumers crazy at the pump. \nThe evidence is very real.\n  The fact is, the investigation, as the Department of Energy describes \nit, is toothless. They do not have the authority under current law to \nstand up for the consumer at the pump. The Federal Trade Commission, \nfor reasons that are beyond my comprehension, refuses to deal with the \ndocumented cases of redlining and zone pricing and anticompetitive \npractices.\n  So I have come to the floor today, Mr. President, and colleagues, to \noutline specific steps, specific actions that could to be taken on a \nbipartisan basis by the energy conferees to provide real and concrete \nrelief to energy consumers at the pump.\n  In this conference, the Congress has the opportunity to say that when \nour consumers are facing, as I described, price hikes of 50 cents--50 \ncents--for gas, the Government is going to be on their side with \npolicies that promote competition in gasoline markets, in particularly \nthose 27 States which are, in effect, mini monopolies, where there are \njust a handful of choices for consumers and prices go up as a result.\n  I call on the Congress to take up this cause in this House-Senate \nenergy conference. This is a chance to go to bat for consumers on the \nissue that is frustrating our consumers and our small businesses every \nsingle day. They are looking for the Congress to step up and act to \nprovide some real relief. The people of this country are asking for \nthat kind of advocacy. I believe it is time for the Congress to provide \nthat kind of approach.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11409-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11409-S11410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OATH OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, earlier today, I talked about \nremembering September 11 and the terrible events that happened that \nday, but it also brought us together as we remembered what it means to \nbe an American.\n  This afternoon, I wish to address an important statement on what it \nmeans to be a citizen of the United States. I mean specifically the \noath of allegiance which all new citizens swear in court when they are \nnaturalized.\n  I rise this afternoon to announce that I will shortly introduce \nlegislation to make the current oath of allegiance\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nthe law of the land. Doing so will give the oath of allegiance the same \nstatus enjoyed by other key symbols and statements of being American. \nThe American Flag, the Pledge of Allegiance, the National Anthem, and \nour national motto--all these symbols and statements have been \nspecifically approved by Congress and are now a matter of law.\n  The oath of allegiance, which is currently a matter of mere Federal \nregulation, ought to be treated with the same dignity. I do this today \nbecause it has come to my attention that the Bureau of Citizenship and \nImmigration Services, or BCIS, an agency of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, may be planning to change the oath of allegiance that \nimmigrants take to become citizens of this Nation.\n  According to National Review Online:\n\n       The Federal Government is about to change the Oath of \n     Allegiance that immigrants take at citizenship ceremonies.\n\n  The article goes on to say BCIS intends to announce the change, \nperhaps make it effective immediately, perhaps on September 17, \nCitizenship Day, or next week, during Constitution Week, which is the \nanniversary of the signing of the Constitution. I do not know whether \nthat will happen or whether it will not happen, but I have read the new \noath that, according to National Review Online, BCIS intends to make \npublic next week.\n\n  I prefer the oath we already have. The oath of allegiance is a \nfundamental statement on the commitment of becoming a U.S. citizen. It \nshould not be altered by a Government agency, no matter how well \nintentioned. Any change should be subject to the approval of this body. \nIt ought to be enshrined in law.\n  In the first 5 months of this fiscal year, nearly 170,000 new \nAmericans took the oath of allegiance and were naturalized as citizens \nof this country. The oath assumed its present form in the 1950s and was \nfirst adopted in Federal regulation in 1929, but some of the language \ndates all the way back to 1790.\n  Let me describe how this oath is used in practice. Imagine that we \nare in a Federal courthouse, such as the one I was in in Nashville. It \nwas October 2001. It was Naturalization Day. This happens at virtually \nevery Federal courthouse virtually every month. The room is filled with \nanxious persons talking among themselves in halting English. They are \nobviously with their families and their closest friends. They are \nneatly dressed. Most faces are radiant.\n  That day there were 77 persons from 22 countries who had passed their \nexams, learned English, passed a test about American Government, \nsurvived a character investigation, paid their taxes, and waited in \nline for 5 years to be a citizen of the United States of America.\n  The bailiff shouts: ``God save this honorable court.'' On that day, \nthe judge, her Honor Aleta Trauger, walked in. She asked each of the \napplicants to stand, to raise each one's right hand and repeat the \nfollowing oath, which I am going to state. I hope those listening will \nlisten carefully because this oath makes an impression:\n\n       I--\n\n  And then you state your name--\n\n     hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely \n     renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any \n     foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or \n     which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I \n     will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the \n     United States of America against all enemies, foreign and \n     domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the \n     same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States, \n     when required by law; that I will perform noncombatant \n     service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \n     required by law; that I will perform work of national \n     importance under civilian direction when required by law; and \n     that I take this obligation freely without any mental \n     reservation or purpose of evasion, so help me God.\n\n  Now, that is quite an oath. It has strength. It has clarity. It \nsounds as if it might have been written by a couple of rowdy patriots \nin Philadelphia or Williamsburg. Yet, surprisingly, Congress has never \nvoted on the content of this oath of allegiance. We have left it to \nregulators.\n  That is not how we treat other symbols of our Nation or other \nstatements on what it means to be an American. For example, the \nAmerican flag with its 50 stars--one for each State, 13 stripes for the \noriginal colonies--cannot be altered by Federal regulation. The only \nway a star gets added is when Congress acts to admit a new State, and \nwe have never changed the 13 stripes since the flag was first adopted \nin 1777.\n\n  The Pledge of Allegiance, which we repeat each morning in the Senate, \ncannot be altered by Federal regulation. The pledge is a statement of \nsome of the values of the American creed: ``One nation under God, \nindivisible, with liberty and justice for all.''\n  What if a Federal agency decided we should take out the word \n``justice,'' and just say ``with liberty for all''? It cannot happen \nbecause the pledge can only be altered by an act of Congress, as it was \nin 1954 when the phrase ``under God'' was added.\n  The national motto, ``In God We Trust,'' which appears on all of our \ncoins and dollar bills, cannot be altered by Federal regulation. It is \na fundamental statement of the religious character of the American \npeople, even though we do not permit and do not want the establishment \nof a state religion.\n  The Treasury Department cannot decide to leave ``In God We Trust'' \noff the next dollar bill it prints because the motto was adopted by \nCongress, at first in 1864 to be printed on the 2-cent piece, and later \nas the official national motto in 1956.\n  The national anthem, ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' cannot be changed \nby Federal regulation. It, too, is a statement of our values, declaring \nour country to be ``the land of the free and the home of the brave.''\n  What if a Government agency decided it preferred ``America the \nBeautiful'' or ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' or the song we sang \non the steps of the Capitol this morning, ``God Bless America,'' all of \nwhich are great songs? It cannot be done. The agency would have to ask \nCongress to act. Why? Because ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' was named \nour national anthem by law in 1931.\n  Likewise, the oath of allegiance should not be altered lightly by a \nGovernment agency without public comment and without approval from \nCongress.\n  Of the five symbols and statements I have described, the flag, the \nanthem, the pledge, the motto, and the oath of allegiance, only the \noath of allegiance is legally binding on those who take it. New \ncitizens must take it and they must sign it.\n  Just to be clear, I have no objection to others proposing \nmodifications to the oath of allegiance that we use today. I happen to \nlike the present oath. It has strength. It has clarity. I have seen in \nthe eyes of new Americans how much it means to them. Perhaps ways can \nbe found to make it even stronger. Still, let us make sure any changes \nhave the support of a people as represented by Congress.\n  The oath of allegiance is a statement of the commitments required of \nnew citizens. Current citizens, through their elected representatives, \nought to have a say in what those commitments are. That is a lesson in \ndemocracy. A legally binding statement on an American citizen ought to \nreflect American values, including democracy.\n  So as we remember the sobering events of September 11, we are also \nreminded of how our country came together as one nation in response to \nthose events. Today, more than at any time in a generation, we \nunderstand and value what it means to be an American. We ought to \nprotect in law the great statements of our citizenship, such as the \noath of allegiance. If it should ever be revised, it should be done in \nan open and democratic manner. The people should have a chance to make \ntheir views known. Congress should vote. That is the American way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11410-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11410-S11411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RYAN WHITE CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to make some comments \nregarding the Ryan White CARE Act and the Labor-HHS appropriations bill \nthat we passed yesterday.\n  Twenty two years ago, the Centers for Disease Control published a \ncase study that involved five patients infected with a mysterious \nvirus. At the time, I was a third-year surgical resident at the \nMassachusetts General Hospital in Boston. I remember, vaguely, those \nfirst cases and the worrying\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\nquestions. What was it? How was it transmitted? Could it travel by air? \nShould we be afraid?\n  As reports of the illness grew, so did the public anxiety. Never \nbefore had we seen a virus with such power to destroy--to destroy \ncells, cellular function, to destroy lives, families, and entire \ncommunities.\n  During my surgical residency, we began to treat blood in the \noperation room as potentially toxic, potentially deadly. We began \nwearing double gloves, masks in the operating room. And we took these \nprecautions to protect ourselves, not our patients. The emergence of \nHIV/AIDS changed the practice of medicine, public health, and it \nchanged the public consciousness.\n  Fast forward to 2003. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimate that between 850,000 and 950,000 Americans are infected with \nHIV/AIDS. One quarter of them do not know they have it and for the \nfirst time in many years we are seeing an increase in rate of HIV \ninfection.\n  CDC experts estimate that, since the virus was first identified, \n500,000 Americans have died from AIDS-related illnesses.\n  The number of new infections among adolescents is rising, and rising \ndisproportionately among minorities. AIDS is the leading cause of death \namong African Americans 25-44 years of age. It is the second leading \ncause of death among Latinos of the same age group. In Shelby County in \nmy home State, African Americans comprise 45 percent of the population, \nbut make up 75 to 85 percent of county residents infected with the \nvirus.\n  Over the course of more than 20 years of treating patients, I have \nseen first hand the deadly results of HIV infection. I have also seen \nthe devastation it wreaks across entire communities: mothers who \nunknowingly transmit the virus to their newborns; children who suffer \nthe double curse of being HIV positive and orphaned by parents taken by \nthe disease.\n  Fortunately, since those early days, researchers have discovered \nmethods to double the life expectancy of people with HIV/AIDS. They \nhave developed new and powerful drugs for the treatment of HIV \ninfection, and researchers continue making advances in the treatment \nand prevention of AIDS-related opportunistic infections. We may not yet \nhave a cure, but we are working around the clock to find one.\n  Key to this effort has been the Ryan White CARE Act first passed in \n1990. The Ryan White CARE Act forms a unique partnership between \nFederal, local and State governments; nonprofit community \norganizations, health care and supportive service providers. For the \nlast decade, this legislation has successfully provided crucial support \nservices for low-income, uninsured and underinsured people with HIV/\nAIDS.\n  In particular, through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program, the CARE Act \nhas helped patients gain access to life saving drugs.\n  In 2000, more than 125,000 people living with HIV and AIDS received \ndrug therapy because of this provision. Without the CARE Act, none of \nthese individuals would have had the necessary resources to get the \ndrugs they need which can total a whopping $12,000 per year.\n  And when we say the CARE Act, we must pay proper tribute to the \nAmerican taxpayer who is making this compassionate intervention \npossible.\n  Paradoxically, because of our success in decreasing AIDS mortality, \nhowever, the total number of individuals living with HIV disease \ncontinues to climb; and more individuals are becoming dependent on \nthese programs. But success should not breed failure.\n  Congress has demonstrated its commitment to ensuring the availability \nof funds to meet this need by increasing funding for Ryan White \nprograms from $656 million when I entered the Senate in 1995 to more \nthan $1.9 billion last year. The bill passed yesterday provides more \nthan $2 billion for these programs, an increase of almost $24 million.\n  I know many are concerned that, because of State funding shortfalls, \nsome States have begun to restrict their AIDS drug assistance programs. \nThis year, Congress has provided more than $20 billion in fiscal relief \nto the states. It is my hope that some of those funds will be used to \nimprove and maintain access for HIV patients.\n  I thank the chairman for the hard work he has put into crafting the \nLabor-HHS bill that is currently before us. In 1996, I had the pleasure \nof working with Senator Kassebaum to reauthorize the Ryan White CARE \nAct and put in place a number of essential improvements. Again in 2000, \nwhen the law was up for reauthorization, I worked with Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Jeffords, among others, to put in place another round of \ncritical improvements.\n  I know that Chairman Specter faces many challenges in developing this \nimportant legislation every year, and I commend him for his leadership.\n  He did an excellent job in securing Senate passage of this bill under \ncertain constraints. It is my hope that we will be able to address this \nissue further in conference, in next year's budget cycle, and through \nthe upcoming reauthorization of these vital programs.\n  I close with a report from my home State of Tennessee. This morning a \ngentleman named Albert Jones came to visit my office. Mr. Jones is the \nexecutive director of New Directions, Incorporated, an organization \nbased in Memphis which serves people infected with HIV/AIDS.\n  He and representatives from the National Minority AIDS Council came \nto describe what they encounter down in Shelby County and what they \nthink we need to do to fight the epidemic.\n  What Mr. Jones hears most from HIV/AIDS patients is that they need \nbetter access to health care services. Getting to and from treatment is \noften the biggest obstacle. He also urges us to support early treatment \nfor HIV/AIDS, so that HIV becomes a chronic rather than fatal disease.\n  Mr. Jones had a colleague who recently died of AIDS. He tells me that \nhis colleague was so engrossed in his work, so dedicated to the cause, \nthat he worked right up until the day he went to the hospital the very \nlast time.\n  By passing the Ryan White CARE Act yesterday, may we honor this man's \nstrength and commitment by continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS here \nand around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11411-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11411]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING MARY THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I offer my best regards and sincere \ncongratulations to Mary Thompson as she is being honored as the First \nLady of Aberdeen, SD. As you know, Aberdeen is my hometown. Since 1948, \nwe've had the tradition of naming a First Lady of the town. The First \nLadies of Aberdeen, sponsored by Beta Sigma Phi, are selected for their \noutstanding service to the community in many areas including culture, \nreligion, education, arts and politics. Mary has been very active in \neach and every one of these areas.\n  Mary has served the Plymouth Congregational Church as secretary-\ntreasurer, as leader of Puritan Circle, and she has held various \nofficer posts with Women's Fellowship and numerous other committees. As \na proud born Norwegian, Mary has actively participated in Sons of \nNorway for many years. She and her husband, Robert, have opened their \nhome and welcomed visitors from across the country and the world. Mary \nis also an Avera St. Luke's Hospital Auxiliary member; for several \nyears, she has worked in the gift shop and on special projects. Now \nretired, Mary records movies and television specials and takes them to \nthe sick, lonely and shut-ins.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Mary since I was a small child, \nand I consider her a dear friend and gracious lady. Mary and my mother, \nBetty, have been friends for many years, and both love playing bridge. \nFor nearly 50 years, Mary has played bridge with the Northern State \nUniversity Faculty Bridge Club. She attended college at NSU, earning an \nelementary education degree. There, she met and married the love of her \nlife, Robert Thompson.

Mr. President, I want to thank both Senator Specter and \nSenator Harkin for their hard work on this important legislation which \nprovides Federal Funding for the Departments of Labor, DOL, Health and \nHuman Services, HHS, and Education, and related agencies. It funds \nprograms that are among the most critical to the health and well-being \nof our Nation. With our military forces deployed abroad and a \nstruggling domestic economy here at home, providing for and protecting \nour Nation has never been more challenging or more important.\n  The funding provided by this bill for domestic health programs is \ncritical for our country, States and local governments. Given the poor \nstate of our national economy and the rising number of unemployed and \nuninsured Americans, as well as the budget crises facing most State \ngovernments, resources provided by this legislation will help meet the \nsubstantial health care needs of our Nation's vulnerable populations.\n  I am pleased that this legislation provides increased funding for a \nnumber of programs that are particularly important in light of the many \nthreats facing our Nation today. This bill increases funding for the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, which plays a vital \nrole in protecting our nation from bioterror attacks and ensuring \nadequate preparedness for health emergencies. With the recent threat of \nforeign born illnesses such as SARS and Monkey Pox, increased funding \nfor the Infectious Disease Initiative is especially important and will \nensure quick response to public health threats.\n  Additionally, this bill increases funding for National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, by $1 billion over the last fiscal year. That increase \nwill enable the continuation and expansion of research into treatments \nand cures for chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes, new \ninfectious diseases that threaten our Nation's safety, and diseases \nthat disproportionally affect older Americans, such as Alzheimer's. I \nhave strongly supported doubling the amount of the NIH budget, and I am \npleased that its funding continues to increase.\n  In addition to funding key public health programs, this bill provides \nfunding to help States and local communities educate our children. I \napplaud the fact that funding for education for individuals with \ndisabilities and programs to improve educational opportunities for \neconomically disadvantaged students have been increased in this bill. I \nalso am pleased that this legislation increases funding for Head Start \nto ensure that low-income children are physically and mentally prepared \nto begin school.\n  These and the many other important programs funded throughout this \nlegislation will help many Americans. However, I am disappointed to \nfind that the report accompanying this bill is laden with directives \nand suggestive language that predetermines which programs may receive \nfunding. This language eliminates the ability of the agencies funded by \nthis bill to determine, by a fair and competitive process, which \nprograms to fund. This is yet another example of the micro-management \nof federal agencies at the hands of the appropriators.\n  I would like to note that both the bill and the report contain only a \nhandful of earmarks, and I commend the Appropriations Committee for its \nrestraint. I encourage the members of the Committee to resist the \ntemptation to weigh down this important bill with locally specific \nparochial projects when the bill is negotiated with the House of \nRepresentatives during conference. Unfortunately, however, the list of \ndirective and suggestive language included in the actual bill language \nand the accompanying report are extensive, and I will not burden the \nchamber by listing each one individually. Instead, I highlight a few \nexamples:\n  In the report language, for the Department of Labor, the Committee \n``recommends'' $7 million for the Denali Commission for job training in \nrural Alaska. The funding is intended to train rural Alaskans for high-\npaying jobs in their villages. Any doubt as to whether the \nappropriators wanted this funding to occur is dispelled by the fact \nthat the bill language authorizes ``such sums as may be necessary'' to \nthe Denali Commission to conduct this Alaskan job training. Although \nthis specific authority and funding was unrequested by the \nAdministration, the appropriators apparently think they know better. \nThey not only provide the appropriation, but they also want to do the \nwork of the authorizing committee as well. How fortunate it is that \nthis activity in the State of Alaska has such ardent supporters in the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee and has received special \ntreatment at the expense of other states.\n  Furthermore, the report language expresses the Committee's concern \nabout the Department of Labor's reorganization proposal, which would \nclose the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, offices \nin Bangor and Portland, Maine, and would consolidate the activities of \nthose offices in Augusta, Maine. Instead of allowing DOL to do their \njob and streamline the operations of OSHA, the Committee in its report, \n``expects'' the Department of Labor to maintain the existing \norganizational structure with offices in Bangor and in Portland, \nincluding providing adequate office space for the current Bangor OSHA \nstaff. Again, the appropriators are catering to a locality-specific \ninterest in Maine at the expense of the national interest in having a \nmore efficient government agency.\n  Furthermore, this legislation includes legislative and report \nlanguage that creates a new National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Program, \nthrough the Health Resources and Services Administration, and \nappropriates $10 million for the new program. This program may further \nimportant life-saving research; however, this is a new legislative \ninitiative, not authorized by the committee of jurisdiction, and not \nrequested by the Administration, but created and funded entirely by the \nappropriators.\n  Similarly, the report language accompanying the bill includes \ndirective and suggestive language for the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to initiate a number of new programs, all of which may \nbe worthy of consideration; however, none have been requested or \nauthorized. These programs range from the creation of a Diamond \nBlackfan Anemia Clinical Care Center to $500,000 allocated for the CDC \nto create a registry and database of children nationwide with \ncraniofacial malformation. Although these new programs will undoubtedly \nbenefit many children and individuals, they are further examples of new \nprograms created the appropriators, by circumventing the authorizing \ncommittee of jurisdiction.\n  Also included in the report is language directing HHS and the \nDepartment of Education to complete over 20 reports, all at the \nspecific request of the Appropriations Committee. These reports concern \nimportant programs within the Departments, but producing them will \nrequire substantial manpower and time, diverting scarce and valuable \nresources to projects dictated by the Appropriations Committee.\n  With this sluggish economy expected to push this year's budget \ndeficit past a whopping $450 billion and numerous threats facing our \nnation, funds must be expended on programs that will provide the \nmaximum benefit for all Americans. It cannot be spent on unauthorized \nand unrequested projects and reports demanded by members of the \nAppropriations Committee. This is simply wrong and does a disservice to \nall Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11412-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11412-S11413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DEATH OF ANNA LINDH, FOREIGN MINISTER OF SWEDEN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

O'BANNON\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is my sad duty today to inform the \nSenate that our distinguished Governor of Indiana, Frank O'Bannon, has \nbeen incapacitated by what his doctors describe as a massive stroke. \nGovernor O'Bannon is currently at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in \nChicago where-- thankfully--he is showing some small but encouraging \nsigns of improvement.\n  This has been a heartbreaking moment for all of us in Indiana. Frank \nO'Bannon is not only one of the State's most dedicated public \nservants--he is also one of the most respected and loved. I have joined \nwith all my fellow Hoosiers in praying for his recovery. His wife, \nJudy, has been at his side at the hospital since Monday, and I hope she \nknows that she has our unwavering support.\n  Governor O'Bannon has a record of public service that goes back more \nthan 30 years. He was first elected to the Indiana State Senate where \nhe served 18 years--much of it as the Democratic floor leader. He was \nLieutenant Governor for 8 years before being elected Governor in 1996 \nand then re-elected by a wide margin in 2000.\n  I have known Frank O'Bannon many years and consider him my friend. He \nis a good man with a good heart--and that is why we are all so saddened \nby this sudden turn of events.\n  On Wednesday, the Indiana Supreme Court reluctantly issued an order \ntransferring the authority and responsibilities of the Office of \nGovernor to our Lieutenant Governor, Joe Kernan. This transfer of \npower, done in full compliance with the Indiana State Constitution, \nensures that state government will continue to provide all its services \nwithout interruption or delay.\n  I ask my colleagues to join my prayers that Frank O'Bannon is able to \nrecover from this sudden affliction and resume his responsibilities as \nGovernor of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11413-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EULOGY FOR AMBASSADOR JOHN DAWSON\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, last year, my husband, Bob, had the \nprivilege of introducing Members of the Senate to John Dawson, who was \nnominated to serve as the United States Ambassador to Peru. Ambassador \nDawson assumed leadership of the Embassy in Lima in November 2002, at a \ntime of increasing discontent with the government of President \nAlejandro Toledo. Undaunted, John was excited about the challenges and \nopportunities of the new post. But his tenure there was all too brief. \nSadly, just as he was entering the prime of his life and at the \npinnacle of his career, John died of cancer on August 1, 2003.\n  Those who knew John well, knew him to be very dedicated to duty a man \nwith a high sense of optimism and great compassion for others. He was \nkind and thoughtful, and generous in the giving of his time.\n  At his Senate confirmation hearing, it was clear that John had \nextraordinary interpersonal skills, and the work history and experience \nto qualify him for his ambassadorship. But one curious professional \nexperience that he and Bob share bears mention: At one time in their \nlives, both John and Bob were soda jerks at Dawson's Drug Store in \nRussell, KS.\n  It was 1915 when John's great-grandfather took over the drug store. A \nquarter century later, John's grandfather--Ernie Dawson--gave Bob Dole \none of his first jobs working behind the soda counter. Bob was a \nfreshman in high school, and Ernie Dawson was the pharmacist at \nDawson's Drug Store. John's two uncles, Bub and Chet, ran the store. \nGrowing up in the dust bowl days of the 1930s, Bob and John's father, \nBob Dawson, became fast friends.\n  John's father, his mother Joan, and the rest of the family in Kansas \ninstilled in John the work ethic, integrity, dedication, public \nspiritedness and patriotism that helped make him a success in his life \nand his work. Later, John was also fortunate to have the loving support \nof his wife, Susana.\n  John was born in Kansas City in 1950, but spent much of his childhood \nin Latin America. After achieving a Bachelor of Arts degree with honors \nfrom the University of Michigan in 1973, where he majored in economics \nand Latin American studies, John earned a Master of Arts degree in law \nand diplomacy from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts \nUniversity in 1975.\n  That year, John joined the State Department as a foreign service \nofficer. During a long and distinguished career in the U.S. foreign \nservice, he served as Deputy Chief of Mission in El Salvador, Country \nDirector for Panama, Office Director for Andean Affairs, and Economic \nCounselor at our U.S. Embassies in Panama and Costa Rica. Early on, he \nheld positions as Financial Economist at the U.S. Mission to the United \nNations in New York, at the U.S. Mission to the Organization of \nEconomic Cooperation and Development, OECD, in Paris, and in Buenos \nAires and Rio de Janeiro. John also served his country in Argentina and \nBrazil, and was the Director of Mexican Affairs for the State \nDepartment prior to his ambassadorship in Peru.\n  During his years at the State Department, John received numerous \nawards and commendations for his work in El Salvador, Costa Rica, \nPanama, Brazil, and Argentina, at the U.S. Mission to the United \nNations, and in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs. His \ndedication and success in his life's work was recognized with the \nHerbert Salzman Award for Excellence in International Economic \nPerformance, a Presidential Meritorious Service Award, and Superior and \nMeritorious honor awards.\n  Having achieved the post of Ambassador to Peru, John began his \nassignment with great hope and optimism. Within months, however, he \nbecame seriously ill and returned to the United States for treatment. \nDisplaying his characteristic good humor, John looked forward to making \na full recovery and spoke with family and friends of his desire to \nreturn to Peru and continue his work. Tragically, his life was cut \nshort, but his memory lives on through his friends and family, and his \nmany good deeds.\n  Truly, America has lost a faithful public servant and John's family \nhas lost a loving son, husband, father and brother. After John's death, \nSecretary of State Colin Powell stated, ``Ambassador Dawson was very \npopular with his State Department colleagues and will be remembered for \nboth the dedication and collegiality he brought to all of the posts in \nwhich he served.'' A fitting tribute for a remarkable man.\n  I join Bob Dole, Secretary Powell, and John's family, friends and \ncolleagues in saluting this great American and thanking him for his \nservice to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11413-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11413-S11414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JIM PHILLIPS\n\n Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina.

Jim also served as the sports director at \na South Carolina television station and radio station for years.\n  Personally, he was a true friend and one of the most delightful \npeople I have ever had the privilege of knowing. He always had a smile \non his face.\n  God gave him a tremendous gift which he shared with so many for all \ntoo brief a period of time.\n  He was truly one of the best in the business and will be deeply \nmissed.\n  I invite you to join me in the celebration of Jim's life and the \nmourning of\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\nhis passing with the entire Clemson family and all those who were \nfortunate enough to call Jim Phillips a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11414-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:19 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 911.

A bill to make aliens ineligible to receive visas and \nexclude aliens from admission into the United States for nonpayment of \nchild support; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parental \nResponsibility Obligations Met Through Immigration System Enforcement \nAct, or PROMISE Act. Sadly, there are many in our society who do not \nhonor their child support obligations, and ultimately, it is the \nchildren who are hurt by such irresponsibility. Shockingly, many \nforeign nationals are able to benefit from our immigration laws \nnotwithstanding their failure to live up to their child support \nobligations. As a matter of sound policy, our immigration laws should \nrequire those who wish to come into or remain in our country to comply \nwith our moral and ethical standards. Let us be clear in our message. \nIf you do not live up to your financial obligations to your own \nchildren, then you are not welcome in the United States.\n  I am introducing this legislation now because it is time to do \nsomething to protect many children who are economically disadvantaged \nor neglected. These children need clothes, food, and shelter--basic \nnecessities of life. Moreover, when the deadbeat parents fail to meet \ntheir obligations to their own children, it is our society and our \ntaxpayers who must pick up the cost. Of course, we will do what we have \nto for the children in our country, but we need to hold the parents \nresponsible and impress upon them we will no\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\nlonger tolerate their irresponsible attitude toward their own children.\n  Specifically, this legislation amends the current Immigration and \nNationality Act, section 212(a), to include failure to pay child \nsupport as a ground of inadmissibility. It will also amend section \n101(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act so that one who fails to \npay child support is statutorily without good moral character. The \nlegislation will cover not only orders from a court in the United \nStates but also foreign courts with which our Federal or State \ngovernments have reciprocity agreements. As such, deadbeat parents \ncannot use the United States as a haven from child support enforcement \nby other governments.\n  In conclusion, we must be mindful that permission to enter the United \nStates is a privilege and not a right. We will not grant this privilege \nto individuals who do not respect the law of our Nation, the laws of \ntheir home country, or their moral duty to provide for their children.\n  I ask for your support of the PROMISE Act.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the establishment of a commission to \nconduct a study concerning the overtime regulations of the Department \nof Labor, to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to create a commission on overtime pay.\n  Yesterday, the Senate passed an amendment to preclude Federal funding \nfor the regulation issued by the Department of Labor on overtime pay, \nand it is uncertain what will happen as the bill goes to conference. \nThere has been a representation that the President will veto the \nappropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nif this regulation is not in the bill.\n  It seems to me we ought to be taking another step, and that is to \ncreate a commission to deal with this issue so we are prepared in any \neventuality. There is no doubt that the 1945 regulations on the Fair \nLabor Standards Act, that those regulations are vastly out of date and \nthey ought to be revised. There are many lawsuits, some class actions, \nto determine what the definitions are for those who are or who are not \ncovered by overtime pay that ought to be clarified. Clarification can \nbe achieved without having the massive disruption on the change on \novertime pay for so many in the workforce.\n  A change in the overtime pay for those in the workforce would be \nespecially problematic given the economic situation at hand, that it is \na difficult time and there ought not to be that kind of disruption \nwhich would be occasioned by this bill, by the regulations going into \neffect.\n  Even though the Department of Labor's propose legislation stated that \nthe Department could not exactly clarify which workers would be exempt \nor not exempt based on the current and the proposed rules, the \ncommission which I am proposing would have representatives from \nbusiness, the public sector, the labor groups, with widespread approval \nfrom congressional leaders, and is a preferable course so we can \nachieve both objectives; that is, to have clarification on the outdated \nregulations to avoid the litigation and know who is exempt and who is \nnot exempt while doing it without massive disruption of the overtime \npay at a very difficult time for the workers.\n  To reiterate, today I am introducing legislation to establish a \ncommission to conduct a thorough study of issues relating to \nmodernization of the Fair Labor Standards Act overtime provisions. \nThese provisions have remained substantially unchanged since 1975, \ndespite changes in the modern work place.\n  On March 31, 2003, the Labor Department issued proposed regulations \nto update the exemptions from overtime pay for executive, \nadministrative, professional, outside sales and computer employees. \nMore than 70,000 comments were received by the June 30, 2003 deadline. \nDue to the controversy generated by the proposed regulations, I held a \nhearing on July 31, 2003 to explore this\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\ncomplex question. We heard testimony from the Labor Department, as well \nas organized labor and business representatives. It was evident that \nwhile there was general agreement that greater clarity of definitions \nconcerning overtime pay eligibility would be beneficial to both \nemployees and workers there was disagreement about the impact of the \nproposed regulations, and no consensus about how to achieve greater \nclarity and compliance to avoid costly lawsuits. Even the Labor \nDepartment's proposed regulations stated that the Department could not \nexactly clarify which workers are exempt and nonexempt based on the \ncurrent and proposed rules.\n  The commission I am proposing will bring together experts to study \nthese ambiguities and other issues deemed appropriate, and report to \nthe Secretary of Labor and Congress by July 30, 2004. The legislation \nalso specifies that the proposed overtime regulation will not become \neffective until 60 days after the date the commission report is \nsubmitted.\n  The commission will be composed of 11 members representing organized \nlabor, the business community, the general public and Federal \nofficials. The commission members will be appointed on a bipartisan, \nbicameral basis and shall be appointed by the Secretary of Labor, and \nthe House and Senate appropriations and authorizing committees.\n  The primary duties of the commission will be to conduct a thorough \nstudy of, and develop recommendations on, issues relating to the \nmodernization of the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards \nAct of 1938.\n  Specifically the commission will:\n  (1) Review categories and numbers of workers not eligible for \novertime pay under current regulations and identify how many workers \nand employers might be affected by proposed changes to the current \nregulation;\n  (2) Determine if the proposed regulation relating to overtime is \nsufficiently clear to be easily understood by employers and workers;\n  (3) Assess the paperwork burden that employers would have in order to \nassure that each individual worker, claimed to be exempt from such \novertime requirements, actually is exempt under such regulation;\n  (4) Assess the extent to which it will be clear to the individual \nworker as to his or her overtime pay protection under the proposed \nregulation; and\n  (5) Determine the impact of the regulation on nurses, pharmacists, \nand police, firefighters and paramedics.\n  Given the extreme controversy over the proposed overtime regulation, \nI believe that the legislation that I am proposing will provide an \nopportunity for all sides to air the concerns and work with the \nSecretary of Labor to craft a regulation that will benefit employers, \nemployees and the general public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1611\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Any vacancy in the \n     Commission shall not affect its powers, and shall be filled \n     in the same manner as the original appointment.\n       (3) Quorum.--A majority of the members of the Commission \n     shall constitute a quorum, but a lesser number of members may \n     hold hearings.\n       (4) Chairperson and vice chairperson.--The Commission shall \n     select a Chairperson and Vice Chairperson from among its \n     members.\n       (c) Duties of the Commission.--\n       (1) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a thorough study \n     of, and develop recommendations on, issues relating to the \n     modernization of the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) in order to \n     promote clarity and compliance. In conducting such study the \n     Commission shall--\n       (A) review the categories and number of workers not \n     eligible for overtime pay under current regulations under the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and identify how many \n     workers and employers might be affected by proposed changes \n     to such regulations;\n       (B) determine if the proposed regulation relating to \n     overtime is sufficiently clear to be easily understood by \n     employers and workers;\n       (C) assess the paperwork burden that employers would have \n     in order to assure that each individual worker, claimed to be \n     exempt from such overtime requirements, actually is exempt \n     under such regulation;\n       (D) assess the extent to which it will be clear to the \n     individual worker as to his or her overtime pay protection \n     under the proposed regulation;\n       (E) determine the impact of the proposed regulation on the \n     access of individuals to health care based upon the impact \n     the proposed regulation has on nurses and pharmacists, and \n     the impact that such regulation has on fundamental security \n     occupations of first responders such as police, firefighters, \n     and paramedics;\n       (F) identify how the proposed regulation would affect \n     enforcement and compliance actions of the Department of \n     Labor;\n       (G) make recommendation to simplify the definitions of \n     professional or managerial duties that exempt workers from \n     overtime requirements so that they have a greater ability to \n     know in advance what their expectations should be;\n       (H) identify new and emerging specialty positions in the \n     modern workplace that require clarification of their status \n     with respect to the profession employees exemption to the \n     overtime requirements;\n       (I) review the need to update the exemption to the overtime \n     requirements for computer workers;\n       (J) examine the merits of an income ceiling above which \n     workers would be exempt from the overtime requirements;\n       (K) review the salary levels used to trigger the regulatory \n     tests for overtime compliance, including the merits and \n     drawbacks of indexing such levels for inflation;\n       (L) consider what kind of limited or conditional \n     ``docking'' flexibility would provide employers with \n     alternatives to termination and to week-long suspensions \n     without being used as a subterfuge to evade or undermine the \n     salary test with respect to overtime requirements;\n       (M) identify obstacles small businesses may face in \n     achieving compliance or correction with respect to the \n     overtime requirements and develop a means to overcome those \n     obstacles;\n       (N) clarify the definition of ``workplace conduct'' so that \n     employers and employees know whether dangerous or abusive \n     situations, such as harassment or violence off the employer's \n     premises can, nevertheless, be addressed in a manner \n     consistent with the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938;\n       (O) identify ways in which employers can satisfy the \n     requirement that policies regarding workplace conduct be in \n     writing to permit the use of other forms of notice or other \n     technologies for communications while ensuring that notice is \n     fairly provided to workers;\n       (P) identify ways to improve the availability of the \n     proposed safe harbor means of demonstrating compliance with \n     the overtime regulations by clarifying that such regulations \n     are intended to parallel existing legal requirements for \n     discrimination or labor law cases and not to prompt new \n     litigation or confusion; and\n       (Q) study other issues determined appropriate by the \n     Commission.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than July 30, 2004, the Commission \n     shall prepare and submit to the Secretary of Labor, the \n     appropriate committees of Congress, and the general public a \n     report concerning the study conducted under paragraph (1). \n     The report shall include the findings and recommendations of \n     the Commission with respect to the matters described in \n     subparagraphs (A) through (Q) of paragraph (1).\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\n       (3) Effective date of revised regulations.--The Secretary \n     of Labor shall ensure that the effective date for any \n     proposed modifications to the regulations relating to the \n     overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938 is not earlier than 60 days after the date on which the \n     report is submitted under paragraph (2).\n       (d) Powers of the Commission.--\n       (1) Hearings.--The Commission may hold such hearings, sit \n     and act at such times and places, take such testimony, and \n     receive such evidence as the Commission considers advisable \n     to carry out this section.

A bill to establish a technology, equipment, and information \ntransfer within the Department of Homeland Security; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on the terrorist \nattacks of 2 years ago, and to remember those who lost their lives or \ntheir loved ones on that tragic day. We also pause to honor the heroes \nwho came to the rescue that day: our firefighters, police officers, and \nemergency workers.\n  Two years ago, a brilliant late-summer Tuesday morning turned without \nwarning into a horror of fire, smoke and chaos. Just another workday \nsuddenly became a day of unimaginable loss, courage and sacrifice. What \nhappened in New York City, Washington and Pennsylvania 2 years ago \nensured that September 11 would be forever a solemn anniversary we will \nobserve with reverence and reflection. It is a date we will keep in our \nplaces of worship, in our streets and public parks, certainly in our \nhearts.\n  This second anniversary also is an appropriate time for assessment. \nWhile the terrorist attacks told us much about the strength of our \npeople, they also revealed many weaknesses--in planning, cohesiveness \nand cooperation--in our government. The question we in government must \nanswer today is whether our planning is more comprehensive, \npreparedness more effective, and the interactions among the various \nagencies of government more cohesive and cooperative.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the Federal Government has worked to forge \na new relationship with State and local governments. During the past 2 \nyears, Congress has provided $11 billion to States and localities to \nhelp equip and train their police, fire, and emergency personnel. \nFederal experts have trained more than 450,000 State and local first \nresponders and conducted nearly 450 training exercises throughout the \ncountry. These efforts have better equipped our communities and first \nresponders to respond to a terrorist attack.\n  But we must do more to help first responders become first \npreventers--to help them apprehend terrorists and thwart attacks before \nthey happen. Our communities requires more than decontamination \nequipment to treat those affected by a dirty bomb--we need to give our \nlaw enforcement agencies innovative monitoring technologies to thwart \nterrorists before they strike.\n  As the Portland Press Herald reported just last week, ``While [Maine] \nis better equipped to respond to a chemical strike or ``dirty'' \nradioactive bomb, little has been spent to prevent such an attack.'' \nThe legislation I am introducing today is aimed squarely at prevention.\n  The Homeland Security Act established a framework to research and \ndevelop new advanced counter-terrorism technologies. The Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill passed by the Senate just a few months ago \nwill provide the millions needed to fund this effort. Many other \nagencies, both within and outside the Department of Homeland Security, \nare developing technologies that could be used to prevent future \nterrorist attacks.\n  I am pleased to introduce legislation with my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Pryor, which would help the Department quickly \nidentify and transfer cutting edge counter-terrorism technologies and \nequipment to the front lines. Under our legislation, the Director of \nthe Office for Domestic Preparedness, working with State and local law \nenforcement officials, the Science and Technology Directorate, and \nother Federal agencies will identify counter-terrorism technologies \nwith the potential to significantly assist the law enforcement \ncommunity.\n  Once these technologies have been identified, State and local law \nenforcement agencies can apply to receive these technologies and \nequipment directly from the Department of Homeland Security. For \nexample, those law enforcement agencies protecting borders, cargo \nports, and other freight transportation links will be able to secure \nadvanced detection and monitoring equipment that may not be purchased \nusing other Office for Domestic Preparedness funds. This program, then, \nwill fill in the technology gaps between traditional homeland security \nassistance programs.\n  This is not another open-ended grant program. Rather, the counter-\nterrorism technologies and equipment themselves will be available from \na catalog of items proven to work. Transferring the technology, instead \nof providing a monetary grant, will enable ODP to provide the \nappropriate training to law enforcement officials.\n  Our legislation is modeled after a program that works--the successful \nTechnology Transfer Program within the Counterdrug Technology \nAssessment Center. Since 1998, this program has provided nearly five \nthousand pieces of equipment to roughly twenty percent of the Nation's \nState and local law enforcement agencies. It has also operated \nefficiently: administrative costs run less than 10 percent of the total \nfunding per year.\n  I commend Secretary Ridge for his outstanding efforts on the \nmonumental challenge of incorporating nearly two-dozen agencies into \nthe new Department of Homeland Security. But just as it is our first \nresponders who are on the front lines when terrorism strikes, it is our \nlaw enforcement community, our ``first preventers,'' who can best \nthwart terrorism before it occurs. We must build on Secretary Ridge's \nefforts by helping to ensure that our state and local law enforcement \nagencies have the equipment and training they need.\n  I am pleased to have the support from police chiefs and sheriffs \nacross America. In fact, the National Sheriffs' Association, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, and the Major City \nPolicy Chiefs have already voiced their support for this legislation.\n  A few weeks ago, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey \nreleased transcripts of the 911 tapes from that awful day, more than \n1,800 tragic pages that tell an inspiring story of everyday people \nresponding as extraordinary heroes. We in government must not forget \nthat story as we proceed with the difficult task we have undertaken, \none that may never be finished but that must progress. Let every \nSeptember 11, then, be both a day of remembrance and a day when we \ncommit ourselves to better protect the citizens of this great Nation.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11422-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 224--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE SECOND \n   ANNIVERSARY OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES ON \n                           SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, \nMr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Dayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. \nDomenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, \nMr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Graham of Florida, \nMr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, \nMr. Kyl, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLieberman, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Miller, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Specter, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, \nMr. Sununu, Mr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. \nWyden) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 978, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 978) to amend chapter 84 of title 5, United \n     States Code, to provide that certain Federal annuity \n     computations are adjusted by 1 percentage point relating to \n     periods of receiving disability payments, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 978) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, it is altogether fitting that we have \nfinally accomplished this idea on the second anniversary of the violent \nand dastardly attacks of September 11, 2001. Several survivors of that \ntragic day helped inspire this legislation, which will adjust Federal \nemployees' retirement computations to offset reductions in the \nretirement amounts arising from on-the-job injuries covered under the \nworkers compensation program.\n  I thank my colleague, John Warner of Virginia, for cosponsoring the \nmeasure. I particularly thank Kay Cole James in the Office of Personnel \nManagement and her staff for working with me on this measure for well \nover a year now. Moreover, I wish to thank my colleague, Senator Susan \nCollins of Maine, whose leadership today, earlier this year, and last \nyear helped move this measure several times through the procedural \nhoops of the Senate. Finally, we have gotten it passed on the House \nside.\n  Mr. President, this bill addresses a problem in the retirement \nprogram for Federal employees that has been recognized for a long time \nbut unresolved since 1986, when the current retirement system was \nestablished. Unfortunately, complications arising from the Tax Code and \nthe Workers Rehabilitation Act of 1973 have blocked any solution.\n  My resolve to introduce this bill and address this problem was \ninspired by Ms. Louise Kurtz, a Federal employee from Virginia who was \nseverely injured in the September 11 attack, 2 years ago today, on the \nPentagon. She worked at the Pentagon as a civil service employee. She \nsuffered burns from the impact of American Airlines Flight 77, but even \nwith all these burns, she still was trying to rescue and help others \nget out. She suffered burns on over 70 percent of her body. I have seen \nher several times. In fact, I saw her last year, at the Project \nPhoenix, the reopening and dedication of the Pentagon. She had no \nfingers left--just little nubs, really. Her ears were mostly burned off \nas well. She is a person, though, who continues to endure these painful \nsurgeries and faces other surgeries in the future. She wants to \ncontinue with her rehabilitation. She still hopes to return to work \nsomeday.\n  Current law, however, does not allow Mrs. Kurtz to contribute to her \nretirement program while she is recuperating and receiving workers \ncompensation disability payments. As a result, after returning to work \nand eventually retiring, she will find herself inadequately prepared \nand unable to afford to retire because of the lack of contributions \nduring her recuperation and rehabilitation.\n  As Mrs. Kurtz's situation reveals, Federal employees under the \nFederal employees retirement system who have sustained an on-the-job \ninjury and are receiving disability compensation from the Department of \nLabor's Office of Workers Compensation Programs are unable to make \ncontributions or payments into Social Security or the Thrift Savings \nPlan. Therefore, under the current situation, which is being changed by \nthis law, future retirement benefits from both sources--the Thrift \nSavings Plan and Social Security--are reduced.\n  This legislation offsets the reductions in Social Security and the \nThrift Savings Plan retirement benefits by increasing the Federal \nEmployees Retirement System's direct benefit calculation by 1 \npercentage point for the extended periods of disability.\n  Mr. President, you have probably already heard my talk about this \nbill because we have actually passed this measure twice in the Senate. \nWe passed it once on October 17, 2002, and then again in July of this \nyear, 2003. As a lead sponsor of the bill, I was pleased to see that my \ncolleague on the House side, Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis, with her \npersistence, finally got the House of Representatives to pass this \nmeasure yesterday. By taking this matter up and passing it in the \nSenate today, we are clearing it for the President's signature.\n  The passage of this bill ensures that the pensions of our hard-\nworking Federal employees will be kept whole during a period of injury \nand recuperation, especially now that many of them are on the front \nlines in protecting our homeland security in this new and ongoing war \nagainst terror. By protecting the retirement security of injured \nFederal employees, we have provided an incentive for them to return to \nwork and increased our ability to retain our most dedicated and \nexperienced Federal workers. This is a reasonable and fair approach, in \nwhich the whole Senate acted in a logical and compassionate manner last \nfall, and, of course, we did so in July, and we have done so again \ntoday.\n  On the second anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center, \nthe Pentagon, and Flight 93, which crashed in Pennsylvania after the \nbrave efforts of those passengers, I thank my colleagues for once again \npassing this compassionate legislation honoring and helping some of the \nsurvivors of these horrific events.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11424-3", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11424-S11425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES TO THE NATION\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on Sunday night in his televised address to \nthe\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\nNation, the President of the United States outlined clearly and \nunequivocally why we are at war and what is required to defeat our \nenemies. In his remarks, he urged us to remain steadfast and resolute. \nIn that speech, he reminded us that our enemies are motivated not by \nthe perception that we are strong. No. Indeed, they attacked us out of \nthe mistaken belief that we are weak.\n  This is not mere guess or conjecture. When one listens to the words \nof Osama bin Laden himself, he calls America ``a paper tiger.'' He \nboasts that at the first sign of danger, that first painful blow, we \nretreat to wallow in our so-called--his words--decadence.\n  The terrorists did not launch the September 11 attacks in retaliation \nto military action. They struck America as a direct demonstration of \ntheir pure and unshakable hatred. One only has to listen to the words \nof one of Osama bin Laden's closest associates, Yussuf al-Ayyeri--no \nlonger with us, I might add, in body. This murderer warned in a \ntreatise written just before Operation Iraqi Freedom that:\n\n       It is not the American war machine that should be of the \n     utmost concern to Muslims. What threatens the future of \n     Islam, in fact its very survival, is American democracy.\n  Why? Mr. al-Ayyeri fears democracy will--\n\n       . . . make Muslims love this world, forget the next world, \n     and abandon jihad.\n\n  He fears that if democracy takes root in Iraq, Muslims might actually \nbenefit in the here and in the now, that they might become prosperous, \nself-sufficient, tolerant, and consequently--going back to quoting him:\n\n       . . . reluctant to die in martyrdom.\n\n  For this reason, and he explains in the treatise, his comrades must \ndefeat unbelief, must defeat modernism, and most of all must defeat the \ndemocracy brought on by the Americans.\n  While Mr. al-Ayyeri falsely conflates his power-mad ideology with the \nMuslim faith, a faith that we all know is practiced peacefully by \nmillions in this country and indeed around the world, one cannot deny, \nhowever, unwittingly, that he makes his case. Success in Iraq spells \nfailure for al-Qaida, failure for al-Qaida's murderous fanaticism, \nfailure for al-Qaida's tyrannical goals. Success in Iraq strikes at the \ncold, arid hearts of men who murder Muslims for daring to reject al-\nQaida's warped demands.\n  Our efforts to help the Iraqi people build a decent and free nation, \nyes, a democratic society where people of differing ideas, of differing \nethnicity can live in peace, live with one another, will be a clear \nrefutation of all that the terrorists stand for and the poison that \nthey continue to peddle.\n  September 11--most Americans have spent much of the day in thought \nand reflection on that event 2 years ago. I wish, as every American, \nthat September 11 had never happened, that those innocent women and men \nand children were alive today, were with their families, were thriving, \nwere safe. I wish our enemies had never emerged from their caves and \nthey never cooked up their crazed campaign. I wish all these things. \nBut clearly wishing will not and does not make it so.\n  Thus, we are called to act. We are called to lead. We must protect \nour fellow citizens and defeat terror and those regimes that support \nthem. Our enemies will not disappear or go away. It is not going to \nhappen. We know that. Words do not in any way mollify them. Negotiation \nin no way mollifies them. Thus, we must stand firm and we must not \nwaver.\n  We must support our troops; let them know how much we admire their \ncourage, their sacrifice, their bravery. We must let the enemy know \nthat America will press on to victory.\n  I know we will meet the challenge. Americans are strong and Americans \nare tough. We have seen that tenacity. In many ways September 11 made \nit come alive. It uplifted all of us, but it made that tenacity and \nthat strength come alive.\n  We are sincere in our compassion. Why? Because it springs from the \nfundamental belief that all people have a God-given right to liberty, \nto freedom, to know what is in their own minds and to control their own \nfutures; freedom to act in a room and a body like this in the political \nsphere; freedom to participate in their own governance. And, unlike our \ndeadly enemies, we wish the best--not the worst--for Iraq.\n  The President has come this week to this body seeking our support. It \nreally began formally in his speech now 5 days ago on Sunday night. His \nproposal for emergency funding to defeat terror and to stabilize our \nefforts in Iraq and Afghanistan clearly warrants it.\n\n  We will continue to meet with the administration in the days ahead, \nas we have in the last several days, to assist them in these efforts. I \nknow there will be much debate and there will be careful examination of \nthe request, but I know the Senate will overwhelmingly support the \nPresident's request. Why? We think back to September 11. We know who \nthe enemy is and we know what it takes to defeat that enemy.\n  Over the course of the week and in our briefings and after we talked \nto our colleagues who have gone to Iraq, it is very clear that we are \nmaking a lot of progress in Iraq. It is not what you see when you first \nturn on the television or when you open the newspapers now, but from \nour colleagues who have gone there to see firsthand, and as we have \nbeen briefed by people who have just come back, clearly, we are making \nprogress.\n  Just this week the League of Arab States granted the Iraqi Governing \nCouncil membership, albeit conditional membership but membership, in \ntheir deliberative body. This is a significant step forward. There will \nbe many more steps forward in the coming weeks and months ahead. I know \nwe will succeed in this mission. We will defeat terror. And the Iraqi \npeople will have a free and a democratic nation to lead into the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11425-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11425-S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AN INSPIRATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will talk a little bit on another topic \nfor a couple of minutes, in large part because we began this morning \nopening at 8:30, and over the course of the morning I personally, in \npart representing this body, have had a wonderful day. It was a day \nthat was truly inspiring if you look at public service, but also if you \nlook at the sacrifice that others made on September 11 and since that \ntime, and others who continue to make right now in Iraq and Afghanistan \nto preserve the freedoms and liberties that we have.\n  We opened this morning with a commemoration, a bell ringing, and had \na moment of silence with that glorious sound of that bell dramatically \nringing for each of the incidents and the tragedies that occurred on \nSeptember 11.\n  Over the course of the day on this floor, we have heard our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle reminisce, talk about what they \nwere doing then but also how they have been affected as public servants \nin dealing with others, how people have been brought together, how the \ncommon threads which bind all of us have been stressed a little bit \nmore the last couple of years than maybe in the previous years.\n  A little bit later in the morning I had an opportunity to go by the \nPentagon. At the Pentagon I saw the reconstruction. I had the real \nprivilege of having the Speaker of the House give to Secretary Rumsfeld \nthe flag that was flying over the east wing of the Capitol 2 years ago.\n  We were in the chapel in the part of the Pentagon that was struck. In \nthat new chapel are four beautiful stained-glass windows dedicated to \nthe events, to the families, and to the institution--all related to \nSeptember 11.\n  Coming back here a little bit later, the Congress--Members of the \nHouse and Senate, and others--were on the front steps of the Capitol \nnot too far from where I am speaking now on the floor of the Senate. It \nwas very reminiscent of that night 2 years ago when we were on the \nsteps. We made a statement. It was a spontaneous statement that the \nterrorists will not shut down our Government, where we joined hands and \nsang ``God Bless America'' on the night of September 11.\n  Then later this afternoon--just a few minutes ago--we had a wonderful \nservice with our Senate family, staff, Senators, President pro tempore, \nand the Senate Chaplain and the House Chaplain, again reflecting late \nthis afternoon on the events of 2 years ago. It was a wonderful 10 \nminutes when the Chaplain said: ``I just want three people to volunteer \nto come forward and\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\nsay how September affected them.'' Usually everybody kind of sinks down \nand doesn't want to be the one to volunteer in front of a few hundred \npeople. But hands shot up, and people spoke from the heart about how \nSeptember 11 affected them each in individual ways, but with a common \ntheme coming back of appreciation for what this country has given us \nand the importance of our doing everything we can to protect the \nfreedom and liberty upon which this country has been founded and of \nwhich we take advantage.\n  Also, 40 minutes ago I had the opportunity to go to the West Front of \nthe Capitol and look out over The Mall, with the Lincoln Memorial and \nthe Washington Monument--again, not too many yards from where we are \ntoday--to have the lone bugler quietly--right at 6 o'clock tonight, 40 \nminutes ago--play Taps with a clear sky--the Sun was just beginning to \ngo down--to express our appreciation, our love, and our feeling for the \nmany families who have been affected by the tragedy of September 11.\n  Again, I want to add that people continue to sacrifice and fight for \nthat very same freedom. It is appropriate that we use this day for a \nday of reflection.\n  We continue business. I think that is important. A lot of people said \nwe should stop all business in the Senate. No, I don't think anybody \nfrom September 11 would say stop the Nation's business. In effect, they \nwould say continue the Nation's business. Indeed, we made real progress \ntoday and continued the work of the Senate well into last night as \nwell.\n  Americans all over the country--and indeed all over the world; \nindeed, not just Americans--I know spent the day kneeling, praying, \ngoing to synagogues, mosques, and churches, holding services like the \nmany services we have had here in Washington, DC. A large part of that \nI think is reflected in the power of faith and the fact that faith has \nthat power to help heal, to help explain the questions of ``Why?'' that \ncontinue to arise: Why did things happen on that fateful day? Power to \nconsole, faith to reassure--both right now and as it did 2 years ago on \nthat fateful day.\n  Although 2 years later memories are a little bit fainter and our pain \nmay be just a touch more distant, we still ask questions, questions of \n``Why?'' In that answer of the ``why,'' I think it makes all of us a \nbit more determined, a bit more focused, and a bit more appreciative of \nwhat we have.\n\n  We do put our trust in providence. It is hard to be in this body for \nvery long and not realize the importance of faith and providence in the \nSenate and in our Founding Fathers and the democracy we share today.\n  Abraham Lincoln, in his second inaugural address after 4 of the most \ntraumatic years in U.S. history, said: ``The almighty has His own \npurposes.''\n  I thought of that today while sitting through one of the ceremonies. \nIt does help that question of ``Why?'' Clearly, in Abraham Lincoln's \ntime, faith was able to support, console, and give strength to our \nNation. Clearly, that is the same thing today as we look at the various \nservices. Our Founders had a belief. They believed--they knew, and \nbelieved--that our Nation was founded with divine purpose. During some \nof the most difficult moments, with the odds being against us at \ncertain points in time, our leaders turned to faith. And indeed God has \nwatched over this Nation. Although we asked, ``Why?'' on September 11, \nGod was watching over us on September 11.\n  Over the course of the day, it came up to each of us in different \nways. And Lisa Beamer--the world knows now because she was able to \narticulate and put a face that expresses what we are all trying to \ndescribe--said of her husband's flight on that day, September 11:\n\n       The courageous actions of the passengers and crew reminded \n     me that on the day when people around the world felt \n     violated, helpless, alone and afraid, there were still people \n     of character, people who in the midst of crisis dared to live \n     to the last second with hope.\n\n  She captured it.\n  We all have to ask ourselves: Where did those heroes on Flight 93 \nreach to get their courage? We answer: ``Family.'' That is where we get \nour strength. They answer: ``Faith.'' There is no question that each \nindividual's faith almost certainly played a role.\n  Todd Beamer said what is probably the most inspirational thing many \nof us have heard in our lives. He was talking to the telephone operator \nand said: ``Let's roll.'' But what he said a few seconds before that \nwas the recitation of The Lord's Prayer.\n  A few days after September 11, Billy Graham, in the national prayer \nservice at the cathedral, along with folks here looking at the lessons \nof the ``why,'' said:\n\n       The lesson of this event is not only about the mystery of \n     iniquity and evil, but . . . it's a lesson about our need for \n     each other.\n\n  I was thinking about that when I was at the Senate service about an \nhour ago with the Senate family. Regardless of whether we are staff, or \na Member, elected official, worker, Democrat, Republican, whether we \nare in our first term or seventh term, those in the room there, that \ncommon bond is a calling to public service. We believe in the greatness \nof this institution.\n  As you look at the inscriptions all around--the inscription on the \neast doorway that we come through every day, or that most Senators come \nthrough--the inscription written up there is the English translation of \nthe Latin, ``God has favored our undertakings.''\n  We start coming back to those ``why's.''\n  I will close. But I think, clearly, my final reference today, after \ncoming in 11 hours ago for what has been a meaningful day for me, is a \nwish and a prayer that God continues to watch over the family members \nof the victims of September 11, that God heal their wounds as time goes \nforward, and that God continue to shine on America and indeed on this \nSenate.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is about to \ntake us out of session, but I just wanted to take a moment to thank him \nfor his truly inspirational remarks about the events of today which I \nhad an opportunity to hear over the last few moments and also to thank \nhim for his extraordinary leadership of the Senate.\n  You make us proud every day; particularly you make us proud today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11426-1", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE SENATE WEEK\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I close with some announcements. We had a good, productive \nweek. We completed the Labor-HHS appropriations bill after 7 days of \nconsideration. We had 68 amendments considered. We disposed of all 68 \namendments. We had 25 rollcall votes. I congratulate both of the \nmanagers who did just a superb job in staying focused, handling some \nvery difficult situations but allowing time for debate and votes. We \nhave completed that bill. Both Senator Specter and Senator Harkin did a \nsuperb job.\n  Senator Allen helped clear the way for Senate action on H.R. 978 with \nregard to the disability compensation computation bill which can now go \nto the President's desk.\n  Earlier today the Senate spoke with a voice vote as it unanimously \nadopted S. Res. 224 relating to the second anniversary of September 11.\n  Next week I look forward to beginning a fresh week and continuing on \nour appropriations process. Again, we have a number of appropriations \nbills to address. We have made real progress; in fact, five \nappropriations bills. If you look at the overall amount of money, that \nis probably 70 percent of the overall amount of money appropriated. So \nwe are making progress. It is tough--slower than I would like, but we \nare making steady progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/09/11/senate-section/article/S11426-2", "month": "09", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11426-S11427]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
