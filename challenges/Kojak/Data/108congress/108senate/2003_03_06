Madam President, seeing no one else here and being \nprepared to yield as soon as someone comes with a desire to speak, I \nwill take advantage of this opportunity to make a few comments with \nrespect to the pending situation in Iraq.\n  Since I returned from last weekend in Utah, I have become \nincreasingly aware of how anxious people are about Iraq and the \npossibility of war in Iraq. This anxiousness comes from those who are \nsupporters of the President as well as those who are detractors of the \nPresident. Some who have faith in the President's judgment and in his \ninstincts say, we will back him but we are very concerned about the \npossibility of going to war. Those who do not have faith in the \nPresident's political judgment are almost beside themselves with anger \nand anxiety that he would go ahead in the face of what they consider to \nbe serious worldwide opposition to the war.\n  As I look out at the situation, as best I can I have tried to explain \nto them\n\n[[Page S3208]]\n\nwhat I see to help them understand that which the Washington Post \neditorial said last week; that is, the risks of not going to war in the \npresent circumstances are probably greater than the risks of going to \nwar. Those who are looking to the United States to exercise leadership \nin this part of the world--indeed, to free them from the tyranny of \nSaddam Hussein--are just as desperate that perhaps we might back down \nas are those who fear that war will come.\n  War is never an easy decision, and I assure all of my constituents \nthat this President is not given to war simply as something to do. That \nwhich we hear in the press about this possibility is clearly wrong; \nthat is, the suggestion that perhaps the President is going to war in \norder to secure more oil for America. I point out that if oil were our \nmotivation, war would be our last option. We could simply turn to \nSaddam Hussein, remove the sanctions, make accommodations with him, and \nsay, go ahead and produce all the oil you want and we will take \nadvantage of that and the impact of that on the world oil market.\n  Nor does it have anything to do, as some have suggested in the press, \nwith the desire on the part of this President to somehow redeem the \npledge that was made by his father. All of this rewrites history. \nGeorge W. Bush--or George Bush, the first, if I might use that term--\nwas operating under a series of resolutions from the United Nations \nthat did not authorize him to invade Iraq or go into Baghdad to remove \nSaddam Hussein. The decision was made, after examining the \ncircumstances on the battlefield, that the mandate laid down by both \nthe Congress and the U.N. had been fulfilled when the first George W. \nBush had succeeded in liberating Kuwait.\n  We can look back through the lens of history and say that was a \nmistake in terms of what happened in the area, but by no means was it a \ncircumstance where we could say that the present President Bush feels a \nneed to somehow revenge his father or atone for his father. At the \ntime, the decision was made on the basis of the legal situation and the \nbest information available from the battlefield. In hindsight, we might \nsay it was the wrong decision, but under no circumstances can we say \nthat the first President Bush should be criticized for having made it.\n  No, the reason we are going forward in Iraq has to do with much more \nof the American spirit and the American tradition. America is not an \nimperial power, in spite of the statements by some of the people in the \nEuropean press. America does not seek Roman-type domination over other \nnations. When America moves forward in war, it is for one purpose only, \nand that is to advance the cause of freedom. Usually, it is to advance \nthe cause of freedom in America; that is, to preserve our citizens from \nattack. That is an aspect of the current situation.\n\n  Those who say, no, Iraq has never attacked us are being blind to the \ninterconnections throughout the world of the Middle East with respect \nto terror. They say, we do not have a smoking gun to prove absolutely \nthat al-Qaida, when they attacked the World Trade Center and the \nPentagon, was receiving aid from Iraq. Those who are waiting for that \nkind of absolute certainty before they move ahead are not cognizant of \nthe intelligence information that is available not only to those who \nhave attended classified briefings but, frankly, to the whole world \nbased on the presentations made by Secretary Powell at the U.N. and in \nother circumstances.\n  There can be no doubt that America has been attacked, has been \nattacked by those who have received sanctuary in Iraq, and has been \nattacked by those who will, if not stopped, come back at us again and \nagain and again. It is their clear desire to drive the Americans out of \nthe Middle East through military--if necessary, terrorist--tactics, to \nsee to it that we leave. When we leave, what will be the legacy of that \ndecision? If we back out of our military threat against Iraq, what will \nwe leave behind? Will we leave stability? Will we leave freedom? Will \nwe leave prosperity? No. If we back out of the region now, we will \nleave behind us continued warfare, continued death, continued poverty, \nand continued torture. That is not the American tradition, to turn our \nback on those circumstances and walk away when there is an opportunity \nto advance freedom, liberty, prosperity, and peace.\n  I do not envy the President the challenge of the decision he must \nmake, but I recognize America has traditionally, when aroused, stood on \nthe side of moving ahead to protect liberty wherever we can. If we do \ngo ahead with military action in Iraq in the face of Saddam Hussein's \ncontinuing refusal to disarm, what, then, will be the legacy we will \nleave behind when the entire operation is finished? We can only look at \nother American circumstances to try to find the parallel. When we moved \ninto imperial Japan at the end of the second world war, defeated the \nJapanese military, what did we find? A feudal system where women were \nnot only not allowed to vote but in many cases were treated like \nproperty and chattel, where slavery existed throughout the empire, \nwhere property rights were not available to any except those who had \nbeen born to them--a feudal society firmly mired in circumstances of \ncenturies before.\n  What did we leave behind when we departed? A free nation that had \nwomen's suffrage, where slavery was abolished, where property rights \nwere available to all, where the rule of law existed in a democratic \nsociety. We saw the Japanese rise to a level of prosperity thereafter \nthat made them the second strongest economy in the world. That was the \nlegacy we left behind when we achieved military victory.\n  When we won the Second World War, we not only liberated those people \nwho considered themselves under the yoke of foreign domination--the \nDutch, the French, the Belgians, et cetera--we also liberated the \nGermans, who were our enemies, and the Japanese, who were our enemies. \nAfter the Second World War, those who had been our adversaries had a \ngreater degree of freedom, a greater degree of prosperity, and a peace \nand calm in their circumstances they did not have under their previous \nregimes. They did not live under American domination or American \nlegions left there as the Romans would do. They lived there in freedom \nand peace and were protected by American military might from those who \nwould have attacked that peace.\n  It is that history in America that gives me confidence that President \nBush will do the right thing in Iraq. If war becomes necessary because \nof Saddam Hussein's continued refusal to disarm and his continued \nrefusal to step down and turn his country to freedom, if war becomes \nnecessary, the American tradition says the legacy we will leave behind \nwill be one that our children can be proud of and in which Iraqi \nchildren can rejoice.\n  Let us not shrink from our responsibility to be the protectors of \nfreedom and liberty throughout the world. And let us not shrink from \nour responsibility to protect America from those who would attack us if \nwe do not move ahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, shortly we will have a vote on cloture on \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada. Let me just say that I am saddened \nthat we have to have this vote at all. Democrats are not interested in \ndelaying the debate, delaying the vote. What we are interested in is \nthe same standard set for judicial nominees virtually all through \nhistory. Nominees in the past have come before the Judiciary Committee, \nthey have answered their questions, they have provided the \ndocumentation, votes have been taken, and judges overwhelmingly have \nbeen confirmed. This is the exception, not the rule.\n  While we were in the majority we confirmed 101 judicial nominees. I \nhaven't checked, and I have no way of knowing, but I suspect all 101 \nconfirmed judges are conservatives. I don't think they would have made \nit through\n\n[[Page S3209]]\n\nthe screening process of the Bush administration were they not \nconservative.\n  We have voted on a large number--I don't have the number before me--\nof judges this year. Again, I would say, without exception, those \njudges are conservative and, with rare exception, those judges were \nconfirmed unanimously.\n  There are those who suggest that somehow because this is a \nconservative judge, Democrats are balking at confirmation. I will \noppose Mr. Estrada even if we have the opportunity at some point in the \nfuture because I am confident, based on his answers to questions so \nfar, and the limited information we do have available to us so far, \nthat he represents an extreme point of view, not a moderate point of \nview. I believe those extreme positions are ones that would cause \nconcern, whether he were extreme liberal or extreme conservative.\n  But the issue in this immediate case is not philosophical \ntemperament. This issue is about intransigence. This issue is whether \nor not Miguel Estrada or anybody else ought to be held to the same \nstandard for consideration of this important position, the second \nhighest court in the land. He has been asked to fill out a job \napplication and he refuses to fill out the final pages of that \napplication. We are left to guess what his qualifications are. We are \nleft to guess what his judicial temperament is. For many of my \ncolleagues, that is insufficient. His attitude, his disposition, his \nintransigence is why we are here today. So it is not Democrats, it is \nMr. Estrada, it is the administration that continues to be unwilling to \nprovide the cooperation and the information that Members have used in \nthe past to make their judgments.\n  There has been so much misinformation regarding past precedent, but \neven if you sift through all of the misinformation in the assertions \nrelating to other judges and their degree of compliance with the law, I \ndon't know of anyone who has not acknowledged that Solicitor General \ndocuments have been shared with members of the Judiciary Committee and \nthe Senate on past occasions. That is fact. Judge Bork, Benjamin \nCiviletti, Judge Rehnquist--there are many who have provided the very \ninformation we have requested.\n  So it is regrettable we are at this point. We have been debating this \nnomination now for a month. I would like very much for us to turn to \nother important matters. We may be going to war soon. The Senate ought \nto have an opportunity to discuss the implications of war, our thoughts \nabout war. We have not had that discussion. Perhaps now is the time to \ndo so.\n  As I have said on the floor on several occasions, the administration \nseems to be consumed with this one job but ignores the fact that over \n2.5 million Americans have lost their jobs. This Senate ought to be \ndevoting its attention and time to dealing with the real issues \nconfronting our country domestically, which are the economy, the loss \nof jobs, the stagnation, the uncertainty.\n\n  I was with a group this morning who said investment is simply not in \nevidence in large measure because of uncertainty, because people do not \nknow what the future holds economically. We ought to be moving forward \non an economic debate. We ought to be moving forward to address those \n2.5 million Americans who have lost their jobs, but we have not done \nso. Yet day after day, hour after hour, we continue to be consumed by \nthe one job at the expense of the millions.\n  There are many reasons I wish conditions would be different this \nmorning. I do hope Mr. Estrada will see fit to be more cooperative. I \nhave appreciated the willingness on the part of the administration to \nencourage Mr. Estrada to meet with Members. But as many of us have \nnoted, it is not his willingness to meet; it is his unwillingness to \nprovide information that has brought us to this point. Meeting alone is \ncosmetic. Meeting alone is more of a public relations ploy than a \nmeaningful way with which to ascertain the facts. We don't need more \npublic relations. We don't need more efforts to meet if those meetings \ncannot be more productive.\n  So I hope we can move on to issues of great import to this country, \nwhether it is foreign policy or the economy or the many other domestic \nissues we face. We have attempted day after day to bring an economic \nstimulus bill to the Senate floor. Perhaps with this vote the way can \nbe cleared to allow that to happen. But whatever happens, I think it is \nimportant to put my colleagues on notice that the vote will not change \nregardless of how many votes may be cast. We feel strongly as a caucus, \nand we will continue to hold the position as a caucus, that the \ninformation Mr. Estrada has so far failed to provide is not in keeping \nwith past precedent; it is not in keeping with constitutional \nexpectations; it is not in keeping with our expectations with regard to \nthe cooperation we would expect from any nominee.\n  I hope as we consider how we might resolve this matter, Mr. Estrada \nwill work with us, provide information we have asked, work with us to \nensure that those unanswered questions can be answered and that in the \nmeantime we can turn to the matters of interest, of import, of concern \nto the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent before we go into \nexecutive session to have printed in the Record two documents. One is \nan editorial that appeared in the Chicago Tribune, written by Eduardo \nM. Penalver, who was a Supreme Court clerk for Justice John Paul \nStevens.\n  I further ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nletter written to Majority Leader Frist, dated today, from a number of \nHispanic leaders from around the Nation, with the final paragraph:\n\n       We want more representation for our community in the \n     courts, but not at such a high price. We accept liberal and \n     conservative thinkers among us, but Mr. Estrada is much more \n     than a conservative, he is an ideologue. We cannot support \n     the confirmation of an ideologue to such an important \n     position in our society. The cost is too high. We urge you \n     and the members of the Senate to oppose Mr. Estrada's \n     confirmation.\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 4, 2003]\n\n                  Are Estrada's Opponents Anti-Latino?\n\n                        (By Eduardo M. Penalver)\n\n       No merit to argument that to oppose Estrada's nomination is \n     to oppose interests of Latinos.\n       The fight over the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the \n     influential Washington, D.C.-based federal appeals court has \n     lifted the veil on the riddle that lies at the heart of the \n     Latino identity: What exactly does it mean to be a \n     ``Latino''?\n       Republican politicians have struggled to paint Estrada's \n     opponents as anti-Latino. They have been joined by a handful \n     of the Latino organizations supporting Estrada's nomination. \n     And then there's the national TV ad, sponsored by Estrada \n     supporters, that depicts a brown boy seeking work and \n     confronting a shop owner who apparently does not want to hire \n     a Latino. The ad not-so-subtly suggests that Estrada's \n     opponents are like the bigot in the store.\n       I count myself among those who--for ideological reasons--\n     firmly oppose Estrada's nomination. But I am also Latino. And \n     while the Republican moralizing is hard to swallow from the \n     party that in the last decade has given us such ``Latino-\n     friendly'' faces as U.S. Rep. Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) and \n     former California Gov. Pete Wilson, it still seems worth \n     asking whether there is some inconsistency between being \n     Latino and opposing the first Latino to be nominated to the \n     D.C. federal circuit.\n       To answer that question, we have to first decide what it \n     means to be a Latino. This is no easy task. Although we have \n     learned to call ourselves Latino or Hispanic, those of us of \n     Latin-American ancestry have often questioned the propriety \n     of being grouped under a unitary label.\n       After all, it is not immediately clear what my Cuban-\n     American family, which lived in relative privilege in Cuba \n     and was embraced by the United States as victims of communist \n     tyranny during the Cold War, shares with Mexican farmworkers \n     in California's central valley or the El Salvadoran woman who \n     cleans my office, both of whom likely come from extreme \n     poverty and who have been greeted in this country with \n     exploitation and disdain.\n       Still, I have always believed (or perhaps hoped) that being \n     a Latino, like being an African-American, had some \n     substantive, perhaps even political content. In discussing \n     the Estrada nomination with other Latinos, particularly those \n     who support the Estrada nomination, however, I have struggled \n     to articulate what that content might be.\n       Estrada has been criticized by some (both Latinos and non-\n     Latinos) for being insufficiently Latino because his family \n     in Honduras was not poor. By that definition, however, \n     virtually none of the Cubans who arrived in the United States \n     in the first years after the revolution would qualify as \n     authentically Latino. Estrada has also been criticized for \n     being too conservative.\n\n[[Page S3210]]\n\n       But the voting patterns of Latinos (and not of just Cuban-\n     Americans) are far too mixed to impose such a simplistic \n     political litmus test on Latino authenticity. Moreover, as a \n     devout member of the Federalist Society, Estrada's most \n     conservative, and--in my opinion--troubling, views likely \n     relate to his understanding of the proper role of the \n     national government in the federal system, an issue on which \n     few Latinos who are not lawyers have much of an ax to grind.\n       Despite the definitional difficulties, those of us who call \n     ourselves Latino at a minimum must share a commitment to the \n     notion that being Latino has some significance.\n       That significance may be rooted in the fact that, despite \n     our obvious diversity, we are perceived by the Anglo majority \n     to fall within a single group and to possess a common set of \n     stereotypical traits, and that, as a result of the way we are \n     perceived, we share an experience of discrimination in this \n     country. It is possible--though I do not think it to be the \n     case--that being Latino means little more than that. But if \n     it does not even mean that much (or that little), why would \n     we ever even use the term and why would we waste our time \n     forming organizations around such a meaningless notion?\n       I believe that this minimal shared belief provides a \n     principled basis for opposing the Estrada nomination from a \n     distinctively Latino point of view. In addition, I believe \n     that this shared belief suggests that those Latino \n     organizations that have endorsed the Estrada nomination have \n     betrayed the very ideals on which they were founded.\n       From this minimalist Latino perspective, it is not decisive \n     whether Estrada is rich or poor or liberal or conservative. \n     What matters is that Estrada has never said or done anything \n     to indicate that he views himself as belonging to, or having \n     something to contribute to or gain from, this Latino (or \n     Hispanic or Latin American) community we have chosen for \n     ourselves. Indeed, by all accounts, he thinks racial and \n     ethnic categories are irrelevant, even harmful.\n       Miguel Estrada is not less Latino because he comes from a \n     professional Honduran family or because he is a hard-line \n     conservative. But he is certainly less worthy of Latino \n     support because he is against the notion that a Latino \n     identity is a concept with any meaning or value. As a result, \n     organizations whose founding principles revolve around the \n     opposite belief have no business endorsing his nomination to \n     a U.S. Court of Appeals.\n       If Estrada did believe that his Latino identity had some \n     significance, I would probably still oppose him--perhaps \n     because my ideological commitments are more important to me \n     than my desire to see a Latino on the D.C. circuit. But even \n     under those circumstances, given the typical conservative \n     denial that race or ethnicity should ever matter, his \n     Republican supporters' attempt to manipulate ethnic loyalties \n     for the sake of their ideological crusade would still seem \n     particularly cynical and offensive.\n       Nevertheless, the notion that his presence on the federal \n     appeals court would be good for Latinos would be entitled to \n     more weight. Given Estrada's apparent beliefs that Latino \n     identity is irrelevant, however, there is not the least bit \n     of merit to the argument that to oppose Estrada's nomination \n     is to oppose the interests of the Latino community. To the \n     contrary, those of us in the Latino community who oppose \n     Estrada's nomination are simply giving him what he has always \n     asked for: to be treated as an individual and not as the \n     member of a group.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 2003.\n     Majority Leader Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist: We write you today on the \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. Circuit of Appeals. \n     We are all Latino/Hispanic/Chicano professors researching, \n     writing, and teaching in colleges and universities throughout \n     the country. We come from a world, not too dissimilar from \n     the other worlds in our society, where not only are Latinos \n     under represented in our rank of professors, but we are also \n     under represented among the students and worse yet among the \n     Presidents and Deans of our institutions. Nevertheless, we \n     believe in studying old ideas, developing and exchanging new \n     ideas, and training the next generation of thinkers to \n     explore and improve the world around them, however they \n     choose to do so.\n       We have followed with extreme interest the Senate's review \n     and debate on the nomination of Mr. Estrada. For many in our \n     broader society, they may be confused as to whether Mr. \n     Estrada should be supported or not; however, we are not. We \n     stand united in our opposition to the confirmation of Mr. \n     Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       We recognize and congratulate Mr. Estrada on his \n     professional accomplishments. So few Hispanics have had the \n     privileges that he has had to serve as a Supreme Court clerk, \n     to serve in the Solicitor General's Office of the Department \n     of Justice or to reach the level of partner at a major law \n     firm in this country. At the end of the day, however, the \n     question we ask is whether Mr. Estrada would be a fair judge? \n     We conclude that he would not be.\n       He evaded questions from the Senate. That does not give us \n     confidence that he would be a fair and open-minded judge if \n     he feels he has to hide how he approaches the law. His past \n     record, although limited, also provides some disturbing \n     insight into how he would rule as a judge. We see that he \n     would not be a supporter of affirmative action at the very \n     colleges and universities where we teach where Latinos are \n     sorely under represented and under served. A major problem \n     facing Chicanos and other Hispanics is the issue of racial \n     profiling; again, Mr. Estrada downplays its existence. We \n     question whether he has a commitment to protecting civil \n     rights of Latinos.\n       We want more representation from our community in the \n     courts, but not at such a high price. We accept liberal and \n     conservative thinkers among us, but Mr. Estrada is much more \n     than a conservative, he is an ideologue. We cannot support \n     the confirmation of the ideologue to such an important \n     position in our society. The cost is too high. We urge you \n     and the members of the Senate to oppose Mr. Estrada's \n     confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Leonard Valverde, Professor, Educational Leadership & \n     Policy Study, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.\n       Dorinda Moreno, Napa Community College, Ohlone Jr. College, \n     SF State University, Concord, CA.\n       Duane Campbell, Bilingual/Multicultural Education, CSU \n     Sacramento, Sacramento, CA.\n       Gary Urdiales, Youth Development Specialist, Lanier High \n     School.\n       Ian Haney-Lopez, Professor of Law, U.C.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session and resume consideration of \nExecutive Calendar No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally among the two sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pending question is the Estrada \nnomination. The Senator has 12 minutes under his control.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Madam President, the Senate Judiciary Committee is meeting. I spoke \nto our distinguished chairman, Senator Hatch, who is still there, and, \nby mutual agreement, I have come to the Chamber to speak now, and then \nhe will, of course, have his time preserved.\n  Before I start, I thank both the Democratic leader and the assistant \nleader, Senator Reid, for their efforts to safeguard our Constitution \nand to protect the special role of the Senate in ensuring that our \nFederal courts have judges who will fairly interpret the Constitution \nand laws passed by Congress. We pass these statutes for the sake of all \nAmericans, not just for Republicans, not just for Democrats--all \nAmericans. I also thank all the Democratic Senators who have spoken on \nthe floor or who have joined together to preserve the integrity of the \nconfirmation process.\n  What is at stake in this nomination is a lifetime appointment to the \nsecond highest court in the country. Most of the decisions issued by \nthe DC Circuit in the nearly 1,400 appeals filed per year are final \nbecause the Supreme Court now takes fewer than 100 cases from all over \nthe country. Our DC Circuit has special jurisdiction over cases \ninvolving the rights of working Americans, as well as the laws and \nregulations intended to protect our environment, safe workplaces, and \nother important Federal regulatory responsibilities. This is a court \nwhere privacy rights will either be retained or lost, and where \nthousands of individuals will have their final appeal in matters that \naffect their financial future, their health, their lives, and their \nliberty, as well as the lives of their children and generations to \ncome.\n\n  If a nominee's record or responses raises doubts or concerns, these \nare matters for thorough scrutiny by the Senate, which is entrusted to \nreview all of the information and materials relevant to a nominee's \nfairness and experience. No one should be rewarded for stonewalling the \nSenate and the American people. Our freedoms are the fruit of too much \nsacrifice to fail to assure ourselves that the judges we confirm will \nbe fair judges to all people and in all matters. No one should have a \nlifetime appointment as a gift because they stonewalled the Senate.\n  It is unfortunate that the White House and some Republicans have \ninsisted on this confrontation rather than working with us to provide \nthe needed information so we could proceed to an up-or-down vote.\n  Some on the Republican side are having too much fun playing politics, \nseeking to pack our courts with ideologues or leveling baseless charges \nof bigotry, to work with us to resolve the impasse over this nomination \nby providing requested information and proceeding to a fair vote.\n  I was disappointed that Mr. Bennett, the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, in his honest colloquy with the distinguished Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, and me on February 12, which pointed to a solution, \nwas never allowed to go forward by hard-liners on the other side. I am \ndisappointed all my efforts, and those of Senator Daschle and Senator \nReid, have been rejected by the White House. The letter that Senator \nDaschle sent to the President on February 11 pointed the way to \nresolving this matter. The responses we got showed me that they would \nrather engage in politics at the White House.\n  The Republican majority is wedded to partisan talking points that are \nlight on facts but heavy on rhetoric. There has often been an absence \nof fair and substantive debate and a prevalence of name calling that \nhas offended many. At the outset of this debate, I called for an \napology for remarks calling Democrats ``anti-Hispanic'' and I urged \ndebate on the merits. Unfortunately, the Republican name calling \ncontinued, and those attacks were extended to include members of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, some of the highest and most respected \nHispanic elected officials in the Nation, and other Hispanic \norganizations and leaders that oppose this nomination. That is \nextremely disappointing.\n  Our sincere concerns have been distorted and then dismissed. So in \nthese closing moments before the cloture vote, let me puncture some of \nthe Republican myths about this nomination and this process.\n  First, Republicans rely on a letter from former Solicitors General \nstating a policy preference that did not acknowledge past precedent. \nRepublicans claimed, in fact, that our request for memos written by \nthis judicial nominee was unprecedented. That is false. And, during the \ncourse of this debate, even the administration had to concede their \nclaim was false.\n  The smoking gun was a letter from the Reagan Department of Justice \nasking the Judiciary Committee to return similar memos written to the \nSolicitor General by lower level attorneys that had been provided ``to \nrespond fully to the Committee's request and to expedite the \nconfirmation process.'' This was done in another nomination but refused \nin this one. In fact, buried in the current administration's rejection \nof Senator Daschle's good-faith effort to resolve this impasse was the \nbelated concession that other administrations had produced Solicitor \nGeneral Office work papers and other legal memos in other nominations.\n\n  But notwithstanding having admitted that, they misstated that \nprecedent. They continued to misstate the precedent, claiming \nincorrectly that disclosures were predicated on allegations of \nmisconduct by those past\n\n[[Page S3212]]\n\nnominees. But past letters and records prove that the Senate requested, \nand the Reagan administration provided, internal documents such as \nJustice Department legal memos to and from William Rehnquist relating \nto civil rights and civil liberties, appeal recommendations by other \nattorneys to Robert Bork in civil rights cases as well as other \ninternal legal or policy memos he wrote, and a wide range of civil \nrights memos in Brad Reynold's nomination for a short-term appointment \nat the Justice Department. These were requested due to the Senators' \ninterest in examining those writings and better understanding the \nnominees' views and approach to interpreting the laws as executive \nbranch employees. The Senate's interest in examining those documents \nwas not predicated on allegations of misconduct, and that interest was \nnot diminished in any way by the opportunity to review other writings. \nJustice Rehnquist had written judicial opinions and dissents for 15 \nyears, and Judge Bork had served for 6 years on the bench.\n  The real double standard here is that the President selected Mr. \nEstrada based in large part on his work for 4\\1/2\\ years in the \nSolicitor General's Office, as well as for his ideological views. But \nthen, having been picked because of his ideological views, the \nadministration said the Senate may not find out what those views are. \nThe administration also sought to deny access to the type of legal \nmemos that had been provided in the past. The administration said the \nSenate could not examine Mr. Estrada's written work from that office \nmaking recommendations of what the law is or should be, even though \nthese papers would shed the most light on his unvarnished views. They \nasserted that the Senate should not consider the very ideology it took \ninto account in selecting a 39-year-old, with no academic writings as a \nlawyer or judicial opinions that would provide insights into his views, \nfor a lifetime seat on the country's second highest court.\n  This is a nominee well known for having very passionate views about \njudicial decisions and legal policy, well known for being outspoken, \nbut he has refused to share his views with the very people charged with \nevaluating his nomination. There seems to be a perversion of values to \nrequire the Senate to stumble in the dark about his views, when he \nshares his views quite freely with others--certainly with insiders and \npeople in the administration, and he has been selected for the \nprivilege of this high office and for a lifetime position based on \nthose same views that they want to keep hidden from the Senate. We are \nnot asking him to pledge how he would rule but we cannot let a new bar \nbe set that one cannot share views with the Senate without reading \nbriefs, listening to oral arguments, conferring with colleagues and \ndoing independent research. I think any concerned citizen or first year \nlaw student could mention a Supreme Court decision from the past 200 \nyears that may trouble him or her, but Mr. Estrada refused to answer \neven this question, among many, many others.\n  This points to a second myth: That Mr. Estrada cannot answer \nquestions about his views without violating judicial ethics. However, \nas Justice Scalia--one of President Bush's favorite Supreme Court \nJustices--wrote for a majority of the court just last summer, ``Even if \nit were possible to select judges who do not have preconceived views on \nlegal issues, it would hardly be desirable to do so. `Proof that a \nJustice's mind at the time he joined the Court was complete tabula rasa \nin the area of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of \nqualification, not lack of bias.' '' Republican Party of Minnesota v. \nWhite, 122 S. Ct. 2528 (2002). This quote is from the majority opinion \nin a case about whether judicial candidates could share their views. \nThis is a case that the Republican Party took all the way to the \nSupreme Court and won. Prior to this decision there may have been some \nambiguity for judicial candidates about whether they could share their \nviews, but this decision last year by Justice Scalia makes clear that \njudicial ethics do not prevent sharing of views.\n  Third, Republicans have claimed that this debate on a judicial \nnomination was unprecedented. That is false as well. Republicans not \nonly filibustered the Supreme Court nomination of Abe Fortas, they \nfilibustered the nominations of Judge Stephen Breyer, Judge Rosemary \nBarkett, Judge H. Lee Sarokin, Judge Richard Paez and Judge Marsha \nBerson, among others. The truth is that filibusters and cloture votes \non nominations and legislative matters and extended debate on judicial \nnominations, including circuit court nominations, have become more and \nmore common through Republican actions. Of course, when they are in the \nmajority, Republicans have more successfully defeated judicial nominees \nby refusing to proceed on them and then not publicly explaining their \nactions, and by allowing holds by one or a handful of Republicans to \ndetermine a nominee's fate, preferring to act in secret under the cloak \nof anonymity.\n  The nomination of Judge Paez, a Mexican American nominated to the \nNinth Circuit, illustrates quite clearly that the last filibuster of a \ncircuit court nominee occurred on the Republican watch during the last \nadministration. Judge Paez was first nominated in 1996 and Republicans \nrefused to allow him an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate \nuntil he was finally confirmed in 2000, after his nomination had been \npending for more than 1,500 days. In fact, his nomination had waited on \nthe floor for an up or down vote for more than 20 months, 20 times \nlonger than Mr. Estrada's nomination. After Republicans lost a cloture \nvote on March 8, 2000, they moved ``to indefinitely postpone'' his \nnomination. Chairman Hatch noted that such a motion was unprecedented \nfollowing a cloture vote to end what he then acknowledged was a \n``filibuster'' of Judge Paez's nomination. Despite his concerns, 31 \nRepublicans--many of whom have been on this floor demanding an \nimmediate up or down vote on Mr. Estrada's nomination and claiming that \ndelaying a vote is unconstitutional--voted to postpone, in essence, \nforever a vote on Judge Paez's circuit court nomination. I think this \nrecent example punctures the Republican myths about floor votes and \nfilibusters.\n\n  Fourth, Republicans claim that the debate on this nomination has held \nup other business of the Senate, blaming Democrats. That is false. The \ntruth is that Republicans objected to turning to the economic stimulus \npackage and funding for first responders when Senator Daschle sought \nthat action last week. Instead, Republicans have been focused on \nensuring a lifetime job for one man rather than addressing the need to \nstimulate the creation of good jobs for many Americans. During the \ncourse of this debate, Democrats have willingly proceeded to confirming \na number of other judicial nominees of this President--including a \nHispanic nominee to the district court in California--passing the \nomnibus appropriations bill, passing short-term continuing resolutions \nto fund the government, passing the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act against \nchild pornography, and now debating the Moscow treaty. The reason the \nSenate has not done more is because Republicans have not asked the \nSenate to turn to such matters as Senator Biden's bill to grant asylum \nto Iraqi scientists and other bills.\n  Fifth, Republicans have tried to create the impression that those who \noppose this nomination are anti-Hispanic. That is false and they know \nit. The members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus are not anti-\nHispanic, nor are the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education \nFund, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Latino \nlabor leaders, the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project, \nthe California Chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens \n(LULAC), the 75 Latino professors, the 15 former presidents of the \nHispanic National Bar Association, the AFL-CIO, the Sierra Club, \nDolores Huerta--the cofounder of the United Farm Workers of America--\nMario Obledo, Professor Paul Bender or the hundreds of other Americans \nwho called or written in opposition to this nomination.\n  Democratic Senators are not anti-Hispanic. This charge is as baseless \nnow as it was when my religion, and the religion of other Democratic \nmembers on the Senate Judiciary Committee, was attacked by some of the \nRepublican leadership. We ought to understand that people do not have \nthese biases, baseless biases, that are being ascribed by some in their \nzeal to win at\n\n[[Page S3213]]\n\nany cost, just as we should not be attacking each other's religion. \nDemocratic Senators have pressed for the confirmation of many Hispanics \nover the past ten years, including the confirmation of Judge Paez, \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor, Judge Julio Fuentes, Judge Kim Wardlaw, and \nJudge Jose Cabranes, just to name a few of the other Hispanics \nappointed to the circuit courts by Democratic or Republican presidents, \nin addition to Judge Hilda Tagle, Judge James Otero, and Judge Jose \nLinares, just to name a few of the Hispanic district court nominees \nover these years. In fact, Democratic Senators also pressed for Senate \nconfirmation of Enrique Moreno, Jose Rangel, and Christine Arguello, \nwho had been nominated to the circuit courts, and for many other \noutstanding judicial candidates on which the Republican Senate majority \nrefused to proceed when they were nominated or renominated by President \nClinton. Baseless Republican charges of bias prompted LULAC, an \norganization that initially endorsed the Estrada nomination, to \ndisassociate itself from Republican statements.\n  I urge the White House and Senate Republicans to end the political \nwarfare and join with us in good faith to make sure the information \nthat is needed to review this nomination is provided so that the Senate \nmay conclude its consideration of this nomination. I urge the White \nHouse, as I have for more than two years, to work with us and, quoting \nfrom the column published yesterday by Thomas Mann of the Brookings \nInstitute, submit ``a more balanced ticket of judicial nominee and \nengag[e] in genuine negotiations and compromise with both parties in \nCongress.'' The President promised to be a uniter not a divider, but he \nhas continued to send us judicial nominations that divide our nation \nand, in this case, he has even managed to divide Hispanics across the \ncountry, unlike any of the prior judicial nominees of both Democratic \nand Republican Presidents.\n  Madam President, I do not see others seeking the floor except for \nSenator Schumer. I ask unanimous consent that he be allowed 3 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I want to \nsay on behalf of all the Senators on this side of the aisle how much we \nsupport the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, what a difficult \njob he has had, and what a tremendous job he has done. Senator Leahy \nhas set an example for how a Senator should act. He has been a \nstatesman through this and other battles. Speaking on behalf of Senator \nDaschle and for me, I am sure every Democratic Senator, we can't say \nenough that is good. I will let the Record rest on the fact that we are \ntotally supportive of what you have done and how you have handled this, \nand we are proud of what you have done.\n  If there is no one here, I certainly ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Schumer be allowed to speak until someone shows up for the \nRepublican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, let me add my accolades to our \ncolleague and leader of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, who has \ndone a terrific job. I thank Senator Leahy as well as Senator Daschle \nand Senator Reid for the remarkable unity in the Democratic caucus \nwhen, frankly, some of us felt we had to do something here and didn't \nreally think it would come to fruition.\n  Let me say the vote today boils down to one issue more than any \nother: Should the Senate have any role in the selection of judges to \nthe Federal bench? It is that simple. It boils down to the simple fact \nthat there has been an attempt here to obliterate the advise and \nconsent process which the Founding Fathers regarded as one of the most \nimportant in the Constitution.\n  This is not an argument about one man. This is not an argument about \nany particular issue. This is not even an argument about something I \nbelieve strongly, whether somebody's views should be taken into account \nbefore that person is appointed as a Federal judge.\n  What has happened in the last several months has made a mockery of \nthe advise and consent process.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator agree with the statement made by 75 \nHispanic leaders around the country in a letter stating as follows:\n\n       We want more representation from our community in the \n     courts, but not at such a high price. We accept liberal and \n     conservative thinkers among us, but Mr. Estrada is much more \n     than a conservative, he is an ideologue. We cannot support \n     the confirmation of an ideologue to such an important \n     position in our society. The cost is too high. We urge you \n     and the members of the Senate to oppose Mr. Estrada's \n     confirmation.\n\n  Does the Senator from New York agree with that sentence?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague for asking the question. My view is \nyes. I don't want ideologues on the court, whether they be far right or \nfar left. What ideologues tend to do is make law and not interpret the \nlaw. The bottom line is there are many people who know Mr. Estrada who \nsay he is a mainstream conservative and he is not an ideologue who will \ntry to bend the law to the direction of his beliefs; there are many \nothers who say he is an ideologue who will bend the law to the \ndirection of his beliefs.\n  Going back to my first point, we have no way of ascertaining that one \nway or the other because Mr. Estrada has refused to answer in any kind \nof elucidating and forthright way questions that were asked of him \nthroughout 9 hours of hearings, which I chaired, and because the only \nother place we can find what his views are is in his work papers at the \nSolicitor General's Office, which are being withheld even though there \nis no privilege. And those papers have not been withheld by any other \nnominees who have sought to be justices and garner other positions in \nthe Government.\n  Unless we wish to make the Senate simply a detective agency to find \nsome useful indiscretion and eliminate a nomination or oppose a \nnomination, for that reason, then we should oppose Mr. Estrada.\n  I say to my colleagues that the position of being on the Court of \nAppeals in the DC Circuit is one of the most important positions in the \nGovernment. Many might argue that those judges have more power than \nindividual Senators. Can you imagine if we ran for reelection and we \nsaid we refused to answer questions about our views? Can you imagine \nhow the public would react? They would say, whatever your views are, \nyou have an obligation to tell us if you want to achieve a high office.\n  If you read the papers of the Founding Fathers, the advise and \nconsent process was the very way that views of nominees were to be \nascertained. In fact, as Senator Kennedy elucidated in the Chamber the \nother day, for a long time the Constitutional Convention wanted the \nSenate to choose the judges but believed that the ability to choose \nwould be too disparate, and instead they came to the decision that the \nPresident should choose them.\n  But nowhere is it believed that the Senate should be a rubberstamp. \nNowhere is it believed that the Senate should simply be a detective \nagency to find out if someone did something wrong. Our job is to figure \nout what kind of judge Mr. Estrada would be. We know he is a very \nbright man. That has never been disputed. We know he has a story of \nadvancement. That has not disputed. But far more important than either \nof those things, do we know what his views are on the first amendment \nor the commerce clause? Do we know how he would approach cases that \naffect the environment, or workers' rights to organize, where the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals is paramount? We don't \nwant him to tell us how he would rule on a specific case, but the \nAmerican people are certainly entitled to the views of this man in \nterms of how he would be a judge.\n  Some on the other side say it is simply good enough for any nominee \nto say, I will follow the law. If that were the case, we wouldn't be \nhere; we wouldn't need the advise and consent process; the debate in \nConstitution Hall about how to choose judges would have been totally \noverruled.\n  This is a historic moment in a very real sense. It is a moment when \nwe are going to see if a third branch of Government--the one unelected \nbranch of\n\n[[Page S3214]]\n\nGovernment, which has awesome power--is going to be responsible to the \npeople. To simply have Presidents choose judges is not what this \ncountry needs nor what the Founding Fathers intended, yet we are \ngetting to that point right now.\n  I urge my colleagues. I want to join my plea with Senator Leahy's. We \nhave tried on this side. I have tried to understand. The Presidents are \ngoing to get their way almost all of the time. I have voted for 100 of \nthe 106 judges who came before us. I daresay their philosophical views \nabout government and all of these issues are quite different from mine. \nBut as long as they are not out of the mainstream, as long as they \nwon't approach being judges from an ideological point of view where \nthey are making law rather than interpreting law, they deserve to be on \nthe bench, if they have the other qualifications. We have no way of \nknowing right now. The American people have no way of knowing what kind \nof judge Mr. Estrada will be in terms of his views.\n  For that reason, reluctantly, but firm in the conviction that we are \nright, we must oppose the nomination of Miguel Estrada, or at least \noppose his moving forward until we get the kind of information that is \nnecessary to determine what kind of judge he will be that is necessary \nin terms of the precepts of what the Founding Fathers outlined for this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, some Republicans have stated that only two \nor a handful of editorials or op-eds support Democrats in their \nconcerns about Mr. Miguel Estrada's nomination to the second highest \ncourt in the country.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I wish to at this point to use my leader \ntime.\n  Madam President, the debate on the Miguel Estrada nomination began \nFebruary 5, just over a month ago. During that debate, lasting nearly \n100 hours, I have sought unanimous consent on 17 separate occasions to \nbring the nomination to a vote. Regrettably, those requests for consent \nhave been denied--again, on 17 separate occasions.\n  The Democrats have chosen to filibuster this outstanding nominee, \nwho, as we all know, is a Hispanic immigrant who came to this country \nnot speaking English but, through hard work, dedication, and the virtue \nof great capacity of study, achieved academic excellence. His peers, \nthe American Bar Association, affirm his high qualifications.\n  We know a majority in this body will vote to confirm Miguel Estrada \nif given the opportunity to do what really is our only request, and \nthat is to have an up-or-down vote on this nominee. Yet the minority, \neven after the extended time of well over a month and nearly 100 hours \nof factual discussion on the floor, and despite his obvious \ncredentials, the respect he has among his peers, his academic \nqualifications, his arguments before the Supreme Court, has blocked \nthis simple up-or-down vote on this confirmation.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle--and we have heard it again \nand again--say we are really filibustering because we don't have enough \ninformation; we want more information. That is one of the reasons I \nhave tried to be as patient, as reasonable as possible to give that \ntime so that information could be exchanged before resorting to the \nvote we will undertake in a few minutes. They say they wanted more \ninformation, and that is fine. We want to have the appropriate \ninformation in order to make a decision in terms of an up-or-down vote. \nBut, repeatedly, this nominee has said: I am available and I am ready, \nwilling, and available to come by your office to discuss with you if \nthere are further questions you might have.\n  I suggest my colleagues who really feel--putting politics aside--they \ndon't have enough information, pick up the phone and call the nominee \nand have him come by your office and visit and ask those questions, and \nthen give us an up-or-down vote.\n  We are about to vote on cloture. I hope it succeeds the first time. \nThat is right. That is just. That is responsible. But if we need to, we \nwill vote on cloture again and again.\n  Let me be clear. The majority will press for an up-or-down vote on \nthis nominee until Miguel Estrada is confirmed. The fight for justice \nis just beginning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss the recent cloture vote in relation to the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada to the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.\n  The Constitution provides that the President shall nominate \ncandidates for the Federal bench and the Senate shall give advice and \nconsent regarding those candidates. We cannot yet proceed to a vote on \nthis nominee because we take this constitutional obligation--not right, \nbut obligation--seriously. An up-or-down vote on this nominee is \npremature, because we have yet to get disclosure of critical \ninformation regarding this nominee.\n  I believe that it is our obligation to ensure that--to the best of \nour knowledge--each judicial nominee is capable of setting aside \nextreme views that he or she may hold when interpreting the law and \ndeciding cases. We must do our best to ensure that the person will be a \nfair and impartial judge.\n  Miguel Estrada may very well be able to do that. But before we can \nmake that determination, we have a right to full disclosure of \ninformation that will assist us in ascertaining that this is the case. \nWe have a right to expect the nomineee to be forthcoming in answering \nour questions, and we have a right to expect the administration to be \ncooperative in providing any information that is relevant to making our \ndecision. The advice and consent process is not a rubber stamp but a \nmeaningful process.\n  Mr. Estrada is not a sitting judge and has not published any legal \narticles. Written judicial decisions and published legal writings often \nprovide us with the evidence that we need to determine whether a \nnominee will objectively enforce the laws and the Constitution. We have \nneither here to guide us.\n  Added to this, we have a situation where a person in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office who had direct supervisory authority over the nominee \nwhen he worked there, Mr. Paul Bender, has stated that he does not \nbelieve Mr. Estrada can be trusted to decide cases without being \nclouded by his extreme views. He said that Mr. Estrada was so \n``ideologically driven that he couldn't be trusted to state the law in \na fair, neutral way . . . Miguel is smart and charming, but he is a \nright-wing ideologue.''\n  Now this is just one man's opinion and certainly should not be \ndispositive, but it certainly gives us cause for concern and an even \nstronger desire to have access to all available information regarding \nMr. Estrada's judgment and skills. We could judge for ourselves whether \nthere is any basis for Mr. Bender's assessment of Mr. Estrada by \nreviewing the work that he did while working at the Solicitor General's \nOffice. If we had the ability to do so, we could judge for ourselves \nwhether the nominee objectively presented the facts and the law while \nworking in that capacity, which would be a good indication of his \nability to do so as a judge.\n  To this end, my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee sought access \nto the memoranda written by Mr. Estrada to his superiors at the \nSolicitor General's Office on questions such as whether the United \nStates government should appeal an adverse ruling to the Supreme Court \nor whether it should file an amicus brief in a case that the Supreme \nCourt has decided to hear. The administration has categorically refused \nto provide these documents, despite the fact that it is accepted \npractices to make these types of documents available to the Senate in \nthe context of a nomination inquiry.\n  Initially, the administration refused to provide any of these work \nsamples, incorrectly stating that it was the practice of the executive \nbranch to do so. When my colleagues were able to point out that in \nevery prior case where similar work samples were requested they were \nprovided, the administration claimed that were not officially provided \nbut ``leaked'' to Congress. When my colleagues were able to demonstrate \nthat in every prior case where similar documents were requested, the \nDepartment of Justice officially released them to Congress after an \nexhaustive search, the administration claimed similar documents were \nreleased previously only in order to clear up an allegation of \nwrongdoing, but again my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee \ndemonstrated that this simply was not true. Prior precedent clearly \ndemonstrates a policy of cooperation with respect to previous requests.\n  The administration continues to refuse to provide any of the work \nproducts from the Solicitor General's Office despite the fact that \nthere is no legal basis for their refusal and despite the fact that \nsimilar information was disclosed in every other instance that it was \nrequested. We cannot help but be left with the feeling that there is \nsomething to hide in this case.\n  We also might be able to make a judgment regarding the nominees's \nability to be a fair judge through questioning the nominee regarding \nhis judicial philosophy and regarding his analysis of previously \ndecided cases. These questions are commonly asked of judicial nominees \nin order to examine whether the nominee's views are outside the \nmainstream and whether he can set his or her personal views aside in \nanalyzing cases. When my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee pursued \nthis practice, Mr. Estrada refused to provide meaningful answers to \ntheir questions. I have carefully reviewed the transcript from that \nhearing and am quite frankly amazed at Mr.\n\n[[Page S3218]]\n\nEstrada's refusal to answer questions that many prior judicial \nnominees--both those nominated by Democratic and Republican \nPresidents--have answered as a matter of course.\n  As I have mentioned before, this refusal is particularly perplexing, \ngiven that this same individual admitted that he asked similar \nquestions of candidates for a clerkship with Justice Kennedy in order \nto ``ascertain whether there are any strongly felt views that would \nkeep that person from being a good law clerk to the Justice.'' This is \nexactly what my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee sought to do with \nrespect to Mr. Estrada. If this type of information is relevant to the \nprocess of hiring a Supreme Court law clerk, isn't it infinitely more \nimportant to the process of appointing an appellate judge--someone who \nhas a lifetime appointment to the bench?\n  It may be the case, that if this information were to be made \navailable, I would support Mr. Estrada. I have voted in favor of 100 of \nthe 103 nominees that President Bush has sent forward to the Senate \nsince he took office. In many of these cases, I did not agree with the \nnominee's views on many issues. Nevertheless, I had enough information \nto determine that they were not out of the mainstream of American \njurisprudence. I believe we have the right to have access to the \ninformation that we need to make that judgment on this nominee.\n  It is unfortunate that before I finish that I feel I must respond to \nthe allegations of some that the debate surrounding this particular \nnominee relates to his ethnicity. This is a preposterous notion. It is \na smoke and mirrors argument designed to cloud the legitimate debate \nabout the nominee's qualifications for the bench.\n  To infer--or to outright state as has been the case--that my \ncolleagues would be motivated by the fact that Mr. Estrada is Hispanic \nis outrageous. One need only look to recent history to see just how \nwrongheaded that notion is. During the last Democratic administration, \nover 30 Hispanics were nominated for judgeships. I supported all of \nthem. Unfortunately, approximately one-third of them were not \nconfirmed--and some didn't even get the courtesy of a hearing--due to \nopposition from some of my Republican colleagues. It was, in fact, \nduring the last Democratic administration that the first Latina to \nserve at the district court level was confirmed. She continues to serve \nin my State.\n  By contrast, this administration has nominated a total of eight \nHispanics. Six of them have already been confirmed and are now serving \non the bench and the other nominee is expected to move ahead as soon as \nthe necessary paperwork is in order. That leaves only Mr. Estrada, and \nI have stated the reasons I feel it is inappropriate to go forward with \nhis nomination.\n  The debate in this case is about preserving the Senate's \nconstitutional role in judicial nominations. It transcends this \nparticular nomination because if we were to proceed to a vote after \nthis nominee has refused to answer routine questions about his views \nand his judicial philosophy, and after the administration has refused \nto respond to a routine request for samples of this nominee's work \nproduct, we would essentially be conceding that the Senate's role in \njudicial nominations is that of providing a rubber stamp to the \nPresident's nominations. This is clearly not the role envisioned by the \nFramers of our Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3218-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3218-S3221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MOSCOW TREATY\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 3, add the following new declaration:\n       (7) Stand-down from alert status of forces covered by \n     treaty.--Noting that the Administration has stated that \n     ``[t]he first planned step in reducing U.S. operationally \n     deployed strategic nuclear warheads will be to retire 50 \n     Peacekeeper ICBMs, remove four Trident Submarines from \n     strategic service, and no longer maintain the ability to \n     return the B-1 to nuclear service,'' the Senate--\n       (A) encourages the President, within 180 days after the \n     exchange of instruments of ratification of the Treaty, to \n     initiate in a safe and verifiable manner a bilateral stand-\n     down from alert status of all United States and Russian \n     Federation nuclear weapons systems that will no longer be \n     operationally deployed under the Treaty, but which the United \n     States and the Russian Federation may keep operationally \n     deployed under the Treaty until December 31, 2012; and\n       (B) expects a representative of the executive branch of the \n     Government to offer regular briefings to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate regarding--\n       (i) the alert status of the nuclear forces of the United \n     States and the Russian Federation;\n       (ii) any determination of the President to order a stand-\n     down of the alert status of United States nuclear forces; and\n       (iii) any progress in establishing cooperative measures \n     with the Russian Federation to effect a stand-down of the \n     alert status of Russian Federation nuclear forces.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer this amendment. \nI recognize that the leadership is not accepting amendments. I accept \nthat. I am a supporter of the treaty, and I am happy to cast my vote \nfor it.\n  But there is one significant omission from this treaty, and I want to \npoint out that omission. That omission is that we have literally \nthousands of nuclear missiles on hair trigger alert. The Russian \nFederation has thousands of nuclear missiles on hair trigger alert. \nThis treaty does not take that into consideration and does not urge or \ndoes not certify a reduction of the alert status of these missiles. I \nbelieve if we fail to address this issue, we risk the lives of millions \nof people over what may turn out to be a simple miscalculation.\n  People hearing me might say, how can that possibly happen? I would \nlike to explain how it can happen.\n  On the morning of January 25, 1995, the Russian military initially \ninterpreted the launch of a U.S. weather rocket from Norway as a \npossible nuclear attack on the Russian Federation. That is just 8 years \nago. Thankfully, the true nature of the launch became known and a \ncatastrophic mistake was averted. Nevertheless, then-President Yeltsin \nand his advisers had only minutes to decide whether the launch of a \nweather rocket was a surprise attack because Russia, like the United \nStates, maintained and continues to maintain thousands of nuclear \nweapons on high alert status, ready to be launched at a moment's \nnotice.\n  This was not the only instance in which both countries have come \nclose to the unthinkable. On at least two occasions in the United \nStates and at least one occasion in Russia, false alarms could have led \nto the accidental launch of nuclear weapons.\n  Today, Russia and the United States are entering into a new era of \nrelations. We do so with the advent of this treaty. A deliberate \nnuclear strike by either side is unthinkable. In fact, the \nadministration states the brevity of the Moscow Treaty and the lack of \nverification, timetables, and a list of specific weapons to be \ndestroyed, is due to the fact that Russia and the United States are no \nlonger strategic competitors but today we are strategic allies. So fear \nand suspicion have been replaced by trust, cooperation, and friendship.\n  It is surprising, then, that the United States and Russia continue to \nmaintain their nuclear arsenals on this high\n\n[[Page S3219]]\n\nalert status. It is surprising the Moscow Treaty, a symbol of the new \nrelationship, in the words of the administration, does not address this \nissue. In the past, President Bush has recognized the dangers of high \nalert status and the need to reevaluate our nuclear weapons. As a \ncandidate, he stated in a speech on May 23, 2000:\n\n       Keeping so many weapons on high alert may create \n     unacceptable risks of accidental or unauthorized launch.\n\n  Experts on nuclear weapons issues have expressed similar concerns. In \nhis testimony on the Moscow Treaty before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, former Senator Sam Nunn stated that the alert status:\n\n       . . . may well be more important to stability and security \n     than the actual number of nuclear weapons.\n\n  He likened the issue to two families who have agreed to reduce the \nnumber of high-powered automatic weapons aimed at each other in several \nyears' time but in the meantime decide to keep the weapons loaded with \na finger on the trigger.\n  Former Secretary of Defense William Perry testified that the Moscow \nTreaty's failure to address the alert status of the United States and \nRussia's nuclear weapons represented a significant missed opportunity. \nHe concurred with retired Air Force GEN Eugene Habiger, former \ncommander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, who recommended that \nthe United States take a first step by immediately standing down all \nnuclear weapons systems that will not be operationally deployed under \nthe Moscow Treaty.\n  If you will note, the amendment I have sent to the desk does not say \nthis should be unilateral, on our part only; it says a bilateral \nreduction of alert status of operational nuclear weapons deployed \ntoday.\n  I believe we should take the words of the general, of the very \nrespected Senator Nunn, and former Defense Secretary Bill Perry and \ntake some action. A miscalculation, in Senator Nunn's scenario, would \nresult in the loss of a few lives from these automatic weapons in a \nfamily feud situation, but a miscalculation between Russia and the \nUnited States could result in the loss of millions of lives. De-\nalerting will give the leaders of the United States and Russia \nsufficient time to evaluate fully a situation before making a decision \non a nuclear response in a matter of minutes or seconds, and it would \ngreatly reduce the possibility of an accidental nuclear launch due to \nfalse alarm and miscalculation.\n  The amendment I sent to the desk encourages the President, within 180 \ndays of exchange of instruments and ratification, to initiate in a safe \nand verifiable manner a stand-down from alert status of all nuclear and \nRussian nuclear weapons systems that will not be operationally deployed \nunder the treaty.\n  In other words, the treaty calls for removing the operational \ndeployment. But in the meantime all these missiles remain on high alert \nstatus--hair trigger alert status.\n  The amendment would urge the President to call on the Russian \nFederation to reciprocate in kind, and the amendment asks that a \nrepresentative of the executive branch of the Government offer regular \nbriefings to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \nForeign Relations of the Senate on three specific topics: First, the \nalert status of the nuclear forces of the United States and Russia; \nsecond, any determination of the President to order a standdown of the \nalert status on the U.S. nuclear forces; third, any progress in \nestablishing cooperative measures with Russia to effect a standdown of \nRussia's nuclear forces.\n  There is a precedent for de-alerting our nuclear weapons and \nprompting the Russians to do likewise. In 1991, as the Soviet Union \nbegan to crumble, then-President Bush ordered a unilateral standdown of \nthe U.S. strategic bombers and de-alerted some missiles scheduled for \ndeactivation under the START treaty. Soviet President Gorbachev at that \ntime reciprocated with similar measures, and the world breathed a \nlittle easier during those turbulent times. So there is precedent for \ntheir de-alerting missiles. And I believe that this Moscow Treaty, \nwhich is based on friendship, trust, and cooperation, necessitates an \nincreased de-alerting status of the literally thousands of nuclear \nweapons that remain in their silos on a hair trigger alert.\n  The amendment is simple and straightforward. We can take it very \neasily. I very much regret that we are in a no-amendment scenario. What \nI hope to do and my cosponsors hope to do is enter into a colloquy in \nthe Record indicating support for this measure and, second, we will \ndraft a letter and try to get as many signatures from other Senators as \nwe can.\n  I believe this treaty, which should be ratified by this Senate today, \nhas this significant oversight. I believe that to leave these missiles \non hair trigger alert status when we enter into this treaty really \ndowngrades the treaty. If we truly trust, if we truly want to be \ncooperative, and if we truly are friends, friends don't aim loaded guns \nat each other with the triggers pulled back.\n  I am hopeful that the administration would respond and begin a \ndiscussion between President Putin and President Bush to see if we \ncannot reach a bilateral de-alerting of the literally--probably more \nthan--10,000 missiles that will remain with nuclear warheads on hair \ntrigger alert.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 251 Withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be withdrawn.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I take the opportunity to make some \ncomments regarding the ratification of the Moscow Treaty. I do it with \nsome reservation. I think the treaty is both a ``good news'' and ``bad \nnews'' story.\n  Right now, roughly speaking, the United States and Russia each deploy \n6,000 nuclear warheads. The treaty would require the U.S. and Russia to \nreduce these levels to 1,700 to 2,200 ``operationally'' deployed \nstrategic nuclear weapons on each side by December 2012.\n  The good news is that this treaty is a positive step--long overdue, \nbut a positive step nonetheless. Over 10 years ago, in January of 1992, \nwhen U.S.-Russian relations were the warmest in years, President \nYeltsin of Russia proposed that the U.S. and Russia reach a strategic \narms control agreement that set the levels at 2,000-2,500 in a START II \nagreement.\n  If former President Bush had agreed back then, we could be close to \nthe levels today that the Moscow Treaty envisions for 10 years from \nnow.\n  At the time former President Yeltsin made his proposal for deep \nreductions, Defense Department officials, especially Defense Secretary \nCheney--now our Vice President--opposed them.\n  As a result, the START II agreement, signed in January 1993, only \nlimited the number of strategic nuclear warheads to 3,000 to 3,500 on \neach side. And due to wrangling over national missile defense the START \nII agreement never entered into force.\n  So I am glad to see that the administration and Vice President Cheney \nnow support cuts to levels first proposed by President Yeltsin in \nJanuary 1992. This support for stronger strategic arms control steps is \nlong overdue but welcome.\n  A second chance to achieve greater reductions came 6 years ago in \n1997. President Clinton agreed with President Yeltsin at Helsinki that \na future START III agreement would entail reductions to 2,000-2,500 \nstrategic warheads on each side. Most likely, the START III agreement \nwould have overlapped with the START II agreement, finishing \nimplementation at the end of December 2007.\n  The START III levels of 2,000 to 2,500 are essentially the same as \nthose embodied in the Moscow Treaty. The START III would have counted \nseveral hundred warheads on systems in overhaul; the Moscow Treaty will \nnot.\n  Unfortunately, because START II never entered into force, START III \nnegotiations never began. In addition, after 1994, our Republican \ncolleagues deliberately made it more difficult to make progress on \nreducing strategic nuclear arms.\n\n[[Page S3220]]\n\n  Starting with the fiscal year 1995 Defense authorization bill, a \nprovision was regularly added forbidding the President from reducing \nU.S. strategic forces below the START I levels of 6,000 strategic \nnuclear warheads. In time for this treaty, this provision has been \nrepealed.\n  So I am pleased to see that my Republican colleagues now support cuts \nto the levels envisioned by President Clinton and President Yeltsin in \nMarch 1997. It is a welcome change of heart, even though it is long \noverdue.\n  The bad news, however, as many have noted, is that the treaty is but \na modest step forward. Many have argued it has several major \nshortcomings.\n  First, the 10-year implementation period is too long and includes no \nbenchmarks for progress or verification measures. Theoretically, as the \ntreaty now stands, both sides could wait until the last moment to make \ntheir reductions, right before the treaty expires.\n  Second, only some of the warheads removed from missiles and bombers \nwill be dismantled. The rest would merely be put into storage, where \nthey could be redeployed. Thus, there will not be a real reduction in \nthe United States or Russian strategic nuclear arsenals. Moreover, the \nsecurity of thousands of stored weapons will remain a matter of major \nconcern, especially during this era of heightened terrorism.\n  Third, the treaty could have reduced the strategic arsenals of the \nUnited States and Russia even further.\n  Fourth, the treaty does not cover the thousands of small tactical \nnuclear weapons that are a major concern for theft by terrorist groups. \nAnd they are weapons of great power, great destructive capability.\n  Since this treaty is so long overdue, and such a modest \naccomplishment, we must work hard through the Bilateral Implementation \nCommission to improve it in the coming years. We also need to take \nsteps beyond the scope of this treaty to reduce our nuclear arsenals \neven more.\n  So I strongly endorse the call in the Foreign Relations Committee \nResolution of Ratification for the President to ``accelerate'' U.S. \nstrategic force reductions so they can be achieved before December 31, \n2012. We should aim to accomplish this by the end of 2007.\n  We should also seek to dismantle the 4,000 or so warheads that will \nbe removed from launchers--not just put them in storage. Otherwise, \nthis treaty is more of a nuclear ``shell game'' than a true disarmament \nmeasure. Warheads taken off missiles today could be put back tomorrow.\n  We should begin new discussions to reach new lower levels of \nstrategic nuclear weapons. I strongly support the Resolution of \nRatification's call for the President to continue reductions in \nstrategic nuclear warheads. President Putin wanted each side to \ndecrease to levels of 1,500 warheads. There isn't any reason we can't \nreduce to levels of 1,000 to 1,500 in the next 5 to 10 years.\n  There are other problems relating to tactical nuclear weapons and \ntransparency and security of nuclear arsenals that need to be addressed \nand that many have touched upon today. The Senate needs to be active in \naddressing these questions. I look forward to seeing the reports \nrequired by the Resolution of Ratification so we can monitor the \nprogress of the treaty and act accordingly.\n  We have waited too long for this treaty. We cannot let the long \nimplementation time of the treaty sweep these important questions from \nour agenda for the next 10 years.\n  With the assumption that the Senate will remain active on these \nquestions and the administration will follow through with the \nprovisions of the Resolution of Ratification, I give my reluctant \nadvice and consent to this treaty and look back and see how much more \nwe could have accomplished. Nevertheless, let's get on with what we \nhave in front of us and start reducing the size of the nuclear forces \nout there.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor just to \ngive our colleagues a brief report on the status with regard to \namendments to the treaty legislation. Senator Byrd has indicated he \nwishes to offer an amendment. Senator Conrad has an amendment. Senator \nFeingold may have an amendment. We are trying to verify whether he \nstill intends to offer it. And then Senator Levin has an amendment.\n  I had indicated to the distinguished majority leader that we felt we \ncould accommodate these amendments today and vote on final passage \ntonight. He has indicated that if that were the case there would be no \nvotes tomorrow.\n\n  I hope our colleagues can accommodate that schedule to come over and \noffer their amendments, and perhaps we can even agree to a timeframe \nwithin which these amendments can be considered. We have been in a \nquorum call now for about an hour. Obviously, if we want to finish at a \nreasonable hour today, it would be very helpful if our colleagues could \ncome to the floor to offer their amendments. We will have to do it \nsometime today. It seems to me the sooner we get on with this debate, \nthe sooner we can offer those amendments and the sooner we can complete \nour work and do so in a way that will accommodate other schedules which \nI know Senators have tonight and tomorrow.\n  I make that report. I make that plea. I hope our colleagues can allow \nus to finish our work on this legislation so that we can move on to \nother matters.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader \nfor his thoughtful comments. I encourage amendments to be offered as \nsoon as possible and that we be prepared to debate those amendments and \nwork with both leaders to finalize actions on the Moscow Treaty today. \nI appreciate very much the specific amendments that are out there. I \nhope we can identify those amendments and work with the offerers of the \namendments.\n  Mr. President, while I have the floor, I would simply indicate that \nthe Moscow Treaty before the Senate today is very important for several \nreasons. Some of these were outlined by Senator Biden, myself, and \nothers yesterday.\n  But let me reiterate the fact that this treaty arose from a very \nimportant meeting that President Bush had with President Putin of \nRussia last May. During the course of that time, both leaders \nidentified the fact that both countries were in the process of thinking \nthrough how to reduce the number of nuclear warheads that are still on \nmissiles aimed at each other. These leaders identified thousands of \nsuch warheads and the dangers of leaving things where they were. Our \nPresident has indicated that he had already reached a determination \nwith his advisers. It would be in our best interests, if necessary, to \nunilaterally change our situation; that is, to think through carefully \nhow many warheads the United States needs to defend itself against all \npotential adversaries and to move to that number. That would save a \ngreat deal of expense for the taxpayers in perpetuity--every year that \nthese warheads were no longer required. Furthermore, and more \nobviously, it would relieve the anxiety of people all over the world \nwho see the cold war still manifested in a very large number of nuclear \nweapons on missiles that could convey them.\n  The Russians have had the same idea. They have budget stringencies \nthat are much more severe than our own. Therefore, the two leaders came \nto a conclusion that an agreement was useful, and, furthermore, it \nwould illustrate what both characterized as a new relationship between \nRussia and the United States in a very visible and tangible way.\n  Some advisers of both President Bush and President Putin may have \nbelieved all of this might be done without a treaty; that is, both \ncountries simply taking action would seem to be in the self-interest of \nthe two countries. Others clearly believed it would be best to codify \nthis in as simple an agreement as possible. The Moscow Treaty was the \nproduct of that effort. It is a short treaty, as many have pointed out.\n  As I mentioned yesterday, many of the critics believe it is far too \nshort;\n\n[[Page S3221]]\n\nthat it should have covered a great number of areas in much greater \ndetail, including verification procedures and a number of aspects that \nhave been part and parcel of previous arms control agreements between \nRussia and the United States, and/or the United States and other \nparties. Nevertheless, the treaty that was adopted does speak clearly \nto the aim by the year 2012. Both of our countries will, in fact, have \nreduced the number of warheads that are viable vehicles of destruction \nfrom a level of roughly 6,000 apiece now to somewhere in the 1,700-to-\n2,200 range.\n  We will do this on our own schedules, and we will have the protocols \nof START before us through 2009 and the cooperative threat reduction \nactivity--at least the very visible form of cooperative activity and \nverification--through that means.\n  I mention all of that because some Senators have asked both on the \nfloor and off the floor, Is this important to President Bush now? Why \nis the Moscow Treaty coming up at this particular moment?\n\n  I would respond to those questions by saying from the very first \nmeeting the President had with Senator Biden, then-chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, and me, he encouraged us to move as \nrapidly as prudent. And we have done so. We pledged to the President \nthat day that hearings would be held. In fact, they were held last \nyear. They were extensive. We have mentioned that hearings were held \nalso in the Armed Services Committee and there were behind-closed-door \nhearings in the Intelligence Committee, and that both of the other \ncommittees shared with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee the \nproduct of those hearings.\n  Senators have been on the floor of the Senate as members of those \ncommittees and have already testified to the efficacy and the \nimportance of the treaty.\n  This is the first period of time available on the calendar of the \nSenate. The majority leader has given this time to our committee with \nthe full cooperation of Senator Daschle and Democratic leaders of the \nSenate. I treasure that fact because I think it is important and it is \nkeeping the faith not only with our President but with the relationship \nthat our President and President Putin have been attempting to forge.\n  I would simply point out that we have just concluded in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee another extensive hearing on North Korea. \nThere we talked about the importance of a relationship between Russia \nand the United States. That is a very important relationship. The \nUnited States is counting upon Russian friends to be forthcoming with \nregard to their understanding of the risks that are involved in the \nKorean peninsula, the risk to Russia, the risk to the United States, \nand the risk with regard to nuclear weapons throughout the world in \nwhich Russia and the United States have perhaps the greatest \nresponsibility and the greatest stake.\n  The Moscow Treaty is timely with regard to dialog and diplomacy with \nthe United States and Russia with regard to North Korea. Many hope it \nmay be relevant still with regard to our dialog on the question of Iraq \nand Resolution 1441 at the United Nations or its successor.\n  I mention those aspects not with prediction but simply with the \nrelevancy and the timeliness of this debate. I think it is important \nfor us to proceed, if we can, to have a successful conclusion of the \ndebate and a vote on the Moscow Treaty today.\n  The distinguished Democratic leader has indicated that he perceives \nthis as in the best interests of the Senate. I know our leader feels \nthe same. I simply invite Senators to come to the floor to come forward \nwith their amendments, and we will try to proceed.\n  I finally add, both Senator Biden and I indicated yesterday it would \nbe our hope that amendments would not be adopted to the text of the \ntreaty or its annexes at this point. We believe passage by the Duma, as \nwell as passage by the Senate, in a timely manner is very important.\n  We understand there are many Senators who wish the treaty had been \nlonger, more extensive, more intrusive with regard to Russian \nprocedures as well as our own, but we have attempted to achieve a great \ndeal. We have much further to go as we negotiate with our Russian \nfriends. Therefore, I hope Senators will not call for bridges that are \ntoo far on this treaty and thus jeopardize both its passage here and \nits implementation by both countries.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 252\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a few moments, I will send an amendment \nto the desk. Before I do so, I will make some general comments on the \nMoscow Treaty which is before the Senate.\n  I first wish to congratulate and commend our good friends from \nIndiana and Delaware for their great work on this treaty. As on so many \nother issues, they have worked together well in the national interest. \nThe document which is before us, as well as the Resolution of \nRatification, represents a lot of significant work on their part. I \napplaud them for it.\n  The treaty before us is a modest but a positive step in the United \nStates-Russia relationship. It is particularly important we have this \ntreaty. At some point it was suggested the agreement not be in the form \nof a treaty. As a matter of fact, the administration finally decided--I \nthink wisely so, and I believe with the support of the chairman and \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee--that we have a \nlegally binding treaty rather than relying on unilateral steps that are \nnot binding on future administrations and can be easily changed.\n  Having a treaty ensures that the Senate is going to be able to \nfulfill its constitutional role, giving due consideration of any treaty \nand providing advice and consent before ratification.\n  I view this treaty as a starting point for further nuclear arms \nreductions and a useful boost to our new and developing and evolving \nrelationship with Russia. There is much more work to be done to \ncontinue to improve our mutual security with Russia, and that work \nincludes further reducing our reliance on nuclear weapons, reducing \nnuclear proliferation dangers, and improving confidence, transparency, \nand cooperation with Russia on nuclear weapon matters.\n  This treaty, while important, is also somewhat unusual. Its central \nobligation is that both nations will reduce their operationally \ndeployed strategic nuclear warheads to a level between\n\n[[Page S3222]]\n\n1,700 and 2,200 some 10 years from now. There are no gradual steps. It \nis just at a moment in time, 10 years from now, that level of between \n1,700 and 2,200 must be reached. It could be a reduction in the \noperationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads for a very brief \nperiod, providing 10 years from the date of ratification that level is \nreached, and then the treaty expires.\n  Contrary to numerous media reports, this treaty does not require \nreductions in nuclear warhead stockpiles or delivery systems. In fact, \nit does not require the elimination of a single warhead. Under this \ntreaty, both sides can simply remove warheads from land-based or \nsubmarine-based missiles and from bombers. Both sides are free to keep \nevery warhead so removed and to store these warheads indefinitely for \npossible redeployment. The only limitations that will bind the United \nStates and Russia are the limitations on nuclear weapon delivery \nsystems under START I, and that is at least until 2009.\n  After December 5, 2009, when the START I treaty is scheduled to \nexpire, it is not clear what will happen. At least in the case of START \nI, the delivery systems must be destroyed.\n  As the Senate fulfills its constitutionally mandated role in the \ntreaty process and considers whether to provide its advice and consent \nto the ratification of the Moscow Treaty, there are a number of \nquestions about the proper role of the Senate in the treaty-making \nprocess. These are questions to which I know our managers--our chairman \nand ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee--have given a \ngreat deal of time, attention, and thought, and many others in the \nSenate have as well.\n\n  Some of these questions are as follows:\n  Do we want to agree to ratify a treaty if the executive branch does \nnot clearly commit itself to submitting a substantive change in that \ntreaty as an amendment to the Senate for its advice and consent? And do \nwe want to approve a treaty where there is doubt that the executive \nbranch could extend or withdraw from the treaty without even notifying \nor consulting with the Senate, without that guarantee, that commitment \nbeing written into a Resolution of Ratification?\n  These are highly significant questions that apply to the treaty-\nmaking power and to the advice and consent power of the United States. \nI want to address those issues in the amendments that I have to offer \nthis afternoon.\n  The first amendment deals specifically with the question of whether \nthe Resolution of Ratification should provide that the Senate must be \nnotified and consulted prior to the withdrawal from that treaty or the \nagreement to extend that treaty by the President of the United States.\n  Article 4, paragraph 2 of the treaty states that this treaty shall \nremain in force until December 31, 2012, and may be extended by \nagreement of the parties or superseded earlier by a subsequent \nagreement.\n  Paragraph 3 of article 4 states:\n\n       Each Party, in exercising its national sovereignty, may \n     withdraw from this Treaty upon three months written notice to \n     the other Party.\n\n  These are somewhat unusual provisions, as are the administration's \nstatements about them. Previously, extending a treaty was considered \nsomething that would require Senate advice and consent.\n  In the seminal study written in 2001 by the Congressional Research \nService for the Foreign Relations Committee called ``Treaties and Other \nInternational Agreements: The Role of the United States Senate,'' the \nissue of extending treaties is clearly presented:\n\n       Modifying and extending an international agreement amount \n     to the making of a new agreement that should be done by the \n     same method as the original agreement. For treaties, this \n     means with the advice and the consent of the Senate.\n\n  In its article-by-article analysis of the Moscow Treaty, the \nadministration asserts that ``Extension of the Treaty is not automatic \nand must be done by agreement of the parties.''\n  The article-by-article analysis continues, with the administration \nwriting:\n\n       Since such an extension is authorized by Treaty, it would \n     constitute an agreement pursuant to the Treaty and would \n     accordingly not be subject to Senate advice and consent.\n\n  That is the extension issue.\n  On the matter of treaty withdrawal, the administration's article-by-\narticle analysis states:\n       Unlike some other arms control agreements, this withdrawal \n     clause is not tied to a party's determination that \n     extraordinary circumstances jeopardizing its supreme national \n     interests exist. Rather, the Moscow Treaty includes a more \n     general formulation that allows greater flexibility for each \n     party to respond to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n  So the withdrawal clause permits either party to withdraw from the \ntreaty for any reason short of a supreme national interest.\n  The Resolution of Ratification addresses this issue of withdrawal or \nextension with a declaration numbered 6, which:\n\n       Urges the President to consult with the Senate prior to \n     taking actions relevant to paragraphs 2 or 3 of article IV of \n     the treaty.\n\n  So the resolution before us, and before my amendment is considered, \nsimply urges the President--it is precatory language that says, Mr. \nPresident, we urge you, whether it is you or your successor, to consult \nwith the Senate prior to taking the actions relevant to paragraphs 2 or \n3, the extension or the withdrawal from a treaty.\n  The declaration urges the President to consult with the Senate, but \nit does not protect the interests of the Senate because it is not \nbinding. A President--this President or his successor--could simply \ndecide to extend or withdraw from this treaty without notice or \nconsultation with the Senate.\n  The U.S. should not either enter into a treaty or withdraw from a \ntreaty lightly and either action--either entering into a treaty, \nwithdrawing from a treaty, or extending a treaty's operations--should \nbe done only with the involvement of the Senate. We have to give our \nadvice and consent to permit ratification in the first place.\n  We, the Members of this Senate, have the responsibility to assure \nthat involvement. That constitutional responsibility rests in our \nhands, and we should not leave that constitutional mandate and \nresponsibility up to the discretion of the executive branch. We want \nthe executive branch to consult, and we are going to urge them to \nconsult in a Resolution of Ratification. The question is whether we are \ngoing to require that resolution. Barring some circumstances, which I \nwill describe in a minute, we are going to require a chief executive to \nconsult with this body, to give us notice, and to consult, not to seek \nratification--that is a second-degree amendment which my friend from \nWisconsin will be offering in a moment--but the proposal in my \namendment is that we simply require there be notice and consultation of \nthe Senate before there is withdrawal from a treaty which we have \nratified, or extension of a treaty which we have ratified. That is the \nleast we can do. That is a middle course, short of saying we have to \nratify an extension or withdrawal, which I think is also an appropriate \ncourse of action which has been much debated over the years. Short of \nthat, which it seems to me is a matter which is going to be of some \ndebate between the executive and legislative branch, I think a middle \ncourse, which we all ought to be able to agree upon, is that a \nResolution of Ratification require there be notice to the Senate so we \ncan exercise whatever action we decide to take at that point--no \nguarantee that we would have to ratify it before it actually occurs but \nassurance we will be given notice and an opportunity to give our \nadvice, or take whatever action we want, prior to the withdrawal from a \ntreaty or prior to the life of the treaty being extended.\n  The amendment I am going to be offering is very straightforward. I do \nnot know if this amendment is at the desk. If not, I will send it on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Feingold, and Senator Akaka, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, and Mr. Akaka, proposes an amendment numbered 252.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S3223]]\n\n   (Purpose: To provide an additional condition requiring notice and \n  consultations prior to withdrawal from, or extension of, the Treaty)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following new condition:\n       (3) Notice and consultations prior to withdrawal or \n     extension.--(A) Prior to taking any action relevant to \n     paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article IV of the Treaty, and except as \n     provided in subparagraph (B), the President shall--\n       (i) provide not less than 60 days advance notice of such \n     action to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and\n       (ii) consult with the Senate on such action.\n       (B) The President may waive a requirement in subparagraph \n     (A) if the President--\n       (i) determines that national security needs prevent the \n     President from meeting the requirement; and\n       (ii) submits to the committees of the Senate referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) a written notice of the waiver, including a \n     description of the national security needs and the reasons \n     justifying the waiver.\n       In section 3, strike declaration (6).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will explain it at this point. This amendment is \nstraightforward. It says that prior to taking any action to extend or \nwithdraw from this treaty, the President shall provide not less than 60 \ndays' notice to the Senate and shall consult with the Senate.\n  Now, what happens if there is some national security need which \nprevents the President from providing such notice or consultation? The \namendment foresees that possibility and has a waiver provision in case \nthere is some unforeseen national security need that would prevent the \nPresident from immediately requiring to notify and consult with the \nSenate. So there is considerable flexibility given to the President if \nit is needed for national security reasons.\n  There has been a lot written about whether or not the Senate must \nactually ratify a withdrawal from a treaty. There has been much debate \non that subject. In a Congressional Research treatise on treaties, \nwritten in 1993 and then republished more recently with the same \nlanguage, this is what the Research Service says about the issue of \nwithdrawal from a treaty and the Senate role in that process, that the \nU.S. Constitution is silent with respect to the power to terminate \ntreaties. The matter is not discussed in the debates of the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Briefly:\n\n       While the Constitution tells us who can make treaties, the \n     President shall have the power, by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, to make treaties.\n\n  It does not say who can unmake them. As a consequence of the \nConstitution's silence in this regard, there has been some confusion of \ndoctrine upon this point and a variety in practice.\n  A little later on in this study, the Congressional Research Service \nsays the same: Whether the President alone can terminate a treaty's \ndomestic effect remains an open question. As a practical matter, \nhowever, the President may exercise this power since the courts have \nheld that they are conclusively bound by an executive determination \nwith regard to whether a treaty is still in effect. The same result may \napply to a congressional termination, particularly if it is regarded as \na declaration of war.\n  So according to the Congressional Research Service, the issue of \nwhether the President alone can terminate a treaty is an open question. \nThis amendment does not intend to resolve that question. A second-\ndegree amendment, however, will be offered which will address that \nissue. My amendment does not. My amendment simply says--and it seems to \nme this is a very modest amount of protection for the Senate's \nconstitutional responsibility in the treaty-making process--unless \nthere is some national security reason why you cannot give notice to \nthe Senate that you are intending to withdraw or extend the treaty, \ngive us 60 days' notice so we can take whatever action we deem is \nappropriate, so we can give consultation and advice on the question of \nwithdrawal or extension. It does not prevent the administration from \nextending or withdrawing from the treaty. It does not--``it'' being my \namendment--require Senate approval of extension, even though that is \nthe policy and practice to date often as elaborated by that study.\n  It does not require Senate approval of withdrawal from a treaty. It \nsimply says the President shall notify and consult with the Senate \nbefore extending or withdrawing from the treaty.\n  This amendment is consistent with what the Foreign Relations \nCommittee wrote in its report about the treaty relative to the issue of \nconsultation on arms control treaties. It is a very thorough report. \nThe committee that we have before us, on page 22, says the following:\n\n       The Senate and this committee have an institutional \n     interest in the close observation of arms control \n     negotiations and the successful implementation of resulting \n     agreements. Past administrations have recognized that \n     consultations with the Senate prior to taking actions \n     relating to assigning, amending, or withdrawing from such \n     agreements may avert serious disagreements.\n\n  On the specific question of withdrawal, the committee report says: \nShould it become necessary for a party to withdraw from the treaty, \narticle 4 provides for 3 months' notice of such a decision. Events can \nwell occur between submissions of the annual report required in \ncondition 2 that would warrant informing and consulting with the \nSenate. In any circumstance, the Senate would desire notification and \nconsultation.\n  So the parties, the two countries involved, must give each other 3 \nmonths' notice prior to the withdrawal. But relative to the Senate, the \nreport simply says the Senate would desire notification and \nconsultation.\n  I could not agree more with that statement: ``desire.'' But it is not \nenough to say we desire a consultation. If we are going to protect the \nconstitutional responsibilities of this body, we must assure our \nconstitutional responsibility and the operation of treaties is going to \nbe protected and our role under the Constitution is, in fact, honored--\nnot just honored in the breach but in the actual life of the treaty. I \nbelieve this is the minimum we should do.\n  We should write into our Resolution of Ratification a requirement in \nthe absence of some national security reason that the President, \nwhoever the President might be at the time, do give us the notice and \ngive us the opportunity to take whatever action or consult as we deem \nmight be appropriate relative to the issue of withdrawal or extension \nof this treaty prior to the administration making that decision giving \nthat notice to the other party to this treaty.\n  The amendment is consistent with what the administration says it is \nwilling to do. Secretary Powell stated: While it is the President who \nwithdraws from treaties, the administration intends to discuss any need \nto withdraw from the treaty with the Congress, to include the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, prior to announcing any such action.\n  That is a welcome statement of intent. We should incorporate that \nassurance. We should enshrine that assurance. We should embody that \nassurance. Intentions and administrations change. The obligation of \nthis body to the Constitution endures. It is a solemn responsibility. \nIt does not change. The intention of the President or a new President \nwith new intentions changes. Language of the Constitution, relative to \nwhat this body's responsibility is relevant to treaties, is unchanging.\n  This amendment simply requires notification and consultation which \nSecretary Powell and the committee indicate they want and would expect \nwould happen. It simply assures that, in fact, in the absence of some \nnational security need, which is unexpected, which would permit a \nwaiver of the notice requiring that a President would notify this body \nbefore withdrawal or extension of a treaty would occur.\n  The committee report concludes that: Declaration (6), while not \nbinding on the President, is a formal request that the executive branch \nmaintain the consultation policy enunciated in the Secretary of State's \nanswer to the question--which I gave above that the administration \nintends to discuss. That is what the committee report says Declaration \n(6) provides, which is in the Resolution of Ratification. It is a \nrequest to the executive branch. That is not strong enough in terms of \nour obligations to the Constitution and to our responsibility relative \nto the treaty-making power.\n  If we want to really assure what we are requesting is, in fact, part \nof the operation of this treaty, we should include in this Resolution \nof Ratification a condition which my amendment offers, which is that \nthe President would\n\n[[Page S3224]]\n\ndo what the committee said it really wants and really desires and \nreally urges, to use the words of the report, and that is to notify, \nconsult with the Senate prior to taking action to withdraw from or \nextend a treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 253 to Amendment No. 252\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I compliment the Senator from Michigan for his \ntremendous leadership on this issue.\n  I rise today to add my thoughts to the debate on the first arms \ncontrol treaty between the United States and Russia during the 21st \ncentury, and to offer an amendment that will reaffirm the role of the \nSenate in the treaty extension and withdrawal process.\n  When the Senate adopts this resolution of ratification, as I expect \nthat it will be a wide margin, the Moscow Treaty will be on its way to \nbecoming the law of the land, and the Senate will have fulfilled its \nconstitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent to its \nratification.\n  As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I believe that we \ncovered a lot of ground in the series of hearings that the Committee \nhad to examine this brief, 3-page document last year, and that we \nexplored a number of the concerns that I and a number of members of the \nCommittee and of the Senate have regarding the issues of compliance and \nverification, the lack of a timetable for the reductions required by \nthe treaty, the fact that this treaty does not require that any nuclear \nwarheads actually be destroyed, and a number of other important issues.\n  I continue to be troubled by the language contained in article IV of \nthe Moscow Treaty regarding the process by which one of the Parties may \nwithdraw from this treaty. I am concerned that either of the Parties \nwould be able to withdraw with only 3 months' written notice and \nwithout a reason. And unlike other arms control treaties, the Moscow \nTreaty does not require that the Parties cite ``supreme national \ninterest'' upon announcing withdrawal. In fact, this concept is not \neven mentioned in article IV.\n  As my colleagues may recall, I found the President's decision to \nunilaterally withdraw the United States from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty last year troubling on both policy and constitutional \ngrounds. I discussed this issue at some length with Secretaries Powell \nand Rumsfeld during the Foreign Relations Committee's hearings on this \ntreaty last year, and I am troubled by the administration's contention \nthat consultation with and approval by the Senate would not be required \nto withdraw from the Moscow Treaty.\n  I agree with the Senator from Michigan. The Senate has a \nconstitutional role to play in treaty withdrawal, and I am concerned \nthat the administration is not taking seriously our role in this \nprocess.\n  While I recognize that Declaration (6) in the resolution before the \nSenate today urges the President to consult with this body prior to \nwithdrawing from the Moscow Treaty, I am concerned that there is no \nspecific requirement for such consultation.\n  So, Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk and I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 253 to amendment No. 252.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                   (Purpose: To modify the condition)\n\n       At the end of the proposed condition, add the following:\n       (C) Prior to taking any action relevant to paragraphs 2 or \n     3 of Article IV of the Treaty, the President shall obtain the \n     approval of two thirds of the Senators present.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the second-degree amendment that I offer \ntoday would add to the underlying Levin amendment a provision that \nwould require the President to obtain the approval of two-thirds of the \nSenate before withdrawing from or extending this treaty.\n  Mr. President, Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution states that \nthe President ``shall have the Power, by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided that two thirds of \nthe Senators present concur. . . .''\n  The Senator from Michigan pointed out in his remarks that the \nConstitution is silent on the process by which the United States can \nwithdraw from a treaty, and the record in the Congress and the \nexecutive branch is mixed. However, I believe and I think many others \nbelieve the intent of the Framers as explained by Thomas Jefferson is \nclear. In section 52 of Jefferson's Manual, he writes:\n\n       Treaties are legislative acts. A treaty is the law of the \n     land. It differs from other laws only as it must have the \n     consent of a foreign nation, being but a contract with \n     respect to that nation.\n\n  Article II, Section 3 of the Constitution states that the President \nshall:\n\n       take Care that the laws be faithfully executed. . . .\n\n  Jefferson continues:\n\n       Treaties being declared, equally with the laws of the \n     United States, to be the supreme law of the land, it is \n     understood that an act of the legislature alone can declare \n     them infringed and rescinded. This was accordingly the \n     process adopted in the case of France in 1798.\n\n  It is worth noting, that four signers of the Constitution were \nserving in Congress when this first treaty termination occurred--by an \nAct of Congress--in 1798, just 11 years after the Constitutional \nConvention.\n  It is clear to me, as it was to Thomas Jefferson, that the Senate has \na constitutional role to play in terminating treaties. Since the advice \nand consent of the Senate is required to enter into a treaty, this body \nshould at a minimum be consulted before the President makes the \ndecision to withdraw this country from a treaty, and especially from a \ntreaty of this magnitude.\n  As Jefferson noted, a treaty is equal with a law. A law cannot be \ndeclared to be repealed by the President alone. Only an Act of Congress \ncan repeal a law. Action by the Senate or the Congress should be \nrequired to terminate a treaty. Anything less could tip the scale \ndangerously in favor of the executive branch.\n  That said, I recognize it is unlikely that my amendment would be \nadopted, or that the President would agree to move forward with this \nprocess if my amendment were included in this resolution of \nratification, but I very much thought we ought to make this point on \nthe floor of this body that is charged by the Constitution with this \nresponsibility. It is a responsibility which I believe was intended by \nthe Founders, that we act specifically with a two-thirds vote to \nwithdraw from a treaty.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 253 To Amendment No. 252, Withdrawn\n\n  In light of the reality here, I now withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret that this Treaty will move \nforward without a requirement for a Senate vote on its abrogation or \nextension, but I do express my support for the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, of which I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor. I also want to thank the Senator for his work on this \nimportant issue.\n  The Levin amendment is consistent with my view that the Senate \nshould--at a minimum--be consulted if the President decides to withdraw \nfrom or extend this treaty in the future. I believe that this is a step \nin the right direction, and I urge my colleagues to support the Levin \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Michigan. I do so reluctantly \nbecause of my high regard for the Senator and his work on arms control, \nwhich has been indefatigable. His wisdom I respect.\n  As a rule, we are on the same side. I, however, wish to oppose the \namendment for the reasons I will relate in this testimony. I read, in \nmy opening statement yesterday, words that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee addressed to this issue in the Resolution of Ratification. \nThe Senator has referenced that fact.\n\n[[Page S3225]]\n\n  It was drafted by us in an attempt to address concerns put forward by \nthe Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Wisconsin, and others \nregarding the treaty's withdrawal clause contained in article 4.\n  Our text is based on Secretary Powell's commitment to consult with \nthe Senate should the President consider the utilization of the \nwithdrawal provision.\n  It is worth repeating, especially in light of the amendment offered \ntoday, the answer Secretary Powell submitted for the record on the \nissue of treaty withdrawal. The Foreign Relations Committee asked the \nSecretary:\n\n       What role will the Congress have in any decision to \n     withdraw from this treaty?\n       Will the administration agree to at least consult closely \n     with this committee--\n\n  That is the Foreign Relations Committee--\n\n       before making any such decision?\n\n  The Secretary responded:\n\n       While it is the President who withdraws from treaties, the \n     administration intends to discuss any need to withdraw from \n     the treaty with the Congress, to include the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee prior to announcing any such action.\n\n  This was a carefully considered answer of Secretary Powell for the \nrecord.\n  Past Senate consideration of this issue has resulted in the view that \none of the bases on which a President may terminate a treaty without \ncongressional participation is when a decision to withdraw is taken in \nconformity with the provisions of the treaty. The Moscow Treaty, as it \nstands, provides for this.\n  I am aware of Senators' concerns and arguments about the need to \ninsert the Senate into the process. Many of the arguments we have heard \nabout withdrawal stem from President Bush's decision to withdraw from \nthe ABM Treaty. That decision was taken in full compliance with the \nterms of the ABM Treaty. The President made no secret about his desire \nto do so, and Congress held innumerable hearings and public statements \nabout the need to take the action.\n  I am sympathetic to arguments from Senators regarding the need to \nmaintain Senate prerogatives. The process governing termination and \nwithdrawal is a point of constitutional debate. Although the \nConstitution assigns a specific role for the Senate in the treaty \nratification process, it is silent on the issue of treaty termination. \nFurthermore, nothing in the Constitution restricts the President from \nterminating or withdrawing from a treaty on his own authority.\n  Presidents have consistently terminated advice and consent treaties \non their own authority since 1980. Twenty-three of the thirty treaties \nterminated during this period were bilateral; seven of these treaties \nwere multilateral, all of them terminated by the President.\n  Prior to 1980, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona challenged \nPresident Carter's termination of the Mutual Defense Treaty with \nTaiwan. Senator Goldwater's challenge failed and the treaty was \nterminated.\n  The White House legal adviser has long argued that the President is \nthe principal spokesman of the Nation in foreign affairs, and \nrestrictions on that power have been strictly construed. Given the \nabsence of a textual basis conferring the termination power on another \nbranch or an established practice derogating from the President's \ntermination power, it is difficult to envision such a role for the \nSenate.\n  Proponents of a senatorial role in this process will often respond by \nsuggesting that the President cannot, on his own authority, terminate a \ntreaty because it is the law of the land. Again, the White House \nsuggests this is a fallacy. A terminated treaty no longer has effect in \nmuch the same way that a provision of a law or treaty found by the \ncourts to be unconstitutional no longer has effect. However, in neither \ncase is the law repealed.\n  Historically, there is evidence of only one instance in which the \nSenate sought by a resolution of advice and consent to limit the \nPresident's constitutional power to terminate a treaty. The first \ncondition to the 1919 proposed resolution of advice and consent to \nratification of the Versailles Treaty would have provided:\n\n       Notice of withdrawal by the United States may be given by a \n     concurrent resolution of the Congress of the United States.\n\n  On that occasion, the Vice President of the United States, Thomas \nMarshall, addressing the Senate before the vote, called the condition \nan unconstitutional limitation on the President's powers, a view with \nwhich a number of leading scholars of the day concurred. The resolution \nfailed to receive the required two-thirds vote and the question has \nremained moot for the better part of a century--I might say, until \ntoday.\n  Beyond the legal issues that underlie this debate, some have \nexpressed concern that article 4 differs from previous arms control \nagreements in that it only requires 3 months' notice and permits \nwithdrawal based upon issues related to national sovereignty. Critics \npoint out the START treaty allows the parties to withdraw after giving \n6 months' notice, and only ``if it decides that extraordinary events \nrelated to the subject of this Treaty have jeopardized its supreme \ninterest.''\n  The withdrawal clause is reflective of the changed nature of our \nrelationship with Russia, not a desire to rob the Senate of its role in \nthe treaty-making process. As the administration's article-by-article \nanalysis sent to the Senate with the treaty states--this is the \nanalysis by the administration as it submits the treaty:\n\n       Unlike some other arms control agreements, the withdrawal \n     clause is not tied to a Party's determination that \n     extraordinary circumstances jeopardizing its supreme national \n     interests exist. Rather, the Moscow Treaty includes a more \n     general formulation that allows greater flexibility for each \n     Party to respond to unforeseen circumstances.\n\n  Indeed, as we have related in this debate, the Moscow Treaty arose \nfrom a desire on the part of the United States unilaterally to destroy \nits nuclear weapons and likewise a similar desire by the Russians. \nFinding these coincident interests, they have joined in this treaty; \nnevertheless, there is no timetable. Some critics have pointed out that \nthe nature of this treaty is substantially different. It is one that \ncomes from the volition of the two without specific verification \nprocedures.\n  I do not view the withdrawal provisions as a weakness in the treaty. \nInstead, I believe it is another manifestation of the improved U.S.-\nRussian relationship. It should also be pointed out that our bilateral \nrelationship provides us with some confidence that the time and reasons \nfor withdrawal would not necessarily relate to the agreement. As the \nSecretary of State told the Committee: ``The Moscow Treaty's \nformulation for withdrawal reflects the likelihood that a decision to \nwithdraw would be prompted by causes unrelated either to the Treaty or \nto our bilateral relationship. We believe this formulation more \nappropriately reflects our much-improved strategic relationship with \nRussia.''\n  In sum Mr. President, I was hopeful that our resolution of \nratification would have resolved this issue. For the benefit of the \nSenate let me again read the text of our resolution of ratification.\n\n       Given the Senate's continuing interest in the Treaty and in \n     continuing strategic offensive reductions to the lowest \n     possible levels consistent with national security \n     requirements and alliance obligations of the United States, \n     the Senate urges the President to consult with the Senate \n     prior to taking actions relevant to paragraphs 2 or 3 or \n     Article IV of the Treaty.\n\n  This text was negotiated closely with Administration officials with \nthe goal of striking a compromise that would preserve Senate \nprerogatives while not infringing upon the power provided to the \nPresident by the Constitution. I believe we succeeded in doing so.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the amendment, and I urge my colleagues \nto do so as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, let me begin by saying I agree with the \nSenator from Michigan as well as my colleague from Wisconsin in that I \nbelieve--and, as the old joke goes, I have history to prove it--that \nthe Senate has in the treaty power in the treaty clause of the U.S. \nConstitution an equal responsibility with the President of the United \nStates.\n  As the old joke goes, if you want to learn a subject, teach it. For \nthe last 10 years, I have been teaching a three-credit course at the \nWidener University Law School on Saturday mornings on separation of \npowers issues. In one of\n\n[[Page S3226]]\n\nthe three parts of the course, ``What is treaty power? And who has what \nauthority under the Constitution?'' I come down clearly on the side \nthat the Senate has the authority to insist that any extension, or \nwithdrawal, for that matter, from a treaty be confirmed by the Senate. \nWe have a right to do that, I believe. But it is an open constitutional \nquestion.\n  I will, unless we are ready to go to a second amendment, be happy to \ntake a few minutes and go through what I believe to be constitutional \nlaw and history on this point.\n  Let me cut through that for a moment and go to the place where I \nthink it is not worth the fight on this particular treaty. I believe \nthis treaty is so open ended and so, in some sense, amorphous and rests \nso much upon not merely the goodwill--I assume goodwill on the part of \nthe administration--but on the intensity with which the administration \nbelieves this treaty should come to fruition that a provision that \nmarginally increases the substance of the possibility of a substantive \noutcome which I support--which is getting down to 1,700 or below \n2,200--that to jeopardize this treaty that rests on an awful lot on \ngood faith over a genuinely serious constitutional fight which I think \nsomeday has to be resolved, that it is not worth the candle on this \ntreaty and may in fact in turn, if we were to prevail--and I don't \nthink we have the votes to prevail, but if we did prevail on this--\nwould be sufficient in my view for this administration to not pursue \nthrough the treaty mechanism this agreement.\n  I want to remind everybody, the administration made it clear from the \noutset that they did not want a treaty. They did not want to have to \ncome back to us with this treaty.\n  Because of the steadfastness of Senator Helms, we agreed on the \nprinciple that we would insist that any agreement--we knew it was being \nnegotiated in Moscow--be brought back before the Senate.\n  So my concern is that this agreement, which the administration \nunilaterally and bilaterally supports--that is, with the Russians or \nwithout the Russians, and they don't really much care what we think \nabout it anyway, whether it be in terms of a treaty--that they would be \nprepared to walk away from this over a genuine, legitimate, \nsignificant, constitutional issue and debate.\n  White House Counsel in this administration and in Democratic \nadministrations who have suggested that Senator Feingold, Senator \nLevin, and I are wrong about the prerogative of the Senate, I suggest, \nwould be inclined to say to the President: You are going to do this \nanyway unilaterally--that is, move down to these ranges--you have said \nyou are going to do it anyway; the treaty is so loose, it doesn't bind \nyou much at all anyway; forget the treaty; just proceed on this course, \nand don't sign onto this principle on this fight.\n  I was asked by the press how I could not be willing to go to the wall \non this issue since I was the guy who went to the wall that resulted in \nthe so-called Biden condition on interpretation of treaties, which was \ninitially added to the INF Treaty in 1988. There was a simple reason. \nThere was a lot more at stake in that treaty in terms of the \nsubstantive impact upon the strategic balance and doctrine. We also had \na circumstance where the administration very much wanted that treaty. \nAnd it was an opportunity to set in law, in principle, the principles \nof treaty interpretation.\n\n  So it was worth the fight, the stakes were high enough, and the \nadministration was not likely to reject the underlying treaty if it \npassed, which it did. That is the practical distinction I would make.\n  But let me speak just another 5 minutes or so to the constitutional \nside of this argument. Although it is not specified in the \nConstitution, I believe there is a concurrent power both the President \nand the Senate have; and that is, the power with regard to the \ntermination of a treaty.\n  Our history for over 200 years of practice is, though, decidedly \nmixed. At various times in our history, the Congress has directed or \nauthorized the President to terminate a treaty.\n  On a few occasions, the Senate alone has done that, terminated a \ntreaty. The President has terminated a treaty without prior \ncongressional authorization but then received subsequent approval by \nthe Congress and the Senate. And the President has terminated treaties \nunilaterally.\n  For example, Presidents have done so with several commercial treaties \nin the first half of the 20th century. President Lyndon Johnson gave \nnotice of his intent to have the United States withdraw from a \nmultilateral treaty on international aviation known as the Warsaw \nConvention. Although this notice was subsequently withdrawn, the \nForeign Relations Committee held hearings on the treaty at issue, and \ndid not challenge President Johnson's power to withdraw from it.\n  More recently, President Carter unilaterally terminated the Mutual \nDefense Treaty with Taiwan in connection with diplomatic recognition of \nthe People's Republic of China. President Carter also gave notice of \nthe termination of several other treaties, most related to immigration. \nPresident Clinton withdrew from multilateral agreements, including our \nmembership in the United Nations's Industrial Development Organization.\n  The question of who has the power to terminate a treaty has never \nbeen definitively resolved by the Supreme Court. President Carter's \ndecision to terminate the Taiwan Treaty was challenged by several of \nour Republican colleagues, and that case reached the Supreme Court. The \nSupreme Court decision, though, does not provide much legal precedent, \nthough perhaps it gives us some guidance as to how the Court might rule \ntoday.\n  In Goldwater v. Carter--that was the case about withdrawing from the \nTaiwan Treaty, when we recognized the People's Republic of China--the \nSupreme Court vacated a decision of the Court of Appeals of the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, a decision which had affirmed the \nPresident's power to unilaterally terminate a treaty.\n  By vacating the lower court ruling, though, no legal precedent was \nleft to stand. The Supreme Court decision commanded no majority. Four \nJustices invoked what I know my colleagues on the floor and the \nPresiding Officer fully understand; they invoked what is called the \nPolitical Question Doctrine and thereby decreed the case not a matter \nfor the courts.\n  The fifth Justice held the case should not be before the Supreme \nCourt because it was not ripe for judicial review.\n  The only Justice who addressed the merits of the case, Justice \nBrennan, held for the President's power in that case because he thought \ntermination of the treaty with Taiwan was an act that necessarily \nflowed from the recognition of the People's Republic of China. He \nargued further that recognition power is clearly held by the President \nwithin the Constitution.\n  The leading scholarly authority on the subject, the Restatement of \nForeign Relations Law, of which the noted scholar, Columbia Law \nProfessor Lou Henkin was a chief reporter, states: ``The President has \nauthority unilaterally to suspend or terminate'' a treaty ``in \naccordance with its terms, or to make the determination that would \njustify . . . terminating or suspending an agreement because of its \nviolation by another party or because of supervening events.'' The \nRestatement concludes that this power of the President is based upon \nhis constitutional power to conduct foreign relations.''\n  The Restatement concedes, however, that the Senate has concurrent \nauthority, and it could circumscribe the President's power by \nconditioning its consent--which is what I understood in the withdrawn \namendment by my friend from Wisconsin--by conditioning its consent to \nthat treaty on a requirement that the termination clause only be \nexercised with the consent of the Senate, which I happen to think we \nhave the power to do as well.\n\n  But without turning this into a seminar--which all of my colleagues \nunderstand this full well; I am not educating anybody on this floor as \nto something they do not already know--without going into any more of \nit, I believe the Senate has concurrent power it could exercise.\n  I believe there will come a treaty which is of such consequence that \nthe Senate will determine it must exercise that power. But whether it \nis wise to do so as is done in the Levin-Feingold amendment is another \nmatter, in my view.\n\n[[Page S3227]]\n\n  In closing, I think Senators Levin and Feingold raise important legal \nand substantive concerns. I think it would prompt, in this case--\nbecause it goes, in a sense, beyond this treaty the precedent we would \nbe establishing--I think it would prompt--and obviously I don't know--\nstrong executive branch opposition, and all done at this point to make \na legal point. No matter how much I agree with it, it is to make a \nlegal point that does not substantively have much impact here. I think \nit is really better made for a treaty of more substance and consequence \nthan this one.\n  Let me make it real clear what I mean by that. I do not want to \nbelittle this treaty. I do not mean to imply it is of no value. But I \nthink, quite frankly, if we are to go to the point to take this to the \nwall, and we were to pass this amendment--and I realize it has been \nchanged now; it is not as consequential as both the Senators would have \nliked, because the Feingold provision has been withdrawn, and as much \nas I would like it if we were going to set down a principle here, I \nthink the consequence of its passage, if it resulted in this \nadministration walking away from this treaty, would do much more harm \nthan any possible good could be done by our adopting this amendment.\n  The point made by the chairman is we are no worse off \nconstitutionally on this unresolved, substantive issue because of the \nlanguage unanimously added in the committee. So essentially what we are \nsaying here--what I am saying here, and I think the chairman--and I am \nnot suggesting he should associate himself with my remarks as to what \nthe President's and the Senate's power is--but we are basically saying \nwe have agreed to fight this fight another day on another treaty at \nanother time.\n\n  How do you define in treaty language what ``consult'' means? In \ndeclaration 6, we use the term ``consult,'' but it needs much less \nspecificity there because it is even more vague. So I think you build \nin confusion, difficult to define, in even adding the Levin language.\n  This is an uncomfortable position for me to be in, both \nintellectually and politically, to be not supporting this amendment. I \nwant my colleagues to understand why. I want to make it clear, even \nthough I agreed with the chairman that I would not, as the ranking \nmember, support amendments beyond what we had agreed to in order to get \nthis done, I want to make it clear to my Democratic colleagues, I am \nnot in any way asking anyone to be bound by that. I am not trying to \nspeak for the Democrats on that issue. I am giving my best advice as to \nhow I think, for what it is worth, we can enhance the prospect that we \nreally will, through this treaty, accomplish a momentum that relates to \nreducing the number of nuclear weapons each side has at its disposal.\n  And ultimately, hopefully by the provisions we have in some of the \ndeclarations, we will not stop at this treaty. We will not stop at this \nmethodology. We will try to move on to everything, including tactical \nweapons at some point down the road.\n  That is my reasoning, for what it is worth. I am not going to support \neven the less constitutionally controversial provision of the Levin-\nFeingold amendment for the reasons I have stated.\n  I pledge to my colleagues, assuming I am around and assuming we have \nthe opportunity, God willing, to be able to establish this principle on \na really significant agreement that we make, a mutual agreement or \nmultilateral agreement with other parties in the world that promotes \neverything from arms reduction to our interest, this fight has to be \nmade at some point. I just don't think it is worth the candle on this \nat this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me thank my colleagues for their comments. Some of \nwhat they say frankly amazes me and startles me.\n  How the administration could possibly walk away from this treaty \nbecause a Resolution of Ratification contains the requirement that they \ngive us 60 days' notice before withdrawing, when in fact they say they \nare intending to give us that notice, amazes me. The administration has \nrepresented to the Senate by Secretary Powell that it is their \nintention to discuss any need to withdraw from the treaty with the \nCongress. That is their intention.\n  How it can be suggested they are going to walk away from a treaty \nwhich simply puts into our ratification resolution and embodies what \nthey intend to do, anyway, is a complete mystery to me. It raises the \nquestion, are they serious about that intention? Can't we take them \nseriously? Can't we assure ourselves that maybe the next \nadministration, because it might not have the same intention, should be \nbound by us? Do we have to leave this requirement to give notice of \nwithdrawal from a treaty up to the absolute discretion of an executive \nbranch? That is not protecting the constitutional role and requirement \nand obligation and responsibility of the Senate.\n  The question was raised by my dear friend from Delaware about what \nthe word ``consult'' means in the amendment. It means the same thing as \nin the language which the Foreign Relations Committee has given us. In \ndeclaration 6 of the resolution, it says the Senate urges the President \nto consult with the Senate. We define ``consult'' in the way the \nForeign Relations Committee defines it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The difference is the declaration is not binding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the important difference. But the word is the same \nword.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is the same word, but the need for precision in a \nnonbinding declaration is a lot less important, in a judicial sense, \nthan it is in a binding provision. That is the only point I was making.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The important fact is it is not binding.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is what it comes down to. This is not an issue as to \nwho has the power to withdraw from a treaty. Both the Senator from \nIndiana and the Senator from Delaware make arguments about that issue. \nThat is not resolved in this amendment. Both of their remarks address \nthat issue, as did my remarks. I am the first one to acknowledge that \nas a matter of fact the Constitution is silent with respect to the \npower to terminate treaties. That is the quote I used before that came \nfrom the Congressional Research Service. The Constitution is silent. \nThere has not been a resolution of this issue.\n  There is the Goldwater case that can be interpreted as the Senator \nfrom Delaware did. We do not resolve that issue in this amendment. This \namendment does not remove from the President, nor does it purport to \nremove from the President, the power to terminate or extend a treaty. \nThat issue is a major constitutional issue.\n  I cannot believe, and I did not hear that either of our colleagues \nsuggested, that there is a constitutional problem with my amendment \nbecause my amendment does not require the President to get the advice \nand consent of the Senate to withdraw from the treaty. My amendment \nsimply says: Before you exercise your right to withdraw, give 60 days' \nnotice to the Senate. I don't think there is the slightest \nconstitutional infirmity in simply providing what the President says he \nintends to do and what the committee says is desirable be done in the \nlanguage of the committee ratification resolution, that we urge a \nformal request that the executive branch consult with the Senate of the \nUnited States.\n  There is no constitutional issue with my amendment. With the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin's second-degree amendment, which has been withdrawn, \nthere was a very serious constitutional issue, one which we could spend \ndays on in the Senate, as to whether or not we can require in a \nratification resolution that the President obtain our consent to the \nwithdrawal from a treaty. That is a major, massive constitutional \nissue. That one has resonated around the country for a couple hundred \nyears. That was not going to be resolved in this Resolution of \nRatification. I hope some day it is resolved in a lengthy debate.\n  But what I am proposing is simply the most modest step to give some \nprotection to the obligation and responsibility of this institution \nrelative to treaty-making power, which is that we just be given notice, \n60 days' notice, and consultation prior to a decision of\n\n[[Page S3228]]\n\nthe President to withdraw from a treaty.\n  I have not heard today, and I don't believe that there is, a serious \nargument that my amendment raises constitutional issues. As a matter of \nfact, almost by definition, it cannot, since the President says he is \nintending to consult with us and since the committee says it is \ndesirable that he do so.\n  I have not heard that argument. Again, I don't believe it could be a \nserious argument, that we could simply not do what this amendment does, \nwhich is to require that there be 60 days' notice and consultation.\n  But how the suggestion could be made that the President would walk \naway from this treaty if the Resolution of Ratification contains \nlanguage that embodies what the intention of the administration is to \ndo anyway, and what the committee is urging the administration to do \nanyway, is a complete mystery to me. That one befuddles me--the idea \nthat this administration, which has proposed and signed this treaty, \nwould walk away from the treaty if the Senate says in a ratification \nresolution that the administration will give us the same notice that \nthe administration says it intends to give us. That one, it seems to \nme, is not a credible argument.\n  So there is going to be disagreement as to whether or not the Senate \nhas the power to put in a ratification resolution a provision that the \nPresident must, before extension or withdrawal, get the approval of the \nSenate. If that were part of my amendment, I could understand why there \nwould be a massive debate over that issue--mainly between the White \nHouse, which I think would say no way, and many Members of the Senate \nwould say that is the only way we can protect the constitutional \nobligation of the Senate. But that is not this amendment. That was the \nFeingold amendment, which was withdrawn.\n  This amendment walks a middle road and says we want to get a \ncommitment in this resolution that we be given the notice and \nconsultation which the administration says it intends to give us. It \ncannot bind future administrations. This administration--I don't have \nany doubt--intends to do what it says it intends to do. Secretary \nPowell says he intends to give notice. I take him at his word. He is an \nhonorable man. But administrations come and go and intentions change \nwith future administrations. That is the relevance of this amendment--\nto put in our ratification resolution what the committee says is \ndesirable, and what the committee says it urges the administration to \ndo, and what the administration says it intends to do, and about which \nI have not heard a constitutional argument, for good reason, because \nhere we are not limiting the power of the President to withdraw from a \ntreaty.\n  The President has the same power to withdraw from a treaty before or \nafter my amendment is defeated or accepted. That power doesn't change. \nWhat changes, however, with this amendment, would be to say that the \nSenate, as part of its treaty obligation and responsibility, wants to \nbe informed prior to the withdrawal from or extension of a treaty that \nthe executive branch enters into.\n  That is, again, a summary of the amendment. I hope, even though \nobviously the leaders of the Foreign Relations Committee oppose this \nfor the reasons they give--and I don't think there are two Members of \nthe Senate for whom I have greater respect than these two Members. We \nhave worked together on these issues. Senator Lugar, Senator Biden, and \nI have worked together on so many issues over the years that I have \nlost count. My respect and regard for them is boundless. But I think \nthis is an issue of important principle that the Senate should \naddress--whether or not we want to be given notice before a President \nwithdraws from this treaty that we are about to ratify, hopefully.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, again, I will simply say that in our \nResolution of Ratification--and this is what we have before the Senate \nnow:\n\n       Given the Senate's continuing interest in the treaty and in \n     continuing strategic offensive reductions to the lowest \n     possible levels consistent with national security \n     requirements and the alliance obligation of the United \n     States, the Senate urges the President to consult with the \n     Senate prior to taking action relevant to paragraphs 2 or 3 \n     of article 4 of the treaty.\n\n  It seems to me the language is clear. We have spelled it out. In \naddition, we have had testimony and have queried Secretary Powell \nregarding his interpretation of the role of the Congress, and he has \nassured us that there would be consultation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is a procedural inquiry. We are trying to determine--\nto assist a colleague who has an urgent, unusual need--if we can set a \ntime on this amendment at 4:05; would that be amenable? I hate to \ninterrupt my friend.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, that would be very satisfactory. In fact, I even will \npropose a time sooner than that if that is in the realm of the \npossible.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is what is difficult. The earlier we are able to set \na time, the earlier we will be able to vote. If we set it 10 minutes \nfrom now, it would have to be 4:15 instead of 4:05.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Let me make a proposal and, in fact, offer a unanimous \nconsent at this time to that effect.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote in relation to the Levin \namendment No. 252 occur at 4:05 today, and that the time until then be \nequally divided in the usual form; further, that no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator from Michigan for that suggestion.\n  I will conclude by indicating that the Senator from Michigan and the \nSenator from Wisconsin proposed a serious constitutional issue. At the \ninitiation of this debate, I indicated that this is not a settled law. \nI also argue that this is not the treaty on which to attempt to settle. \nThere has been precedent--at least in terms of activity that both the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware and I have decided. I pointed out \n30 treaties terminated by the President since 1980. This is a lot of \ntreaties. That has been the regular practice.\n  I referred to a debate on this issue indicated in 1919 on the \nVersailles Treaty on which the Vice President of the United States \naddressed the Senate. The Senate did not come up with a two-thirds vote \nto change the fact that the Constitution is silent.\n  I accept the fact that the Senator from Michigan pointed out at some \npoint in our history--and I think the Senator from Delaware made the \nsame point--we may want to have this debate, but I hope not on this \ntreaty at this time, given the assurance by the Secretary of State, and \nlikewise by the committee, in our article 4 to this treaty.\n  For the benefit of Senators, there are about 26 minutes left and, \nessentially, we will leave it to the Chair how that should be divided.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have a minor point, but the Record should \nbe clarified. When I was referring to what my friend from Michigan said \nabout the difference between the declaration and his condition--one \nbeing binding, one not--I referred to the word ``consult.'' It goes \nbeyond that. The ambiguous language really is in the declaration. In \nhis proposal is ``any action relevant'' to paragraphs 2 or 3 of article \n4 of the treaty, which is the action relevant to the extension or \nwithdrawal--that is the language that was taken by him, properly so, \nfrom the declaration, and that is the part that is ambiguous, not the \nword ``consult.''\n  At any rate, it is a distinction without a great difference.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Delaware \ndoes not control the time and cannot suggest the absence of a quorum. \nThe Senators from Indiana and Michigan control time under the order.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3229]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 252, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe the yeas and nays have not been \nordered. I modify my amendment by striking the word ``any'' on line 5 \nand striking the word ``relevant'' on line 5 and substituting the word \n``pursuant'' for the word ``relevant'' on line 5. The modification is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 252), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following new condition:\n       (3) Notice and consultations prior to withdrawal or \n     extension.--(A) Prior to taking action pursuant to paragraphs \n     2 or 3 of Article IV of the Treaty, and except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), the President shall--\n       (i) provide not less than 60 days advance notice of such \n     action to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate; and\n       (ii) consult with the Senate on such action.\n       (B) The President may waive a requirement in subparagrah \n     (A) if the President--\n       (i) determines that national security needs prevent the \n     President from meeting the requirement; and\n       (ii) submits to the committees of the Senate referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) a written notice of the waiver, including a \n     description of the national security needs and the reasons \n     justifying the waiver.\n       In section 3, strike declaration (6).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Kennedy \nbe added as a cosponsor to the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 254.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To specify information to be included in the annual report on \n     the role of Cooperative Threat Reduction and nonproliferation \n               assistance under condition 1 in section 2)\n\n       At the end of the last sentence of condition 1 in section \n     2, strike the period and insert the following: ``, and shall \n     include--\n       ``(A) an estimate of the funding levels required in the \n     fiscal year following the year of the report to implement all \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction programs and other \n     nonproliferation programs relevant to the Treaty and ensure \n     that nuclear weapons, materials, technology, and expertise in \n     the Russian Federation are secure from theft and diversion; \n     and\n       ``(B) a description of any initiatives proposed by the \n     President to address any matter covered by subparagraph (A) \n     in order to improve the implementation or effectiveness of \n     the Treaty.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, this amendment is the result of several \nhearings I chaired in the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \nInternational Security and Proliferation on the importance of Nunn-\nLugar Cooperative Threat Reduction assistance to national security.\n  The collapse of the Soviet Union left stockpiles of nuclear weapons \nand materials vulnerable to theft and diversion. The Nunn-Lugar \nlegislative initiative of 1991 established several threat reduction \nprograms in the Departments of Defense and Energy to help dismantle \nweapons of mass destruction or improve their security. These programs, \nalong with others in the State Department, are critical to preventing \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or the diversion of \nmaterial to terrorists.\n  U.S. nonproliferation activities have accomplished a great deal. With \nAmerican assistance, all nuclear weapons have been removed from \nUkraine, Kazakstan, and Belarus. Our nonproliferation programs also \nprevent the recruitment by terrorists or other countries of WMD \nscientists and engineers.\n  The CTR and other nonproliferation programs are making progress but \nface a new set of responsibilities in light of the Moscow Treaty. The \nRussian Federation intends to reduce and destroy various weapons \nsystems with U.S. assistance under the CTR and other nonproliferation \nprograms.\n  I strongly support language in the Moscow Treaty that directs the \nPresident to ``submit to Congress . . . a report and recommendations on \nhow United States Cooperative Threat Reduction assistance to the \nRussian Federation can best contribute to enabling the Russian \nFederation to implement the Treaty efficiently. . . .''\n  In November 2001, President Bush and President Putin met to discuss \nhistoric cuts to the nuclear stockpiles in the U.S. and in Russia. This \ndiscussion led to the Moscow Treaty before us today.\n  After the first day of that summit, President Bush remarked that:\n\n     [o]ur highest priority is to keep terrorists from acquiring \n     weapons of mass destruction . . . we will strengthen our \n     efforts to cut off every possible source of biological, \n     chemical, and nuclear weapons material and expertise.\n\n  The CTR and other nonproliferation programs are the primary means we \nhave to prevent weapons, weapon-usable materials, and expertise in the \nRussian Federation from falling into the hands of terrorists. Secretary \nof State Powell said, in testimony before the Senate, that the CTR \nprogram will be used to ``make warhead storage facilities more secure. \nSuch U.S. assistance will also increase the security of the Russian \nwarheads made excess as provided in the Moscow Treaty.''\n  The goals of the CTR and other nonproliferation programs are vital to \nnational security. Getting there will be difficult. We must provide \nthese programs with the funding necessary to\n\n[[Page S3230]]\n\naccomplish their important and challenging task.\n  I have joined my friend and colleague, Senator Lugar, in supporting \nadequate funding and high-level administration support for these \nprograms for years. For this reason, my amendment would ensure funding \nestimates are included in this annual report on CTR contributions to \nRussian implementation of the Moscow Treaty. It is important that \nCongress know how the CTR and nonproliferation programs can be used to \nhelp the Russian Federation with its treaty obligations. It is equally \nimportant for Congress to know what these programs require to realize \ntheir full potential for enhancing security.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 254, Withdrawn\n\n  Madam President, I have had discussions with the distinguished \nchairman concerning my amendment. He has given me assurances that the \nintent of my amendment will be covered in the report mentioned in \ncondition 1 and other reports already required by Congress. For this \nreason, I withdraw my amendment, and Senator Lugar and I will enter \ninto a colloquy on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii for his very important thoughts about threat reduction and about \nour mutual quest and support.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank my friend, the Senior Senator from Indiana, for \nthis opportunity to discuss with him the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nand other non-proliferation programs and their importance to effective \nimplementation of the Moscow Treaty.\n  I have chaired several hearings in the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal \nServices, and undertaken several studies, on the importance of the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction. Because of this work it was my \nintent today to offer an amendment to the Moscow Treaty to expand the \nreport on Cooperative Threat Reduction and non-proliferation programs \ncontained in the recommended resolution of ratification by including \nfunding requirements.\n  As my colleague knows, the collapse of the Soviet Union left \nstockpiles of nuclear weapons and materials vulnerable to theft and \ndiversion. The Senate and the Nation have benefited from the Senior \nSenator's leadership in the Nunn-Lugar legislative initiative of 1991 \nthat established threat reduction programs in the Departments of \nDefense and Energy to help dismantle weapons of mass destruction or \nimprove their security. These programs, along with others in the State \nDepartment, are critical to preventing the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction or the diversion of material to terrorists.\n  My amendment would amend Condition One in the Resolution of \nRatification so that the annual report on non-proliferation programs \nincludes two important pieces of information. First, the report would \ninclude an estimate of funding levels necessary for the CTR and other \nnon-proliferation programs relevant to the Treaty to ensure that \nnuclear weapons, materials, technology, and expertise in the Russian \nFederation are secure from theft and diversion. Second, the report \nwould include a description of any initiatives proposed by the \nPresident for the CTR or other non-proliferation programs that will \nimprove the implementation or effectiveness of the Treaty. I understand \nthrough my conversation with the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee that, while he appreciates my concerns and reasons behind my \namendment, it should not be included in the resolution before us.\n  U.S. non-proliferation activities have accomplished a great deal. \nWith American assistance, all nuclear weapons have been removed from \nUkraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. Our non-proliferation programs also \nprevent the recruitment by terrorists or other countries of WMD \nscientists and engineers.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with my friend. The CTR and other non-\nproliferation programs are making progress but face a new set of \nresponsibilities in light of the Moscow Treaty. The Russian Federation \nintends to reduce, destroy, and account for various weapons systems, \nmaterials, and expertise with U.S. assistance under the CTR and other \nnon-proliferation programs. For this reason, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee included Condition One to the Treaty to require the President \nto submit to Congress an annual report and recommendations on how \nCooperative Threat Reduction assistance can best help the Russian \nFederation implement the Treaty efficiently and maintain the security \nand accurate accounting of its nuclear weapons and weapons-usable \ncomponents and material.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. I strongly support this language. The Committee Report on \nthe Moscow Treaty states that this report will include ``the role of \nCooperative Threat Reduction and nonproliferation assistance.'' Am I \ncorrect in my interpretation that the annual report will include the \ncontribution of both the Department of Defense CTR program and other \nprograms that are relevant to Treaty implementation and security and \naccounting of nuclear weapons and materials?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, this report is intended to establish the rationale \nfor all U.S. non-proliferation programs insofar as they can be used to \nhelp Russia dismantle weapons or assure the security of those weapons \nand of the fissile material in them. The report also will include the \namount of CTR assistance that the Russian Federation will need to meet \nits obligations under the Treaty.\n  Mr. AKAKA. That is good to hear. I have joined with my friend in \nadvocating for adequate funding and high-level administration support \nfor these non-proliferation programs for years. For this reason, I was \nconsidering offering an amendment to include funding estimates needed \nto assist Russia meet its obligations under the Moscow Treaty. It is \nimportant that Congress know how the CTR and non-proliferation programs \ncan be used to help the Russian Federation with its Treaty obligations \nand how best to fund these programs to meet Treaty obligations. Does my \ncolleague believe it would be useful if such information was provided \nto Congress?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes, I agree that such information is useful. However I \nbelieve that this information already is provided as part of the \noverall CTR annual report to Congress by the Department of Defense and \nannual reports by other non-proliferation programs. Specifically, the \nCTR annual report contains funding levels for individual projects as \nwell as five-year cost estimates.\n  I understand my colleague's concern that this report does not address \nTreaty-specific programs. The report required in the resolution of \nratification could lay the groundwork for future cost and program \nrequirements for non-proliferation that perhaps can be addressed in the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I look \nforward to the opportunity to work with you in defining the amount and \nextent of information we need to adequately fund and support these \nimportant programs. I also understand your desire to keep paperwork and \nreporting requirements to a minimum for the small but hardworking staff \nof the CTR program. Accurate and timely reporting of this information \nis crucial for proper congressional oversight of these programs. It is \nmy hope that the administration understands my concerns.\n  In November 2001 President Bush remarked that ``[o]ur highest \npriority is to keep terrorists from acquiring weapons of mass \ndestruction . . . we will strengthen our efforts to cut off every \npossible source of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons material \nand expertise.'' I know my friend shares my respect for the CTR and \nother non-proliferation programs that are the primary means we have to \nprevent weapons, weapons-usable materials, and expertise in the Russian \nFederation from falling into the hands of terrorists.\n  The goals of the CTR and other non-proliferation programs are vital \nto national security. Getting there will be difficult. I know that by \nworking together we can provide these programs with the funding \nnecessary to accomplish their important and challenging task.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to express my support for the \nStrategic Offensive Reduction Treaty, otherwise known as the Moscow \nTreaty, which\n\n[[Page S3231]]\n\nwas signed by President Bush and President Putin on May 24, 2002. This \ntreaty is important because it signifies that Russia and the United \nStates are committed to and cooperating on the reduction of nuclear \nweapons. It carries the weight of law and will remain in force for a \ndecade. It is also important because it binds the United States and the \nRussian Federation to each reduce the number of operationally deployed \nstrategic weapons to between 1,700 and 2,200 by the end of 2012.\n  Presently, the United States has approximately 6,000 nuclear weapons \nand the Russian Federation has almost 5,500 nuclear weapons. The Moscow \nTreaty is a step forward, reducing the danger of large numbers of \noperationally deployed nuclear weapons. This treaty is a good step, but \nit is only a small step. Much more must be done. Russia entered into \nnegotiations seeking a legally binding document that would limit \nstrategic nuclear warheads, and in their words ``provide transparency \nand predictability'' by containing definitions, and counting and \nelimination rules that resembled those in the START Treaties. \nUltimately, Russia wanted to ensure that this process would be \nirreversible; in their words, that it would ensure the \n``irreversibility of the reduction of nuclear forces.''\n  This administration, however, had different goals. Russia had to \nconvince the United States to sign a legally binding document rather \nthan a less formal exchange of letters. The United States rejected any \nlimits and counting rules that would have required the elimination of \ndelivery vehicles and warheads, stating that it wanted flexibility to \nreduce its forces at its own pace and to restore warheads to deployed \nforces if conditions warranted. So while this treaty changes the status \nof some operationally deployed warheads, it does not require the \ndismantling of a single weapon. Once this treaty is fully implemented, \nthe United States will still have approximately 6,000 nuclear weapons. \nThere will just be more weapons in storage. And similarly, the Russians \ncould have approximately 5,500 nuclear weapons, but they would be \nnonoperational according to the lines of this treaty.\n  The treaty does not bind either party to any schedule for \ndeactivation. It only requires that cuts be completed by December 31, \n2012, the day the treaty expires. This means that either side can stop \nor even reverse the reduction process over the decade as long as both \nparties comply by the final date of the treaty.\n  The treaty does not specifically address the problems of tactical \nnuclear weapons or MIRV'd ICBMs. The number of Russian tactical nuclear \nweapons is believed to be between 8,000 and 15,000, while the United \nStates has approximately 2,000. Russian tactical nuclear weapons are \nsubject to fewer safeguards and are more prone to theft and \nproliferation. These are the proverbial suitcase weapons, often \ndiscussed in the press, which are the ones that are most mobile, most \ndifficult to trace and detect. And the treaty does not deal with these \nweapons at all.\n  In addition, the Moscow Treaty effectively ends START II, which I \nwill discuss in more detail later, which means that Russia will likely \nkeep its weapons MIRV'd, meaning they will have multiple warheads on \ntheir weapons. Since MIRV'd weapons are fewer and more vulnerable, it \nincreases the perceived need for a first strike.\n  Another shortcoming of the Moscow Treaty is that it includes no \nverification procedures. START I verification procedures will remain in \nplace until 2009. But there was never agreement between the parties \nabout which, if any, procedures could be used in the Moscow Treaty. \nDiscussion of verification procedures is supposed to continue, but the \nadministration recently stated: We have determined that specific \nadditional transparency measures are not needed and will not be sought \nat this time.\n  I also believe the treaty withdrawal provisions are too lax. Parties \ncan withdraw from the Moscow Treaty with 3-months notice without giving \nany reason. This means a party needs no compelling reason to stop \ncomplying with the terms of this treaty.\n  Finally, the terms of this treaty must be met by December 31, 2012, \nbut that is the day the treaty expires. It is possible that it could be \nextended, but another agreement would have to be reached to do that. On \nthe other hand, it could also lapse so the parties could raise the \nnumbers of operationally deployed warheads above 2,200 on January 1, \n2013. In effect, they could go through the term of the treaty without \nsignificant reductions, let the treaty lapse, and nothing would have \nbeen affected by the treaty. I hope certainly that doesn't happen.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Lugar and Senator Biden. They have done a remarkable job of \nadding some detail to the treaty.\n  The resolution we are considering today contains two important \nconditions. The first condition requires a report and recommendation on \nhow cooperative threat reduction assistance to the Russian Federation \ncan best contribute to the efficient implementation of the treaty and \nmaintain the security and accurate accounting of Russia's nuclear \nweapons and materiel. As I will discuss in detail later, the CTR \nprogram is the most effective tool to counter proliferation, and we \nmust do all we can to maintain it.\n  Secondly, the resolution requires an annual implementation report \nwhich will include, among other items, a listing of strategic nuclear \nweapons force levels for both parties, a detailed description on \nstrategic offensive reductions planned by each party for the current \nyear, and how these reductions will be achieved, verification and \ntransparency measures taken or proposed by each party, and actions \ntaken or proposed to improve the implementation and effectiveness of \nthe treaty.\n  There are also several nonbinding declarations, most of which request \nreports to Congress and encourage the President to continue to work to \nreduce nuclear weapons. These conditions and declarations make the \ntreaty more substantial and, I believe, more effective.\n  I will support this treaty strengthened by this resolution. I want to \nsay to the administration, however, that this is simply not enough. The \nrise of rogue nations and rogue nonstate actors, has made the threat of \nproliferation even more urgent. One of the legacies of the cold war is \nthe abundance of nuclear weapons and fissionable material that is no \nlonger under the clear control of the Russian Federation or other \nformer states of the Soviet Union. Moreover, many of these nuclear \nweapons are housed in nations which are struggling economically and are \nsusceptible to offers from rogue actors to acquire these materials.\n  As Graham Allison of Harvard, former dean at the Kennedy School, \nstated:\n\n       The single largest threat to American lives and liberties \n     going forward for the next decade is terrorism, particularly \n     terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. The one that I \n     have been most concerned about is loose nukes.\n\n  We must do everything possible to counter proliferation through \nprotection, containment, and interdiction. In 1991, former Senator Sam \nNunn and Chairman Richard Lugar recognized the risk presented by the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They created--history \nwill record this--one of the most important initiatives that has been \nseen in this Senate, in this country in many years; that is, the \ncounterproliferation program, the cooperative threat reduction program.\n  The programs they established in the Department of State, the \nDepartment of Energy, and the Department of Defense, have had \nsignificant success in preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Through these programs, the United States has secured tons \nof nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union; helped deactivate, \ndismantle, or destroy thousands of Russian nuclear weapons and delivery \nsystems; and helped provide employment for hundreds of Russian \nscientists and engineers with expertise in building nuclear, chemical, \nor biological weapons, who otherwise might be tempted to sell their \nexpertise to unfriendly nations or terrorist organizations. This is an \nextraordinary accomplishment, but so much needs to be done in addition.\n\n  Even though only about $1 billion of the $400 billion defense budget \nis annually allocated to support these programs, they have been among \nthe most successful of all nonproliferation efforts undertaken by this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S3232]]\n\nGiven the success of the programs, it is difficult to understand why \nsecuring adequate funding has been a significant challenge in the Bush \nadministration.\n  I also want to add my voice to those of my many colleagues who \nbelieve the United States and the international community are capable \nof doing, and must do, much more in this regard. Let me quote once \nagain from the expert, Senator Lugar, who in his article in the \nDecember 2002 issue of Arms Control Today, said:\n\n       It is critical that the United States lead in establishing \n     a global coalition capable of exerting pressure on states to \n     cooperate with the safeguarding, accounting, and (where \n     possible) destruction of weapons and materials of mass \n     destruction. Given that a war is being contemplated with Iraq \n     over the question of their weapons programs, it is reasonable \n     to ask why more is not being done on a global scale to \n     control other proliferation risks.\n\n  I agree with the chairman. I also agree with his statement:\n\n       We must not only accelerate dismantlement efforts in \n     Russia, we must broaden our capability to address \n     proliferation risks elsewhere and build a global coalition to \n     support such efforts.\n\n  Clearly, undeniably, there is a lot of work to be done in these \nprograms, not the least of which is to make up for time lost to these \nprograms over the past 2 years.\n  The Bush administration put most of the nonproliferation programs on \nhold during fiscal year 2001, in order to conduct a review to determine \nthe validity of the programs. Luckily, most of the programs survived \nthe review, and some were even strengthened; but little progress was \nmade as very little work was done during this yearlong review.\n  Then, at the completion of the review, the fiscal year 2002, and all \nprevious years, funds for the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram were frozen for over a year because the Bush administration \nfailed to make the required certification to spend the money.\n  Just recently, these funds have been released as a result of waiver \nauthority included in the fiscal year 2003 Defense Authorization Act. \nThis is waiver authority that the Republicans in the other body wanted \nto severely restrict and limit to 1 year, but luckily, in the end, the \nSenate was able to prevail and provide an unrestricted waiver for 3 \nyears.\n  These two events, the program review and the inability to certify, \neffectively stopped the Nunn-Lugar programs for approximately 2 years. \nThe effectiveness of some of these programs has clearly been inhibited, \nif not damaged. The challenge now is to work to regain and then \nincrease their effectiveness.\n  The sheer magnitude of the problem of proliferation dictates that we \nmust find an international consensus and work through multilateral \narrangements.\n\n  Despite the bureaucracy and delay that accompanies international \ncooperation, I believe it is necessary, especially in the area of arms \ncontrol regimes, to have a multilateral approach.\n  A report by the Rand Corporation to the then-President-elect Bush \npointed out:\n\n       Without our democratic allies, many emerging global issues \n     will likely prove to be beyond our ability to manage, but \n     together with them, the United States will gain unparalleled \n     ability to respond to tomorrow's demands and shape the \n     future.\n\n  Regrettably, the Bush administration has demonstrated a distrust of \ninternational organizations.\n  Since President Bush took office, the administration has withdrawn \nfrom the ABM Treaty and walked away from meaningful negotiations \nconcerning START II.\n  Indeed, in the preamble and article 2 of the Moscow Treaty, the first \nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty is referred to as START, not START I. \nSTART II is evident only in its absence from this treaty.\n  Assistant Secretary of Defense J. D. Crouch has said:\n\n       I think we have sort of moved beyond START II.\n\n  Many Russian officials have recognized what appears to be the \ninevitability of this and indicated they are considering START II \ndead--meaning that Russia is no longer obligated to eliminate its \nMIRV'd ICBMs.\n  We must recognize that in many areas, including arms control, the \nUnited States cannot go it alone, and we have to not only encourage but \nactively work to create an international coalition, particularly with \nrespect to proliferation of these weapons and nuclear materials.\n  I am also concerned that recent actions by the United States seems to \nindicate that while we talk about nonproliferation in principle, in \npractice we seem to be somewhat ambivalent. This is exacerbated when it \nappears that the U.S. is increasing the importance of nuclear weapons \nin our defense policy.\n  While the nonproliferation programs were being held up, the \nadministration was working on a new nuclear posture review that would \nput more emphasis on nuclear weapons. The December 2001 Nuclear Posture \nReview laid out a framework which includes maintaining the current size \nof the nuclear weapons stockpile, not reducing it; blurring the \ndistinction between nuclear offensive strike and conventional offensive \nstrike; introducing the notion that new nuclear weapons might be needed \nto meet changing security requirements; holding open the possibility of \nresuming nuclear weapons testing, either to develop nuclear weapons, or \nto maintain the current stockpile; supporting a robust nuclear weapons \ncomplex, not just to implement the stockpile stewardship program, but \nto manufacture hundreds of new plutonium pits per year, and to be able \nto design a new weapon if needed; and increase ``test readiness''--the \nlevel of readiness to conduct a nuclear weapons test, reducing that \ntime period from 36 months to 18 months, essentially leaning further \nforward to the possibility of resuming nuclear tests. In addition, the \nBush administration sought $15.5 million in its fiscal year 2003 \nrequest for a robust nuclear earth penetrator to use against hardened \nand deeply buried targets. This RNEP would modify an existing nuclear \nweapon with yields up to a megaton. Despite the fact that the fiscal \nyear 2003 National Defense Authorization Act requires a report of the \nplan for this weapon before funds are released, there is an additional \n$15 million requested for this program in the fiscal year 2004 budget, \nindicating that the administration is still determined to try to \ndevelop this new variety of nuclear weapon.\n\n  There has also been a renewed interest in the development of small \nnuclear weapons. Even though there is clearly no military requirement \nfor such a weapon, again in its fiscal year 2004 legislative proposal, \nthe Department of Defense seeks the total repeal of a current ban on \nresearch and development that could lead to production of a low-yield \nnuclear weapon.\n  DOD states that this law, in their words, ``has negatively affected \nU.S. Government efforts to support the national strategy to counter \nweapons of mass destruction and undercuts efforts that could strengthen \nour ability to deter, or respond to, new or emerging threats.''\n  Frankly, this adds up to a very disturbing path of legitimizing the \nuse of nuclear weapons in a world in which we are dramatically \nconcerned with the possibility that Iraq is attempting to obtain \nnuclear weapons, a world in which the North Koreans are beginning to \nflaunt their ability to produce nuclear weapons, in which India and \nPakistan are on the brink of conflict with nuclear weapons. The idea \nthat we are lowering our own threshold to deploy, to use, to consider \nin our doctrine the use of nuclear weapons is, I think, an unfortunate \nand very dangerous approach. These continued efforts, both in the \nposture review, in requests for new weapons, in requests to investigate \nand do research on new types of nuclear weapons, and this legitimacy \nfor the use of nuclear weapons, will have profound and detrimental \nconsequences throughout the world.\n  It is extraordinarily difficult, if not impossible, to urge other \nnations to forswear the development and use of nuclear weapons if we \nare so routinely talking about the development and use of nuclear \nweapons. This is a very disturbing development.\n\n  We have to look at nonproliferation as part of our overall defense \npolicy. Advocating new or usable nuclear weapons destroys, inhibits, \nand damages the credibility of the United States as we seek to restrain \nthe development and deployment of nuclear weapons. I hope that message \ncomes through in not only today's discussions, but in this treaty.\n\n[[Page S3233]]\n\n  I am also concerned with another aspect of the current situation. We \nare talking about our approach to Iraq as a need to disarm Saddam \nbefore he acquires nuclear weapons. Yet we have moved rather gingerly \nand pushed over to the United Nations the problem of North Korea which \nis on the verge of beginning to operate its reprocessing facilities, \nwith the capability of building nuclear devices within months, if not \nweeks.\n  I think this leads many people, and not just those who follow these \npolicy debates but most ordinary Americans, to wonder what is the \ndifference. Why is the situation in Iraq so compelling, even though \nthere is little evidence that Saddam is on the verge of producing a \nnuclear weapon, that we engage in a military conflict, while, on the \nother hand, when there is glaring evidence of the ability of the North \nKoreans to produce such a weapon, we have moved this along into the \ncategory of not a crisis, something the U.N. can handle? That \nintellectual dilemma is puzzling many people throughout this country.\n  I believe there is a crisis in North Korea, and I believe it is a \ncrisis that requires the prompt attention of the President. If one \nlooks at the strategic vision we have to embrace, it can perhaps be \ndivided into several major tasks.\n  The first is to preempt terrorists and, indeed, we saw this week an \neffective use of our military and intelligence forces and our allies in \nPakistan. Then we have to interdict, contain, and stop the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The North Koreans, in my mind, pose a much more difficult challenge \nto us than the Iraqis at the moment. Not only are they on the verge of \nproducing a nuclear weapon because they have the nuclear material, they \nalso have a history of selling anything to anyone because their major \ncash crop is selling weapons to anyone who will buy them.\n  We are here today to conclude a very small but a very important step \nforward with the support of the Moscow Treaty, but we have much more to \ndo when it comes to particularly supporting efforts by our country in \nan international coalition to preempt, to interdict, to stop the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, and I \nthink to reexamine carefully and thoroughly the new emphasis we are \nputting on the development and use of nuclear weapons in our inventory.\n  I believe we will regret the day we give legitimacy to the potential \nuse of nuclear weapons by any power, including the United States.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To provide an additional condition)\n\n       At the end of section 2, add the following new condition:\n       (3) Annual reports on monitoring capabilities.--(A) Not \n     later than 60 days after the exchange of the instruments of \n     ratification of the Treaty, and annually thereafter on May 1, \n     the President shall submit to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations, the Committee on Armed Services, and the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate an estimate, prepared \n     by the Director of Central Intelligence, on the capability of \n     the United States to monitor the compliance of the Russian \n     Federation with the requirements of the Treaty.\n       (B) Each estimate shall meet the requirements of a national \n     intelligence estimate under section 103(b)(2)(A) of the \n     National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 403-3(b)(2)(A)), and \n     shall include--\n       (i) an estimate, for each strategic nuclear weapons system \n     of the Russian Federation, of the confidence of the United \n     States, whether low, medium, or high, in the capability of \n     the United States to monitor the deployed warheads on such \n     system;\n       (ii) an assessment of the capability of the United States \n     to monitor the compliance of the Russian Federation with the \n     requirements of the Treaty--\n       (I) under the verification measures of the verification \n     regime under the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of \n     Strategic Offensive Arms, with Annexes, Protocols, and \n     Memorandum of Understanding, signed at Moscow on July 31, \n     1991 (START Treaty); and\n       (II) after the verification regime expires upon termination \n     of the START Treaty; and\n       (iii) additional mechanisms to ensure United States \n     monitoring of the compliance of the Russian Federation with \n     the requirements of the Treaty, including--\n       (I) further agreements between the United States and the \n     Russian Federation;\n       (II) mutual data exchanges between the United States and \n     the Russian Federation;\n       (III) improvements in the transparency of strategic \n     offensive reductions under the Treaty;\n       (IV) improvements to existing monitoring technologies; and\n       (V) other appropriate mechanisms.\n       (C) Each estimate shall be submitted in both classified and \n     unclassified form.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Strategic Offensive Reduction Treaty \nthat has been under consideration for a couple of days, also known as \nthe Moscow Treaty, is, in my judgment, in the 18 years I have been here \nthinking about arms control and certainly as part of the debate in the \nForeign Relations Committee and on the floor in the ratification of \ntreaties, as flimsy a treaty as the Senate has ever considered. I \nbelieve its faults are many. At best, its defenders contend that it \ndoes no harm, but I find fault even in that assessment, and I find \nfault ultimately in this treaty.\n  The Moscow Treaty promises to reduce the deployed offensive weapons \nof the United States and Russia to a range of between 1,700 to 2,200 \neach by December 31, 2012. As far as the treaty goes, that is the \nhighlight.\n  I think, under certain circumstances, one would certainly say that \nreducing its own number of deployed missiles is a worthy goal and \nsomething we want to achieve, but in the world we live in today, simply \nreducing their deployment, where they are sometimes under better \ncontrol than they are going to be if they are not deployed, it may, in \nfact, be taking a dangerous situation and perhaps lending itself to the \ngreater dangers of this particular moment of history.\n  In my assessment, regrettably, the treaty amounts to little more than \na series of missed opportunities. Let me be precise about that point.\n  It does not mandate a reduction in total warheads. None must be \ndismantled. The treaty merely requires both parties to reduce the \nnumber of warheads in their operationally deployed arsenals. It \nprovides no timetable for the planned reductions in deployed forces \nprior to the treaty's 2012 target date. It never requires the \ndestruction of a single launcher.\n  In effect, the treaty allows each side to upload, download, and mix \nweapons in and out of storage. It contains no verification procedures, \nand the vast stockpiles of nuclear warheads in this country and in \nRussia remain unchanged.\n  Nuclear weapons, as we all know, are the legacy of the cold war, the \nmost pressing single threat that we face today as we contemplate \ndealing with Saddam Hussein and as we wish we were dealing with North \nKorea. The most pressing threat, however, is really that nuclear \nweapons, or their lethal components, might fall into the hands of \nterrorists or irresponsible governments at the head of rogue regimes. \nThis fact makes the provisions of this treaty even more troubling.\n  Instead of requiring the dismantlement of warheads or launchers, the \ntreaty simply requires that on one day in 2012, the sides are to have \nno more than the 1,700 or 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear weapons. \nThe remaining thousands of weapons will be held in reserve, stockpiled \nfor some other unforeseen need, a need, I might say, in the context of \nthe threats we are looking at in the year 2003 that is extraordinarily \nhard to explain, particularly when those stockpiled weapons become the \nrisk of stolen, bartered, sold, or blackmailed materials. By their \ncontinued existence, they present a tempting target for thieves and for \nterrorists.\n  It is no secret that there are those who are eager to capitalize on a \ndeadly market for weapons-usable nuclear materials. The GAO has \ndocumented numerous failed attempts to smuggle nuclear materials out of \nRussia. I say to\n\n[[Page S3234]]\n\nmy colleagues that out of 20 of these incidents over the last decade, \nthe materials involved in 13 of the 20 that we know about, and possibly \nas many as 15, were traced back to Russian sources.\n  I will tell my colleagues from my experience as a law enforcement \nofficial that if you know you caught 20 and you know you are operating \nwith limited capacities to detect, anyone ought to be asking the \nquestion, How many did we miss and how many will we miss in the future?\n  The great security challenge of our day is to keep nuclear weapons \nout of the hands of those who would do us harm, but this treaty only \nexpands the stockpile of nondeployed warheads in Russia, and in this \ncountry for that matter. It may advance some old cold war calculus for \narms control, but it is not a part of a broader comprehensive approach \nto our nuclear relationship with Russia, particularly in the area of \nthreat reduction, and there I think the treaty runs the risk of \nincreasing the danger of nuclear theft by stockpiling thousands of \nwarheads.\n  Obviously, it is the task of all of us to try to make the world more \nsecure, not less secure. As I have said previously, we need to \nrevitalize the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program by giving it the \nsustained leadership, attention, and funding it deserves.\n  Over the last decade, the United States has spent about $7.5 billion \nto deactivate 6,000 warheads and destroy thousands of delivery \nvehicles. Why would we spend $7.5 billion to deactivate and destroy and \nthen bring a treaty to the floor of the Senate which does neither? We \nhave to make good on our pledge of $10 billion over the next 10 years \nto the G-8 threat reduction partnership, and we need to encourage the \ngood faith participation of our allies. But we know that even those \nefforts are not going to be enough.\n  In 2001, the bipartisan Baker-Cutler commission concluded that for \nour efforts to secure Russia's nuclear weapons materials and expertise \nto succeed, we will have to spend $30 billion over the next 10 years. \nThat is a challenge we ought to be meeting as a primary goal prior even \nto the implementation of this treaty.\n  The treaty's supporters have noted that its brevity is important, as \nif the length of a treaty somehow constitutes a real accomplishment, \nand that provisions in it are a reflection of our new relationship with \nRussia.\n  My question is, if we are in a new environment with Russia, then why \nnot include verification and transparency measures that reflect that \nnew environment? The treaty does not mandate the dismantlement or \ndestruction of warheads or launchers. Yet the provisions of this treaty \nturn upon themselves and the very logic underpinning the treaty as \nargued by its proponents. For instance, they argue, as Secretary \nRumsfeld did before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last summer, \nthat no arms control treaty in the history of our country has ever \nrequired the destruction of warheads.\n  Well, if this treaty is based on the conclusion that we live in a \ndifferent time, if this treaty is based on the conclusion that the cold \nwar is really over, if this treaty is based on the conclusion that we \nhave a new and better relationship with Russia and that we therefore \ncan look to a new period, why then keep these warheads in storage for \nanother day when the numbers we are reducing to under any SIOP or any \nwarfighting plan we have ever seen are sufficient to destroy the world \nseveral times over? It simply does not make sense.\n  Why expand the stockpiles of stored nuclear warheads and materials \nwhen we know to a certainty, as the CIA tells us, we do not have the \ncapacity today to safeguard those materials? Why would we do that when \nwe are prepared to go to war against Iraq to prevent Iraq from \nillicitly receiving the very kinds of materials that we are about to \nencourage the capacity for others to seek out in the same way as we \nhave seen others do in those 20 examples I cited a few moments ago?\n  The logic escapes anybody who stops to really think about what we are \ndoing with this treaty. If we have really entered a new age and a new \nrelationship with Russia--and I believe we have in fact--then neither \nRussia nor the United States should hedge on a commitment to real and \nmeaningful arms reduction to an agreement that addresses in its very \nfabric the new and real threat of proliferation by theft or diversion. \nBy doing so, we would send a signal to Saddam Hussein and to the rest \nof the world that we are not hedging our bets; that, in fact, we are \nserious and we are setting an example, and that the rest of the world \nis earning the justification for moving to disarm another nation for \nmoving to nuclearization.\n\n  Those same supporters who say we need to hold on to vast stockpiles \nof nuclear warheads ironically argue that the profoundly changed nature \nof the relationship with Russia means we need not have negotiated \nverification regimes for this treaty.\n  There are still those in this country, as surely there are some in \nRussia, who continue to view our former cold war adversary with some \nmeasure of suspicion and distrust.\n  This treaty had the potential to deepen Russian-American cooperation \nand confidence building. If it had included verification measures, the \ntreaty would have silenced skeptics of our new relationship by \ndemonstrating mutual weapons reductions through inspection and \nverification. But, regrettably, it does not. Both sides understand that \neach has the potential to redeploy all of these weapons unless we can \nverify, at a minimum, their location. So by this feature alone, this \ntreaty contains the seeds of future doubt and suspicion.\n  Verification ought to be a crucial aspect of our effort to secure \nnuclear weapons and materials, and if we cannot be certain that the \nnumbers of deployed warheads have been reduced, we will not be certain \nof the magnitude of the challenge of securing those materials.\n  Since the height of the arms control negotiations, now almost two \ndecades ago, the cry of many of my colleagues on the other side of this \naisle--which I remember well for years as we tried to move through \nvarious arms control treaties--was appropriately, as Ronald Reagan \nsaid, ``trust but verify.''\n  This treaty exhibits a lot of trust but no verification. Accordingly, \nI am offering an amendment to help address the critical issue of \nverification. It is a very simple amendment, and it really ought not to \npresent a problem to colleagues. If we are to have more confidence in \nthis treaty, we should be working with the Russians now to achieve a \nviable regime to verify that reductions are indeed taking place on both \nsides and that they are taking place in a way that safeguards those \nmaterials. In the absence of any mutually agreed upon verification \nregime, we are left to rely on national means and methods to determine \nwhether or not Russia is making the reductions promised on a reasonable \nschedule to meet the December 2012 target date.\n  My amendment adds a new condition to the Resolution of Ratification \nrequiring an annual report prepared by the intelligence community on \nour ability to monitor Russia's compliance with the Moscow Treaty. For \nall those who have worried about trusting, verifying, and knowing what \nis happening, this is a very simple requirement, that we learn from our \nown intelligence community about our capacity to safeguard the \ninterests of the United States of America. This national intelligence \nestimate must also provide an assessment of the ability of the United \nStates to monitor compliance with the SORT treaty through the \nverification regime of the START I treaty and our ability to monitor \ncompliance after the START I verification regime terminates in 2009.\n  Perhaps most notably, under my amendment the intelligence community \nis required to inform us of the mechanisms they need to verify treaty \ncompliance with a high degree of confidence, including consideration of \nfurther agreements between the United States and the Russian \nFederation, mutual data exchanges between the two countries, \nimprovements in the transparency of reductions that are called for in \nthis treaty, technological improvements, and other appropriate \nmechanisms.\n  I have long viewed this treaty's lack of verification measures as a \nsource of grave concern. I spoke out in the Foreign Relations Committee \non each occasion that this treaty was considered. Last summer, when the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on\n\n[[Page S3235]]\n\nthe treaty, I noted the huge contradiction in it, the lack of \nverification and accountability in the reduction, and the fear that \nthese weapons or materials might fall into the hands of terrorists.\n  While I understand that we cannot mandate the dismantlement of \nwarheads or the security of nuclear materials without renegotiating \nthis treaty, it is critical we have an understanding, in order to \nprotect the security interests of our country, of our own ability to \nmonitor Russian compliance, where that ability might fall short and to \nunderstand a perspective on what we simply do not know. Without \nmeaningful verification, there is a great deal that we will not know. \nAnd in this case, what we don't know can, indeed, hurt us in this \ndangerous world that we live in today.\n\n  Last month, I voted in committee to bring the treaty to the full \nSenate but not without reservation. At that time, I registered my \nserious concern about the treaty's lack of verification measures, about \nthe lack of milestones or targets other than the 2012 date, and about \nthe peculiarity of a treaty that expires on the very same day that it \nreaches its intended goal.\n  The amendment I offer today is intended to drive at the heart of the \nverification issue. I know several of my colleagues have offered or \ntalked about other important fixes to address the shortcomings of this \ntreaty, and I applaud their efforts, but at its heart this treaty \nrepresents a missed opportunity. It almost represents a treaty for the \nsake of a treaty without regard to the longer term security interests \nand strategic interests of the United States.\n  We missed an opportunity to help make the world safer for our \nchildren in the long term. We missed an opportunity to eliminate \nthousands of nuclear weapons for the long term, and not just to reduce \ndeployed weapons for the short term. We missed an opportunity to \nadvance American-Russian relations in a way that, in fact, builds a \nstronger foundation of trust between our two great countries.\n  By addressing the verification issue as envisioned in my amendment, I \nbelieve we can at least learn from our own intelligence community--\nwhich we ought to be willing to trust--what more needs to be done to \nprovide the transparency and verification so essential to any agreement \nof this nature. If we are to make America safer, and we must, it will \ntake more than cosmetic treaties that leave Russia's nuclear arsenal in \nplace. As Ronald Reagan told the Nation, ``History has shown that peace \nwill not come, nor will our freedoms be preserved, by good will \nalone.''\n  We have work still to be done to meet today's challenges, and I \nbelieve one of those challenges is to fix the Moscow Treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me respond to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts by reviewing, once again, the origins of the Moscow \nTreaty. At the time that President Putin and President Bush met in May \nof last year, Russia had made the decision that the distinguished \nMinister of Defense of Russia, Sergei Ivanov, announced that the \nRussians would be destroying warheads in a matter of course, \ndismantling them from missiles. President Bush had indicated that as a \nmatter of fact, unilaterally, the United States was prepared to do the \nsame. For a variety of reasons--some economic, some safety--both \ncountries had decided upon a course of action. When the two Presidents \ncame together to formulate their joint announcement, the Moscow Treaty \nwas formed.\n  As has been pointed out, first it was not clear that a treaty would \nbe formulated, but ultimately both leaders decided that was the best \ncourse. That is why the treaty is simple. It, clearly, does not cover \nall of the objectives of arms control that can be covered in further \nnegotiations, and many of us hope there will be further negotiations, \nnot only in the nuclear area but in the biological area where in the \ncourse of this we have pointed out there is still a lack of \ntransparency on the part of the Russians, as we perceive it at certain \nmilitary facilities.\n  In the case of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts as a way of shoring up a treaty that he has \ncriticized, let me say that the major verification procedure now in \nplace is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, very specifically. \nAt Surovatika, Senators and Members of the House have witnessed four \nmissiles coming into that plant each month. They are destroyed. \nClearly, the warheads have been separated from the missiles prior to \nthat destruction. That four-a-month situation is going to continue \nunless for reasons of our own parliamentary procedure we stop the \nfunding.\n  Clearly, you can verify the missiles. In my last visit to the site, I \nwas accompanied by the governor of the territory, the mayors of various \ntowns and radio stations in Russia. Why? Because this is a jobs issue. \nRussians employ people destroying missiles. Nothing very secret about \nit; they are swarming around. A television station from Indianapolis, \nchannel 13, accompanied me on that occasion, took pictures of the \nentire process and put it on a remarkable documentary on Indianapolis \ntelevision.\n  We need to catch up with where verification is in the world. It is on \nthe ground, with Americans working in cooperative threat reduction with \nRussians.\n  The missiles that come in are interchangeable SS-17s, SS-18s, and SS-\n19s. We visited with plant officials about their further planning on \nSS-24s and 25s. This is the comprehensive scope of what we are talking \nabout. These are, in fact, the missiles on which the warheads were \nlocated and from which they have been separated.\n  In a future treaty the United States and Russia may decide they wish \nto go much further with regard to the destruction of the warheads \nthemselves. That point has been made by many Senators that the treaty \ndoes not call for the destruction of warheads. But, in fact, warheads \nare being destroyed by Russia and by the United States.\n  In terms of both of our countries, we have decided not to have \ntransparency to the point that both nations are inspecting that \nprocess, but we are able to verify the results. I point out that the \nintelligence report that perhaps the Senator is calling for may be \ncovered in large part by the cooperative threat reduction annual report \nto Congress. This one is for fiscal year 2002, a detailed summary not \nonly of nuclear dismantlement and demolition but, likewise, anything we \nare doing in chemical and biological, too.\n  I admit there are areas, as I have said earlier, that we are not into \nyet, and we wish we were. My hope is we will be successful as two \nnations in seeing eye to eye on movement in that direction.\n  When it comes, however, to the verification of this Moscow Treaty, it \nflows from the fact that both nations of their own will want to destroy \nthe missiles and separate the warheads and thus reduce the viability of \nthese situations. We have indicated at our own time, at our own speed, \nwe will do that. And the linchpin from the beginning, it seems to me, \nis the fact not only of the START requirements that do expire in 2009 \nbut the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program on the ground which has no \nexpiration unless Congress decides to terminate it. That is a different \ndebate and a different set of decisions.\n  I am hopeful Senators will understand that. I appreciate the fervent \nplea for verifiability for all of us. As I say, I admit, I wish we had \na better insight into the disposition of all of the warheads, but even \nhere both Russians and Americans indicate in the fullness of time that \nthese warheads have to be destroyed. In large part that is because \nsometimes the fuel components in them are unstable. They become a \ndanger for the nation that is simply holding them.\n\n  This is not a sporting goods situation of inert matter on shelves. \nThese, unfortunately, are far too living, viable, dynamic instruments. \nThis is why we have worked with Russia on the fissile material that \ncomes from the destruction of these warheads; to provide storage for \nthat. It is a whole new set of problems.\n  Some arms control people have suggested that while the warhead is on \nthe missile, you do not have the problem of fissile material that might \nget loose and be bought or sold. It is contained. That is still true \nwhile it is in the warhead. As it comes out of the warhead, a whole new \nset of problems is created--\n\n[[Page S3236]]\n\nof storage and of accountability. We are working with the Russians \nthrough our Department of Energy on these accountability projects, \nwhich are intense and vigorous.\n  For these reasons, I oppose the amendment of the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts. I hope other Senators will oppose it. It \nappears to me to be unnecessary. I would say, simply, other criticisms \nof the treaty are certainly a matter of the opinion of the Senator, but \nit was a modest treaty. It came from the volition and the will of both \ncountries coming together at their own time, at their own speed, and \nwith procedures that seem to me to offer an adequate amount of \nverifiability, much of it on the site and through the eyes of the \nRussian press, as well as our own.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the chairman of the committee knows, I \nhave so much respect for him. We rarely have disagreements.\n  In essence, he sort of made my case just now. I have never argued \nabout the destruction of some of the missiles that are going in. I \ntalked about the warheads and fissionable material. Fissionable \nmaterial is not in the missile; it is in the warhead. The distinguished \nchairman just said, I wish we had a better sense of the disposition of \nthose warheads. I wish we had a better sense of the disposition of \nthose warheads.\n  All I am asking for is that we ask our intelligence communities. Is \nthe Senate scared of asking its own intelligence community for a report \non our capacity to know where those materials are and what is \nhappening? That is all I am asking.\n  On the floor of the Senate, I cannot go into what we have heard in \nprivate, in classified sessions. But this amendment is based on my \nknowledge of what our intelligence community is concerned about and \nwhat I believe we ought to be concerned about in this country. So as \nthe chairman says, I wish we had a better sense of what is happening to \nthose warheads.\n  If we are willing to go to war in Iraq because we think it is \ndangerous for that man to have nuclear warheads, and we know that 15 \nout of some 20 efforts to transfer this material has come from Russia, \nwe better be concerned about these warheads. That is what this is \nabout. That is precisely what involves the security of the people of \nthe United States of America, and that is what this amendment is about.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote in \nrelation to the Kerry amendment, No. 255, occur at 5:40 today, and the \ntime until then be equally divided in the usual form, provided that no \nfurther second-degree amendment be in order to the amendment prior to \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I add one final argument, and that is the \nactual text of the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts requires these intelligence reports on the capability of \nthe United States to monitor the compliance of the Russian Federation \nto the requirements of the treaty.\n  The treaty does not require insight into the warhead destruction. \nThat is a desirable aim, and I have indicated in due course we may be \nable to negotiate that, but that is not a part of this treaty. \nTherefore, the report that is being asked for really asks for \ninformation that is not covered by the treaty.\n  I repeat, the information that is covered by the treaty, it seems to \nme, is really adequately monitored by the cooperative threat reduction \npersonnel.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I yield to the distinguished Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Let me, as we say in \nthis body, associate myself with the remarks of my colleague and say it \nin a slightly different way. The Senator is asking us to have the \nintelligence community monitor something that there is no capacity to \nmonitor because there is no provision in the treaty requiring the \nmonitoring. It is a little bit like saying we would like the President \nto report to us, on a yearly basis, the cost of the destruction or \ndismantling or taking off of alert or removing from a silo every \nmissile that is removed by the Russians.\n  That would be great, but it is not in the treaty. There is no \nprovision.\n  Regarding the ultimate criticism, the primary criticism the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts makes of the treaty is accurate. There is not much \nto this treaty. There is not much to it. As I said in my very long \nopening statement, the administration, when they testified before the \ncommittee, said: Look, we were going to do this anyway. We were going \nto do this anyway. So we told the Russians, in effect paraphrasing the \nSecretary of State, we told the Russians if you want to come along, \ncome along; if you don't, you don't.\n  The whole rationale of this administration is the bet that the cold \nwar is over, it is truly and forever behind us. I hope they are right. \nThis treaty affords few protections in the event of a heightened \nmistrust that develops, or a crisis. It doesn't have any protections. \nSo we are not kidding each other, between now and 2012 the Russians \ncould go out, if they were capable of doing it financially, and build \n10,000 more nuclear weapons. They could dig 40,000 more holes for \nsilos, if they had the money. There is nothing in this treaty that \nprevents that.\n  I know we are all railing against what the treaty should have been; \nwhat, if we personally were negotiating it, we would have done. But, \nunfortunately, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, he has a tough \ncall the rest of us must make. If you don't like what is in it, and \nthere is a great deal that is not in it that we would like to have in \nit, vote against it. Vote against it. But you can't fix something that \nis not broken, in effect--the treaty has no verification. It has no \nrequirement the warheads be destroyed. There is no requirement they be \naccounted for. There is no requirement that there, in fact, be any \nprogress shown until December 31, 2012.\n  If you view all of these deficiencies as fatal flaws, then vote no, \njust flat vote no because you cannot fix them. You cannot fix them. The \nonly way I think we could fix them is if we get the administration and \nRussia and the United States on a positive track here. We have them on \na track. The track is that upon which we have agreed. As Sam Nunn said, \nthis is a good-faith treaty. That is the bottom line.\n\n  The reason I am for this treaty is failure to ratify it, I believe, \nwill be read as bad faith. Ratifying it demonstrates good faith, and \nour hortatory language--the message we have sent personally in terms of \neach individual Senator speaking to the administration--the language in \nour declarations and conditions and the amendments on the floor makes \nit clear to the administration that there is clearly a majority of \nMembers of the Senate who would like to see more done. We are not \ncriticizing what has been done. We just would like more done.\n  I understand the frustration. Believe me. I understand the \nfrustration. The greatest concern--and I think we have taken care of \nit--is if, in fact, the Russians do not have the engineering and/or \nfinancial capability of meeting the commitment they have made to reduce \ntheir deployed forces, we will help them. That is the best thing we can \ndo. That is what we have done.\n  I suggest we should support this treaty and we should oppose this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the \ndistinguished ranking Member. Let me be very clear. I am not asking for \nanything to be done here that isn't monitoring of this treaty. If you \nlook on page 2 of my amendment, it says I am looking for ``an estimate, \nfor each strategic nuclear weapons system in the Russian Federation, of \nthe confidence of the United States, whether low, medium, or high, in \nthe capability of the United States to monitor the deployed warheads of \nsuch systems.''\n\n[[Page S3237]]\n\n  I am looking for ``an assessment of the capability of the United \nStates to monitor the compliance of the Russian Federation with the \nrequirements of the Treaty.''\n  This is to make sure we can see that this treaty, as the minority \nranking Member has called it, as limited as it is--I am trying to \nmaking sure we can comply and know that we have the ascertainment of \nour intelligence community with respect thereto.\n  That is precisely what my amendment does.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 256\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I expect to take just a few minutes. I will \nbe offering an amendment and then having a colloquy. I send an \namendment to the desk on behalf of myself, Senator Daschle, Senator \nAkaka, and Senator Nelson of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] for himself, Mr. \n     Akaka, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Nelson of Florida, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 256.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide an additional element in the annual implementation \n                                report)\n\n       In section 2, in paragraph (2)(F), strike ``; and'' and \n     insert a semicolon.\n       In section 2, redesignate paragraph (2)(G) as paragraph \n     2(H).\n       In section 2, after paragraph (2)(F), insert the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       (G) with respect to the strategic offensive reductions \n     described pursuant to subparagraph (B) for a calendar year, a \n     listing of--\n       (i) the total number of each type of strategic offensive \n     nuclear warhead that will be in the nuclear weapons stockpile \n     of the United States during the calendar year, and the total \n     number of each type of strategic offensive nuclear weapon \n     that will operationally deployed by the United States during \n     the calendar year;\n       (ii) the number and type of nuclear warheads in the United \n     States that are dismantled during the previous calendar year; \n     and\n       (iii) to the extent possible, the total number of each type \n     of strategic offensive nuclear warhead that will be in the \n     nuclear weapons stockpile of the Russian Federation during \n     the calendar year, and the total number of each type of \n     strategic offensive nuclear weapon that will be operationally \n     deployed by the Russian Federation during the calendar year.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, condition 2 of the Resolution of \nRatification requires the President to submit to the Committee on \nForeign Relations and the Armed Services Committee an annual report \nthat would include, among other things, the following: A, a listing of \nthe strategic nuclear weapons force levels of the United States and a \nbest estimate of the strategic nuclear weapons force levels of the \nRussian Federation as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year; B, \na detailed description, to the extent possible, of strategic offensive \nreductions planned by each party for the current calendar year.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that those elements of \nthe report should include certain important information on \noperationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads.\n  I have discussed this matter with Senators Lugar and Biden, and I \nthink we can address the issue satisfactorily with a colloquy between \nmyself and Senators Lugar and Biden.\n  My question of Senator Lugar is the following: Will the committee \nurge the administration to include under the annual reporting \nrequirements required by conditions 2(a) and 2(b), that the Committees \non Foreign Relations and Armed Services would receive information on \nthe following: During the calendar year of the report, the specific \nnumber and type of warheads that are planned to be no longer \noperationally deployed; secondly, during that current calendar year, \nthe planned total size and makeup of the stockpile of strategic nuclear \nwarheads by number and by type; and as to the past year, the report \nwould then, hopefully, include and be urged to include by Senators \nLugar and Biden the total number and type of any warheads that were \ndismantled during the preceding calendar year?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to respond to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan. Our report does not require \ninformation on those warheads that are not operationally deployed. We \nwould urge the administration to provide this information.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I may respond to my colleague, I am not \nsure whether condition 2 requires the executive branch to list force \nreductions or force levels by warhead types. But I certainly think it \nis a good idea to do so, and I would urge the administration to do so.\n  In addition, I think the administration should make a decision on \nwarhead dismantlement. Quite frankly, my support for ratification of \nthis treaty is based in part on the administration's assurance before \nour committee that at least some warheads removed under the treaty will \nbe destroyed or dismantled, and I fully expect the administration to \nlive up to this. So I think the Senator is making a very valid point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank both Senators for the assurance that they will \nurge the administration that the reporting provided for under the \nResolution of Ratification would hopefully include the information I \nhave just outlined.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 256, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I now withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n              Alert Status of U.S. Russian Nuclear Forces\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from \nDelaware and the Senator from Indiana some questions about one of the \nissues that was raised during the hearings conducted by his committee \non this treaty, and one of the questions not addressed by this treaty \nthat I believe to be critical to reducing the danger of accidental or \nunauthorized nuclear war: the alert status of U.S. and Russian nuclear \nforces.\n  Like me, I know that they are concerned that the current alert status \nof\n\n[[Page S3238]]\n\nU.S. and Russian nuclear forces leaves open the possibility that, by \ncontinuing to maintain those nuclear forces that will not be \noperationally deployed under the Moscow Treaty on so-called hair \ntrigger alert status, we increase the chances of an accidental or \nmistaken launch of nuclear weapons or, worse still, provide additional \nvulnerability to terrorist who might seek to hack into our nuclear \ncommand and control system and launch weapons.\n  I was pleased to note that the report of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee on this treaty addresses the concerns that the alert status \nissue creates for crisis stability raised by former Senator Nunn, and \nthe suggestion made by Gen. Eugene Habiger, the former Commander in \nChief of U.S. Strategic Command that ``We may have to find a way to \nmove more weapons off alert status''.\n  What are the views of the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nIndiana on this issue, and the desirability of moving nuclear weapons \noff alert status?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think that the new relationship between \nthe United States and Russia can only be improved by taking nuclear \nweapons off alert status. By giving decision makers more time to react \nto disturbing information, this would lower the risk of a nuclear war \ncaused by one side's mistaken belief that the other was attacking it. I \nam especially impressed, moreover, by the fact that Gen. Eugene \nHabiger, former Commander in Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command feels \nthat the time has come to do this. I would note, however, that General \nHabiger warned that existing specific de-alerting proposals were often \nnot viable.\n  Mr. LUGAR. During our hearings on the treaty, a number of witnesses \nexpressed concern about the alert status of U.S. strategic nuclear \nwarheads. As the United States and Russia enter a new era of friendship \nand cooperation, we must take a close look at what we can do, in a safe \nand effective manner, to take nuclear weapons off alert status and \nprevent an accidental nuclear launch due to a false alarm or a \nmiscalculation. I know our friend and former colleague Senator Sam Nunn \nexpressed hope in our hearings that we might address the cold war-era \nnuclear postures of the United States and Russia as a critical next \nstep following ratification of the Moscow Treaty.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. In addition to recommending an ``immediate \nstanddown'' in the alert status of the nuclear forces reduced under \nthis treaty, it is my understanding that in his testimony, General \nHabiger also suggested that a system to take weapons off alert status \nin ways that make sense, are transparent, and do not compromise our \nsecurity be designed by teams by people who actually build the weapons.\n  Given this commonsense recommendation--and the failure of the treaty \nto address this question--I would like to ask the Senator what action \nhe would recommend the Senate take to make General Habiger's suggestion \na reality? What measures, if any, does he plan to address this issue in \nan appropriate manner this Congress?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Foreign Relations Committee's report encourages the \nPresident to establish a commission of weapon system experts to \nundertake the review that General Habiger proposed. It adds that if the \nPresident does not do so, Congress could usefully act on its own, \neither to establish such a commission or, perhaps, to commission the \nNational Academy of Sciences to set up such a group.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator from Delaware is correct, and while we have \nnot determined precisely how to proceed, I expect that we will want to \nencourage action by the President before we move on our own. Such a \nmeasure could be offered as an amendment to major legislation such as \nthe Department of State authorization bill.\n  I can say with confidence that Senator Biden and I are agreed that we \nshould continue to pursue this initiative in ways that will provide \nproductive results.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from the Delaware and the Senator \nfrom Indiana for their leadership and hard work on this issue, and I \nlook forward to continuing to work with him, on additional legislation, \nif need be, to pursue this initiative.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to engage the distinguished \nleadership of the Foreign Relations Committee in a colloquy.\n  Mr. President, for the past several years I have been increasingly \nconcerned about the ``loose nuke'' threat presented by the Russian \nFederation's arsenal of non-strategic or ``tactical'' nuclear warheads. \nUnlike strategic nuclear forces, intermediate range nuclear forces, or \neven conventional forces in Europe, tactical nuclear arms are not \ncovered by any arms control treaty. There are no formal negotiated \nlimits of any kind, no way to hold current and future Russian leaders \nto the unfulfilled promises of steep reductions made by former Soviet \nPresident Gorbachev and former Russian President Yeltsin more than a \ndecade ago. In fact, we do not even have a good estimate of how many \ntactical warheads Russia has because the United States has no \ninspection rights. Unclassified estimates of the current Russian \nstockpile have ranged widely, from 7,000 warheads to 18,000 warheads--\nfour to eleven times as many as the United States. I am very troubled \nby the insufficient security at Russian nuclear warhead storage \nfacilities and al Qaida's known interest in acquiring these horrific \nweapons. Am I right to understand that my colleagues share this \nconcern?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I share the concern voiced by the senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota on the potential proliferation threats posed by non-\nstrategic nuclear weapons in Russia. As the Senator knows, the United \nStates has voiced serious concerns about the safety and security of \nthese dangerous weapons stored at multiple locations around Russia. I \nbelieve the Russian tactical nuclear weapons arsenal represents an area \nof concern and needs attention.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I agree with the Senator from North Dakota and the \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Lugar. During \nhearings last year on the Treaty of Moscow now before the Senate, \nseveral of our distinguished witnesses mentioned Russia's tactical \nnuclear stockpile, including former Senator Nunn. The smaller size and \ngreater number of these weapons puts them at higher risk for theft by, \nor illicit sale to, terror networks such as al-Qaida.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleagues, who perhaps remember that in 1998 \nI authored legislation passed by Congress that identified Russia's \ntactical nuclear stockpile as a serious proliferation threat and called \nfor United States pressure on Russia for real reductions. I was \ntherefore disappointed that a requirement for Russian tactical warhead \ndismantlement and United States inspection rights were not part of the \nTreaty of Moscow. The disconnect between the ability of the United \nStates to maintain current strategic force levels almost indefinitely, \nand Russia's inevitable strategic nuclear decline due to economic \nrealities, gave our side enormous leverage that I believe we should \nhave used to win Russian concessions on tactical nuclear arms. While I \nam encouraged that the resolution of ratification before us includes a \ndeclaration on accurate accounting and security, it does not mention \nRussian tactical nuclear reductions. I have prepared a corrective \namendment and would welcome the support of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his work on this \nimportant issue and his thoughtful invitation. I would ask that the \nSenator from North Dakota withhold his amendment with the understanding \nthat the Foreign Relations Committee will make a serious effort to \nelevate the matter of Russian tactical nuclear weapons to a top \npriority on our Nation's arms control and threat reduction agenda.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the chairman and ranking member be willing to hold \nhearings in the coming months focusing on the threats associated with \nRussia's tactical nuclear stockpile? Furthermore, would the chairman \nand ranking member be willing to join me in urging the President to \ndevelop a comprehensive plan to reduce the Russian tactical threat, \nincluding making Russian tactical warhead reductions a priority in our \ndealings with the Russian Federation?\n\n[[Page S3239]]\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. The ranking member and I have plans to hold hearings on \nthe continued proliferation challenges in Russia. Clearly the threat \nposed by tactical nuclear weapons would be an important topic to be \ndiscussed and investigated in that forum. I believe that tactical \nnuclear warhead reductions should be a top United States priority in \nour new relationship with Russia.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the chairman and ranking member consider sharing \ntheir views on the threats posed by the proliferation of tactical \nnuclear weapons with the administration? Might I propose a letter \nindicating our shared concerns and our hopes that this issue will be a \nhigh priority for the administration in future discussions with Russia?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator for his thoughts. This issue was \nraised repeatedly during our hearings on the Treaty. I am confident of \nthe administration's efforts to engage Russia on this issue. I would be \nhappy to reinforce the committee's views on these issues with the \nappropriate Administration officials.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me echo the comments on the chairman. After entry into \nforce of the Moscow Treaty, getting a handle on Russian tactical \nnuclear weapons must be a top arms control and non-proliferation \nobjective of the United States Government. I look forward to joining \nthe chairman in holding hearings on this matter and in writing to the \nadministration with the Senators from Indiana and North Dakota. A \ncomprehensive approach to this problem, as the senior Senator from \nNorth Dakota suggests, is sorely needed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleagues for their concern about this clear \nand present ``loose nuke'' threat and for their supportive statements \ntoday. We cannot afford for this blind spot in our non-proliferation \nefforts to go uncorrected. With the assurances of the chairman and \nranking member, I withdraw my amendment and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the treaty between the United States of \nAmerica and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions \nalso known as the ``Moscow Treaty'' obligates each side to reduce the \nnumber of its strategic offensive nuclear warheads to a range of 1,700 \nto 2,200 by the end of 2012. This treaty is a good beginning and I \ncongratulate the President for making a complete break with past arms \ncontrol approaches by placing reliance on deterrence and missile \ndefense. The enemies of American must clearly understand that they \ncannot attack or threaten us with impunity and that our Nation will \nhave a national missile defense in place as soon as possible.\n  President Reagan coined the phrase ``trust but verify,'' This phrase \ncould have no greater meaning than when it is applied to the Moscow \nTreaty.\n  I recently returned from Moscow where I was deeply impressed by the \ndramatic transformation underway in that huge country. While there is \nno doubt that Russia is on the track towards democracy and a free \nmarket economy, it is equally clear to me that the Russians are not at \nthe stage where they can be given a blank check to implement the Moscow \nTreaty. Congress has authorized more then $4.7 billion for U.S. \nprograms aimed at helping Russia and other newly independent states to \nreduce the threats from their weapons of mass production. The Moscow \nTreaty does not expressly deal with the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \nReduction program but the objectives of the treaty cannot be achieved \nwithout extending this assistance to Russia. The only certainty about \nfuture costs to implement this treaty is that the costs are uncertain \nand that the uncertainty goes toward how much higher costs will be. \nAccording to a GAO report issued this week, ``. . . a pilot facility to \ndestroy 14 percent of Russia's chemical weapons over an 11-year period \nwould cost the United States almost $890 million--an increase of about \n$150 million from the estimate . . .'' Higher program cost uncertainty \nis compounded by Russia's apparent inability to pay for its agreed-upon \nshare of project costs.\n  Another problem with an effective reduction of weapons of mass \ndestruction is that Russia is not always willing to provide access to \nits sensitive national security sites. Access is essential to verify \nthat the Parties are living up to their part of the agreement. \nAccording to the same GAO report, U.S. inspectors do not have access to \nthe sites in Russia where 90 percent of the materials used in weapons \nof mass destruction are stored. Access issues largely revolve around \ntrust, and, frankly, this treaty highlights the need for access; it \ndoes not solve the problem.\n  Despite its obvious incompleteness and inadequacies, the Moscow \nTreaty is a step in the right direction of reducing and limiting \nstrategic nuclear warheads. Reliance on a START I verification regime \nas provided in the treaty is not, of course, satisfactory, but it can \nprovide a block in the foundation for good faith implementation through \na genuine verification scheme.\n  President Bush is headed in the right direction in working to build a \nconstructive partnership with Russia. American does not fight wars with \ndemocracies. While a reduction in nuclear weapons is an important \nelement on both sides in building the trust and mutual dependence \nneeded for a stable, long-term relationship, I want to stress the \nimportance of maintaining the Nuclear Triad. Our land-base missile \nsystems, in particular, play an essential role in ensuring this \nNation's security. With 200 Minuteman III missiles, Malmstrom Air Force \nBase, in my State of Montana has and will continue to play a critical \nrole in our national security.\n  The Moscow Treaty deserves the advice and consent of the Senate so \nlong as it is seen as the beginning and not the end of the long path we \nmust follow to rid the earth of weapons of mass destruction and threats \nto our national security.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is one of those ironies of history that \nthe U.S. Senate began debate on the ratification of the latest and \nhistoric arms control treaty on the day that historians mark as the \n50th anniversary of death of Stalin. Whether, in fact, Stalin died on \nthis day, or whether he had been poisoned a few days before, is a fact \nthat, like so many others of Soviet history, is clouded with \nuncertainty. But it is a fact that he was one of the most brutal \ndictators of the 20th century and he died at a time when the Soviet \nUnion was a global foe of the United States.\n  More interesting for this debate, Stalin's death in 1953 occurred at \na time when our nations were just beginning a strategic competition \nthat would see our nuclear stockpile grow to massive and frightening \nlevels before we reached our first accommodations, nearly 20 years \nafter Stalin's death.\n  Today, while we still have many cultural and political differences \nwith the Russian state, we cooperate on more issues than we compete, \nand we do not compete under the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n  A decade ago, the Soviet Union went to the dustbin of history, and \nwith it went an ideological enmity that locked us in a spiral of \ngrowing nuclear arsenals and the existential comfort of mutually \nassured destruction, a comfort that made sense to the strategic \nthinker, but left of lot of other people all over the world, including \nin our own societies, feeling quite insecure.\n  After President Nixon initiated an era of arms control agreements \nwith the first Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty, or SALT, the pendulum \nbegan to swing the other way. And, as is often the case with historic \npendulums, it far exceeded a sensible point. By the early 1980s, while \nstrategic arms treaties had already reduced the aggregate megatonnage \nof our combined strategic arsenals, a school of arms control theology \nhad been accepted that, as is often the case with the social science \ntheology of the moment, threatened to overcome all rationale thinking \non strategic issues. The answer to all arms control issues was always \nyet another treaty. Existing treaties were sacrosanct, with the wise \nold dictum so famously and wisely uttered by Bismarck in the 19th \ncentury ignored: ``At the bottom of all treaties is written in \ninvisible ink, rebus sic stantibus''--Until circumstances change.\n\n  Circumstances did change. Technologies barely imaginable in the \n1960s, when the first strategic treaties were contemplated, became \ncommonplace in the 1980s. An era of self-enforced vulnerability to \nmutually assured destruction, enshrined in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty, became anachronistic as physicists and engineers first\n\n[[Page S3240]]\n\nimagined missile defense and then a visionary president, Ronald Reagan, \ngrasped its potential to defend societies against missiles armed with \nweapons of mass destruction. In doing so, President Reagan reflected a \nvery American belief that know-how and new thinking can provide \nsecurity to those who never felt secure under mutual assured \ndestruction.\n  What bumpkins and dreamers, the conventional arms control theologians \ndeclaimed. Let us dismiss these simpletons and disparage their thinking \nas ``Star Wars,'' they said; as if the Strategic Defense Initiative had \nanything to do with stars or wars, but instead a more secure world here \non earth.\n  Today, it would be inaccurate to state that we have developed missile \ndefense to a functionally deployable state. But, we are closer to a \nfunctional stage than those who dismissed it out-of-hand ever imagined. \nThey were wrong and, today, our challenges to perfecting missile \ndefense are largely in engineering, no longer scientific. A grateful \nNation has President Reagan to thank for being able to transcend the \nconventional wisdom and believe in American creativity and technology \nto move us into a new strategic era.\n  But the arms control lobby would not relent, or even reform, through \nthe 1980s and 1990s. We had some good arms control agreements \nnegotiated, signed and ratified--I supported the START treaties. We had \nsome treaties that I believed did not enhance our security--and I voted \nagainst the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. While I have generally \nsupported the idea that bilateral and verifiable reductions of the \nstrategic arsenals of Russia and the U.S., preserving necessary \nstrategic arsenals of Russia and the U.S., preserving necessary \nstrategic force structures, was stabilizing and therefore in our \ninterest, I have never believed that this world would be more secure if \nthe U.S. handicapped its nuclear option.\n  Circumstances changed. Our global foe of 30 years ago is not our \nprimary threat today. The mutual assured destruction doctrine that held \nthe world in nuclear check for nearly 50 years became suspect, an old \nstrategic doctrine of vulnerability. New threats and new, vicious \nsubstate actors became the threats that brought us grief and anxiety.\n\n  We saw technologies spread to a host of rogue nations, many of which \nhold explicitly antagonistic postures toward the U.S. In 1998, a \ncongressionally mandated Commission To Assess the Ballistic Missile \nThreat to the United States, chaired by Donald Rumsfeld, brought to \nlight the fact that, ``concerted effects by a number of overtly or \npotentially hostile nations to acquire ballistic missiles with \nbiological or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to the U.S., its \ndeployed forces and its friends and allies.'' Further, the report \nconcluded that ``the threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging \ncapabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has \nbeen reported in estimates and reports by the intelligence Community.'' \nSuch clarity in assessment forced us to refocus the efforts of the \nIntelligence Community, and they responded.\n  But it also forced us to continued to challenge the conventional \nwisdom on arms control at the time, and that required that we face up \nto fact that we needed to proceed with our research and development of \na missile defense capability, and that, if we were serious about this, \nwe had to recognize that we would need to abandon the ABM Treaty.\n  One candidate for the 2000 presidential election shared the vision of \nPresident Reagan. He recognized that the ABM Treaty was not sacrosanct. \nIn fact, he had read the test, which plainly allowed for the U.S. to \nwithdraw. I don't know if President Bush knew the doctrine in \ninternational law of rebus sic stantibus, but President Bush certainly \nknew that the strategic situation had changed, and U.S. national \nsecurity required that we not constrain our security for tomorrow by a \nconcept from yesterday. Such an approach was to guarantee insecurity. \nAnd President Bush understood something fundamental about strategic \ndoctrine: insecurity does not sustain stability.\n  President Bush told us all that the days of the ABM were limited. And \nthe arms control lobby went, to make a bad pun, ballistic. Abandoning \nthe ABM Treaty with Russia would herald a new era of unrestrained \nnuclear competition, as both sides would try to outbid the other's \narsenal with enough weapons to overwhelm, they declared with certainty \nbread of doctrinaire conviction.\n  President Bush and his advisers didn't flinch in their thinking. But \nthey did address the question: If the fear is that withdrawing from the \nABM Treaty which we did--the U.S. withdrew from the Treaty on December \n13, 2001 and the Treaty was effectively terminated 6 months later--then \nthe U.S. will match our withdrawal from the ABM with a new proposal to \nlower the START II levels to historic new reductions.\n\n  And on March 24 of last year, the Russian Federation and the United \nStates concluded the Treaty on Strategic Offensive Reductions, which \nwill now be overwhelmingly passed as this body provides our advice and \nconsent.\n  This is a historic moment for nuclear arms reduction. It is, more \nimportantly and in my opinion, a historic moment in the evolution of \narms control doctrine.\n  The treaty reduces operationally deployed warheads for both sides to \na range of 1,700 to 2,200 by December 31, 2012. Today our arsenals are \nmore than twice that level. The reductions are to be implemented based \non the established START I verification regime and mechanism, which \nwill be in place until 2009. The treaty allows for consultation and \nextension of verification mechanisms beyond that time.\n  The Treaty allows either party to ``determine for itself the \ncomposition and structure of its strategic offensive arms,'' meaning \nthat we will be able to configure our triad according to the evolving \nneeds of our nuclear posture review. The treaty does not link the \nobjectives to our continued Cooperative Threat Reduction program, \nappropriately known as the Nunn-Lugar programs, recognizing all of the \nwork the current chairman of Foreign Relations Committee and our former \nDemocratic colleague have committed in their careers toward the cause \nof disarmament. I commend my colleagues on the Foreign Relations and \nArmed Services committees for engaging the administration in extensive \ndiscussions about continued support for this program. I strongly \napprove the administration's commitment to this program, and I will \ncontinue to support their budget for this.\n  Lord Palmerston said in the 19th century, ``We have no eternal allies \nand we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and \nperpetual.'' Our interests evolve year-by-year, and the world remains a \nvery hostile place. Russia competes with us geopolitically, but it does \nso in the Security Council, not in strategic arms.\n  It is in the interests of the world that our two arsenals be reduced, \nand it is in the interests of both of our countries that we reduce them \nwith transparency, and flexibility.\n  These principles are enshrined in the Moscow Treaty. I commend the \nadministration for concluding it with Russian administration, and I \nurge the Russian Duma to proceed with their own ratification, as I \nencourage my colleagues today to join me in support of this historic \ntreaty.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nratification of the Moscow Treaty which will require the United States \nand Russia to reduce the number of strategic nuclear warheads to 1,700 \nand 2,200 each by December 31, 2012. This treaty marks an important \nstep forward in the relationship between the United States and Russia \nand reduces the dangers posed by strategic nuclear weapons. \nNevertheless, I am concerned that the treaty does not go far enough and \nI believe its flaws must be addressed if we truly want to make the \nthreat of nuclear war a thing of the past.\n  It should be pointed out that at one time the administration did not \neven want a treaty, preferring to reach a ``gentleman's agreement'' \nwith Russia instead. I am pleased that President Bush changed course \nand recognized the value in committing the reduction of strategic \nnuclear warheads to a binding, legal document.\n  That document now before us is welcome but its brevity--all of three \npages--indicates that certain issues were left out or swept aside.\n\n[[Page S3241]]\n\n  First, the treaty does not actually require the United States or \nRussia to destroy any nuclear warhead. Either side may comply with the \nprovisions of the treaty simply by ``deactivating'' the warhead and \nplacing it in storage for possible redeployment. And, each side \nreserves the right to decide what exactly ``deactivation'' means.\n  This runs counter to the whole point of reducing the dangers of \nnuclear weapons by eliminating them once and for all. Have we really \nmade a step forward in securing a better world for ourselves and future \ngenerations if both sides can re-arm at a moment's notice? And have we \nreally made progress if the actual number of warheads destroyed is \nrather small?\n  Russia, for one, simply can not afford to maintain its current number \nof strategic nuclear warheads. But I am concerned that if we do not \nactively destroy more of our strategic nuclear warheads, Russia may \nfeel compelled to keep more of its own, thus diverting valuable \nresources away from more pressing needs. And, I think everyone \nrecognizes that Russia's ability to safely and securely store any \nwarheads is far less than our own and the potential that they may fall \ninto the wrong heads much higher.\n  Second, the treaty does not contain a detailed verification regime to \njudge compliance with its provisions. The treaty only mentions the \ncreation of a Bilateral Implementation Commission that will meet twice \na year. No more. The START Treaty, in contrast, contained provisions on \ndetailed notifications, regular data exchanges, onsite inspections, and \ncontinuous monitoring of select facilities.\n  President Reagan was found telling his Soviet counterparts that when \nit came to reducing the number of nuclear weapons, his motto was \n``Trust, but verify.'' Though the Soviet Union is no more and Russia \nand the United States have a new relationship based on friendship and \ncooperation, I believe President Reagan's words still ring true.\n  Eliminating nuclear warheads is serious business and it is beneficial \nand, necessary, even for friends, to closely monitor, and verify, the \nprogress of each side. We will enhance and deepen the trust and \ncooperation between Russia and the United States by doing so. So, I \nwould urge the administration to use the Bilateral Implementation \nCommission as a forum for negotiating a detailed verification regime.\n  Third, there is no timetable for implementation and no mileposts to \njudge progress before the Treaty expires. The only date and milepost \nmentioned is the deadline to reach 1,700 to 2,200 strategic nuclear \nwarheads by December 31, 2012.\n  Thus, over a 10-year period, with no verification regime, we will \nhave no indication on how Russia is achieving the goals of the treaty \nuntil the very day it is bound to reach those goals. And then the \ntreaty expires unless both sides agree at some point to extend it.\n  Again, trust and cooperation are built on verification and openness. \nI urge the administration to press for detailed timetables and \nmileposts to ensure that both sides are actively complying with the \nprovisions of the treaty and will reach the final marker at the stated \ntime.\n  Fourth, the treaty does not address tactical nuclear weapons. As my \ncolleagues know, there is a great deal of uncertainty about the number, \nlocation, and secure storage of Russian tactical nuclear weapons. \nSmaller and more portable than strategic nuclear weapons, they are \nvulnerable to theft or sale to terrorist groups. Yet, the treaty does \nnot even mention them.\n  This is a glaring oversight and the dangers posed by tactical nuclear \nweapons--especially now in the post-September 11 world of global \nterrorism--warrants the immediate attention and action by both Russia \nand the United States. I urge the administration to press for an \naccurate accounting of and adequate safeguards for tactical nuclear \nwarheads and to work towards reducing their number.\n  Finally, the treaty does not address the alert status of our nuclear \nforces. I offered, and withdrew, an amendment to address this issue \nearlier. Suffice to say that I am very concerned that in this era of a \nnew relationship between the United States and Russia, we still keep \nour nuclear weapons on high alert or hair trigger status. This greatly \nincreases the chances of an accidental or unauthorized launch or \nmiscalculation which would result in unthinkable devastation.\n  Clearly there are problems with this treaty but I will vote for \nratification because it is a step forward towards the goal of reducing \nthe dangers posed by strategic nuclear weapons.\n  But there is a lot of work to be done to make this Treaty truly \nworthwhile. As our former colleague Senator Sam Nunn stated in hearing \nheld by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Moscow Treaty:\n\n       If [the Treaty] is not followed with other substantive \n     actions it will become irrelevant at best and \n     counterproductive at worst.\n\n  I hope the administration will take these words to heart and get to \nwork on the important issues left out of the treaty so that we will be \nable to leave a world for future generations safer from the horror of \nnuclear war.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this resolution \nof ratification for the Treaty Between the United States of America and \nthe Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions, otherwise \nknown as the Moscow Treaty.\n  This treaty is a masterstroke. It represents, and, I am sure, will be \nsent as ushering in a wholly new approach to arms control for a wholly \nnew era. The simplicity of this treaty is a marvel. It is extremely \nbrief, indeed just three pages long. It is shorn of the tortured \nbenchmarks, sublimits, arcane definitions and monitoring provisions \nthat weighed down past arms control treaties.\n  This is for a very good reason. The simplicity and brevity of this \ntreaty reflect the simple fact that the US and Russia have moved beyond \nthe enmity of the cold war era. The treaty recognizes this fact. It \nassumes a degree of trust between nations that are no longer on the \nprecipice of war. Indeed, this treaty is the ultimate confirmation of \nthe fact that arms control does not lead to real peace; rather, real \npeace--in this case made possible by a democratic transformation in \nrussia--leads to arms control.\n  The old cold war approach to arms control treaties is clearly \noutmoded. Can anyone truly believe that a 700-page behemoth like the \nSTART I treaty is relevant to today's situation? Clearly, such an \napproach would not reflect today's radically changed political and \nstrategic environment. As such, it would not serve America's real \nsecurity needs.\n  This treaty does. The most important thing to remember about this \ntreaty is that it was negotiated after the United States independently \ndetermined the number of strategic warheads that were needed for our \nsecurity. The outcome of the negotiations with Russia simply ratified \nour own prior determination. This is in stark contrast to the old \napproach to arms control, whereby arms control agreements preceded and \nultimately drove our military and strategic decisions.\n  The long lead time for achieving reductions and the lack of sublimits \nand interim benchmarks in the treaty also serve our interests by \npreserving much needed flexibility. Looking at the fluid, almost \nchaotic, situation in the world today, with new threats having arisen \nin just the past year or so--attacks on our homeland, nuclear weapons \ndevelopments in North Korea and Iran--one can foresee that \ncircumstances could easily change over the next decade. If \ncircumstances and threats change, so too might our strategic nuclear \nrequirements. Thus, it is only prudent that we not box ourselves in. \nThe drafters of this treaty in the Bush administration were wisely \ncognizant of that fact.\n  Mr. President, this treaty--and the forward-looking, post-cold war \nmindset that serves as its basis--deserves our strongest support. I \nurge my colleagues to approve this resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I support ratification of the Moscow \nTreaty without any amendments or further conditions set upon it by the \nSenate. Ratifying this resolution as it was unanimously reported out of \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations is the right thing to do.\n  This treaty is a tremendous step forward in the effort to make this \nworld a safer place. This is especially significant in light of all \nthat is going on in the world with our fight against terrorism. It is \nespecially important and\n\n[[Page S3242]]\n\nsignificant to work in this way with the Russian Federation. This \ntreaty and mutual framework helps further align and strengthen the \ngrowing relationship between Russia and the United States. We should \nall be encouraged that Russia's Duma has made no reservations about \nthis treaty and is expected to approve it soon after the Senate \napproves it.\n  The Moscow Treaty reduces the aggregate number of operationally \ndeployed strategic nuclear warheads to a range of 1,700 to 2,200 by the \nend of 2012. This is a tremendous accomplishment that deserves the full \nsupport of the Senate and the Russian Duma. President Bush and Russian \nPresident Putin hold this as a high priority in getting this treaty \nratified in a timely manner.\n  This treaty was considered in a deliberative and thoughtful manner by \nthe Senate. The Foreign Relations Committee worked in conjunction and \ncooperatively with the Armed Services Committee and Intelligence \nCommittee. As well, the insights, reservations and recommendations on \nthis issue were solicited and received by Secretary of State Colin \nPowell, Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld, and Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Richard Myers.\n  The Moscow Treaty is unlike any arms control agreement we have \nparticipated in with Russia or the former Soviet Union before. \nPreviously, we spent decades with our counterparts in conferences and \nmeetings to negotiate treaties. This agreement was concluded more \nquickly--with openness, trust, and verification prevailing in a new era \nof American and Russian relations.\n  Traditionally, there have always been many objections to treaties \nsuch as these which limit our arms and possibly put the United States \nas risk. Now, we are hearing of some who have said this treaty is not \nstrong enough. And there has been some legitimate debate about the \nverification system and reduction schedule which I and many of my \ncolleagues share.\n  But I do not believe these concerns rise to the level to oppose this \ntreaty since it provides a mutual framework for pursuing the continued \ndestruction of weapons and missiles whose sole purpose was to be used \nagainst the Untied States. This treaty is too important to oppose. It \nhighlights and emphasizes the vitality of the new relationship between \nthe United States and Russia. And with the ongoing war on terrorism, \nthis is of utmost importance.\n  Like the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I believe our storage procedures are sound and I am thankful \nfor the flexibility within the treaty for our strategic systems. Yet I, \nlike many others, do share some concerns on the Russian side. But these \nconcerns are alleviated since the Treaty has avenues we can pursue \nwhich addresses these possible problems to ensure that weapons do not \never slip into the wrong hands. Also, I am thankful Russia is agreeable \nto work with the United States to ensure that these weapons never fall \ninto the hands of terrorists or rogue states.\n  Also, one certainly must pay attention to, and demand, a solid \nverification system for these weapons. Some point out that the treaty \nhas a flawed verification system that must be watched closely. But this \ncriticism has not reached the level of doubt and worry to scrap the \ntreaty. As well, those critics are operating under the guise of a cold \nwar mentality. But things have changed in our relationship with Russia.\n  Secretary Powell has been upfront on this issue in regards to the \nverification system in the Treaty. On behalf of the administration, he \nhas clarified the need to keep the verification process the way it is \nwithin the treaty. The administration points to the fact that the cold \nwar is over and we must move beyond that thought process. Also, \nSecretary Powell argues that we are better served with flexibility and \nnot rigidity under the treaty.\n  I believe the level of verification in this treaty is what is needed. \nWe do know that our American verification experts already have the \nSTART Treaty verification procedures underway. These experts and \nprocedures will be around for another decade. So, we do have \ndismantlement teams and equipment from the United States in Russia. \nThese teams have been and will continue to cooperatively--with \nverification--dismantle these Russian weapons.\n  Overall, I believe this treaty is in the national interest of the \nUnited States, the Russian Federation, and the world. Of course there \nare those critics who say this treaty does not go far enough, and some \nmay say it goes too far. The purpose of this treaty is not to put an \numbrella over all arms policy for all countries all at once. These \nobjectives and goals can be made through piecemeal approaches, and this \nis exactly what this treaty does.\n  We have a new ally with the Russian Federation, and we must move \nahead to strengthen our relationship with this new ally and make this \nworld a safer place. I urge my colleagues to support the Moscow Treaty \nwithout further conditions being set upon it. It is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I congratulate Senators Lugar and Biden \non their efforts on this treaty. In their new roles as chairman and \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, they have gotten off \nto an impressive start.\n  By holding a series of hearings on pressing foreign policy questions, \nincluding the looming war in Iraq, they have helped every Member of \nthis body and every American.\n  In addition, they have taken the Moscow treaty, a treaty that came to \nus with perhaps more questions than answers, and added some definition. \nTheir collective labors on behalf of this treaty demonstrate what \nbipartisanship leadership on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can \naccomplish.\n  This treaty represents a positive step forward by calling on the \nUnited States and Russia to reduce their operational strategic nuclear \nweapons.\n  But it is a step long overdue. Many in this body felt these kinds of \ncuts were possible years ago. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts \nfor much of the last decade, Republican opposition prevented us from \nimplementing the kind of cuts this treaty now recommends.\n  To ensure that we derive the maximum security benefit possible from \nthis treaty, the Administration will have to fill in a number of \nimportant holes.\n  Though the administration has assured us that some nuclear warheads \nwill be dismantled, the treaty itself does not require the destruction \nof any Russian or American nuclear warheads. At best, the treaty will \nput warheads out of reach, but, unfortunately, not out of use.\n  Moreover, the treaty does not include a schedule that spells out when \nthe deactivations must occur. In fact, the treaty language does not \nrequire the deactivation of a single weapon until December 31, 2012, \nthe day the Treaty expires.\n  Finally, the treaty also lacks any concrete commitments on \nverification, undermining longstanding, commonsense principle of our \narms control policy.\n  In years past during Senate discussion of other arms control \ntreaties, some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle based \ntheir opposition to these treaties on the lack of adequate verification \nprovisions. Evidently, either verification is no longer as important to \nthem or they are more willing to trust rather than verify.\n  Notwithstanding these shortcomings and inconsistencies, Mr. \nPresident, I intend to vote for the Resolution of Ratification, and I \ndo so because it points our country in the right direction.\n  But at the same time I would like to send a message as loudly and \nclearly as I can to the administration and to my colleagues here in the \nSenate: our work to deal with the threat posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction does not--in fact cannot--stop with this vote.\n  Last fall, the President's National Security Strategy stated that:\n\n       The gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads \n     of radicalism and technology. Our enemies have openly \n     declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction, \n     and evidence indicates that they are doing so with \n     determination.\n\n  We need look no further than the steadily escalating crisis in North \nKorea to recognize that the President was right on that point.\n  You will have to look much harder, however, to ascertain exactly what \nthe administration proposes to do about this crisis, let alone the \nlarger issue of proliferation worldwide.\n\n[[Page S3243]]\n\n  That is why last night I joined with several of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Lieberman and Biden, to introduce S. Res. 77, a \nresolution that calls on the administration to devise a comprehensive \nstrategy to confront the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  The Bush administration's policy to counter proliferation has \nsuffered from inconsistency. It downplays immediate threats, such as \nNorth Korea, while emphasizing others. It puts together a coalition \nagainst terrorism, but has ignored allies and undercut international \naction against proliferation. In sum, the administration's actions have \nserved to weaken the effort to establish a robust coalition against \nproliferation.\n  Since taking office, the Administration has been deeply ambivalent \nabout U.S. efforts to secure loose Russian nuclear weapons and \nmaterials and unemployed nuclear scientists. While focusing on Iraq, it \nhas ignored looming problems elsewhere, such as North Korea and Iran. \nAnd rather than seeking ways to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons, \nit pursues doctrines that would effectively lower the threshold for the \nuse of nuclear weapons, further compounding the threat of \nproliferation.\n  This is too dangerous a situation to ignore any longer. Our \nresolution calls for a comprehensive strategy--not unhelpful actions or \nad hoc reactions--to confront the threat proliferation presents to \nAmerican citizens.\n  Among other proposals, we urge the President to begin to build a \ncoalition against proliferation, immediately and directly engage North \nKorea, vastly increase the funding for U.S. programs that secure loose \nnuclear weapons, and deliver sufficient homeland security funds to the \nstate, local and tribal governments so they can prepare their first \nresponders to respond against further terrorist attacks.\n  The administration tells us that the Moscow Treaty represents a new \nkind of agreement, one that acknowledges we have emerged fully from the \ncold war era. We join the President in welcoming this new era.\n  But we must take this opportunity to create a comprehensive strategy \nthat recognizes we have entered a new and potentially dangerous era of \nproliferation.\n  To date the administration has failed in that effort. But we cannot \nafford to delay any longer.\n  Time is not on our side. The risks to our security mount with each \nday that passes without an administration strategy.\n  Mr. LUGAR. My understanding is the distinguished majority leader has \na statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senators Lugar and \nBiden for their excellent work over the past 2 days. I appreciate their \nleadership on this very important Resolution for Ratification of the \nMoscow Treaty.\n  The treaty is critically important to making the world a safer place \nand will lead to dramatic reductions in nuclear arsenals. I commend the \nchairmen. The next vote on the adoption of the Resolution of \nRatification will be the last vote of the evening.\n  In addition, there will be no rollcall votes during tomorrow's \nsession, although the Senate will be in session to allow Members to \nspeak in morning business. Many will be speaking on Iraq. If any \nMembers are interested, I encourage them to come to the floor to do so \ntomorrow. The next rollcall vote will be on Monday at 6 p.m.\n  I thank all Senators for their attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR.

The report shall be submitted in both \n     unclassified and, as necessary, classified form. (2) Annual \n     implementation report. Not later than 60 days after exchange \n     of instruments of ratification of the Treaty, and annually \n     thereafter on April 15, the President shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate a report on implementation of the \n     Treaty by the United States and the Russian Federation. This \n     report shall be submitted in both unclassified and, as \n     necessary, classified form and shall include\n       (A) a listing of strategic nuclear weapons force levels of \n     the United States, and a best estimate of the strategic \n     nuclear weapons force levels of the Russian Federation, as of \n     December 31 of the preceding calendar year;\n       (B) a detailed description, to the extent possible, of \n     strategic offensive reductions planned by each party for the \n     current calendar year;\n       (C) to the extent possible, the plans of each party for \n     achieving by December 31, 2012, the strategic offensive \n     reductions required by Article I of the Treaty;\n       (D) measures, including any verification or transparency \n     measures, that have been taken or have been proposed by a \n     party to assure each party of the other party's continued \n     intent and ability to achieve by December 31, 2012, the \n     strategic offensive reductions required by Article I of the \n     Treaty;\n       (E) information relevant to implementation of this Treaty \n     that has been learned as a result of Strategic Arms Reduction \n     Treaty (START) verification measures, and the status of \n     consideration of extending the START verification regime \n     beyond December 2009;\n       (F) any information, insufficiency of information, or other \n     situation that may call into\n\n[[Page S3244]]\n\n     question the intent or the ability of either party to achieve \n     by December 31, 2012, the strategic offensive reductions \n     required by Article I of the Treaty; and\n       (G) any actions that have been taken or have been proposed \n     by a party to address concerns listed pursuant to \n     subparagraph (F) or to improve the implementation and \n     effectiveness of the Treaty.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS.\n\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to the ratification of \n     the Moscow Treaty is subject to the following declarations, \n     which express the intent of the Senate:\n       (1) Treaty interpretation. The Senate reaffirms condition \n     (8) of the resolution of ratification of the Document Agreed \n     Among the States Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed \n     Forces in Europe (CFE) of November 19, 1990 (adopted at \n     Vienna on May 31, 1996), approved by the Senate on May 14, \n     1997, relating to condition (1) of the resolution of \n     ratification of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) \n     Treaty, approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988.\n       (2) Further strategic arms reductions. The Senate \n     encourages the President to continue strategic offensive \n     reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with \n     national security requirements and alliance obligations of \n     the United States.\n       (3) Bilateral implementation issues. The Senate expects the \n     executive branch of the Government to offer regular \n     briefings, including consultations before meetings of the \n     Bilateral Implementation Commission, to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate on any implementation issues related to the Moscow \n     Treaty. Such briefings shall include a description of all \n     efforts by the United States in bilateral forums and through \n     diplomatic channels with the Russian Federation to resolve \n     any such issues and shall include a description of\n       (A) the issues raised at the Bilateral Implementation \n     Commission, within 30 days after such meetings;\n       (B) any issues related to implementation of this Treaty \n     that the United States is pursuing in other channels, \n     including the Consultative Group for Strategic Security \n     established pursuant to the Joint Declaration of May 24, \n     2002, by the Presidents of the United States and the Russian \n     Federation; and\n       (C) any Presidential determination with respect to issues \n     described in subparagraphs (A) and (B).\n       (4) Nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Recognizing the \n     difficulty the United States has faced in ascertaining with \n     confidence the number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons \n     maintained by the Russian Federation and the security of \n     those weapons, the Senate urges the President to engage the \n     Russian Federation with the objectives of\n       (A) establishing cooperative measures to give each party to \n     the Treaty improved confidence regarding the accurate \n     accounting and security of nonstrategic nuclear weapons \n     maintained by the other party; and\n       (B) providing United States or other international \n     assistance to help the Russian Federation ensure the accurate \n     accounting and security of its nonstrategic nuclear weapons.\n       (5) Achieving reductions. Recognizing the transformed \n     relationship between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation and the significantly decreased threat posed to \n     the United States by the Russian Federation's strategic \n     nuclear arsenal, the Senate encourages the President to \n     accelerate United States strategic force reductions, to the \n     extent feasible and consistent with United States national \n     security requirements and alliance obligations, in order that \n     the reductions required by Article I of the Treaty may be \n     achieved prior to December 31, 2012.\n       (6) Consultations. Given the Senate's continuing interest \n     in this Treaty and in continuing strategic offensive \n     reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with \n     national security requirements and alliance obligations of \n     the United States, the Senate urges the President to consult \n     with the Senate prior to taking actions relevant to \n     paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article IV of the Treaty.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to Senator Biden \nfor his leadership and management of this treaty and to all Members of \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee, including the distinguished occupant of \nthe Chair, and also Senators who contributed constructively to, I \nbelieve, a very important achievement.\n  I specifically mention staff Members who were most supportive and \nhelpful: Tom Moore, Ed Levine, Jofi Joseph, Brian McKenan, Jason Hamm, \nKen Myers, Sr., and Kenny Myers, Jr. We are appreciative of staff on \nboth sides of the aisle for a remarkable piece of work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as you know, Black History Month drew to a \nclose last week with the end of February. It was a month of much \ncelebration and many lessons. For me, it was also a time for \nreflection. I want to take this opportunity to speak for just a moment \nabout where we have been, where we are now and where we, as a nation--\n``under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all''--must go.\n  Black History Month actually evolved from Black History Week, \nestablished in 1926 through the tremendous efforts of Dr. Carter Godwin \nWoodson. He originally chose the second week of February because of its \nproximity to the birth dates of two great men whose role in the history \nof Black Americans are legendary: Frederick Douglass and Abraham \nLincoln. Dr. Woodson's goal was simple: to highlight the many \naccomplishments of African Americans and their history of contribution \nto the growth and success of the United States of America.\n  This year, as our Nation faces challenges unsurpassed in my own \npersonal memory, I would like to speak for a moment of what I hope and \npray our--this United States Senate--contributions will be.\n  The 20th century saw great strides forward in equality, civil rights \nand racial relations in America. These strides were made because \ndedicated men and women recognized what needed to be done to right \nwrongs--and then they went and did the right things--sometimes at the \nexpense of their own lives.\n  Recently, Darrell Green, former Washington Redskin great and future \nNational Football League Hall of Famer, told a group of Senators that \nknowing the right thing to do is easy. Doing the right thing takes a \nlot of commitment and very hard work. He reminded us that we are in the \nCongress to serve--and when we are gone, the world should be a better \nplace not just for a few, but for all people.\n  Twenty years from now, as our replacements in this Chamber celebrate \nBlack History Month, I hope they will have cause to celebrate the good \nthat we accomplished. I hope they will be able to celebrate the \nprogress we made in bringing people together. I hope they will \ncelebrate the fact that United States Senators of the 108th Congress \nled the way in spurning activities and speech designed to infect racial \nwounds, not heal them.\n  And I hope they will celebrate the fact that we, as today's leaders, \nmade great strides forward in parity in education and health care for \nall Americans.\n  We all know that education is the ultimate key to opportunity. Our \npublic education system is an unparalleled commitment by the United \nStates of America to our Nation's children. We need to make certain \nthat we provide them with the tools they must have to succeed. Their \nsuccess, after all, is vital to all of our future endeavors. If we are \nto make progress worth celebrating by future generations, we must do \nthe right things.\n\n[[Page S3245]]\n\n  We must also do the right things to reduce health disparities. It is \nsimply wrong that an African American male the same age as myself is \nsignificantly more likely than am I to contract heart disease. We need \nto provide not only research, but action in this area. Every American \ndeserves the highest quality health care, regardless of race.\n  I hope they will celebrate the fact that we fought an aggressive and \neffective war against AIDS, the plague of our time--and perhaps of all \ntime. A disease that disproportionately affects African Americans and \nindeed, the continent of Africa.\n  Mr. President, last month we celebrated the amazing accomplishments \nof African Americans throughout our history. Let us also celebrate a \njoint commitment to ensure that our contribution to Black history--\nreally, to American history--will be that we serve well, do what is \nright, and leave the world a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3245-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3245-S3246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DOUBLE TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak \nwith my colleagues as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging. Every \nperson in this Chamber, every Senator, has an abiding interest in the \nwelfare of America's seniors. The issue I wish to speak to this \nafternoon is, No. 1, how double taxation unfairly targets older \nAmericans and the disastrous effect of the dividend penalty on \ncorporate governance.\n  During the first week of February, the Aging Committee held a hearing \nentitled ``Tax Fairness: Does Double Taxation Unfairly Target Older \nAmericans?''\n  Those attending the Aging hearing learned that older Americans, both \nworking and retired, are subject to double taxation more than any other \nage group in the United States. Just yesterday, Larry Kudlow, \neconomist-spokesman on Fox News, a television commentator, was here to \nspeak to many of us on the issue of double taxation. Older Americans \nare literally being taxed to death by their own Government.\n  Let me share with you three reasons seniors are double taxed. The \nreality is, first, many seniors pay taxes twice on Social Security \nbenefits. Secondly, the Government collects the death tax when a senior \npasses on. Third, dividend income is also taxed twice; it is taxed once \nat the company level and again at the individual level. Older Americans \nare more likely to hold investments that pay dividends than any other \nage group. Over 70 percent of all taxable dividend payments are \nreceived by Americans age 55 and older.\n  Clearly, eliminating the dividend penalty will benefit older \nAmericans and seniors who have worked hard all of their lifetime, \nsacrificed, and saved a nest egg for their retirement. More than 9 \nmillion seniors age 65 years and older, many on fixed incomes, rely on \ndividend income to make ends meet from month to month. The average--and \nthis is an important figure because, remember, our critics are saying, \nbut this is just for the rich; remember, 9 million seniors, 65 years of \nage and older--dividend income for these taxpayers is a little over \n$4,000 per year. But $4,000 additional money per year for someone \nliving on a fixed income is a substantial amount of money.\n  Let me share with you the testimony of one of the witnesses at the \nAging Committee hearing, Dick Buxton from Idaho. Mr. Buxton was there \nto talk about the beneficial impact of ending double taxation on \ndividends and what it would do to his father and mother-in-law. His \nfather is 89 years old, a railroad retiree; his mother-in-law is 91 \nyears old and a retired schoolteacher. They both worked very hard all \ntheir lives, saved a little money, and invested in corporations that \npaid dividends as a part of their life savings to benefit their income.\n  They are not wealthy people. They are what is clearly part of the \nnumber I am talking about. They are not retired Wall Street investment \nbankers. They are not wealthy heirs to family fortunes. These are the \nmiddle-class seniors who were frugal throughout their lifetime and \nsaved a nest egg for retirement. These are the faces of seniors across \nthe country who should not be penalized for saving. That is what our \nPresident has said, and that is one of the reasons he has offered up \nthe opportunity to take down the double taxation of dividends. These \nare the kind of people who would benefit clearly from the abolition of \nthat double taxation.\n\n  Ending the dividend penalty not only benefits older Americans. It \ngives a much needed boost to our economy. It also makes corporations \nmore accountable. At the hearing, we learned that restoring trust in \nensuring the honest financial management of our Nation's companies is \nextremely important as an issue of this moment in our Nation's history. \nLarry Kudlow spoke very clearly to that issue yesterday, that it is a \nunique time in our Nation's investment history, and we need to give \nthis area of our economy a jolt. Improving confidence in our financial \nmarkets is critical to all workers, retirees, especially after the \nEnron and WorldCom debacles.\n  How would ending the dividend penalty improve corporate \naccountability? Well, dividends don't lie. You either have the cash to \npay them or you don't. Increases in dividend payments would provide a \nclear and unmistakable signal of a company's strength and viability in \nthe market to the average person who would invest in that company. No \ncorporate report, no message by a corporate executive saying: Here is \nwhat we are going to do, and here is how we are going to bump the \nstock, and here is the game we are playing for all of your investors as \nthe story. The story is, are we making a profit and are we paying a \ndividend. That is kind of the old way that created the stability in \ncorporate America that most investors began to rely on years ago.\n  Dividends signal stability. They encourage shareholders to hold for \nthe long term even when companies go through tough times. For example, \nBristol-Myers is a company that has gone through tough times recently. \nThe current annual dividend is $1.12, with a yield of about 5 percent. \nInvestors know Bristol-Myers is basically a sound, healthy, productive \ncompany.\n  The dividend is a big part of investor confidence in the long-term \nstrength of a company. The psychology of shareholders changes with \nshort-term to long-term as it relates to the value of dividends and \nwhen those dividends go up.\n  Dividends encourage internal investment in only the best ideas. \nDividends are taxed at a much higher rate than capital gains. The \nhigher dividend tax encourages companies to hoard cash rather than pay \nit out in dividends. The dividend penalty causes too much money to be \nchasing too few good investment ideas. We have seen that in spades as \ncompanies have come tumbling down as a result of bad decisions made by \ncorporate America.\n  One of our experienced witnesses known as an expert, Hillary Kramer, \nwho is often on television and has her own program, speaking to the \nstability of investment, spoke about United Airlines. Over the past \ncouple of decades, UAL invested their cash in Internet ventures and car \nrentals and hotels. United Airlines ventured out of their core \ncompetency; that is, getting people from one spot to another on an \nairliner, in part because the Tax Code pushed them in that direction. \nShareholders might have been better served if they had paid a higher \ndividend instead and stayed with the business of efficiently and safely \nmoving people through their airlines.\n  The dividend penalty diverts cash away from shareholders into bad but \ntax-favored activities. On the other hand, paying cash out in dividends \nencourages stockholders to channel the cash into the most productive \ninvestment opportunities available inside and outside the company. This \nencourages management to be more careful and prudent when investing \ncash. After all, this is cash that is owed to the stockholder or owned \nby the stockholder.\n  The dividend penalty encourages a dangerous buildup of debt and \ndiscourages using cash to finance internal investments. Heavy business \ndebt makes companies less stable. The cost of debt is artificially low \ncompared to using cash because of the double taxation of dividends. \nInterest payments on debt are subsidized by the Tax Code as an expense. \nIn other words, we encourage corporate indebtedness by this very \nmethod. Dividends, on the other hand,\n\n[[Page S3246]]\n\nare taxed now at a rate of nearly 70 percent, second highest in the \nworld. The first highest is Japan. The flattest, most stagnant, economy \nin the world today is Japan.\n  There is a simple and clear explanation. We all know that if we want \nmore of something, we subsidize it; if we want less of something, we \ntax it. Remember, heavy debt has been associated with many of the \nrecent large bankruptcies about which I have spoken.\n  You will remember that Enron had significant debt levels, among other \nthings, that it had most of its problems investing in a variety of \nareas outside of its core competence. The Tax Code encourages debt and \ndiscourages dividend payments.\n  The double taxation of dividends encourages the creation of \nnoncorporate entities. These noncorporate entities include partnerships \nand limited liability corporations. Again, Enron left many of its debts \noff the books. As a result, Enron overstated profits by some $400 \nmillion in its annual reports. Noncorporate entities do not pay double \ntaxes like corporations.\n  Many of the scandal-ridden companies that imploded over the past few \nyears had created several noncorporate entities--in part, to escape \ndouble taxation. Again, the Government says to do one thing--be honest \nand straightforward. But the same Government encourages complexity and \ndishonesty with its very own tax policy.\n  A year ago, Professor Jeremy Siegel of the Wharton School of Business \nwrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Nothing could possibly excuse Enron, Arthur Andersen and \n     other firms from their deceptive and fraudulent practices. \n     But cries for accounting reforms, transparent earning \n     reports, and audit independence will not amount to anything \n     [other than to slightly discourage this effort] if the U.S. \n     tax system encourages firms to do just [what Enron did].\n\n  The double taxation of the dividends is hurting efforts to prevent \ncorporate corruption. The frustrating thing is that even after enacting \ntougher penalties for corporate crooks, it may be wasted effort, unless \nwe end the double taxation penalty. The incentive is backward, Mr. \nPresident. If we have learned nothing over the past decades, we should \nhave learned that incentives do matter.\n  I would venture most of us in the Chamber agree that ending the \ndouble taxation of dividends is good for older Americans and it is good \ntax policy. It would be a shame for us to cast aside good policy \nwithout a fair and honest appraisal.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the effort to end the double taxation \nof dividends. We can help improve corporate accountability by proper \ntax policy, while greatly helping America's seniors.\n  In conclusion, I will quote one of the expert witnesses who testified \nat our hearing, Hilary Kramer:\n\n       Abolishing the double taxation of dividends is about \n     keeping companies honest, competent, and resourceful. . . .\n\n  I say we end the dividend penalty now for the sake of our seniors, \nwho are the savers and investors in stable investments, and who live on \nfixed incomes, and for the sake of returning trust to the governance of \ncorporate America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3246-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ARKANSAS TROOPS ACTIVATED FOR WAR ON TERROR AND IN MIDDLE EAST\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred March 2, \n2003, in New York City. Robert Spreng, 53, a resident of Manhattan's \nUpper East Side, was attacked at 4 a.m. as he walked home from a local \nbar. Spreng was followed by three men who approached him and screamed, \n``Faggot!'' Spreng raised his hands and said that he didn't want any \ntrouble, to which the assailants responded, ``Faggot, you're going to \nhave trouble tonight.'' Then the three men attacked Spreng, punching \nand kicking him. A witness called police, who were able to stop the \nbeating.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3246-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3246-S3247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNANIMOUS CONSENT CONSIDERATION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to James \n``Jim'' O'Toole for all of his hard work and efforts with the Parks and \nHistoric Preservation Subcommittee which I chair.\n  Born and raised in San Francisco, Jim O'Toole is a graduate of St. \nIgnatius College Prep and the University of San Francisco. After a 23-\nyear career with the National Park Service, he came to Washington, D.C. \nin 1987 as part of the U.S. Department of the Interior's Management \nDevelopment Program where he also served on a professional fellowship \nto the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. After the \ncompletion of his fellowship, Mr. O'Toole resigned from the Park \nService and assumed the roles as professional staff member for the \ncommittee. During his tenure in the Senate, he served as professional \nstaff for the minority for the Subcommittee on Public Lands, National \nParks and Forests from 1987 to 1994, and with the majority for the \nSubcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation and Recreation \nfrom 1994 until now.\n  Mr. O'Toole's primary issue responsibilities encompassed all work \nrelating to the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation \nand Recreation, including: oversight of the National Park Service and \nPark Police; Wild and Scenic Rivers; National Trails and Recreation \nAreas; Historic Sites and Preservation; Military Parks and \nBattlefields; Land and Water Conservation Fund; outdoor recreation \nresources; preservation of prehistoric ruins and objects of interests \non the public domain; concessions programs affecting federal land \nmanagement agencies; and various public land management issues. Over \nthe past fourteen years, the bulk of the Senate Energy Committee \nlegislation has been reported from the National Parks Subcommittee \nwhich Jim staffed. Mr. O'Toole was also the primary Senate staffer for \nH.R. 3248, the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Act of 1997, (P.L. 104-\n333). This law contains the precedent setting San Francisco Presidio \nlegislation which has been used as a template for similar private \nsector initiatives including the Oklahoma City Memorial and the Baca \nRanch in New Mexico.\n  More recently, Jim was instrumental in the passage of the Vision 2020 \nParks Restoration Act, P.L. 105-391. Vision 2020 represents the \nculmination of a three-year effort and the first major reform of the \nNational Park Service in more than 30 years, including an 11 year \neffort to reform the Agency's Concession Management Program.\n  After 14 dedicated years working for the Senate Energy Committee, and \nmore than 23 years with the National Park Service, it is with gratitude \nand great enthusiasm that I convey my personal thanks and appreciation \nto Jim O'Toole. I also announce that Jim is officially retired from his \nlife of public service as of today, and he will be joining the private \nsector.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to Mr. O'Toole and I wish him well \nwith all of his new ventures and future challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3247-2", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO FIRE CHIEF STEVE PAULSELL\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Fire Chief \nSteve Paulsell who for the past 25 years has been Chief of the Fire \nDistrict in Boone County, MO. When Mr. Paulsell became Fire Chief in \n1997, the fire department was volunteer and consisted of six stations \nand 50 firefighters. Under Chief Paulsell's supervision, the fire \ndistrict has become a national leader in fire and emergency service. \nChief Paulsell's departmental accomplishments include: growth from six \nto fourteen fire stations in 2003, over 300 volunteer personnel, \ncreation of one of 28 Federal Emergency Management Agency urban search \nand rescue task forces, an FBI accredited bomb squad, award-winning \nelementary school education life safety program, creation of fire and \nbuilding codes in Boone County, and original creator of the Joint \nCommunications 911 Center. Chief Paulsell's personal accomplishments \ninclude: International Association of Fire Chief's Fire Chief of the \nYear in 1996, chair of the Missouri Fire Service Alliance, National \nFire Academy course developer, and developer of Missouri State Fire \nMutual Aid system. In addition to these accomplishments, Mr. Paulsell \nhas testified on behalf of the Nation's fire service to the Senate.\n  Boone County Fire District Board President Willis Smith praises Chief \nPaulsell and states, ``He was the right man to lead our fire department \nin 1977 and he is still the right man to lead. He has the vision, \ninsight and leadership abilities to continue to grow this department.'' \nI commend Boone County Fire Chief Steve Paulsell for his dedicated \nservice to protecting and improving the quality of fire and emergency \nservices for Missourians, and for making the Boone County Fire District \na model for our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3247-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FILIBUSTERS ON JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last week in the Senate, I \nindicated that with the exception of Supreme Court nominees, I believed \nthat if a judicial nominee answers the questions posed to him or her \nand provides the Senate with the information needed in order for us to \nperform our constitutional role of advice and consent, I would not \nengage in a filibuster on the nomination.\n  I made this remark expecting that the so-called blue slip process \nwould be honored. That is, if a Senator from the nominee's home State \ndid not return a blue slip, that nominee would not have a hearing, \nwould not be considered in the Judiciary Committee, and would never \neven come before the full Senate. A filibuster would not be possible \nbecause the nomination would not leave the Committee.\n  After my remarks, however, something happened that makes me question \nthat assumption. I heard on good authority that hearings are being \nconsidered on nominees for whom a blue slip has not been returned.\n  Given this development, it is possible that the Senate could, in the \nvery near future, be asked to vote on a nominee for whom a blue slip \nwas never returned. At the time of my statement last week, I was not \naware that such an abrupt change in Senate practice was being \ncontemplated so seriously and so quickly.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, if a nominee were to come before the full \nSenate without a blue slip having been returned by a home State \nSenator, I reserve the right to participate in a filibuster on that \nnomination.\n  Furthermore, after I gave my statement last week, an incident \noccurred in the Senate Judiciary Committee that is of great concern to \nme and should be to the entire Senate. The rules of the Judiciary \nCommittee require at least one Member of the minority party to agree to \nend debate on a matter before the Committee. Despite this rule, and \ndespite the fact that no one on the Democratic side voted to end \ndebate, the Committee held a vote on two circuit court nominees anyway.\n  If Committee rules are going to be ignored--if the rights of the \nminority party and the interests of the minority party are trampled \nupon--this process is going to break down. It may take a filibuster in \nthe full Senate to ensure that the rules are followed.\n  Finally, Mr. President, when President Bush was elected, he pledged \nto govern from the center. Judicial candidates who are not moderate, \nmainstream nominees violate that pledge. I want to hold President Bush \nto his pledge, so I also reserve the right to filibuster a nominee who \nis far outside the mainstream.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3248-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3248]]\n                        TRIBUTE TO VICTOR BAIRD\n\n Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, in February my State lost one of \nits great citizens and the father of the Washington State wine \nindustry, Walter Clore.\n  My colleagues in the Senate may not know a fact that many wine \ndrinkers around the globe have learned the last few years: Washington \nstate produces some of the highest quality wine in the world. In 2001, \nWine Enthusiast Magazine named Washington state as ``Wine Region of the \nYear'' in recognition of its fast emergence as a global leader in \nproducing quality wines.\n  I am very pleased that Walter Clore lived to see this honor--and so \nmany other honors--bestowed on Washington wine. These honors reflect \njust how far the Washington wine industry has come. They are also an \noutstanding tribute to the legacy of Walter Clore and his vision, hard \nwork, and dedication.\n  I had the great privilege to meet Walter Clore in August 2002. That \nmonth, I spent two days traveling through Washington wine country--from \nYakima to Prosser to the Tri-Cities to Walla Walla. I toured wineries \nand vineyards and visited with wine grape growers, vintners, and \nresearchers.\n  Walter Clore was himself a researcher. He spent 40 years at the \nWashington State University Irrigated Agriculture Research and \nExtension Center in Prosser, Washington, an institution that has helped \nlead Washington agriculture forward in so many ways. During his career, \nWalter developed and tested wine grape varieties throughout Washington \nState.\n  Walter Clore retired in 1976, but he was not content to relax and \nwatch from the sidelines. Using his 40 years of experience and \nknowledge, he connected emerging vintners with promising varieties and \npointed them to ideal sites for growing wine grapes.\n  I am deeply saddened by the loss of Walter Clore. But I take solace \nin the fact that he pursued his passion with unrelenting determination \nand transformed his vision of a vibrant Washington wine industry into a \nreality. We need more pioneers like Walter Clore.\n  Today, Washington state's $2.4 billion wine industry is the Nation's \nsecond largest producer of premium wines. The industry boasts more than \n200 wineries and 300 wine grape growers. More important to consumers \nthan the size of the industry, my State continues to earn respect for \nits quality, affordable wines.\n  I believe the best way to pay tribute to Walter Clore is to continue \nhis legacy. As a U.S. Senator, that means funding research through USDA \nand institutions like Washington State University to keep the industry \nhealthy and on the cutting edge. It means investing in trade promotion \ninitiatives like the Market Access Program so that Washington wine can \nearn the markets and worldwide recognition it deserves. And it means \ncreating opportunities for Washington wine country to become a \ndestination spot for wine lovers who live in the Pacific Northwest and \naround the Nation.\n  As Washingtonians, we are so proud to call Walter Clore our own. On \nbehalf of the Washington wine industry, I want to express my \ncondolences to Walter's family. I also want to let them know that we \nwill continue to build on his great legacy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from Wine \nPress Northwest about Walter Clore be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wine Press Northwest, Feb. 3, 2003]\n\n           Walter Clore, ``Father of Washington Wine,'' Dies\n\n       Yakima, Wash.--Dr. Walter Clore, the man known as the \n     ``Father of Washington Wine,'' passed away this morning. He \n     was 91.\n       Clore, who in 1972 predicted wine consumption would triple \n     in the U.S. by 1999, died in a Yakima-area convalescent home. \n     Considered the father of Washington wines, Clore came up with \n     the idea of growing wine grapes in the Columbia Valley after \n     arriving in Prosser soon after Prohibition was repealed.\n       Clore retired from the Washington State University \n     Irrigated Agriculture Research and Extension Station in 1976, \n     four years after he commented on the future of wine in this \n     country at a chamber of commerce meeting. His involvement \n     remained strong well into retirement. Last summer, he visited \n     with U.S. Sen. Patty Murray when she toured the region's wine \n     country.\n       Clore literally helped write the book on the Washington \n     wine industry. In fact, The Wine Project, co-authored by Ron \n     Irvine, serves as a biography of sorts for the man some view \n     as the Johnny Appleseed of vinifera grapes in the state.\n       He spent 40 years at the Prosser Experiment Station. During \n     his tenure, Clore, more than any other individual, is \n     responsible for convincing Eastern Washington farmers they \n     could grow world-class wine grapes.\n       Clore was born July 1, 1911, and grew up in Oklahoma during \n     Prohibition and was raised a teetotaling Methodist. He came \n     to Washington State College in 1934 on a $500 fellowship. In \n     1937, Clore was appointed assistant horticulturist. He was \n     the third faculty member on staff at the center and began \n     working with tree fruits and small fruits--including grapes.\n       One of Clore's primary contributions to the industry was \n     figuring out where premium wine grapes could be grown in the \n     state. He grew vinifera varieties throughout the state and \n     collected volumes of data on how they fared. He retired in \n     1976.\n       Soon after, the Washington wine industry began to grow in \n     earnest and Clore began consulting. Stimson Lane Vineyards \n     and Estates, which owns Columbia Crest and Chateau Ste. \n     Michelle, sought Clore's advice. He pointed them to several \n     sites that have turned out of be among best in the state, \n     including Horse Heaven Hills and Cold Creek.\n       ``The industry got a running start because he planted \n     scores of varieties throughout the Columbia Valley and \n     collected the data necessary for vintners to make reasonable \n     decisions about where to site a vineyard or winery,'' said \n     Ted Baseler, president of Stimson Lane. ``Prior to that, \n     many people decided it was a foregone conclusion that \n     premium wine grapes could not be grown in Washington.''\n       Last fall, Columbia Crest honored Clore by naming its \n     Bordeaux-style red blend the Walter Clore Private Reserve. \n     It's an honor Clore, 91, appreciated on a couple of levels.\n       ``I read in a recent Wine Spectator that Opus One earned a \n     93 point rating (out of 100) and was priced at $150,'' Clore \n     said during an Oct. 16 ceremony at the Paterson, Wash., \n     winery. ``I also read that the Columbia Crest Walter Clore \n     Reserve received a 92 rating and was priced at $30.''\n       Several of those grape growers, along with Clore's friends \n     and company officials, came out to help Columbia Crest and \n     Clore toast the 1999 vintage. Special guests included\n\n[[Page S3249]]\n\n     George Carter--Clore's longtime assistant--and Les Fleming, \n     pioneer Grandview winery and vineyard manager.\n       Doug Gore, vice president and head winemaker at Columbia \n     Crest, said part of the honor includes naming the room where \n     the reserve wine is aged as the Walter Clore Barrel Room.\n       ``There are a lot of legends in the Washington wine \n     industry, but it was Walter Clore who first dreamed it was \n     possible,'' Gore said. ``The modern-day legends are a \n     validation that he was right.''\n       Gore likes to tell the story about when he was a brand-new \n     assistant winemaker at Chateau Ste. Michelle's Grandview \n     winery and was told by his boss Kay Simon that if any grower \n     comes to the back door wanting an analysis of their grapes to \n     shoo them around to the front.\n       ``There was this kindly looking gentleman who came to the \n     back door wanting a sample run on some grapes, and I told him \n     to go around front. However he was persistent, so I asked who \n     he was and he told me, Walt Clore. I apologized for trying to \n     get rid of him. That was the beginning of a long association \n     with the man who I consider the Johnny Appleseed of \n     Washington's wine grape industry,'' Gore said.\n       In the preface to The Wine Project, Clore wrote: ``I grew \n     up during Prohibition in a teetotaler, nonsmoking Methodist \n     family. My mother was a staunch Women's Christian Temperance \n     Union Member.''\n       It was an interest aside to the man who grew up to be \n     called the father of the Washington's wine industry, which \n     today is vigorous, flourishing and much in debt to Clore's \n     visionary research.\n       It was Clore, a horticulturist at WSU's Prosser research \n     station, who was asked more than 40 years ago to look at the \n     potential of growing vinifera wine grapes in Eastern \n     Washington.\n       ``I was intrigued and was given the research task of \n     determine the best adaptable varieties for making premium \n     wines,'' he said.''This was not a difficult task, as I found \n     the interest of co-workers high including not only those in \n     Washington but Oregon, Idaho and British Columbia'' he wrote.\n       Clore also helped develop the rare Lemberger red variety \n     and found some willing disciples. One of these was Kiona \n     Vineyards Winery in the Red Mountain AVA, which has made \n     Lemberger for more than 20 vintages.\n       John Williams, who with grower Jim Holmes was one of the \n     original partners at Kiona, said, ``Dr. Clore was the man in \n     the state's wine industry as far as I'm concerned. If it \n     hadn't been for him, both Jim and I probably would not have \n     gotten into making wine.'' I remember in the late 1970s when \n     he called me saying that since Kiona was the only one \n     interested in the Lemberger variety we would be first to get \n     the plants released by WSU,'' Williams said.\n       Bob Woehler, longtime Tri-City Herald and Wine Press \n     Northwest wine writer, whose association with Clore traces \n     back to the 1970s, said, ``His homespun dignity and overall \n     nice-guy friendliness was as impressive as the knowledge he \n     gave to the Washington wine industry.\n       ``Interestingly, Dr. Clore's association with wine led to \n     developing a taste for it himself despite his upbringing. He \n     often liked to relate at gatherings that he got his mother \n     eventually to try a sip or two,'' Woehler said.\n       James Zuiches, dean of WSU's College of Agriculture and \n     Home Economics, said in a press release, ``From my point of \n     view, Walter Clore was a true pioneer in agricultural \n     research. He took leadership without anyone telling him to, \n     to evaluate wine grape varieties for Washington's \n     environment. He laid the basis for a multimillion dollar \n     industry. He was a role model for faculty and many people \n     have benefitted from his research and extension work. He \n     never lost his love for the industry. He didn't teach \n     formally in a classroom, but he taught thousands of people \n     through his publications, extension programs and training of \n     students in field work.''\n       Clore's death came as plans were being made to build a $6 \n     million Walter Clore Wine and Culinary Center in Prosser.\n       In 1993, the WSU Foundation established the Walter J. Clore \n     Scholarship Endowment to provide scholarships to full-time \n     undergraduate students at WSU who are interested in studying \n     grape production, processing or marketing.\n       Shaw and Sons Funeral Directors, Yakima, is in charge of \n     arrangements.\n       Anyone who wishes to make a memorial gift may contact \n     Patrick Kramer, WSU College of Agriculture and Home Economics \n     development director, who has a list of four charities the \n     family has suggested.

CARMEL \n                       MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to the \nGreater Mt. Carmel Missionary Baptist Church for a half-century of \ndedication and leadership within the Detroit community. On March 15, \n2003, people will be gathering in my hometown of Detroit, MI to \ncelebrate the 50th anniversary of Greater Mt. Carmel Missionary Baptist \nChurch. I am pleased to recognize the members of the Church for their \nmany years of dedication and service to the community.\n  The Greater Mt. Carmel Missionary Baptist Church first opened its \ndoors on March 1, 1953. At the time, it was only a small congregation \nthat met at a storefront every Sunday. In March of 1965, Greater Mt. \nCarmel relocated to its current location on Helen Street in Detroit. \nLater that year, the congregation's Radio Ministry was established and, \n38 years later, can still be heard every Sunday afternoon.\n  Over the last 50 years, Greater Mt. Carmel has become a valuable and \nwell-respected spiritual and educational resource for its growing \ncongregation. Under the guidance of Pastors Montgomery and Pierce, the \ncongregation has expanded upon many fronts and continues to enrich the \nlives of many people. Greater Mt. Carmel Missionary Baptist Church has \npartnered with Focus: HOPE to assist with food delivery programs to the \nelderly and underprivileged.

This campaign to ensure \nthe continued rule of Robert Mugabe and his associates was clearly \nrevealed in the badly flawed presidential election held in March 2002. \nSubsequent to the election, the Mugabe government intensified its \nrepression of opposition political parties and those voices in civil \nsociety and the independent press calling on the government to respect \nthe nation's democratic values and the basic human rights of its \ncitizens. To add to the desperation of the besieged Zimbabwean people, \nthe current government has engaged in a violent assault on the rule of \nlaw that has thrown the economy into chaos, devastated the nation's \nagricultural economy, and triggered a potentially catastrophic food \ncrisis.\n  As a result of the unusual and extraordinary threat posed to the \nforeign policy of the United States by the deterioration of Zimbabwe's \ndemocracy and the resulting breakdown in the rule of law, politically \nmotivated violence, and the political and economic instability in the \nsouthern African region, I have exercised my statutory authority and \nissued an Executive Order which, except to the extent provided for in\n\n[[Page S3250]]\n\nregulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued \npursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into \nor any license or permit granted prior to the effective date:\n  Blocks all property and interests in property of the individuals \nlisted in the Annex to the order;\n  Prohibits any transaction or dealing by United States persons or \nwithin the United States in property or interests in property blocked \npursuant to the order, including the making or receiving of any \ncontribution of funds, goods, or services to or for the benefit of the \npersons designated pursuant to the order.\n  The Secretary of the Treasury is further authorized to designate any \nperson determined, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to be \nowned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act directly or \nindirectly for or on behalf of, any persons designated in or pursuant \nto the order. The Secretary of the Treasury is also authorized in the \nexercise of my authorities under the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act to implement these measures in consultation with the \nSecretary of State. All Federal agencies are directed to take actions \nwithin their authority to carry out the provisions of the Executive \nOrder.\n  This Executive Order further demonstrates the U.S. commitment to \nsupporting Zimbabwe's democratic evolution, and strengthens our \ncooperation with the European Union in efforts to promote that \nevolution. The European Union has acted to freeze the assets of 79 \nindividuals responsible for the political, economic, and social \ndeterioration of Zimbabwe. With the exception of two individuals no \nlonger associated with the Government of Zimbabwe, this order \nencompasses all those identified by the European Union.\n  I have enclosed a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                      George W.

Bush's fight against Al Qaeda, which led \n     to the destruction of its network in Afghanistan and its \n     liberation from religious fanaticism; and\n       Whereas, the defeat of the Iraqi aggression in 1991 and the \n     Al Qaeda network in 2001-2002 owes much of its success to the \n     leadership of the United States in marshalling the support of \n     many nations, including Russia and China, and worldwide \n     public opinion, especially the people of Afghanistan who \n     welcomed their delivery from the Taliban; and\n       Whereas, the United States is also approaching the current \n     North Korean crisis with the same positive, multilateral \n     approach with the support of neighboring countries and \n     allies, South Korea and Japan, and the cooperation of China \n     and Russia; and\n       Whereas, the United States has secured the approval of the \n     United Nations in the current intensive arms inspection \n     operation in Iraq and is seeking the support of NATO allies \n     and major powers in disarming and neutralizing Iraq; and\n       Whereas, neither the nations of the world nor public \n     opinion is supporting the United States in seeking a \n     unilateral military solution in Iraq because they do not \n     perceive the provocation or threat that existed in 1991 when \n     Iraq invaded and occupied Kuwait; and\n       Whereas, a unilateral military solution, specifically, a \n     preemptive strike against Iraq, is fraught with many dangers \n     such as a possible igniting of a clash between Muslim and \n     Christian nations; a disruption of oil supply and prices, \n     which have unknown consequences to the world economy, \n     including the economy of the United States; and \n     intensification of the Arab-Israeli conflict; a possible \n     incitement to other nations to settle scores unilaterally; \n     and a rekindling of the national divisiveness prevalent \n     during the Vietnam War; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii suffered economically in the aftermath of \n     Operation Desert Storm in 1991 and the downturn in tourism \n     following the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon \n     on September 11, 2001, and will likely suffer similar \n     economic consequences in a new Iraqi War or a conflict on the \n     Korean Peninsula: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twenty-\n     second Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of \n     2003, that this body expresses its strong support for U.S. \n     policy in containing and disarming the rogue states of Iraq \n     and North Korea through the United Nations and with the \n     support of allies and friends; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this body:\n       (1) Reaffirms House Concurrent Resolution No. 2, dated \n     January 18, 1991, and House Resolution No. 106, dated March \n     12, 1991, supporting the men and women in our armed forces \n     fighting in Operation Desert Storm and praising its success \n     in ousting the Iraqi invaders from Kuwait;\n       (2) Restates unequivocally its strong commitment to \n     collective security through the United Nations, as so nobly \n     expressed by the men and women in Operation Desert Storm from \n     the United States and twenty-seven coalition partners;\n       (3) Strongly supports the President's positive policy in \n     seeking a dialogue, in concert with our allies, South Korea \n     and Japan, and with neighboring China and Russia, to have \n     North Korea give up its nuclear program and to institute \n     appropriate international safeguards, including on-site \n     United Nations inspection and a United States pledge of ``no \n     first strike'';\n       (4) Strongly supports the President's policy of containing \n     and disarming Iraq as a threat to world peace and security, \n     particularly the current United Nations arms inspection to \n     find and destroy Iraqi arms of mass destruction;\n       (5) Expresses its strong concerns and reservations for a \n     unilateral United States military solution, such as a \n     preemptive strike on Iraq with only the support of Israel and \n     the United Kingdom in the face of opposition and reservations \n     from world public opinion, including that of the American \n     people; and\n       (6) Strongly supports President George W. Bush in \n     continuing the current policy of working with and through the \n     United Nations, seeking the support and assistance of both \n     allies and interested powers, such as China and Russia, and \n     explaining to and seeking the understanding and support of \n     the American people; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Governor Linda Lingle is asked to convey to \n     President George W. Bush the strong support of the House of \n     Representatives:\n       (1) For the men and women of our armed forces and their \n     families;\n       (2) For his efforts in fighting terrorism and rogue states;\n       (3) For using approaches other than a unilateral military \n     solution; and\n       (4) For using a multi-national approach to find a solution \n     to this problem through the United Nations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That Hawaii's Congressional delegation is also \n     requested to convey to the officers and members of the United \n     States Congress the views presented in this Resolution; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the United \n     States Congress, Hawaii's Congressional delegation, and \n     Governor Linda Lingle.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-62.

Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Members of the Legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       Section 1. That all members of the Wyoming Legislature, and \n     the Governor of the State of Wyoming, deeply convey their \n     thanks and best wishes to the citizen-soldiers of the Fourth \n     Infantry Division Rear Operations Center at the Wyoming Army \n     National Guard and their families, for their service to the \n     Nation and Wyoming.\n       Section 2. That these citizen-soldiers, and their families, \n     not be forgotten during their service to our state and \n     nation.

A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to improve access and choice for entrepreneurs \nwith small businesses with respect to medical care for their employees; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill that will \nprovide revolutionary changes to the health insurance choices available \nfor small businesses. This bill, ``The Small Business Health Fairness \nAct of 2003'' will give small businesses the same market-based \nadvantages and leverage that large employers and unions currently enjoy \nto provide health insurance for their employees.\n  One month ago, I convened my first hearing as Chair of the Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship to explore the crisis small \nbusinesses are currently facing in their attempts to find affordable \nhealth care for their employees. The reason I made this my first \nhearing was that whenever I spoke to small businesses this is the \nnumber one issue they wanted to discuss. Small businesses in my State \nare literally desperate for more health insurance options; some \nbusiness owners even say this is keeping them awake at night.\n  At the hearing small businesses from my home State of Maine made it \nclear that they have only one choice for their health care. Even when \nthey band together in local purchasing pools, they are unable to \nattract any other insurance carriers to provide them with less \nexpensive and more flexible options. Even though they have cut back on \nthe coverage and increased the costs to the employees, they are still \nfinding it almost impossible to provide health insurance to their \nemployees. And as the costs to the employees increases, many employees \nfind this too much to absorb, which leaves them uncovered and, \ntherefore, increase the ranks of the employed but uninsured.\n  Indeed, the Washington Post reported on February 28 that worries \nabout rising health care costs registered higher in a poll conducted by \nthe Kaiser Family Foundation than even concerns over the stock market \nor terrorist attacks. Thirty-eight percent of the respondents were \n``very worried'' that the cost of their health care or health insurance \nwould increase compared to 22 percent who were ``very worried'' about \nlosing their savings in the stock market, or 19 percent who were ``very \nworried'' about being a victim of a terrorist attack.\n\n  With small businesses creating up to 75 percent of net new jobs in \nAmerica and with a shocking 56 percent of the 41.2 million uninsured in \nthis country already either working a full-time, full-year job or \ndepending on one who does, we have an obligation to ensure that more of \nthese individuals can receive insurance through their employers. So \nwhen the Kaiser 2002 Employer Health Benefits Survey reports that only \n61 percent of all small businesses are offering health benefits--and \nthat's down from 67 percent just three years ago--is there any question \nthat we're headed in exactly the wrong direction?\n  This is a crisis, and it's even worse in businesses with fewer than \n50 employees. Of those, only 47 percent currently provide health \ninsurance benefits, and the Department of Labor reports that only 24 \npercent of small businesses that employ ``low-wage'' workers offer \nhealth plans.\n  The fact is, with more than two-thirds of all Americans relying on \ntheir employer for health insurance, we can't afford to continue the \ndisturbing trend identified by the Kaiser Family Foundation, where \nmonthly premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance on average \nrose 11 percent from 2000 to 2001, and then 12.7 percent from 2001 to \n2002--the second straight year of double digit increases. As a result, \n22 percent of all firms increased employee deductibles in 2002, and 32 \npercent told Kaiser they are likely to do so this year.\n  The problem is all the more acute for small businesses. For those \nwith fewer than 10 workers, the employer and employees together pay--on \naverage--about 8 percent more in premiums than the amount paid by \nlarger companies. And for all firms under 200 employees, 84 percent \nindicated to Kaiser that cost was an important factor in not offering \nhealth care.\n  The result of all this isn't hard to predict. Businesses can and \nclearly are dropping health benefits. Others struggle onward in \nproviding coverage, but only at the cost of the growth of the business, \nor offering packages with higher premiums, or a combination of both.\n  If we can do something that will help more small businesses provide \nhealth insurance to their employees, then we can significantly reduce \nthe number of those who are without health insurance in this country.\n  The Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2003 will improve access to \naffordable health care for small businesses by giving them the same \nadvantages currently enjoyed by large employers and unions. The bill \nemploys a very basic principle--that volume purchasing of insurance by \nsmall businesses will work as it does for any other commodity and for \nany large business or union that purchases health insurance coverage--\nit will help reduce the cost. As President Bush has said, ``It makes no \nsense in America to isolate small businesses as little health care \nislands unto themselves. We must have association health plans.''\n  The Act will allow small businesses to pool together nationally, \nunder the auspices of their bona fide associations, and either purchase \ntheir insurance from a provider, or self-insure in the same way that \nlarge employers and unions currently do. These association health \nplans, AHPS, would be monitored and regulated by the Department of \nLabor's Employee Benefits Security Administration in the same way that \nmore than 275,000 plans offered by large employers and unions are \ncurrently regulated.\n\n  This agency is currently overseeing plans that cover 72 million \npeople. The Department of Labor released a report last week that \nreveals high rates of compliance by group health plans with health care \nlaws enacted under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA. \nMore importantly, the report and the compliance project that is the \nsubject of the report, are further evidence of the Labor Department's \ncommitment and proven success in effectively monitoring health plans. \nThe report establishes that the Department is prepared to oversee \nassociation health plans.\n  Studies by the Small Business Administration, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Congressional Budget Office have all found that these \ntypes of plans operate with between 13 and 30 percent lower \nadministrative costs. These lower costs can then be translated into \nreducing costs to subscribers or providing more benefits.\n  Another reason AHPs will be able to offer less expensive plans, and \nalso greater flexibility, is because they will be exempt from the \nmyriad State benefit regulations. Associations will be able to design \ntheir plans to meet the needs of their members and their employees. By \nadministering one national plan, it will further reduce the \nadministrative costs instead of trying to administer a plan subject to \nthe mandates of each State.\n  Even though the benefit mandates will not be in effect, associations \nwill need to design their plans so that enough members participate in \nthem to attract the necessary employees to make them work. This means \nthat they will naturally provide a full range of benefits similar to \nwhat many States currently require. In many cases, the plans offered by \nlarge employers and unions, which are also exempt from the State \nbenefit mandates, are the most generous plans available. People will \noften stay in those jobs specifically to keep their health care \ncoverage.\n  The Act would also provide extensive new protections to ensure that \nthe health care coverage was there when employees need it. Associations \nsponsoring these plans would need to be established for at least three \nyears for purposes other than providing health insurance--this is \nintended to prevent the current epidemic of fraud and abuse that is \noccurring through sham associations who take money from unsuspecting \nsmall businesses and then cease to exist when some files a claim.\n  In addition, association health plans would be required to have \nsufficient funds in reserve, specific stop-loss insurances, \nindemnification insurance, and other funding and certification \nrequirements to make sure the insurance coverage would be available \nwhen needed. None of these requirements apply\n\n[[Page S3256]]\n\nto any of the plans currently regulated by the Department of Labor, \neither the large employer plans under the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, ERISA, or the union plans under the Taft-Hartley Act.\n  The approach of this bill is, I believe, a good one--but I also \nconsider it a starting point. And in that light, I intend to work with \nall groups and interested parties that are committed to passing this \nbill so that we can improve this bill and finally provide small \nbusinesses with more health insurance options at lower costs. The \ncurrent situation is simply unacceptable. Those who oppose this bill \nand believe the status quo only needs to be modified slightly are not \npaying attention--they are not listening to the millions of small \nbusinesses who are desperate for more choices, or the small employers \nwho are unable to get health insurance at any cost.\n  The time for stalling on providing relief for small businesses unable \nto get affordable health insurance is over. We must act now, and we \nmust pass the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2003 to bring small \nbusinesses more choices and use the power of competition to bring them \nbetter options.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of The Small Business Health \nFairness Act of 2003 and an explanation of its provisions be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and additional material was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 545\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

RULES GOVERNING ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS\n\nSubsection (a). Rules Governing Regulation of Association Health Plans.\n\n       This subsection adds a new Part 8 (Rules Governing \n     Regulation of Association Health Plans) to Title I, Subtitle \n     B of ERISA, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 801. ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS.\n\n       (a) The term ``association health plan'' means a ``group \n     health plan'' (which is defined in ERISA as added by the \n     Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act or HIPAA; \n     under HIPAA such group health plans are subject to all of the \n     portability, preexisting condition, nondiscriminating, \n     special enrollment, renewability and other provisions of \n     ERISA Part 7)--\n       (b) The sponsor of an Association Health Plan (AHP) must \n     be:\n       (1) Organized and maintained in good faith, with a \n     constitution and bylaws specifically stating its purpose and \n     providing for at least annual meetings, as a trade \n     association, and industry association (including a rural \n     electric or rural telephone cooperative), a professional \n     association, or a chamber of commerce (or similar business \n     group, include a similar organization that operates on a \n     cooperative basis within the meaning of section 1381 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code), for substantial purposes other than \n     that of obtaining or providing medical care.\n       (2) Is established as a permanent entity which receives the \n     active support of its members, and collects dues from its \n     members on a periodic basis;\n       (3) Does not condition membership, dues or coverage under \n     the health plan on the basis of health status-related factors \n     with respect to employees of members, and does not condition \n     such dues on the basis of the member's participation in the \n     group health plan.\n       In addition to the associations described above, certain \n     other entities are eligible to seek certification as AHPs. \n     These include (1) franchise networks (section 803(c)), and \n     (2) multiemployer plans and certain existing collectively \n     bargained arrangements which fail to meet the statutory \n     exemption criteria (section 803(d)).\n\n     SEC. 802. CERTIFICATION OF ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS.\n\n       This section establishes a procedure for the certification \n     of Association Health Plans as prescribed by the Secretary of \n     Labor or other applicable authority (applicable authority). \n     In the case of an association health plan that provides at \n     least one benefit option that does not consist of health \n     insurance coverage, the applicable authority shall grant \n     certification only if the applicable requirements are met \n     (or, upon the date on which the plan is to commence \n     operations, will be met). Such self-insured association \n     health plans may only be certified if they also (1) offered \n     such coverage on the date of enactment of this Act; (2) the \n     sponsor does not restrict membership to one or more trades or \n     businesses or industries and whose\n\n[[Page S3264]]\n\n     eligible participating employers represent a broad cross-\n     section of trades or businesses or industries; and (3) the \n     plan's eligible participating employers represent one or more \n     trades or businesses, or one or more industries, which have \n     been indicated as having average or above-average health \n     insurance risk or health claims experience by reason of state \n     rate filings, denials of coverage, or proposed premium rate \n     levels, or other means demonstrated by such plan in accord \n     with regulations prescribed through negotiated rulemaking by \n     the applicable authority.\n       The applicable authority may provide by regulation for \n     continued certification of association health plans. A \n     ``class certification'' procedure is established to speed the \n     approval of plans that offer only fully-insured health \n     insurance coverage.\n       In essence, this procedure has the same effect as requiring \n     the Secretary to implement authority under current law to \n     issue exemptions for association health plans (see ERISA \n     section 514(b)(6)(B)). An AHP that is certified must also \n     meet the applicable requirements of Part 8 as described \n     below.\n\n     SEC. 803. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO SPONSORS AND BOARDS OF \n                   TRUSTEES.\n\n       This section establishes additional eligibility \n     requirements for AHPs. Applicants must demonstrate that the \n     arrangement's sponsor has been in existence for a continuous \n     period of at least three years for substantial purposes other \n     than providing coverage under a group health plan.\n       Subsection (b) also requires that the plan be operated, \n     pursuant to trust agreement, by a ``board of trustees'' which \n     has complete fiscal control and which is responsible for all \n     operations of the plan. The board of trustees must develop \n     rules of operation and financial control based on a three-\n     year plan of operation which is adequate to carry out the \n     terms of the plan and to meet all applicable requirements of \n     the certification and Title I of ERISA. The board of trustees \n     must consist of individuals who are owners, officers, \n     directors or employees of the employers who participate in \n     the plan.\n       In addition to the association described in section 801, \n     certain other entities are made eligible to seek \n     certification as AHPs. These include (1) franchise networks \n     (section 803(c)) and (2) multiemployer plans and certain \n     existing collectively bargained arrangements which fail to \n     meet the statutory exemption criteria (section 803(d)).\n\n     SEC. 804. PARTICIPATION AND COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       This section prohibits discrimination against eligible \n     employers and employees by requiring that all employers who \n     are association members be eligible for participation under \n     the terms of the plan, that eligible employers be informed of \n     all benefit options available, and that eligible individuals \n     of such participating employers not be excluded from \n     enrolling in the plan because of health status. Plans may \n     include minimum participation, contribution, and size \n     requirements to the extent that they meet the \n     nondiscrimination and other rules under sections 701, 702, \n     and 703. Affiliated members of the plan sponsor may be \n     offered overage if they are affiliated at the time of \n     certification or if they were previously uninsured for 12 \n     months prior to being covered. The legislation will not \n     affect the individual health insurance market adversely \n     inasmuch as the bill requires that no participating employer \n     may exclude an employee from enrollment under an AHP by \n     purchasing an individual policy of health insurance coverage \n     for such person based on his or her health status.\n\n     SEC. 805. OTHER REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO PLAN DOCUMENTS, \n                   CONTRIBUTION RATES, AND BENEFIT OPTIONS.\n\n       Section 805 requires an association health plan to meet the \n     following requirements: (1) its governing instruments must \n     provide that the board of trustees serves as the named \n     fiduciary and plan administrator, that the sponsor serves as \n     plan sponsor, and that the reserve requirements of section \n     806 are met; (2) the contribution rates for any particular \n     employer must be nondiscriminatory--they can not vary only on \n     the claims experience of the particular employer or on the \n     type of business or industry in which the employer is \n     engaged, regardless of how much such claims may be above or \n     below average claims experience, (3) the plan has at least \n     1,000 participants and beneficiaries if the plan does not \n     consist solely of fully-insured health insurance coverage, \n     (4) utilizes State-licensed insurance agents in the marketing \n     of health insurance benefits under the plan; and (5) the plan \n     meets such other requirements as may be set forth in \n     regulations by the applicable authority.\n       The rules also stipulate that association health plans must \n     be allowed to design benefit options. Specifically, no \n     provision of state law shall preclude an AHP or health \n     insurance issuer from exercising its discretion in designing \n     the items and services of medical care to be included as \n     health insurance converge under the plan, except to the \n     extent that such law (1) prohibits a specific disease from \n     such coverage, or (2) is not preempted under section \n     731(a)(1) with respect to the matters governed by section 711 \n     (relating to maternal and newborn hospitalization) and \n     section 712 (relating to mental health coverage). In \n     addition, no provision of law shall be construed to preclude \n     an AHP or health insurance issuer from setting contribution \n     rates based on the experience under the plan to the extent \n     such rates are nondiscriminatory as described above.\n\n     SEC. 806. MAINTENANCE OF RESERVES AND PROVISIONS FOR SOLVENCY \n                   FOR PLANS PROVIDING HEALTH BENEFITS IN ADDITION \n                   TO HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.\n\n       Section 806 requires AHPs offering benefit options that do \n     not consist solely of fully-insured health insurance coverage \n     to establish and maintain reserves sufficient for unearned \n     contributions, benefit liabilities incurred but not yet \n     satisfied and for which risk of loss has not been \n     transferred, expected administrative costs, any other \n     obligations and a margin for error recommended by the plan's \n     qualified actuary. In addition, the AHP must maintain minimum \n     surplus reserves of $500,000 or such greater amount (up to \n     $2,000,000) as the applicable authority may prescribe. Also, \n     each plan must secure coverage from an insurer consisting of \n     (1) aggregate stop-loss insurance with an attachment point \n     not greater than 125 percent of expected gross claims; (2) \n     specific stop-loss insurance with an attachment point which \n     is at least equal to an amount recommended by the plan's \n     qualified actuary; and (3) to prevent insolvency, \n     indemnification for any claims which a plan is unable to \n     satisfy by reason of a mandatory termination described under \n     section 809(b). The applicable authority may provide \n     additional requirements relating to reserves and excess/stop \n     loss insurance and may provide adjustments to the levels of \n     reserves otherwise required to take into account the level of \n     excess/stop loss insurance or other financial arrangements.\n       the bill also establishes an ``Association Health Plan \n     Fund'' which is to be managed by the Department of Labor for \n     the purpose of making payments to cover any outstanding \n     benefit claims which are not fulfilled in accord with the \n     solvency standards described above. All certified AHPs will \n     pay $5,000 into the fund annually, and this amount may be \n     altered according to need by the Secretary.\n       The bill also establishes a ``Solvency Standards Working \n     Group'' for the purpose of providing input to the applicable \n     authority with respect to solvency requirements for AHPs \n     certified under the Act. The Working Group shall consist of \n     not more than 15 members appointed by the applicable \n     authority, and shall include: (1) a representative of the \n     NAIC, (2) a representative of the American Academy of \n     Actuaries; (3) a representative of the State governments; (4) \n     a representative of existing self-insured health plans; (5) a \n     representative bona fide associations eligible to sponsor an \n     AHP under the Act; and (6) a representative of multiemployer \n     group health plans.\n\n     SEC. 807. REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATION AND RELATED \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       This section sets forth additional criteria which \n     association health plans must meet to qualify for \n     certification. The Secretary shall grant certification to a \n     plan only if: (1) a complete application has been filed, \n     accompanied by the filing fee of $5,000; and (2) all other \n     terms of the certification are met (including financial, \n     actuarial, reporting, participation, and such other \n     requirements as may be specified as a condition of the \n     certification).\n       The application must include the following: (1) identifying \n     information about the arrangement and the states in which it \n     will operate: (2) evidence that ERISA's bonding requirements \n     will be met; (3) copies of all plan documents and agreements \n     with service providers; (4) a funding report indicating that \n     the reserve requirements of section 806 will be met, that \n     contribution rates will be adequate to cover obligations, and \n     that a qualified actuary (a member in good standing of the \n     American Academy of Actuaries or an actuary meeting such \n     other standards that the Secretary considers adequate) has \n     issued an opinion with respect to the arrangement's assets, \n     liabilities, and projected costs; and (5) any other \n     information prescribed by the applicable authority. Certified \n     association health plans must notify by the applicable \n     authority of any material changes in this information at any \n     time, must file annual reports with the applicable authority, \n     and must engage a qualified actuary.\n       AHPs are also required to file their certification with the \n     applicable state authority of each state in which at least 25 \n     percent of the participants and beneficiaries under the plan \n     are located.\n\n     SEC. 808. NOTICE REQUIREMENTS FOR VOLUNTARY TERMINATION.\n\n       Section 808 requires that, except as provided in section \n     809, and AHP may terminate only if the board of trustees \n     provides 60 days advance written notice to participants and \n     beneficiaries and submits to the applicable authority a plan \n     providing for timely payment of all benefit obligations.\n\n     SEC. 809. CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND MANDATORY TERMINATION.\n\n       Section 809 requires an AHP which offers benefit options \n     which are not fully-insured to continue to meet the reserve \n     requirements under section 806 even if its exemption is no \n     longer in effect. The board of trustees of such an AHP must \n     quarterly determine whether the reserve requirements of \n     section 806 are being met and, if they are not, must, in \n     consultation with the qualified actuary, develop a plan to \n     ensure compliance and report such information to the \n     applicable authority. In any case where an AHP notifies the \n     applicable authority that it has failed to meet the reserve \n     requirements and corrective action has not restored \n     compliance, and\n\n[[Page S3265]]\n\n     the applicable authority determines that there is a \n     reasonable expectation that the plan will continue to fail to \n     meet the requirements applicable to such AHPs, the applicable \n     authority may direct the board to terminate the arrangement.\n\n     SEC. 810 TRUSTEESHIP BY THE SECRETARY OF INSOLVENT \n                   ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS PROVIDING HEALTH \n                   BENEFITS IN ADDITION TO HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   COVERAGE.\n\n       Whenever the Secretary determines an AHP won't be able to \n     provide benefits, or is otherwise in financial distress, the \n     Secretary shall apply for appointment as trustee to \n     administer the winding down of the plan.\n\n     SEC. 811. STATE ASSESSMENT AUTHORITY.\n\n       This section allows a state to assess newly certified AHPs \n     a contribution tax to the same extent they tax health \n     insurance plan. This is intended to enable states to maintain \n     the revenue source for funding high-risk insurance pools.\n\n     SEC. 812. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       This section defines the following terms: group health \n     plan, medical care, health insurance coverage, health \n     insurance issuer, applicable authority, health status-related \n     factor, individual market, treatment of very small groups, \n     participating employer, applicable state authority, qualified \n     actuary, affiliated member, large employer, and small \n     employer. The terms are consistent with those added to ERISA \n     by HIPAA. In addition, the terms ``employer'' and \n     ``employee'' include self-employed individuals and partners \n     for purposes of the application of Part 8 and the provisions \n     of Title I as applicable to association health plans.\n\n                 Subsection (b). Conforming Amendments.\n\n       This subsection contains (1) conforming changes to the \n     definition of ``plan sponsor'' to include the sponsor of an \n     AHP; (2) conforming changes to the Title I exception for \n     church plans electing association health plan status; and (3) \n     as described below, conforming changes to section 514 \n     preemption rules to reflect the policy changes under Part 8 \n     with respect to association health plans. First, paragraph \n     (6) of section 514(b) is made inapplicable with respect to \n     any state law in the case of a certified AHP. Second, a new \n     subsection 514(d) (current subsection (d) is redesignated as \n     (e)) clarifies the ability of health insurance issuers to \n     offer health insurance coverage under AHPs and clarifies the \n     ability of any health insurance issuer to offer health \n     insurance coverage of the same policy type as offered in \n     connection with a particular AHP to eligible employers, \n     regardless of whether such employers choose or do not choose \n     to become members of the particular association. Health \n     insurance coverage policy forms filed and approved in a \n     particular state in connection with an insurer's offering \n     under an association health plan are deemed to be approved in \n     any other state in which such coverage is offered when the \n     insurer provides a complete filing in the same form and \n     manner to the authority in the other state. Also, this \n     section removes the current restriction on state \n     regulation of self-insured multiple employer welfare \n     arrangements providing medical care (which do not elect to \n     meet the certification requirements for AHPs) under \n     section 514(b)(6)(a)(ii) by eliminating the requirement \n     that such state laws otherwise ``be consistent with the \n     provisions of ERISA Title I.'' Section 514 is also amended \n     to include a cross-reference to section 805(b) (relating \n     to the ability of AHPs and health insurance issuers to \n     design association health insurance options) and to \n     section 805(a)(2)(B) (relating to the ability of AHPs and \n     health insurance issuers to base contribution rates on the \n     experience of such plans).\n\n     SEC. 422. CLARIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF SINGLE EMPLOYER \n                   ARRANGEMENT.\n\n       This section modifies the treatment of certain single \n     employer arrangements under the section of ERISA that defines \n     a multiple employer welfare arrangement (section 3(40). The \n     treatment of a single employer plan as being excluded from \n     the definition of such an arrangement (and thus from state \n     law) is clarified by defining the minimum interest required \n     for two or more entities to be in ``common control'' as a \n     percentage which can not be required to be greater than 25 \n     percent. Also, a plan would be considered a single employer \n     plan if less than 25 percent of the covered employees are \n     employed by other participating employers.\n\n     SEC. 423. CLARIFICATION OF TREATMENT OF CERTAIN COLLECTIVELY \n                   BARGAINED ARRANGEMENTS.\n\n       This section clarified the conditions under which \n     multiemployer and other collectively bargained arrangements \n     are exempted from the definition of a multiple employer \n     welfare arrangement, and thus exempt from state law. This is \n     intended to address the problem of ``bogus unions'' and other \n     illegitimate health insurance operators. The provision amends \n     the definition of such an arrangement to exclude a plan or \n     arrangement which is established or maintained under or \n     pursuant to a collective bargaining arrangement (as described \n     in the National Labor Relations Act, the Railway Labor Act, \n     and similar state public employee relation laws). Current law \n     requires the Secretary to ``find'' that a collective \n     bargaining agreement exists, but no such finding has ever \n     been issued. It then specifies additional conditions which \n     must be met for such a plan to be a statutorily excluded \n     collectively bargained arrangement, and thus not a multiple \n     employer welfare arrangement. These include:\n       (1) The plan can not utilize the services of any licensed \n     insurance agent or broker to solicit or enroll employers or \n     pay a commission or other form of compensation to certain \n     persons that is related to the volume or number of employers \n     or individuals solicited or enrolled in the plan.\n       (2) A maximum 15 percent rule applies to the number of \n     covered individuals in the plan who are not employees (or \n     their beneficiaries) within a bargaining unit covered by any \n     of the collective bargaining agreements with a participating \n     employer or who are not present or former employees (or their \n     beneficiaries) of sponsoring employee organizations or \n     employers who are or were a party to any of the collective \n     bargaining agreements.\n       (3) The employee organization or other entity sponsoring \n     the plan or arrangement must certify annually to the \n     Secretary the plan has met the previous requirements.\n       (4) If the plan or arrangement is not fully insured, it \n     must be a multiemployer plan meeting specific requirements of \n     the Labor Management Relations Act (i.e., the requirement for \n     joint labor-management trusteeship under section \n     302(c)(5)(B)).\n       (5) If the plan or arrangement is not in effect as of the \n     date of enactment, the employee organization or other entity \n     sponsoring the plan or arrangement must have existed for at \n     least three years or have been affiliated with another \n     employee organization in existence for at least three years, \n     or demonstrate to the Secretary that certain of the above \n     requirements have been met.\n\n     SEC. 424. ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS RELATING TO ASSOCIATION \n                   HEALTH PLANS.\n\n       This section amends ERISA to establish enforcement \n     provisions relating to association health plans and multiple \n     employer welfare arrangements: (1) willful misrepresentation \n     that an entity is an exempted AHP or collectively-bargained \n     arrangement may result in criminal penalties: (2) the section \n     provides for cease activity orders for arrangements found to \n     be neither licensed, registered, or otherwise approved under \n     State insurance law, or operating in accordance with the \n     terms of the certification granted by the Secretary under \n     Part 8; and (3) the section provides for the responsibility \n     of the named fiduciary or board of trustees of an AHP to \n     comply with the required claims procedure under ERISA.\n\n     SEC. 425. COOPERATION BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES\n\n       This section amends section 506 of ERISA (relating to \n     coordination and responsibility of agencies enforcing ERISA \n     and related laws) to require the Secretary of Labor to \n     consult with state insurance departments with regard to the \n     Secretary's authority under section 502 and 504 to enforce \n     provisions applicable to certified AHPs.\n\n     SEC. 426. EFFECTIVE DATE; TRANSITIONAL RULES.\n\n       In general, the amendments made by Section 421, 424, and \n     425 of the Act are effective one year after enactment of the \n     Act. Sections 422 and 423 are effective upon date of \n     enactment. In addition, the Secretary is required to issue \n     all regulations needed to carry out the amendments within one \n     year after enactment of the Act.\n       The provisions of section 805(a)(2) relating to health \n     insurance coverage do not apply to group health plans \n     existing on the date of enactment if they do not provide \n     health insurance coverage, but later qualify for \n     certification.\n       AHPs not in existence on the date of enactment and desiring \n     to offer benefits which do not consist of health insurance \n     must demonstrate to the Secretary that their risk is at least \n     average or above average. The Secretary shall report to \n     Congress the affect on reducing the number of uninsured after \n     five years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Durbin, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 546. A bill to provide for the protection of paleontological \nresources on Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The \nPaleontological Resources Preservation Act to protect and preserve the \nNation's important fossil record for the benefit of our citizens. I am \npleased to have Senators Baucus, Campbell, Durbin, Feinstein, Leahy, \nand Roberts join me as original cosponsors on this significant \nlegislation.\n  This bill was reported favorably by the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and approved by unanimous consent during the 107th Congress. \nI plan to work closely with my colleagues to enact this bill during the \n108th Congress.\n  In 1999, Congress requested that the Secretary of the Interior review \nand report on the Federal policy concerning paleontological resources \non Federal lands. In its request, Congress noted that no unified \nFederal policy existed regarding the treatment of fossils by Federal \nland management agencies, and emphasized Congress's concerns that lack \nof appropriate standards\n\n[[Page S3266]]\n\nwould lead to the deterioration or loss of fossils, which are valuable \nscientific resources.\n  In response, seven Federal agencies and the Smithsonian Institution \nreleased a report in May 2000 entitled ``Assessment of Fossil \nManagement on Federal and Indian Lands.'' This assessment outlined \ngoverning principles for the management of fossils on Federal lands. \nThe report recommended that penalties for fossil theft be strengthened \nand that Federal fossil collections be preserved and available for \nresearch and public education. The interagency group also stated that \nfossils on Federal lands are rare and a part of America's heritage and \nthat effective stewardship requires accurate information and \ninventories.\n  The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act embodies these \nprinciples, and provides the paleontological equivalent of protections \nfound in the Archeological Resources Preservation Act. The bill finds \nthat fossil resources on Federal lands are an irreplaceable part of the \nheritage of the United States. It affirms that reasonable access to \nfossil resources should be provided for scientific, educational, and \nrecreational purposes. The bill acknowledges the value of amateur \ncollecting, but protects vertebrate fossils found on Federal lands \nunder a system of permits.\n  I would like to emphasize that this bill in no way affects \narchaeological or cultural resources under the Archaeological Resources \nProtection Act of 1979 or the Native American Graves Protection and \nRehabilitation Act. They are exempted. This bill covers paleontological \nremains--fossils on Federal lands only.\n  As we look toward the future, public access to fossil resources will \ntake on a new meaning as digital images of fossils become available \nworldwide. The National Museum of Natural History, one of the premier \nSmithsonian museums, already has an online catalogue of 9 million \nspecimens, some of which include digital images. Museums will be able \nto provide global access for researchers, collectors, and educators to \nstudy fossil collections through online catalogs and images. Many \nscientists in developing countries currently lack vital information \nabout fossils because they cannot afford travel costs to museums. This \ndigital advance will truly make fossils a global resource for the \npublic.\n  Discoveries in paleontology are made more frequently than we realize. \nThey shape how we learn about the world around us. In January of this \nyear, Nature reported that Chinese scientists at Beijing's Institute of \nVertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology discovered several four-\nwinged dinosaur fossils. This discovery is providing us with critical \ninsight into the phenomenon of flight. The Paleontological Resources \nPreservation Act would create a legacy of scientific knowledge for \nfuture generations.\n  The protections offered in this Act are not new. Federal land \nmanagement agencies have individual regulations prohibiting theft of \ngovernment property. However, the reality is that U.S. Attorneys are \nreluctant to prosecute cases involving fossil theft because they are \ndifficult. Congress has not provided a clear statute stating the value \nof paleontological resources to our Nation, as has been provided for \narcheological resources. Fossils are too valuable to be left within the \ngeneral theft provisions that are difficult to prosecute, and they are \ntoo valuable to the education of our children not to ensure public \naccess. We need to work together to make sure that we fulfill our \nresponsibility as stewards of public lands, and as protectors of our \nNation's natural resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 546\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Paleontological Resources \n     Preservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Paleontological resources are nonrenewable. Such \n     resources on Federal lands are an accessible and \n     irreplaceable part of the heritage of the United States and \n     offer significant educational opportunities to all citizens.\n       (2) Existing Federal laws, statutes, and other provisions \n     that manage paleontological resources are not articulated in \n     a unified national policy for Federal land management \n     agencies and the public. Such a policy is needed to improve \n     scientific understanding, to promote responsible stewardship, \n     and to facilitate the enhancement of responsible \n     paleontological collecting activities on Federal lands.\n       (3) Consistent with the statutory provisions applicable to \n     each Federal land management system, reasonable access to \n     paleontological resources on Federal lands should be provided \n     for scientific, educational, and recreational purposes.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish a comprehensive \n     national policy for preserving and managing paleontological \n     resources on Federal lands.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) Casual collecting.--The term ``casual collecting'' \n     means the collecting of a reasonable amount of common \n     invertebrate and plant paleontological resources for personal \n     (scientific, educational, or recreational) use, either by \n     surface collection or using non-powered hand tools resulting \n     in only negligible disturbance to the Earth's surface and \n     other resources.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior with respect to lands administered by the \n     Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture \n     with respect to National Forest System Lands administered by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (3) Federal lands.--The term ``Federal lands'' means lands \n     administered by the Secretary of the Interior, except Indian \n     lands, or National Forest System Lands administered by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (4) Indian lands.--The term ``Indian Lands'' means lands of \n     Indian tribes, or Indian individuals, which are either held \n     in trust by the United States or subject to a restriction \n     against alienation imposed by the United States.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means the fifty States, the \n     District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and \n     any other territory or possession of the United States.\n       (6) Paleontological resource.--The term ``paleontological \n     resource'' means any fossilized remains, traces, or imprints \n     of organisms, preserved in or on the earth's crust, that are \n     of paleontological interest and that provide information \n     about the history of life on earth, except that the term does \n     not include--\n       (A) any materials associated with an archaeological \n     resource (as defined in section 3(1) of the Archaeological \n     Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470bb(1)); or\n       (B) any cultural item (as defined in section 2 of the \n     Native American Graves Protection and Rehabilitation Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 3001)).\n\n     SEC. 5. MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall manage and protect \n     paleontological resources on Federal lands using scientific \n     principles and expertise. The Secretary shall develop \n     appropriate plans for inventory, monitoring, and the \n     scientific and educational use of paleontological resources, \n     in accordance with applicable agency laws, regulations, and \n     policies. These plans shall emphasize interagency \n     coordination and collaborative efforts where possible with \n     non-Federal partners, the scientific community, and the \n     general public.\n       (b) Coordination of Implementation.--To the extent \n     possible, the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall coordinate in the implementation of this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 6. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND EDUCATION PROGRAM.\n\n       The Secretary shall establish a program to increase public \n     awareness about the significance of paleontological \n     resources.\n\n     SEC. 7. COLLECTION OF PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Permit Requirement.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in this Act, a \n     paleontological resource may not be collected from Federal \n     lands without a permit issued under this Act by the \n     Secretary.\n       (2) Casual collecting exception.--The Secretary may allow \n     casual collecting without a permit on Federal lands \n     administered by the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of \n     Reclamation, and the U.S. Forest Service, where such \n     collection is not inconsistent with the laws governing the \n     management of those Federal lands and this Act.\n       (3) Previous permit exception.--Nothing in this section \n     shall affect a valid permit issued prior to the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Criteria for Issuance of a Permit.--The Secretary may \n     issue a permit for the collection of a paleontological \n     resource pursuant to an application if the Secretary \n     determines that--\n       (1) the applicant is qualified to carry out the permitted \n     activity;\n       (2) the permitted activity is undertaken for the purpose of \n     furthering paleontological knowledge or for public education;\n       (3) the permitted activity is consistent with any \n     management plan applicable to the Federal lands concerned; \n     and\n       (4) the proposed methods of collecting will not threaten \n     significant natural or cultural resources.\n\n[[Page S3267]]\n\n       (c) Permit Specifications.--A permit for the collection of \n     a paleontological resource issued under this section shall \n     contain such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems \n     necessary to carry out the purposes of this Act. Every permit \n     shall include requirements that--\n       (1) the paleontological resource that is collected from \n     Federal lands under the permit will remain the property of \n     the United States;\n       (2) the paleontological resource and copies of associated \n     records will be preserved for the public in an approved \n     repository, to be made available for scientific research and \n     public education; and\n       (3) specific locality data will not be released by the \n     permittee or repository without the written permission of the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) Modification, Suspension, and Revocation of Permits.--\n       (1) The Secretary may modify, suspend, or revoke a permit \n     issued under this section--\n       (A) for resource, safety, or other management \n     considerations; or\n       (B) when there is a violation of term or condition of a \n     permit issued pursuant to this section.\n       (2) The permit shall be revoked if any person working under \n     the authority of the permit is convicted under section 9 or \n     is assessed a civil penalty under section 10.\n       (e) Area Closures.--In order to protect paleontological or \n     other resources and to provide for public safety, the \n     Secretary may restrict access to or close areas under the \n     Secretary's jurisdiction to the collection of paleontological \n     resources.\n\n     SEC. 8. CURATION OF RESOURCES.\n\n       Any paleontological resource, and any data and records \n     associated with the resource, collected under a permit, shall \n     be deposited in an approved repository. The Secretary may \n     enter into agreements with non-Federal repositories regarding \n     the curation of these resources, data, and records.\n\n     SEC. 9. PROHIBITED ACTS; PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--A person may not--\n       (1) excavate, remove, damage, or otherwise alter or deface \n     or attempt to excavate, remove, damage, or otherwise alter or \n     deface any paleontological resources located on Federal lands \n     unless such activity is conducted in accordance with this \n     Act;\n       (2) exchange, transport, export, receive, or offer to \n     exchange, transport, export, or receive any paleontological \n     resource if, in the exercise of due care, the person knew or \n     should have known such resource to have been excavated, \n     removed, exchanged, transported, or received from Federal \n     lands in violation of any provisions, rule, regulation, law, \n     ordinance, or permit in effect under Federal law, including \n     this Act; or\n       (3) sell or purchase or offer to sell or purchase any \n     paleontological resource if, in the exercise of due care, the \n     person knew or should have known such resource to have been \n     excavated, removed, sold, purchased, exchanged, transported, \n     or received from Federal lands.\n       (b) False Labeling Offenses.--A person may not make or \n     submit any false record, account, or label for, or any false \n     identification of, any paleontological resource excavated or \n     removed from Federal lands.\n       (c) Penalities.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and \n     (3), a person who knowingly violates or counsels, procures, \n     solicits, or employs another person to violate subsection (a) \n     or (b) shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a class A \n     misdemeanor.\n       (2) Damage over $1,000.--If the sum of the scientific or \n     fair market value of the paleontological resources involved \n     and the cost of restoration and repair of such resources \n     exceeds the sum of $1,000, such person shall, upon \n     conviction, be guilty of a class E felony.\n       (3) Multiple offenses.--In the case of a second or \n     subsequent such violation, such person shall, upon \n     conviction, be guilty of a class D felony.\n       (d) General Exception.--Nothing in subsection (a) shall \n     apply to any person with respect to any palentological \n     resource which was in the lawful possession of such person \n     prior to the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 10.

A bill to encourage energy conservation through bicycling; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Conserve by \nBike Act to promote energy conservation and improve public health. I am \npleased to be joined by my colleagues from Maine, Senator Susan \nCollins, in introducing this measure. This legislation addresses one \npart of our Nation's energy challenges. Although there is no single \nsolution, every possible approach must be considered in order to solve \nour energy problems.\n  Our Nation would realize several benefits from the increased use of \nbicycle transportation, including lessened dependence on foreign oil \nand prevention of harmful air emissions. Currently, less than one trip \nin one hundred, .88 percent, is by bicycle. If we can raise our level \nof cycling to one and a half trips per hundred, which is less than one \nbike trip every two weeks for the average person, we will save more \nthan 462 million gallons of gasoline in a year, worth more than $721 \nmillion. That is the equivalent of one day a year we will not need to \nimport any foreign oil.\n  In addition to fostering greater independence from foreign oil \nsupplies, this bill will help mitigate air quality challenges, which \ncan be harmful to public health and the environment. Unlike automotive \ntransportation, bicycling is emissions-free.\n  The Conserve by Bike Act encourages bicycling through two key \ncomponents: a pilot program and a research project. The Conserve by \nBike Pilot Program established by this legislation would be implemented \nby the U.S. Department of Transportation. The Department would fund up \nto ten pilots throughout the country that would utilize education and \nmarketing tools to encourage people to convert some of their car trips \nto bike trips. Each of these pilot projects must: 1. document project \nresults and energy conserved; 2. facilitate partnerships among \nstakeholders in two or more of the following fields: transportation, \nlaw enforcement, education, public health, and the environment; 3. \nmaximize current bicycle facility investments; 4. demonstrate methods \nthat can be replicated in other locations; and 5. produce ongoing \nprograms that are sustained by local resources.\n  This legislation also directs the Transportation Research Board of \nthe National Academy of Sciences to conduct a research project on \nconverting car trips to bike trips. The study will consider: 1. what \ncar trips Americans can reasonably be expected to make by bike, given \nsuch factors as weather, land use, and traffic patterns, carrying \ncapacity of bicycles, and bicycle infrastructure; 2. what energy \nsavings would result, or how much energy could be conserved, if these \ntrips were converted from car to bike; 3. the cost-benefit analysis of \nbicycle infrastructure investments; and 4. what factors could encourage \nmore car trips to be replaced with bike trips. The study also will \nidentify lessons we can learn from the documented results of the pilot \nprograms.\n  The Conserve by Bike Program is a small investment that has the \npotential to produce significant returns: greater independence from \nforeign oil and a healthier environment and population. The Conserve by \nBike Act authorizes a total of $6.2 million to carry out the pilot \nprograms and research. A total of $5,150,000 will be used to implement \nthe pilot projects; $300,000 will be used by the Department of \nTransportation to coordinate, publicize, and disseminate the results of \nthe program; and $750,000 will be utilized for the research study.\n  The provisions in this bill enjoy strong, bipartisan support and \npassed as an amendment to last year's Senate energy bill. The measure \nis endorsed by the League of American Bicyclists, which has over \n300,000 affiliates, as well as the Association of Pedestrian and \nBicycle Professionals, Rails to Trails Conservancy, Thunderhead \nAlliance, Bikes Belong Coalition, Adventure Cycling, International \nMountain Bicycling Association, Chicagoland Bicycle Federation, and the \nLeague of Illinois Bicyclists.\n  By enacting the Conserve by Bike Act, we can reduce our energy \ndependence, reduce harmful air emissions, and improve public health. I \nurge my colleagues to cosponsor the Conserve by Bike Act and join me in \nmaking a responsible investment in cleaner, healthier and more energy \nefficient future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 547\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONSERVE BY BICYCLING PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Program.--The term ``program'' means the Conserve by \n     Bicycling Program established by subsection (b).\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n       (b) Establishment.--There is established within the \n     Department of Transportation a program to be known as the \n     ``Conserve by Bicycling Program''.\n       (c) Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--In carrying out the program, the Secretary \n     shall establish not more than 10 pilot projects that are--\n       (A) dispersed geographically throughout the United States; \n     and\n       (B) designed to conserve energy resources by encouraging \n     the use of bicycles in place of motor vehicles.\n       (2) Requirements.--A pilot project described in paragraph \n     (1) shall--\n       (A) use education and marketing to convert motor vehicle \n     trips to bicycle trips;\n       (B) document project results and energy savings (in \n     estimated units of energy conserved);\n       (C) facilitate partnerships among interested parties in at \n     least 2 of the fields of--\n       (i) transportation;\n       (ii) law enforcement;\n       (iii) education;\n       (iv) public health;\n       (v) environment; and\n       (vi) energy;\n       (D) maximize bicycle facility investments;\n       (E) demonstrate methods that may be used in other regions \n     of the United States; and\n       (F) facilitate the continuation of ongoing programs that \n     are sustained by local resources.\n       (3) Cost sharing.--At least 20 percent of the cost of each \n     pilot project described in paragraph (1) shall be provided \n     from State or local sources.\n       (d) Energy and Bicycling Research Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall enter into a \n     contract with the National Academy of Sciences for, and the \n     National Academy of Sciences shall conduct and submit to \n     Congress a report on, a study on the feasibility of \n     converting motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips.\n       (2) Components.--The study shall--\n       (A) document the results or progress of the pilot projects \n     under subsection (b);\n       (B) determine the type and duration of motor vehicle trips \n     that people in the United States may feasibly make by \n     bicycle, taking into consideration factors such as--\n       (i) weather;\n       (ii) land use and traffic patterns;\n       (iii) the carrying capacity of bicycles; and\n       (iv) bicycle infrastructure;\n       (C) determine any energy savings that would result from the \n     conversion of motor vehicle trips to bicycle trips;\n       (D) include a cost-benefit analysis of bicycle \n     infrastructure investments; and\n       (E) include a description of any factors that would \n     encourage more motor vehicle trips to be replaced with \n     bicycle trips.\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $6,200,000, to \n     remain available until expended, of which--\n       (1) $5,150,000 shall be used to carry out pilot projects \n     described in subsection (c);\n       (2) $300,000 shall be used by the Secretary to coordinate, \n     publicize, and disseminate the results of the program; and\n       (3) $750,000 shall be used to carry out subsection (e).\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nIllinois in reintroducing this legislation to recognize and promote \nbicycling's important impact on energy savings and public health.\n  With America becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, it is \nvital that we look to the contribution that bike travel can make toward \nsolving our Nation's energy challenges.\n\n[[Page S3269]]\n\nThis legislation would establish a Conserve by Bike pilot program that \nwould oversee pilot projects throughout the country designed to \nconserve energy resources by providing education and marketing tools to \nconvert car trips to bike trips. Right now, fewer than one trip in one \nhundred is by bicycle. If we could increase this statistic to one and a \nhalf trips per hundred, we would save over 462 million gallons of \ngasoline in a year, worth over $721 million.\n  While more bike trips would benefit our energy conservation efforts, \nthat would also help improve the public's health. According to the U.S. \nSurgeon General, fewer than one-third of Americans meet Federal \nrecommendations to engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical \nactivity at least 5 days a week. Even more disturbing is the fact that \napproximately 300,000 U.S. death a year are associated with being obese \nor overweight. By promoting biking, we are working to ensue that \nAmericans will increase their physical activity.\n  The Conserve by Bike Act has received widespread support on the \nnational, state, and local level, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 548. A bill to improve mental health programs for veterans, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as a senior member of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am proud to reintroduce legislation \ntoday intended to strengthen mental health programs within the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs a key element of caring for those who \nhave served on the battlefield.\n  Historically, as many as one-third of all veterans seeking care at VA \nhave received mental health treatment, and research suggests that \nserious mental illnesses affect at least one-fifth of the veterans who \nuse the VA health care system. About 450,000 of the approximately 2.3 \nmillion veterans who receive compensation from VA have service-\nconnected psychiatric and neurological disorders.\n  I remain concerned about the viability of some of the programs \ndeveloped to care for veterans with mental health needs. I have heard \ntestimony about a number of these programs endangered by budget \nconstraints and a shift in focus from inpatient care to outpatient \nclinics. Specialized programs particularly for substance use disorders \nand PTSD shut down, reduced in size, or understaffed--offering little \nor no care to veterans suffering from these seriously debilitating \ndisorders.\n  Congress previously enacted a provision to designate $15 million in \nVA funding specifically to assist medical facilities in their efforts \nto improve care for veterans with substance use disorders and PTSD. \nThis additional funding has enabled VA to develop better outpatient \nsubstance abuse and PTSD treatment programs, outpatient dual-diagnosis \nprograms, more PTSD community clinical teams, and more residential \nsubstance abuse disorder rehabilitation programs.\n  The funds for these mental health programs, mandated by the \nMillennium Benefits and Health Care Act of 1999, will soon revert to a \ngeneral fund. The bill I am introducing today ensures that this funding \nwill remain ``protected'' for three more years and increases the total \namount of funding identified specifically for treatment of substance \nuse disorders and PTSD from $15 million to $25 million.\n  Another provision of the legislation I am introducing today concerns \nVA's Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Centers, called \n``MIRECCs. In 1996, Congress authorized VA to establish five of these \ncenters dedicated to mental illness research, education, and clinical \nactivities. This provision will allow VA to establish up to ten more \nMIRECCs to study and treat mental illnesses. MIRECCs have encouraged \nresearch, given VA caregivers more and better tools to treat patients \nwith mental disorders, and increased our fundamental understanding of \nmental illnesses. Much more can be done in this area if the program is \nexpanded.\n  Another critical area of VA care involves counseling and treatment \nfor veterans who were victims of sexual harassment or sexual assault \nduring active military service. In 1992, Congress authorized VA to \nprovide counseling to women who experienced sexual trauma during active \nmilitary service. Two years later, recognizing that sexual trauma is \nnot limited to women, Congress expanded VA's mandate to offer \ncounseling and treatment regardless of gender. The Veterans Millennium \nHealth Care and Benefits Act of 1999 broadened VA's responsibilities \ntoward victims of sexual trauma even further, strengthening outreach \nefforts and extending the programs through December 2004. The \nlegislation I am reintroducing today would provide permanent authority \nto VA for counseling and treatment of veterans who have experienced \nmilitary sexual trauma, so that veterans and health care professionals \ncan depend upon these critical services.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the expansion of \nthese enormously important mental health programs with the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. We owe our service men and women no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 548\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Land Consolidation Act to improve \nprovisions relating to probate of trust and restricted land, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nInouye and Thomas in introducing key legislation to help stop Indian \nland fractionation.\n\n[[Page S3270]]\n\n  One of the most enduring and damaging legacies of late-19th century \nFederal Indian policy is the continuing fractionation of Indian trust \nlands.\n  The results of this ever-growing problem make it nearly impossible \nfor affected Indian tribes to devise economic development strategies.\n  By attempting to ``break up the tribal landmass'' and turning Indians \ninto yeoman farmers, the Dawes Act of 1887 resulted in millions of \nacres of land transferred out of Indian ownership.\n  By virtue of Indian heirship and probate rules and the steady march \nof time, millions more acres have passed from their original Indian \nallottees to thousands of descendants with undivided interests in \nparcels of land.\n  In strict economic terms, these interests are practically worthless.\n  Congressional efforts to counter this problem have focused on the \nIndian Land Consolidation Act and amendments made to the Act.\n  Key escheat sections designed to return individual-owned fractionated \nlands to tribal ownership have been held unconstitutional by the U.S. \nSupreme Court in 1987, Hodel v. Irving, and in 1997, Babbitt v. Youpee.\n  Congress and the Administration have also sought to return these \ninterests to tribal ownership through voluntary purchase.\n  The ``Indian Land Consolidation Program'' was enacted as part of the \nFiscal Year 1999 Omnibus Appropriation and has proven a success.\n  In 1999 I introduced amendments to the ILCA to limit disposition of \nIndian lands to Indian heirs, life estates to non-Indian heirs, or the \ntribe with jurisdiction over the lands.\n  The bill I am re-introducing today was considered by the Committee on \nIndian Affairs and passed by the Senate last session.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Indian Probate \n     Reform Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Act of February 8, 1887 (commonly known as the \n     ``Indian General Allotment Act'') (25 U.S.C. 331 et seq.), \n     which authorized the allotment of Indian reservations, did \n     not permit Indian allotment owners to provide for the \n     testamentary disposition of the land that was allotted to \n     them;\n       (2) that Act provided that allotments would descend \n     according to State law of intestate succession based on the \n     location of the allotment;\n       (3) the reliance of the Federal Government on the State law \n     of intestate succession with respect to the descent of \n     allotments has resulted in numerous problems affecting Indian \n     tribes, members of Indian tribes, and the Federal Government, \n     including--\n       (A) the increasingly fractionated ownership of trust and \n     restricted land as that land is inherited by successive \n     generations of owners as tenants in common;\n       (B) the application of different rules of intestate \n     succession to each interest of a decedent in or to trust or \n     restricted land if that land is located within the boundaries \n     of more than 1 State, which application--\n       (i) makes probate planning unnecessarily difficult; and\n       (ii) impedes efforts to provide probate planning assistance \n     or advice;\n       (C) the absence of a uniform general probate code for trust \n     and restricted land, which makes it difficult for Indian \n     tribes to work cooperatively to develop tribal probate codes; \n     and\n       (D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide for \n     many of the essential elements of general probate law, either \n     directly or by reference, which--\n       (i) is unfair to the owners of trust and restricted land \n     (and heirs and devisees of owners); and\n       (ii) makes probate planning more difficult; and\n       (4) a uniform Federal probate code would likely--\n       (A) reduce the number of fractionated interests in trust or \n     restricted land;\n       (B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning \n     assistance and advice;\n       (C) facilitate intertribal efforts to produce tribal \n     probate codes in accordance with section 206 of the Indian \n     Land Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2205); and\n       (D) provide essential elements of general probate law that \n     are not applicable on the date of enactment of this Act to \n     interests in trust or restricted land.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the implementation of air quality \nprograms developed in accordance with an Intergovernmental Agreement \nbetween the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the State of Colorado \nconcerning Air Quality Control on the Southern Ute Indian Reservation, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am re-introducing a bill that is \nimportant to the State of Colorado, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and \nall Coloradans that live in the southwest corner of our beautiful \nState.\n  More than thirty years of experience with environmental laws shows us \nthat local design and implementation of such laws almost always trumps \nthe ``one size fits all'' approach advocated by many in Washington, \nD.C.\n  The Federal Clean Air Act authorizes States and Indian tribes to \naccept responsibility for air quality plans and standards, and \nimplement many of the regulatory programs needed to maintain or improve \nair quality.\n  In 1984 Congress ratified a jurisdiction and boundary agreement \nbetween the Tribe and the State that spared both sides litigation costs \nand a fight over the jurisdictional status of each square inch on the \nreservation. The 1984 pact permits the Tribe and the State to work out \njurisdictional issues for themselves.\n  Some uncertainty remains with respect to environmental issues and \nrather than placing the Environmental Protection Agency in the middle \nof a controversy about whether it is authorized to delegate Clean Air \nAct programs within the Ute Reservation, the Tribe and the State signed \nan agreement to eliminate any ambiguities.\n  First, consistent with Congress' mandate in the Clean Air Act, the \nTribe will be the entity responsible for administering Clean Air Act \nprograms within the reservation.\n  Second, an equal number of Tribal and State representatives will sit \non the Commission established to hear and make decisions, and will set \nthe pace for Tribal applications for delegations of authority. Finally, \nFederal court review is available to hear challenges to decisions by \nthe Commission.\n  In closing, let me again commend the efforts of both the Tribe and \nthe State in negotiating and signing this historic agreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 551\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Southern Ute and Colorado \n     Intergovernmental Agreement Implementation Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress, after review and in recognition of \n     the purposes and uniqueness of the Intergovernmental \n     Agreement between the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the State \n     of Colorado, finds that--\n       (1) the Intergovernmental Agreement is consistent with the \n     special legal relationship between Federal Government and the \n     Tribe; and\n       (2) air quality programs developed in accordance with the \n     Intergovernmental Agreement and submitted by the Tribe for \n     approval by the Administrator may be implemented in a manner \n     that is consistent with the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et \n     seq.).\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \n     implementation and enforcement of air quality control \n     programs under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and \n     other air quality programs developed in accordance with the \n     Intergovernmental Agreement that provide for--\n       (1) the regulation of air quality within the exterior \n     boundaries of the Reservation; and\n       (2) the establishment of a Southern Ute Indian Tribe/State \n     of Colorado Environmental Commission.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administrator.--The term ``Administrator'' means the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (2) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Southern \n     Ute Indian Tribe/State of Colorado Environmental Commission \n     established by the State and the Tribe in accordance with the \n     Intergovernmental Agreement.\n       (3) Intergovernmental agreement.--The term \n     ``Intergovernmental Agreement'' means the agreement entered \n     into by the Tribe and the State on December 13, 1999.\n       (4) Reservation.--The term ``Reservation'' means the \n     Southern Ute Indian Reservation.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means the State of Colorado.\n\n[[Page S3276]]\n\n       (6) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Southern Ute \n     Indian Tribe.\n\n     SEC. 4.

CIVIL ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       If any person fails to comply with a final civil order of \n     the Tribe or the Commission made in accordance with a program \n     under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) or any other \n     air quality program established under the Intergovernmental \n     Agreement, the Tribe or the Commission, as appropriate, may \n     bring a civil action for declaratory or injunctive relief, or \n     for other orders in aid of enforcement, in the United States \n     District Court for the District of Colorado.\n\n     SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW.\n\n       Any decision by the Commission that would be subject to \n     appellate review if it were made by the Administrator--\n       (1) shall be subject to appellate review by the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit; and\n       (2) may be reviewed by the Court of Appeals applying the \n     same standard that would be applicable to a decision of the \n     Administrator.\n\n     SEC. 7. DISCLAIMER.\n\n       Nothing in this Act--\n       (1) modifies any provision of--\n       (A) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);\n       (B) Public Law 98-290 (25 U.S.C. 668 note); or\n       (C) any lawful administrative rule promulgated in \n     accordance with those statutes; or\n       (2) affects or influences in any manner any past or \n     prospective judicial interpretation or application of those \n     statutes by the United States, the Tribe, the State, or any \n     Federal, tribal, or State court.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Allen, \n        Mr. Craig, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Allard, and Mr. \n        Talent):\n  S. 554. A bill to allow media coverage of court proceedings; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sunshine \nin the Courtroom Act of 2003, a bill to allow media coverage of court \nproceedings. This legislation will provide Federal judges with the \nstatutory authority to exercise their discretion to allow the \nphotographing, electronic recording, broadcasting and televising of \nfederal court proceedings.\n  During the 107th Congress, the Judiciary Committee reported identical \nlegislation favorably, by a vote of 12 to 7. It's my hope that the full \nSenate will have the opportunity to act on this bill as early as \npossible in the 108th Congress.\n  Sunshine bill will help the American people to become better informed \nabout the judicial process. Moreover, this bill will help to produce a \nbetter judiciary. Increased public awareness and scrutiny will bring \nabout greater accountability and help judges to do a better job.\n  Allowing cameras in the Federal courts is consistent with the intent \nof our Nation's Founders that trials should be held in front of as many \npeople as choose to attend them. In my view, the First Amendment to the \nConstitution requires that court proceedings must be open to the public \nand, by extension, to the news media. As the Supreme Court has said, \n``what transpires in the courtroom is public property.''\n  Clearly, the basic American values of openness and education are \nserved by allowing electronic media access to Federal courtrooms. There \nare many beneficial and no substantial detrimental effects to allowing \ngreater public access to the inner workings of our federal courts. \nFifteen States have conducted studies aimed specifically at the \neducational benefits that are derived from camera access to courtrooms. \nThey all determined that camera coverage contributes to greater public \nunderstanding of the judicial system.\n  Moroever, the experience of the States with electronic media access \nto judicial proceedings demonstrate that still and video cameras can be \nused without any problems, and that procedural discipline is preserved. \nAccording to the National Center for State Courts, all fifty States \nallow at least some degree of camera access to judicial proceedings \nunder a wide variety of rules and conditions. My own State of Iowa, for \nexample, has operated successfully in this open manner for more than 20 \nyears.\n  Furthermore, at the Federal level, the Federal Judicial Center \nconducted a pilot program in 1994 that studied the effects of allowing \ncamera access to courtrooms. The study found ``small or no effects of \ncamera presence on participants in judicial proceedings, courtroom \ndecorum, or the administration of justice.''\n  Based on the experience of the States, as well as state and Federal \nstudies, Senator Schumer and I are introducing this bill with a well-\nfounded confidence that it represents sound public policy. \nNevertheless, in order to provide a mechanism for Congress to study the \neffects of this legislation on our judiciary before making this change \npermanent, we have included a three-year sunset provision in our bill.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that there is a \nstrong public interest in electronic media access to important court \ncases. At my urging and that of Senator Schumer, Chief Justice \nRehnquist permitted the delayed audio broadcasting of the oral \narguments before the Supreme Court in the historic 2000 presidential \nelection dispute. The Supreme Court's response to our request was a \nmajor step in the right direction.\n  It is important to emphasize, that this bill does not require any \nFederal judge in any Federal court to allow camera access to judicial \nproceedings. Rather, it simply gives Federal judges the discretion to \nallow cameras or other electronic media access if they see fit. The \nbill also protects the privacy and safety of non-party witnesses by \ngiving them the right to have their faces and voices obscured.\n  This piece of sunshine legislation will bring greater openness and \naccountability to the Nation's Federal courts. The best way to maintain \nconfidence in our Federal judiciary, which has tremendous power, is to \nlet the sun shine in by allowing judges to exercise their discretion in \nopening Federal courtrooms to public view through the broadcasting and \ntelevising of judicial proceedings. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nco-sponsoring the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Native American Health and Wellness \nFoundation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 556. A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nrevise and extend that Act; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Inouye and McCain in introducing two bills vitally important \nto the health of Native Americans: the ``Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct Reauthorization of 2003''.\n  It is an unfortunate fact that the health status of Native people in \nthe United States is poor. In fact, in the western hemisphere only the \npeople of Haiti are in worse shape.\n  Alcohol, drug abuse, and mental illness, tuberculosis, cancer, \nobesity and diabetes, heart disease, infant mortality, and a host of \nrelated pathologies plague Native people.\n  Last fall's reauthorization of the Special Indian Diabetes Program \nshowed the Federal commitment to ending the scourge of diabetes in \nNative communities.\n  The ``Indian Health Care Improvement Act Reauthorization of 2003'' \nwill reauthorize the programs administered by the Indian Health Service \nand will increase the direct management of health care services by \ntribes, Native Alaskans and Urban Indian health centers.\n  This bill is the product of intense consultation between tribes, \nNative Alaskan health providers, and Urban Indian health centers, and \nrelevant Federal agencies and representatives of the public and private \nhealth care sectors.\n  The efforts of the IHS and Native health providers have been \nsuccessful in improving the health status of Native people. Just in the \nlast 10 years, infant and maternal mortality rates have declined by 30 \npercent and 40 percent, respectively. Similarly, tuberculosis mortality \nrates have also been reduced 53 percent. Other indicia of Native health \nstatus have also shown marked improvement.\n  Even with modest increases in recent spending bills, funding for \nNative health care continues to lag far behind the level of need.\n  To help close this gap, we must be creative and tap other sources of \nfunds for Native health including the private, tribal and non-profit \nsectors of our economy.\n  The second bill I am introducing will do just that and will \nfacilitate the contribution of funds for purposes of Native health care \nby establishing a non-profit, charitable foundation to receive funds \nand in-kind contributions for such purposes.\n  This is not a radical step as similar foundations have been \nestablished for other purposes. In recent years Congress has created \nboth the American Indian Education Foundation and the Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation, which have proven to be very successful in achieving their \npurposes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting these important bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom\n\n[[Page S3316]]\n\ngross income amounts received on account of claims based on certain \nunlawful discrimination and to allow income averaging for backpay and \nfrontpay awards received on account of such claims, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Civil Rights Tax \nRelief Act of 2003, a bill designed to promote the fair and equitable \nsettlement of civil rights claims. I am very pleased to be joined today \nby Senators Grassley, Daschle, Bingaman, Cochran, and Sarbanes.\n  The primary purpose of this bill is to remedy an unintended \nconsequence of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, which \nmade damage awards that are not based on ``physical injuries or \nphysical sickness'' part of a plaintiff's taxable income. Because most \nacts of employment discrimination and civil rights violations do not \ncause physical injuries, this provision has had a direct and negative \nimpact on plaintiffs who successfully prove that they have been \nsubjected to intentional employment discrimination or other intentional \nviolations of their civil rights.\n  The problem is compounded by the fact that plaintiffs are now taxed \non the entirety of their settlements or damage awards in civil rights \ncases, despite the fact that a portion of a settlement or award must be \npaid to the plaintiff's attorney, who in turn is taxed on the same \nfunds. This double taxation of attorneys' fees awards penalizes \nAmericans who win their civil rights cases.\n  I would like to share one example of how individuals can be harmed by \nthe current taxation scheme, and even discouraged from challenging \nworkplace discrimination. The example was brought to my attention by \nDavid Webbert, an attorney who practices in Augusta, ME--my State's \ncapital. In one of his cases, David represented a person who \nsuccessfully challenged a business' policy of discriminating against \npersons with a particular type of disability. As a result of the case, \nthe discriminatory policy was declared illegal and was ended. Although \nthe plaintiff did not receive any monetary damages in the case, the law \ndid provide for payment of attorney's fees, which were paid by the \ndefendant's insurance company. Because of the current law's double \ntaxation of attorney's fees, they were taxable to the plaintiff in this \ncase, despite the fact that they were also taxable to the attorney. In \nshort, plaintiffs in civil rights cases like this could have to pay \ntaxes even though they receive no monetary award. Or, in other words, \nunder current law, a plaintiff can actually be penalized financially \nfor bringing a meritorious case against a company's discriminatory \npolicies.\n  Our bill would eliminate the unfair taxation of civil rights victims' \nsettlements and court awards--taxation that adds insult to a civil \nrights victim's injury and serves as a barrier to the just settlement \nof civil rights claims.\n  Our bill would change the taxation of awards received by individuals \nthat result from judgments in or settlements of employment \ndiscrimination cases. First, the bill excludes from gross income \namounts awarded other than for punitive damages and compensation \nattributable to services that were to be performed, known as \n``backpay,'' or that would have been performed but for a claimed \nviolation of law by the employer, known as ``frontpay.'' Second, award \namounts for frontpay or backpay would be included in income, but would \nbe eligible for income averaging according to the time period covered \nby the award. This correction would allow individuals to pay taxes at \nthe same marginal rates that would have applied to them had they not \nsuffered discrimination. Third, the bill would change the tax code so \nthat people who bring civil rights cases are not taxed on the portion \nof any award paid as fees to their attorney. This provision would \neliminate the double-taxation of such fees, which would still be \ntaxable income to the attorney.\n  The Civil Rights Tax Relief Act would encourage the fair settlement \nof costly and protracted litigation of employment discrimination \nclaims. Our legislation would allow both plaintiffs and defendants to \nsettle claims based on the damages suffered, not on the excessive taxes \nthat are now levied.\n  Our bill has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, AARP, the \nNational Employment Lawyers Association, the No FEAR Coalition, the \nReligious Action Committee for Reform Judaism, the Society for Human \nResource Management, and others. This bill is a ``win-win'' for civil \nrights plaintiffs and defendant businesses. I invite my colleagues to \njoin in support of this common sense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Campbell, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 558. A bill to elevate the position Director of the Indian Health \nService within the Department of Health and Human Services to Assistant \nSecretary for Indian Health, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ndesignate the Director of the Indian Health Service as an Assistant \nSecretary for Indian Health within the Department of Health and Human \nServices. I'm pleased that my colleagues, Senators Bingaman, Campbell, \nMurray, Johnson, and Domenici are joining me in this effort as original \nco-sponsors.\n  The purpose of this legislation is simple. It will redesignate the \ncurrent Director of the Indian Health Service, IHS, as a new Assistant \nSecretary within the Department of Health and Human Services to be \nresponsible for Indian health policy and budgetary matters.\n  The Indian Health Service is the primary health care delivery system \nand principal advocate for Indian health care needs, both on the \nreservation level and for urban populations. More than 1.6 million \nIndian people are served every year by the IHS, yet the agency has not \nhad the necessary resources to fully meet tribal health care needs. The \nIHS will continue to be challenged by a growing Indian population as \nwell as an increasing disparity between the health status of Indian \npeople as compared to other Americans. Thousands of Indian people \ncontinue to suffer from the worst imaginable health care conditions in \nIndian country--from diabetes to cancer to infant mortality. In nearly \nevery category, the health status of Native Americans falls far below \nthe national standard.\n  The purpose of this bill is to respond to the desire by Indian people \nfor a stronger leadership and policy role within the primary health \ncare agency, the Department of Health and Human Services. The Assistant \nSecretary for Indian Health will ensure that critical policy and \nbudgetary decisions will be made with the full involvement and \nconsultation of not only the Indian Health Service, but also the direct \ninvolvement of tribal governments.\n  This legislation is long overdue in bringing focus and national \nattention to the health care status of Indian people and fulfilling the \nFederal trust responsibility toward Indian tribes. Implementation of \nthis bill is intended to support the long-standing policies of Indian \nself-determination and tribal self-governance and assist Indian tribes \nwho are making positive strides in providing direct health care to \ntheir own communities.\n  Tribal communities are in dire need of a senior policy official who \nis knowledgeable about the programs administered by the IHS and who can \nprovide the leadership for the health care needs of American Indians \nand Alaska Natives.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to permit an \nindividual to operate a commercial motor vehicle solely within the \nborders of a State if the individual meets certain minimum standards \nprescribed by the State, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Commercial \nDriver's License Devolution Act of 2003. This bill is identical to that \nwhich I introduced in the 107th Congress as a companion bill to \nlanguage originally brought to the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives by my friend from North Carolina, Representative Howard \nCoble.\n  I believe it is no secret to my colleagues here in the Senate, that I \nsupport small business and returning power to the States. The \ntraditional, one-size-fits-all approach to governing has done more harm \nthan good, and this bill is an attempt to remedy some of that.\n\n[[Page S3318]]\n\n  This legislation will give States the option to establish their own \ncommercial driver's license, CDL, requirements for intrastate drivers. \nIt will return power to the States by giving them the option to license \nintrastate drivers of commercial motor vehicles based upon testing \nstandards determined by the individual States. And I stress, it will be \nan ``option.''\n  I want to emphasize that this legislation is not a Federal mandate \nimposed on States. States that choose not to participate would remain \nunder Federal guidelines. A State that chooses to exercise this option \nwould in no way diminish the role of the CDL in the long-haul trucking \nindustry. Additionally, this legislation effectively precludes two or \nmore States from using this option as the basis for an interstate \ncompact.\n  As I am sure my colleagues are aware, the Commercial Motor Vehicle \nSafety Act of 1986, CMVSA, required States to establish a new and \nuniform program of testing and licensure for all operators of \ncommercial vehicles both intra and interstate. The principal objectives \nof the Act have been met, and would not be harmed by this legislation \nI'm introducing here today.\n  I have no issue with the CMVSA. It is a good law, and at the time the \nprovisions it contained were necessary and timely for improving the \nstandards of performance for long-haul truck drivers in this country. \nHowever, I, like my counterpart in the House, believe the CMVSA was \nimposed upon intrastate commerce where the operation of trucks may be a \nsmall but necessary part of an individual's job. Therefore, the reality \nwas that Washington imposed its will on thousands of small businesses \nacross this country who aren't involved in long-haul trucking and we \nexpected them to adjust to any circumstance that might arise. That's \nunfair and not what government is supposed to be about.\n  When you have conditions such as these, I believe it should be within \na State's discretion to determine what kind of commercial vehicle \nlicensure and testing is required for commerce taking place solely \nwithin its borders.\n  This legislation is important to our nation's small businesses, \nespecially those dependent upon commercial truck travel, which means \nit's important to the consumers. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 559\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to impose tariff-rate quotas on certain casein and \nmilk protein concentrates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to show my support \nfor the Milk Import Tariff Equity Act of 2003 by being an original \ncosponsor of Senator Craig's bill. This legislation will prevent \nforeign dairy products from continuing to circumvent U.S. trade laws.\n  Currently, milk protein concentrate, MPC, is not subject to the same \nquotas required of other dairy products. Foreign dairy producers have \nbegun exploiting this loophole by blending previously processed dairy \nproteins with nonfat dry milk to boost its protein content so that it \nqualifies as milk protein concentrate. This allows the milk protein \nconcentrate to circumvent any laws that would subject the imports to \ntariff rate quotas.\n  The result has been a flood of foreign dairy blends being imported in \nthe U.S. market, displacing sales of domestic dairy products and \nlowering prices for American dairy farmers.\n  As milk prices are at historic lows, down about 38 percent from \nprices last year, this flood of foreign dairy products has put a strain \non many of the dairy farmers in my State of Wisconsin.\n  Since many of the blended products imported into this country are \nheavily subsidized, American farmers are forced to compete on an unfair \nplaying field. This loophole in our tariff schedule allows certain \nheavily subsidized foreign dairy products nearly unfettered access to \nour dairy markets, hurting the American dairy farmers.\n  As I travel across Wisconsin, I have heard from any dairy farmers who \nare struggling to stay in business. Many of these farmers are concerned \nabout the flood of unfair imports that are hurting our American dairy \nmarkets.\n  In March of 2001, the General Accounting Office, GAO, released a \nreport that highlighted the increase of milk protein concentrates \ncoming into this country under outdated trade laws. The report pointed \nto a loophole in our trade laws that has resulted in increased imports \nof blended dairy proteins. The importing of blended dairy proteins is \nbeing done solely for the purpose of avoiding the U.S. tariff rate \nquota for nonfat dry milk.\n  The GAO study determined that MPC imports surged by more than 600 \npercent in the six years before the report was released. MPC imports \nlower prices for U.S. dairy farmers by displacing sales of domestic \ndairy products.\n  Since I have received the results from the General Accounting Office \nstudy that reported this loophole in U.S. trade laws, I have \nparticipated in a bipartisan effort to amend this loophole, so that we \nmay protect our dairy farmers from unfair trade practices and help them \nin the struggle to farm on such an unfair playing field.\n  This bill would close this loophole by regulating milk protein \nconcentrate imports in the same manner all other dairy import products \nare regulated. It would correct a loophole that exists in U.S. trade \nlaw that is contributing to such low dairy prices experienced in my \nstate of Wisconsin and across the Nation.\n  This loophole depresses the price of milk for farmers, costs U.S. \ntaxpayers money, and gives foreign dairy producers an unfair advantage \nover our own dairy farmers. It is time for this Congress to stand \nbehind our farmers and that is why I support the Milk Import Tariff \nEquity Act of 2003.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator \nMark Dayton and Senator Larry Craig in introducing the bipartisan Milk \nImport Tariff Equity Act. Our bill will prevent importers of dairy \nproducts from circumventing U.S. trade laws.\n  Although I opposed it at the time, during the Uruguay Round \nmultilateral trade negotiations, the United States agreed to allow a \nsubstantial increase in dairy product imports into this country. Tariff \nrate quotas were established to allow imports of most dairy products to \nrise from an average of 2 percent of domestic consumption to as much as \nfive percent. At least initially, these controls appeared to be \neffective. But foreign competitors have found ways to circumvent these \nquotas by adjusting the protein content of nonfat dry milk so that it \nis classified\n\n[[Page S3319]]\n\nby the U.S. Customs Service as milk protein concentrate, MPC. While \nnonfat dry milk imports are strictly regulated, there are no quotas on \nMPCs and duties are low.\n  A recent GAO study requested by Congress determined that MPC imports \nsurged by more than 600 percent over a six year period. MPC imports \nlower prices for U.S. dairy farmers by displacing sales of nonfat dry \nmilk. According to the GAO study, some exporters are blending \npreviously processed dairy proteins, such as casein, whey and nonfat \ndry milk into MPC solely for the purpose of avoiding the U.S. tariff \nrate quota for nonfat dry milk. This practice, specifically cited in \nthe GAO report, circumvents statutory U.S. trade provisions designed to \nregulate imports of nonfat dry milk powder.\n  It is time to close this loophole. Under our bill, MPCs would be \nregulated in the same manner as all other dairy products: by imposing \ntariff-rate quotas on MPC imports. This legislation also closes a \nsimilar loophole that exists for casein used in the production of food \nor feed, while continuing to allow unrestricted access for imports of \ncasein used in the manufacture of glues and for other industrial \npurposes.\n  Most Americans probably don't realize it, because retail fluid milk \nprices have hardly changed, but dairy farmers in Vermont and across \nthis Nation are really struggling. Farm-gate milk prices have fallen \nmore than 30 percent over the past 18 months and are now at the lowest \nlevels in 25 years. Even the most efficient producers are unable to \nmake a profit at these prices. Prices are low in part due to these \nimports. Others will argue that MPC imports represent just a small \nfraction of U.S. milk production. But when you are dealing with a \nperishable commodity like milk, even a slight increase in supply can \nhave a dramatic effect on prices.\n  Closing the MPC loophole is one of the most important steps we can \ntake to help our nation's dairy farmers. I commend Senators Dayton and \nCraig for their leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Craig, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \n        Burns, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 561. A bill to preserve the authority of States over water within \ntheir boundaries, to delegate to States the authority of Congress to \nregulate water, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n   Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the State Water \nSovereignty Protection Act, a bill to preserve the authority of the \nStates over waters within their boundaries, to delegate the authority \nof the Congress to the States to regulate water, and for other \npurposes.\n  Since 1866, Congress has recognized and deferred to the States the \nauthority to allocate and administer water within their borders. The \nSupreme Court has confirmed that this is an appropriate role for the \nStates. Additionally, in 1952, the Congress passed the McCarran \namendment which provides for the adjudication of State and Federal \nWater claims in State water courts.\n  However, despite both judicial and legislative edicts, I am deeply \nconcerned that the administration, Federal agencies, and some in the \nCongress are setting the stage for ignoring long established statutory \nprovisions concerning State water rights and State water contracts. The \nEndangered Species Act, the Clean Water Act, the Federal Land Policy \nManagement Act, and wilderness designations have all been vehicles used \nto erode State sovereignty over its water.\n  It is imperative that States maintain sovereignty over management and \ncontrol of their water and river systems. All rights to water or \nreservations of rights for any purposes in States should be subject to \nthe substantive and procedural laws of that State, not the Federal \nGovernment. To protect State water rights, I am introducing the State \nWater Sovereignty Protection Act.\n  The State Water Sovereignty Protection Act provides that whenever the \nUnited States seeks to appropriate water or acquire a water right, it \nwill be subject to State procedural and substantive water law. The Act \nfurther holds that States control the water within their boundaries and \nthat the Federal Government may exercise management or control over \nwater only in compliance with State law. Finally, in any administrative \nor judicial proceeding in which the United States participates pursuant \nto the McCarran Amendment, the United States is subject to all costs \nand fees to the same extent as costs and fees may be imposed on a \nprivate party.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Burns, Mr. Craig, \n        Mr. Crapo, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Smith):\n  S. 562. A bill to amend chapter 3 of title 28, United States Code, to \ndivide the Ninth Judicial Circuit of the United States into 2 circuits, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate, in a 94-\n0 vote, went on record expressing its unanimous opposition to last \nweek's decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refusing to \nreview a three-judge panel ruling that bars children in public schools \nfrom voluntarily reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  The Pledge decision rendered by the court is not an aberration. It is \nsymptomatic of a court that has become dysfunctional and out-of-touch \nwith American jurisprudence, common sense, and constitutional values. \nUnfortunately, citizens in the states that are within the Ninth \nCircuit's jurisdiction have had to contend with the court's \nidiosyncratic jurisprudence for decades.\n  One should not be surprised that the full Ninth Circuit refused to \nreconsider this ill-conceived decision. The recent history of the court \nsuggests a judicial activism that is close to the fringe of legal \nreasoning. And it is for that reason that the Ninth Circuit has, by \nfar, the highest reversal rate in the country. During the 1990s, almost \n90 percent of cases from the Ninth Circuit reviewed by the Supreme \nCourt were reversed. In 1997, a startling 27 of the 28 cases brought \nbefore the Supreme Court were reversed--two-thirds by a unanimous vote.\n  Over the last three years, one-third of all cases reversed by the \nSupreme Court came from the 9th Circuit. That's three times the number \nof reversals for the next nearest circuit. And 33 times higher than the \nreversal rate for the 10th Circuit\n  Last November, on a single day, the Supreme Court summarily and \nunanimously reversed three Ninth Circuit decisions. In one of those \nthree cases, the Supreme Court ruled that the circuit had overreached \nits authority and stated that the Court ``exceed[ed] the limits imposed \non federal habeas review substitut[ing] its own judgment for that of \nthe state court.''\n  One of the reasons the Ninth Circuit is reversed so often is because \nthe circuit has become too large and unwieldy. The Circuit serves a \npopulation of more than 54 million people, almost 60 percent more than \nare served by the next largest circuit. By 2010, the Census Bureau \nestimates that the Ninth Circuit's population will be more than 63 \nmillion.\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Ninth \nCircuit alone accounts for more than 60 percent of all appeals pending \nfor more than a year. And with its huge caseload, the judges on the \nCourt just do not have the opportunity to keep up with decisions within \nthe circuit, let alone decisions from other circuits\n  Another problem unique to the Ninth Circuit is that it never speaks \nwith one voice. All other circuits sit as one entity to hear full-\ncourt, en banc, cases. The Ninth Circuit sits in panels of 11. Clearly, \nsuch a procedure injects unnecessary randomness into decisions. If an \nen banc case is decided 6 to 5, there is no reason to think it \nrepresents the views of the majority of the court's 24 active members.\n  In fact, some commentators believe a majority of the 24 members of \nthe court may have disagreed with the Pledge decision, but were \nconcerned that a random pick of 11 members of the Court to hear the \ncase, en banc, might have resulted in the decision being affirmed.\n  It is inconceivable to me that a circuit court could render a \ndecision based on its concern about the potential makeup of an en banc \npanel. What\n\n[[Page S3320]]\n\nkind of jurisprudence is that? Citizens in no other circuit face that \ntype of coin-flip justice. That is fundamentally unfair to every single \none of the 54 million people who live within the jurisdiction of the \nNinth Circuit and is reason alone to restructure the circuit.\n  It is time that Congress finally faces the fact that the Ninth \nCircuit is no longer a viable and functioning circuit. It is for that \nreason that I am today introducing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals \nReorganization Act of 2003. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenators, Stevens, Burns, Craig, Crapo, Inhofe, and Smith.\n  The bill we are introducing today would divide the Ninth Circuit into \ntwo independent circuits. The restructured Ninth Circuit would contain \nCalifornia, and Nevada. A new Twelfth Circuit would be composed of \nAlaska, Hawaii, Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Guam, and \nthe Northern Mariana Islands.\n  Earlier I indicated a number of reasons why I believe the Circuit \nneeds to be reorganized. Let us not forget the scope of this circuit \nand the 54 million people who live within it. The Ninth Circuit extends \nfrom the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border, spans the tropics of \nHawaii and across the International Dateline to Guam and the Mariana \nIslands. Encompassing some 14 million square miles, the Ninth Circuit, \nby any means of measure, is the largest of all U.S. Circuit Courts of \nAppeal. It is larger than the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, Seventh and Eleventh Circuits combined!\n  Moreover, because of the sheer magnitude of cases brought before the \nCourt, citizens within the court's jurisdiction face unprecedented \ndelays in getting their cases heard. Whereas the national average time \nto get a final disposition of an appellate case is nearly 11 months, an \nappeal in the Ninth Circuit takes nearly 50 percent longer--almost one \nyear and four months.\n  This is not the first time that Congress has recognized that the \nNinth Circuit needs restructuring. Numerous proposals to divide the \nNinth Circuit were debated in Congress even before World War II.\n  In 1973, the Congressional Commission on the Revision of the Federal \nCourt of Appellate System Commission, commonly known as the Hruska \nCommission, recommended that the Ninth Circuit be divided. Also that \nyear, the American Bar Association adopted a resolution in support of \ndividing the Ninth Circuit.\n  In 1995, a bill was reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nwhich Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah declared in his Committee's report \nthat the time for a split had arrived: ``The legislative history, in \nconjunction with available statistics and research concerning the Ninth \nCircuit, provides an ample record for an informed decision at this \npoint as to whether to divide the Ninth Circuit . . . Upon careful \nconsideration the time has indeed come.''\n\n  In 1997, Congress commissioned a report on structural alternatives \nfor the Federal courts of appeals. The Commission, chaired by former \nSupreme Court Justice Byron R. White, found numerous faults within the \nNinth Circuit and recommended major reforms and a fundamental \nreorganization of the Circuit.\n  On the day my legislation is enacted into law, the concerns of the \nWhite Commission will be addressed. A more cohesive, efficient, and \npredictable judiciary will emerge.\n  Many who oppose legislation to reorganize the Ninth Circuit, contend \nthat all the Circuit needs is the appropriation of more Federal dollars \nfor more Federal judges. However, I do not believe more money will \nsolve the inherent problems that exist in a circuit of such magnitude. \nAs former Senator and Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice, Howell \nHeflin, a Democrat from Alabama, remarked after Congress divided the \nformer Fifth Circuit: ``congress recognized that a point is reached \nwhere the addition of judges decreases the effectiveness of the court, \ncomplicates the administration of uniform law, and potentially \ndiminishes the quality of justice within a Circuit.'' in the case of \nthe Ninth Circuit, there can be little doubt that we are at that point \nin time that former Senator Heflin cited.\n  Former Oregon Senator Bob Packwood believed that a Ninth Circuit \nsplit would enable judges to achieve a greater mastery of applicable, \nbut unique, State law and State issues. He believed such mastery was \nnecessary because ``burgeoning conflicts in the area of natural \nresources and the continuing expansion of international trade efforts \nwill all expand the demand for judicial excellence . . . By reforming \nour courts now, they will be better able to dispense justice in a fair \nand expeditious manner.''\n  I agree with the former Senator. The uniqueness of the Northwest, and \nin particular, Alaska, cannot be overstated. An effective appellate \nprocess demands mastery of State law and State issues relative to the \ngeographic land mass, population and native cultures that are unique to \nthe relevant region. Presently, California is responsible for almost 50 \npercent of the appellate court's filings, which means that California \njudges and California judicial philosophy dominate judicial decisions \non issues that are fundamentally unique to the Pacific Northwest. This \nneed for greater regional representation is demonstrated by the fact \nthat the East Coast is comprised of five Federal circuits. A division \nof the Ninth Circuit will enable judges, lawyers and parties to master \na more manageable and predictable universe of relevant case law.\n  Further, a division of the Ninth Circuit would honor Congress' \noriginal intent in establishing appellate court boundaries that respect \nand reflect a regional identity. In spite of efforts to modernize the \nadministration of the Ninth Circuit, its size works against the \noriginal purpose of its creation: the uniform, coherent and efficient \ndevelopment and application of Federal law in the region. Establishing \na circuit comprised solely of States in the Northwest region would \nadhere to Congressional intent. And the State of Hawaii should \nrightfully be included in this circuit, for like Alaska, there are \nunique issues that are faced by the two States that are not part of the \ncontiguous lower 48.\n  A new Twelfth Circuit, comprised of states of the Pacific Northwest, \nwould respect the economic, historical, cultural and legal ties which \nphilosophically unite this region.\n  No single Court can effectively exercise its power in an area that \nextends from the Arctic Circle to the tropics. Legislation dividing the \nNinth Circuit will create a regional commonality that will lead to \ngreater uniformity and consistency in the development of federal law, \nand will ultimately strengthen the constitutional guarantee of equal \njustice for all.\n  It is my hope that this Congress will finally approve this necessary \nreorganization. It is long overdue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to facilitate the deployment of wireless \ntelecommunications networks I order to further the availability of the \nEmergency Alert System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Emergency \nCommunications and Competition Act, ECCA, along with my colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Sununu. We are joined by twelve of our \ncolleagues, led by Senator Burns, the distinguished chairman of the \nCommerce Communications Subcommittee, as well as Senators Dodd, Gregg, \nHutchison, Inouye, Jeffords, Lott, Kennedy, Leahy, Lieberman, Mikulski, \nand Miller.\n  The bill we introduce today is identical to S. 2922, the measure \nwhich Senator Burns and I co-authored in the 107th Congress. I was very \npleased and grateful for the tremendous support this legislation \nreceived from local television broadcasters and a wide range of public \ninterest groups that speak for consumers, minority groups, rural \nAmericans, health care, public safety, and property rights.\n  This bill will ensure that consumers will soon be able to avail \nthemselves of an innovative new wireless technology that has been \napproved by the Federal Communications Commission. It is called the \nMultichannel Video Distribution and Data Service, MVDDS, a title which \naccurately describes what this new service will provide consumers: \ncable competition and high speed access to the Internet.\n  As I indicated in my introductory remarks to S. 2922 last September, \nunless Congress enacts this legislation, it may be years before MVDDS \nis actually deployed to the public. That would be a lost opportunity \nfor consumers. We need to improve our communications infrastructure, \nnot only for greater access to cable and the Internet, but also for \npublic safety purposes. MVDDS technology can address all of these \nneeds, and we should remove unnecessary and counterproductive \nregulatory obstacles that prevent its swift deployment.\n  The Consumers Union, like many, has supported ECCA because it will \nhelp ensure that competition rapidly emerges for video programming as \nwell as high speed Internet services. Earlier this year, the Consumers \nUnion issued a report, ``Cable Mergers, Monopoly Power and Price \nIncreases,'' which documents the most recent steep rate increases \nimposed by cable operators. The report noted, for instance, that cable \nrates in Baton Rouge soared 7 percent last November. This was typical \nof rate increases throughout the country.\n  According to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, cable rates rose 11.4 percent in just the last two years. \nThis compares to a 3.8 percent increase in the Consumer Price Index \nover the same period. According to the FCC, just one percent of cable \ncommunities enjoy ``effective competition.'' I submit that this \nstartling lack of competition, more than anything else, explains why \nlocal cable rates have increased at three times the inflation rate.\n  If MVDDS can go head-to-head with incumbent cable systems in all \nparts of the country, I believe that this good old fashioned \ncompetition will result in lower prices and better service for \nconsumers--even for those who don't choose to subscribe to MVDDS.\n  Rural organizations recognize the extraordinary opportunity this new \nwireless technology can offer rural Americans. They understand that the \nFCC's Order, which authorized MVDDS, will likely fail to ensure this \nnew technology will indeed adequately serve rural America.\n  Local television broadcasters support this measure because it will \nensure consumers in their markets can view all local television \nstations. Today, satellite operators DirecTV and EchoStar do not carry \nover 1,000 local TV channels--and no stations from ten States: Alaska, \nArkansas, Idaho, Maine, Montana, Mississippi, North and South Dakota, \nWest Virginia, and Wyoming. As you know, the satellite operators sought \nto merge so that they would have sufficient capacity to carry all local \nTV stations, but federal regulators rejected the merger on \nanticompetitive grounds.\n  The Emergency Communications and Competition Act, which we are re-\nintroducing today, will restore fairness in the FCC licensing process, \nand in so doing, speed the deployment of MVDDS to applicants that are \nready to launch service to the public now.\n  The bill provides that MVDDS applicants will be licensed in the same \nmanner as satellite companies who applied on the same day to share the \nsame spectrum. Currently, the FCC plans to subject only MVDDS \napplicants to an auction process. This would impose a discriminatory \ntax on an innovative new technology. Unfortunately, this is more of the \nsame burdensome regulation that I believe has contributed to the \ncollapse of the telecommunications sector. Government regulation is \nnecessary, certainly, but we must be smart in how we regulate business. \nWe must ensure that our laws and regulations are technologically \nneutral so\n\n[[Page S3322]]\n\nthat government policies don't replace the role of the marketplace in \ndetermining the fate of consumer products and services.\n  In an Order released last month, the FCC recognized the need to \nprevent disparity in licensing when it authorized certain satellite \nspectrum to be re-used for mobile terrestrial service without requiring \na spectrum auction. Similarly, the ECCA would prohibit the FCC from \nconducting an auction for licenses that re-use satellite spectrum for \nfixed terrrestrial operations.\n  Furthermore, an action would drastically delay the introduction of \nservice to the public. Mr. President, this is quite the opposite of \nwhat spectrum auctions are supposed to do. In this case, industry \nincumbents can abuse the auction process to block the introduction of \nnew competition. A company with vast resources available could easily \ntrounce a small startup in an auction--and then, under the terms of the \nFCC's Order, it would not have to deploy service for 10 years. \nConsumers cannot and should not have to wait while this spectrum is \n``shelved'' for an entire decade.\n  The ECCA solves this problem by ensuring that only qualified \napplicants will be licensed. That is, within six months of enactment, \nthe FCC would issue licenses to any applicant that can demonstrate \nthrough independent testing that it will employ a technology that won't \ncause harmful interference to DBS operators with whom they would share \nspectrum. Then, to be sure that service is in fact deployed, the ECCA \nrequires licensees to provide service to consumers within five rather \nthan ten years.\n\n  This legislation also requires that parties who apply for licenses \nunder this provision must assume specific public interest obligations \nin exchange for their prompt licensing. The bill requires full must-\ncarry of local television stations, and an additional set aside of 4 \npercent of system capacity for other pubic interest purposes such as \ntelemedicine and distance learning. I can assure my colleagues that \nthese are issues particularly important in rural areas in states like \nLouisiana.\n  The ECCA will also promote public safety, in two ways. First, it will \nrequire MVDDS licensees to air Emergency Alert System warnings, \nincluding AMBER alerts for missing children. EAS warnings are presently \ncarried by cable systems and over-the-air broadcasters, but they are \nnot seen by those who get their programming from DBS unless the viewer \nhappens to be watching a local channel. Obviously, the need for greater \ndissemination of EAS warnings is particularly important for the ten \nstates in which no local stations are carried via satellite.\n  Second, this legislation requires MVDDS licensees to make their \ntransmission systems available to national security and emergency \npreparedness personnel on a top-priority basis in times of need. We all \nknow that when emergencies strike, the need for public safety personnel \nto communicate with one another skyrockets. MVDDS wireless networks, \nwhich will be deployed ubiquitously throughout the country, can help \nalleviate this thirst for spectrum.\n  For these reasons, I believe that Congress should act on this matter \nas soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to support his bill and vote \nfor enactment. I as, unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 564\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Communications and \n     Competition Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to improve homeland security, prevent tax increases, \nsupport education and health care, and strengthen the economy; to the \nCommittee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homeland \nProtection and Tax Hike Prevention Act of 2003.\n  As I speak, State governments face a budget gap of $80 billion in \n2004, according to the National Governors Association. My own State of \nNorth Carolina must close a $2 billion deficit this year, the third \nyear in a row that we have faced a deficit of $1 billion or more. There \nis an additional $30 billion deficit in 2003 that, for most States, \nmust be closed before the fiscal year ends in June. Cities and towns \nface a similar budget pinch. The likely result in many States will be \nsteep tax increases and budget cuts.\n  Because most States have seen two or three lean years in a row, the \neasiest cuts and sources of revenue have already been tapped. States \nalready closed nearly $50 billion in deficits for 2003. According to \nStandard and Poor's, ``With rainy day funds having been depleted \nrapidly over the past three years, few options remain other than tough \ncuts or revenue increases.''\n  The State and local budget crisis is a serious threat to our economy. \nState spending cuts and tax increases equaling $100 billion would \ndirectly lower GDP growth by one percentage point, according to the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities. According to the Center, ``The \nonly way this blow to the economy can be mitigated is through federal \nfiscal relief for the states.''\n  Millions of Americans across the Nation will be directly affected by \nState tax increases and budget cuts. For example, Kansas is considering \nnew taxes on hair stylists, theaters, and doctors. Missouri is now \ntaxing pharmacies. In fact, policymakers in 15 States are already \ncalling for tax increases of approximately $14 billion in 2004.\n  New York budget proposals would raise class sizes and cut 43,000 \nearly education slots in New York City. Florida may take away medical \ncoverage for 26,000 low-income people. In California, hundreds of \nnursing homes are in danger of bankruptcy, according to the Washington \nPost. San Diego may close fire stations.\n  Portland, OR, will likely trim its school year by 24 days. Oregon \nState police are laying off 129 troopers and abandoning 24-hour \npatrols. The Multnomah county jail will release as many as 500 inmates \nearly. Medical benefits will be eliminated for 8,000 elderly and \ndisabled people.\n  This is wrong. It's wrong for the people being hurt. And it is wrong \nfor our economy. That's why I am proposing the Homeland Protection and \nTax Hike Prevention Act of 2003. This bill would enacts a State relief \nplan I first described last November. It gives States and cities a \ntotal of $50 billion, allowing them to avoid raising taxes and protect \ncritical priorities in public safety, education, and health care.\n  First, my legislation would provide $10 billion to states and major \ncities to strengthen homeland security. We have a whole range of \nhomeland security priorities that we ought to be meeting but we \nhaven't. Although our domestic readiness begins with first responders, \nthey are not getting the training and equipment they need to respond to \nan attack with speed, skill, and strength. Our public health system \nisn't fully prepared to respond to biological attacks. We need to \nmodernize an emergency warning system that is terribly out of date so \nwe can reach Americans at any time, day or night.\n  Our infrastructure is exposed. There are 500 large skyscrapers, 250 \nmajor arenas and stadiums, and countless train, subway, and automobile \nbridges and tunnels. Many of these facilities have vulnerable \nventilation systems, poor emergency exits, and inadequate fire \nretardants and blast-resistant materials. Security at nuclear and \nchemical plants and over shipments is still too lax. At 123 chemical \nplants, a toxic chemical release would endanger a million people or \nmore.\n  We need to meet all these priorities, and we can ought to meet them \nthrough a partnership between Washington, states, and local \ncommunities. This bill goes a long way toward doing that by providing \n$10 billion for homeland security.\n  Next, today's bill would provide States $10 billion through higher \nMedicaid reimbursements. Higher Medicaid reimbursements can \ndramatically help State budgets. It can also address serious inequities \nin the way Medicaid funds are distributed today. The legislation is \nbased on Senator Rockefeller's excellent proposal. It maintains last \nyear's Medicaid matching rate where rates are declining and provides an \nadditional modest, temporary increase in the matching rate. This short-\nlived relief will help states balance their budgets and protect \nchildren and seniors who rely on Medicaid.\n  Last but not least, my bill will give States and local governments \n$30 billion in general relief. In return for this aid, State and local \ngovernments must agree not to cut K-12 education funding or raise \ncollege tuition faster than inflation for low- and middle-income \nfamilies.\n  Across the Nation, States and cities are struggling with more needs \nand less revenue. Washington is not doing its part to help. Instead, we \nhave created new demands through the No Child Left Behind education \nreform law and the Federal special education laws, without delivering \nthe resources needed to meet those demands. We ought to help States and \nlocalities meet those demands, and this bill will do that.\n  The Homeland Protection and Tax Hike Protection Act will strengthen \nour homeland security and prevent states and cities from raising taxes \nand cutting schools and health care. I hope my colleagues will join me \nin supporting it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 565\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Protection and Tax \n     Hike Prevention Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ameliorate the hardships faced by millions of \n     Americans as a result of State and local budget crises, \n     including tax increases and cuts to education, health care, \n     and other vital State and local programs;\n       (2) to avoid the economic damage that would be caused by \n     tens of billions of dollars in State and local tax increases \n     and spending cuts that would further weaken the Nation's \n     economic growth and job creation; and\n       (3) to improve the Nation's readiness for a terrorist \n     attack by providing financial assistance to assist States and \n     cities to--\n       (A) prepare first responders and emergency personnel;\n       (B) implement anti-counterfeiting protections;\n       (C) strengthen security at vulnerable targets, such as \n     nuclear power plants and public transportation systems; and\n       (D) address other homeland security priorities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nAlzheimer's disease research and demonstration grants; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Alzheimer's \nDisease Research, Prevention, and Care Act of 2003. I am pleased that \nSenators Bond, Kennedy, Lincoln, Breaux, and Dodd are joining me as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation. This bill expands research on \nAlzheimer's disease at the National Institute on Aging and reauthorizes \nthe Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant Program that helps patients and \nfamilies get services like respite care and adult day care.\n  I believe that ``honor thy mother and father'' is not only a good \ncommandment to live by, it's also a good policy to govern by. That's \nwhy I authored the Alzheimer's Disease Research, Prevention, and Care \nAct--to put values into action and get behind our Nation's families.\n  In 1998, the Federal Government was spending just $323 million on \nAlzheimer's disease research, a disease that affects about 4 million \nAmericans. I fought for more funding for Alzheimer's disease and the \nNational Institute on Aging. Not just an incremental increase--I fought \nto double the funding. I am proud that the National Institute on Aging \nwas funded at $1 billion this year. That's double what it was 5 years \nago. The Federal Government will spend more than $600 million on \nAlzheimer's research this year.\n  This investment in Alzheimer's disease research is paying off. \nScientists have found evidence that a cholesterol-lowering drug may \nprevent Alzheimer's. Researchers are testing a vaccine on mice that may \nprevent the disease in humans. Seven clinical trials are currently \nunderway to find out whether estrogen, vitamin E, gingko biloba, and \naspirin can prevent the disease.\n  Even with these victories, there is still a lot more to do. \nAlzheimer's disease is a devastating illness. Four million Americans \nsuffer from Alzheimer's, including one in ten people over age 65 and \nnearly half of those over age 85. Nineteen million Americans say they \nhave a family member with the disease. The Medicare program alone spent \n$31.9 billion for the care of people with Alzheimer's disease in the \nyear 2000. Without a cure, the number of Alzheimer's patients will more \nthan triple in the next 50 years. Fourteen million Americans will \nsuffer from Alzheimer's by 2050. If science can help delay the onset of \nAlzheimer's by even five years, it would improve the lives of millions \nof families and save billions of dollars.\n  This legislation is about more than just statistics--it's about \nhelping to meet the day-to-day needs of patients with Alzheimer's and \nthe long range needs of the nation. Last year, I chaired a hearing at \nthe Gerontology Research Center at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical \ncenter in Baltimore. I heard from Peter Savage, a Baltimore man caring \nfor his wife, Ina. Mrs. Savage was diagnosed with early onset \nAlzheimer's disease at just 53 years old. I heard Mr. Savage's pain and \nfrustration as he told the Subcommittee on Aging about his family's \nlong struggle: watching his wife's slow decline; trying to care for \nMrs. Savage by himself and with the help of daughters; the difficulty \nof finding someone to help them when the caregiving responsibilities \nwere more than the family alone could bear; and the looming costs of \nnursing home care.\n  The bill I am introducing gets behind families like the Savages and \nmillions of others struggling with this disease. My bill reauthorizes \nand expands the Alzheimer's Demonstration grant Program. This program \nhelps patients and families get support services like respite care and \nhome health care. These\n\n[[Page S3326]]\n\ngrants connect help states leverage private resources to fill in gaps \nin existing services and make sure that programs reach the most \nvulnerable families. This important program needs to be renewed this \nyear. I'm fighting to expand this program to nearly every state, to \nkeep our promises to America's families.\n  This bill also helps to meet the long-range needs of our Nation by \nincreasing the Federal Government's commitment to Alzheimer's disease \nresearch at the National Institutes of Health and the National \nInstitute on Aging. It puts the Alzheimer's Disease Prevention \nInitiative in our Federal law books to speed up the discovery of new \nways to prevent the disease. My bill sets up a cooperative clinical \nresearch program to stretch our Federal research dollars, by making it \neasier for researchers across the country to share data and enroll \npatients in clinical trials. It also authorizes research on ways to \nimprove the health of Alzheimer's caregivers--and ease some of their \nburden.\n  This bill gets behind our Nation's families--both in the lab and in \nthe community. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (by request):\n  S. 571. A bill to establish the Millennium Challenge Account and the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation in order to reduce global poverty \nthrough increased economic growth by supporting a new compact for \nglobal development; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, by request, I introduce for appropriate \nreference a bill to establish the Millennium Challenge Account and the \nMillennium Challenge Corporation in order to reduce global poverty \nthrough increased economic growth by supporting a new compact for \nglobal development.\n  This proposed legislation has been requested by the President of the \nUnited States, George W. Bush, and I am introducing it in order that \nthere may be a specific bill to which Members of the Senate and the \npublic may direct their attention and comments.\n  I reserve my right to support or oppose this bill, as well as to make \nany suggested amendments to it, as this important initiative of the \nPresident continues to be considered by the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord together with a section-by-section analysis of the bill and the \nletter from the President of the United States to the Congress of the \nUnited States dated February 5, 2003.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 571\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to reduce global \n     poverty through increased economic growth by supporting a new \n     compact for global development in which increased support is \n     provided by developed countries to those developing countries \n     that are ruling justly, fostering economic freedom, and \n     investing in their citizens.\n\n     SEC. 102. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.\n\n       To be eligible for assistance under this Act, a country \n     (``eligible country'')--\n       (1) must suffer from significant poverty;\n       (2) must have a demonstrated commitment to--\n       (A) Just and democratic governance, including political \n     pluralism and the rule of law, and respect for human and \n     civil rights of all citizens, protect private property \n     rights, encourage transparency and accountability of \n     governance, and limit corruption;\n       (B) Economic freedom, including economic policies that \n     encourage citizens and firms to participate in the global \n     product and capital markets, promote private sector growth, \n     and avoid direct government participation in the economy; and\n       (C) Investing in its own people, including improving the \n     availability of educational opportunities and health care for \n     all citizens; and\n       (3) must have entered into a Millennium Challenge Contract, \n     as defined in section 103, with the United States.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Short title\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Millennium Challenge Act of \n     2003''.\n\n               TITLE I--THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE ACCOUNT\n\n     Sec. 101. Statement of policy\n       Section 101 states the objective of the Millennium \n     Challenge Account, which is to reduce poverty through \n     promoting sustained economic growth in developing countries \n     committed to implementing good policies.\n     Sec. 102. Eligibility criteria\n       Section 102 identifies the criteria by which countries will \n     be eligible to receive Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) \n     assistance funds. MCA assistance will go to:\n       Very poor countries. It is currently anticipated that in FY \n     2004, countries eligible for MCA funds will be those that are \n     currently eligible to borrow from the International \n     Development Association (IDA) and which have per capita \n     incomes below $1,435 (the historical IDA ``cutoff'' for aid). \n     In FY 2005, all countries with per capita incomes below \n     $1,435 will be eligible for MCA assistance. In FY 2006, the \n     list of eligible countries further expands to those with per \n     capita incomes up to $2,975 (the current World Bank cutoff \n     for lower middle income countries). The per capita income \n     levels will be adjusted on an annual basis.\n       Countries with a demonstrated commitment to ruling justly, \n     encouraging economic freedom, and investing in their people. \n     To assess this commitment and identify recipient countries, \n     the MCA will use clear, concrete, and objective criteria. It \n     is the Administration's intent that in 2004, countries will \n     be selected based on 16 indicators chosen because of the \n     relative quality and objectivity of their data, country \n     coverage, public availability, and correlation with growth \n     and poverty reduction. The specific indicators are listed \n     below with their source noted.\n       Governing Justly:\n       Civil Liberties (Freedom House);\n       Political Rights (Freedom House);\n       Voice and Accountability (World Bank Institute);\n       Government Effectiveness (World Bank Institute);\n       Rule of Law (World Bank Institute); and\n       Control of Corruption (World Bank Institute).\n       Investing in People:\n       Public Primary Education Spending as Percent of Gross \n     Domestic Product (GDP) (World Bank/national sources);\n       Primary Education Completion Rate (World Bank/national \n     sources);\n       Public Expenditures on Health as Percent of GDP (World \n     Bank/national sources); and\n       Immunization Rates: DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) \n     and Measles (World Bank/UN/national sources).\n       Promoting Economic Freedom:\n       Country Credit Rating (Institutional Investor Magazine);\n       Inflation (International Monetary Fund [IMF]);\n       3-Year Budget Deficit (IMF/national sources);\n       Trade Policy (Heritage Foundation);\n       Regulatory Quality (World Bank Institute); and\n       Days to Start a Business (World Bank).\n       Countries that have signed a Millennium Challenge Contract \n     with the United States. The terms of this contract are \n     defined in Section 103 below.\n     Sec. 103. Millennium challenge contract\n       Section 103 specifies the contractual relationship between \n     recipient nations and the United States. Each MCA country \n     will negotiate and sign a Millennium Challenge Contract with \n     the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), established in \n     Title II. To initiate the negotiation, the selected MCA \n     countries will submit country proposals for MCA funds which \n     integrate official interests with those of the private sector \n     and civil society.\n       The negotiated Millennium Challenge Contracts will include \n     a limited number of clear and measurable objectives, regular \n     benchmarks to measure progress toward achieving the \n     objectives, a plan and a timeframe describing how and when \n     the objectives will be met. Each contract will state the \n     responsibilities of the recipient country and the United \n     States, and describe the role and contributions of non-\n     governmental entities including other donors as appropriate. \n     In addition, all contracts will provide for the financial \n     accountability of MCA funds.\n     Sec. 104. Millennium challenge assistance\n       Section 104 authorizes the President to provide assistance \n     for activities that contribute to the achievement of the \n     objectives specified in the contract. These activities will \n     drive productivity and economic growth in MCA countries. \n     Areas of focus for the MCA include agricultural development, \n     education, enterprise and private sector promotion, good \n     governance, health, and trade and investment capacity \n     building.\n     Sec. 105. Authorization of the millennium challenge account \n         and authorities\n       Section 105 authorizes appropriations to the President of \n     $1.3 billion in FY 2004 to carry out the MCA and such sums as \n     may be necessary for subsequent fiscal years. It is \n     anticipated that funding for MCA will reach $5 billion by FY \n     2006. MCA funds will be available until expended (``no-year \n     funds''). This availability of funds allows the Corporation \n     to obligate funds in the most productive manner.\n       Section 105 allows the provision of MCA assistance to \n     countries notwithstanding any other provision of law with the \n     exception of prohibiting MCA assistance to countries that are \n     ineligible to receive assistance under part I of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961. This provision restricts or prohibits \n     assistance to countries that engage in actions prohibited in \n     part I, including countries that: violate human rights, \n     support trafficking in narcotics or human beings, and \n     contribute to terrorist financing. If the President waives \n     any of these provisions to make a country eligible to receive \n     assistance under part I of the Foreign Assistance Act, then \n     that country also would be eligible to receive MCA \n     assistance. MCA assistance would be subject to the provisions \n     of the Anti-Deficiency Act.\n       In addition, section 105 makes the authorities and \n     limitations that are applicable to MCA assistance applicable, \n     as well, to any other funds used in conjunction with MCA \n     funds.\n     Sec. 106. Evaluation and accountability\n       Section 106 requires the Millennium Challenge Corporation, \n     established in Title II, to make all concluded Millennium \n     Challenge Contracts and their formal performance evaluations \n     publicly available on the Internet. The public nature of MCA \n     performance information makes the recipient countries and \n     implementers of MCA programs directly accountable to the \n     citizens of MCA countries and United States taxpayers.\n     Sec. 107. Graduation\n       Participation in the MCA will be limited according to the \n     terms of the Millennium Challenge Contracts, which will \n     define the purposes, activities and timeframe. MCA assistance \n     will have a clearly defined end date. For example, at the \n     conclusion of the contract period, MCA assistance will end \n     unless participant countries submit a new proposal and \n     renegotiate a new contract with the Corporation. Each \n     contract will also specify the conditions under which the \n     contract will be amended or terminated, including for reasons \n     of poor performance.\n\n             TITLE II--THE MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE CORPORATION\n\n     Sec. 201. Establishment of the millennium challenge \n         corporation\n       Section 201 establishes an independent U.S. Government \n     Corporation that will implement the MCA according to \n     provisions of Title I of this Act.\n     Sec. 202. Management of the corporation\n       Section 202 establishes a board of directors for the \n     Corporation that will be chaired by the Secretary of State \n     and include the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget. Individuals serving \n     in these positions in an acting capacity may serve on the \n     Board. The Board will direct the exercise of all functions \n     and powers of the Corporation, and shall make the final \n     decision on the eligibility and selection of MCA countries.\n\n[[Page S3329]]\n\n       The position of the CEO of the Corporation will be a \n     Senate-confirmed Presidential appointment. The CEO's \n     compensation is fixed at the equivalent of a deputy secretary \n     of a department of level II of the Executive Schedule.\n     Sec. 203. Functions of the corporation\n       Section 203 authorizes the Corporation to make grants to \n     any private or public entity to carry out the Millennium \n     Challenge Contracts, to provide technical assistance to \n     develop or carry out the Contracts, and to provide for the \n     financial management and evaluation of MCA programs.\n     Sec. 204. Powers of the corporation\n       Section 204 provides general powers to the MCC to enable it \n     to conduct business operations. The principal office of the \n     MCC is to be established in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan \n     area. The MCC also has the authority to establish overseas \n     offices as it sees fit. Employees of the MCC, and individuals \n     detailed to the MCC, are provided the authority to hold \n     offices with foreign governments, foreign government \n     agencies, or international organizations, so long as no \n     compensation is paid to such employees or individuals by the \n     foreign entity or international organization. Contracts and \n     other commitments of funds may make commitments for the \n     expenditure of funds for such period of time as the MCC deems \n     necessary. This section also provides discretion to the MCC \n     with regard to the making, performance, amendment, or \n     modification of contracts, grants, and other agreements. \n     Finally, this section provides that the MCC and its assets \n     and property are to be exempt from taxation by the United \n     States or by any State or local taxing authority.\n     Sec. 205. Personnel and administrative authorities\n       Section 205 authorizes the CEO of the MCC, in coordination \n     with the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to \n     establish a human resources management system for the \n     Corporation, including a retirement benefits program. \n     However, provisions of title 5 of the United States Code \n     related to anti-discrimination, merit systems principles, \n     whistle blowing, and conflicts of interest, are specifically \n     made applicable to the MCC. Employees of the MCC are \n     considered Federal employees for purposes of leave benefits, \n     workers compensation, unemployment benefits, life insurance, \n     health insurance, and long-term care insurance.\n       Section 205 also provides the authorities for detailing \n     U.S. government employees and private sector staff to the \n     Corporation. Federal employees have two options for serving \n     in the Corporation. They may be detailed on a reimbursable or \n     nonreimburseable basis without interruption of their civil \n     service status and privileges. Alternatively, they may resign \n     from their home agency and retain employment rights. Private \n     sector organizations may also detail staff to the MCC, while \n     continuing to pay those employees pay and benefits.\n       The Corporation has the authority to allocate or transfer \n     money to other agencies; use the services and facilities of \n     any U.S. agency under agreed upon terms; and use any of the \n     administrative authorities contained in the State Department \n     Basic Authorities Act of 1956 and the Foreign Assistance Act \n     of 1961.\n       Section 205 also makes the provisions of the Government \n     Corporation Control act applicable to the MCC.\n                                  ____\n\n     To the Congress of the United States:\n       I am pleased to transmit a legislative proposal to \n     establish the Millennium Challenge Account and the Millennium \n     Challenge Corporation. Also transmitted is a section-by-\n     section analysis.\n       The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) represents a new \n     approach to providing and delivering development assistance. \n     This new compact for development breaks with the past by \n     tying increased assistance to performance and creating new \n     accountability for all nations. This proposal implements my \n     commitment to increase current levels of core development \n     assistance by 50 percent over the next 3 years, thus \n     providing an annual increase of $5 billion by fiscal; year \n     2006. To be eligible for this new assistance, countries must \n     demonstrate commitment to three standards--ruling justly, \n     investing in their people, and encouraging economic freedom. \n     Given this commitment, and the link between financial \n     accountability and development success, special attention \n     will be given to fighting corruption.\n       The goal of the Millennium Challenge Account initiative is \n     to reduce poverty by significantly increasing economic growth \n     in recipient countries through a variety of targeted \n     investments. The MCA will be administered by a new, small \n     Government corporation, called the Millennium Challenge \n     Corporation, designed to support innovative strategies and to \n     ensure accountability for measurable results. The Corporation \n     will be supervised by a Board of Directors chaired by the \n     Secretary of State and composed of other Cabinet-level \n     officials. The Corporation will be led by a Chief Executive \n     Officer appointed by the President, by and with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate. This proposal provides the \n     Corporation with flexible authorities to optimize program \n     implementation, contracting, and personnel selection while \n     pursuing innovative strategies.\n       The Millennium Challenge Account initiative recognizes the \n     need for country ownership, financial oversight, and \n     accountability for results to ensure effective assistance. We \n     cannot accept permanent poverty in a world of progress. The \n     MCA will provide people in developing nations the tools they \n     need to seize the opportunities of the global economy. I urge \n     the prompt and favorable consideration of this legislation.\n                                                   George W.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to promote \norgan donation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this year, due to the rapid and tremendous \nadvancements in our knowledge and in the science of organ \ntransplantation, thousands of Americans will receive a life-saving \norgan transplant. These advances have allowed us to save the lives of \npatients who were once not considered candidates for transplantation.\n  As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I have had the opportunity to \nwatch the field develop and grow over the past three decades. I \nremember my own experiences--of conducting some of the first \ntransplants using hearts and lungs--and recognize our tremendous \nprogress since that time. And I also know the hundreds of my own \npatients who live improved lives due to advances in transplantation.\n  But I have also shared in the grief of patients who died before they \ncould receive a transplant--a direct result of a large and growing \nshortage of organ donors. Medical advances have produced a staggering \nincrease in the number of eligible transplant candidates, while the \nsupply of organs fails to keep pace. Today, more than 80,000 patients \nawait a transplant (a four-fold increase from just over a decade ago). \nAt the same time, more patients die each year before they can receive \nthat life-saving organ.\n  I have also witnessed firsthand how great, lifesaving hope can spring \nfrom great tragedy. Earlier this year, I offered my assistance at the \nscene of a horrible automobile accident in Florida. Most of the family \nin the accident died--including two young children. While my heart goes \nout to his family for their terrible loss, from this tragedy has come \nnew life. This family agreed to donate the organs of their loved ones. \nThis gift has saved the life of a boy from the Virgin Islands. We must \nhonor this family, and all other donor families, by redoubling our \nefforts to increasing organ donation.\n  There is no need for people to die while awaiting a new organ. In my \npractice, I carried a card that listed my patients who were waiting on \nhearts--always aware that several of them would die before a live-\nsaving organ would become available. It was this needless loss of life \nthat was the most painful, most frustrating and most disappointing part \nof my work.\n  In 2000, there were almost 23,000 transplants--a significant increase \nover the roughly 13,000 transplant performed in 1988. Between 1990 and \n2001, the number of organ donors almost doubled, mainly as a result of \nan increase in organs from live donors. In fact, over those ten years, \nthe number of cadaveric donors increased only 35 percent while the \ndemand for transplant has more than tripled.\n  More must be done. There are simply not enough organ donors; public \nawareness has not kept up with the rapid advances of transplantation. \nIt is our duty to do all we can to raise awareness about the gift of \nlife.\n  We must do is work to encourage all Americans to share their desire \nto be an organ donor with their families.\n  We must find other ways to improve organ donation--to identify \neligible organs and work with families to help them better understand \nthe value of donation. This is a new science--one that I have had the \nprivilege of watching firsthand grow from theories and experiments to \naccepted medical practice. My mentor, Dr. Norman Shumway, was one of \nthe leaders in the field; and the advent of cyclosporin was critical to \nits progress. But much remains to be learned, and we must continue to \nmove forward.\n  That is why one of my first priorities when I came to the Senate in \n1995 was\n\n[[Page S3330]]\n\nto establish the Congressional Task Force on Organ Donation--to promote \nawareness of this important issue and encourage a new dialogue seeking \nanswers.\n  Recent years have witnessed a new emphasis on highlighting public \nawareness of this need. In particular, I commend Secretary Thompson for \nmaking organ donation a top priority at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  There also are a number of complementary legislative approaches that \nwe should pursue towards this end.\n  We should provide funding for innovative and bold demonstration \nprojects to improve donation and recovery rates. As part of this, we \nshould ensure that the projects' results will be evaluated quickly and \ntheir lessons be disseminated broadly.\n  We should provide for the placement and evaluation of organ donation \ncoordinators in hospitals--a model that has worked with success in \nother countries.\n  We should expand the authority of the Agency for Healthcare Research \nand Quality to conduct important research on the recovery, preservation \nand transportation of organs. The science of organ transplantation has \nbeen improved and refined since its inception. Yet all too often, organ \ndonation efforts are conducted under the same practices as they were \ntwenty years ago. We must establish a strong evidence-based approach to \nenhancing organ donation and recovery.\n  We must encourage living organ donation by reducing potential \nfinancial disincentives facing living donors through the reimbursement \nof travel and other expenses incurred by living donors and their \nfamilies.\n  We must also seriously evaluate the long-term health effects of \nserving as a living donor by asking the Institute of Medicine to report \non this issue and by establishing a living donor registry to track the \nhealth of individuals who have served as living organ donors.\n  We must seriously examine and improve the role of organ donor \nregistries. These programs have an important role to play in improving \norgan donation rates and have been used with different levels of \nsuccess in some states. However, a number of questions surrounding \nregistries remain unanswered and their effectiveness has not been fully \nevaluated.\n  We must undertake a high-level systematic examination of the \neffectiveness of a range of organ donation approaches. Specifically, \nthe Institute of Medicine should evaluate practices or organ \nprocurement organizations, States, and other countries. This study \nshould examine existing barriers to organ donation, as well as best \ndonation and recovery practices, such as mandated choice and presumed \nconsent. The study should evaluate consent practices, existing state \nroutine notification laws, and the impact of requests for consent where \nregistry listing constitutes express consent under State law. This \nreview should be timely and include recommendations for action \nnecessary to replicate the best practices identified and to otherwise \nincrease organ donation rates.\n  We must recognize and honor the sacrificial decisions to give consent \nand give the gift of life made each year by thousands of donors and \nfamilies. We must do this in such a way as to honor those sharing life \nthrough donation and increase public awareness of this issue.\n  These initiatives are contained within two important pieces of \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  The Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act is a bipartisan, \ncomprehensive bill that seeks to improve the overall process of organ \ndonation and recovery, enhance our knowledge base in these fields, \nencourage novel approaches to this growing problem and increase the \nnumber of organs available for transplants each year. The bill also \nseeks to remove potential barriers to donation, while identifying and \nfocusing on best practices in organ donation. I thank Senator \nChristopher Dodd and Senator Mike Enzi for their assistance on this \nimportant bill. I also want to thank the wide range of patient and \norgan transplantation organizations who have done good work on this \nbill, including the American Society of Transplantation, American \nSociety of Transplant Surgeons, North American Transplant Coordinators \nOrganization, Tennessee Donor Services, New Mexico Donor Services, and \nGolden State Donor Services.\n  The Gift of Life Congressional Medal Act will make each donor or \ndonor family eligible to receive a commemorative Congressional medal. \nThis legislation, which does not cost taxpayers a penny, will recognize \nthe thousands of individuals each year who share the gift of life \nthrough organ donation. Moreover, it will encourage potential donors \nand enhance public awareness of the importance of organ donation to the \nover 80,000 Americans waiting for a transplant. Representative Pete \nStark will soon be introducing the companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I thank him for his dedication in this area.\n  Organ donation is one of the most important issues before us today. \nEach year, thousands of donors and families make the important decision \nto give consent and give the gift of life. We must recognize and honor \ntheir sacrifice, and, in so honoring, work to increase donation rates \nand allow more families to receive this gift of life each year. \nHundreds of my own patients are alive today because of this gift. Let \nus work together to allow more patients and families to experience this \nmiracle.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 572\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

QUALIFIED ORGAN PROCUREMENT ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       Section 371(a) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     273(a)) is amended by striking paragraph (3).\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for tragic reasons, organ donation has been \nin the spotlight of late. On Saturday, February 23, 2002, 17-year-old \nJessica Santillan died after receiving organs from a donor with an \nincompatible blood type. I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my heartfelt condolences to Jessica's family and friends.\n  While it is critical to understand how mistakes led to Jessica's \ndeath, and how they can be avoided in the future, this tragic incident \nshould not diminish our commitment to organ donation--a procedure that \nsaves thousand of lives each year, and was in fact Jessica's only \nchance for survival. Instead, we should make a commitment to increasing \nour donation rates and saving even more lives.\n  Today, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation with Senator Bill \nFrist to do just that. The Organ Donation and Recovery Improvement Act, \nwhich Senator Frist and I originally introduced last Congress, will \nbring positive attention to this critical public health issue by \nincreasing resources and coordinating efforts to improve organ donation \nand recovery. I am proud to be working with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Frist, whose leadership and professional experience as a heart \nand lung transplant surgeon has been critical in making this issue a \npriority.\n  At this very moment, more than 80,000 people are waiting for an organ \ntransplant, and one person is added to this list every thirteen \nminutes. This list has increased from 19,095 people a decade ago. \nUnfortunately, the discrepancy between the need and the number of \navailable organs is growing exponentially. From 1999 to 2000, \ntransplant waiting lists grew by 10.2 percent, while the total increase \nin donations grew by 5.3 percent. Tragically, in 2000, approximately \n5,500 wait-listed patients died waiting for an organ.\n  Undoubtedly, the task before our nation in caring for these patients \nseems daunting. However, each person who makes the decision to donate \ncan save as many as three lives. None of us wants to imagine the \nanguish of watching a family member or a friend wait for an organ \ntransplant hoping that their name reaches the top of the list before \ntheir damaged organ fails or having to bear the emotional, physical, or \nfinancial costs of undergoing a transplant procedure. For those that \ndo, and for all of those that will, we must improve and strengthen our \nsystems of organ donation and recovery. The legislation that Senator \nFrist and I are introducing today represents a significant step towards \nthis goal. It would establish a task force to evaluate and improve \nfederal efforts relating to organ donation and transplantation \nresearch, and would also authorize $3 million in fiscal year 2004 and \nsuch sums as may be necessary in fiscal years 2005 through 2008 for \ngrants to Organ Procurement Organizations to coordinate donation \nactivities between hospitals.\n  A vital part of increasing donations lies in education and public \nawareness initiatives. This legislation would authorize $5 million in \nfiscal year 2004 and such sums as may be necessary in fiscal years 2005 \nthrough 2008 to educate the public about issues surrounding organ \ndonation, as well as train health care providers and other appropriate \nprofessionals in the best methods to use when approaching possible \ndonors and their families. This funding could also be used for other \ndemonstration projects to increase organ donation and recovery rates. \nIn addition, an equal amount is authorized to expand the Agency for \nHealth Care Research and Quality's authority to improve organ donation \npractices.\n  We must also work to remove the barriers that stand in a donor's way \nas he or she seeks to help another person continue life. Our bill would \nseek to expand living donation by authorizing $5 million in fiscal year \n2004 and such sums as may be necessary in fiscal years 2005 through \n2008 for the reimbursement of related expenses incurred by the donor. \nIn addition, this legislation requests an Institute of Medicine report \non living donation practices and potential long-term health risks.\n  Finally, we must work to improve the science of donation and \nrecovery, and address legal issues relating to donation, including \nconsent. More than 20 states currently have registries that may prove \nindispensable in ensuring that we honor a donor's wishes. This bill \nwould establish an advisory committee to study the benefits, and \npotential shortcomings, of these arrangements and work to create a \nnational sense of urgency that matches the national need for donors.\n  I would like to recognize the invaluable support and guidance we \nreceived in drafting this bill from the American Society of \nTransplantation, the American Liver Foundation, the Patient Access to \nTransplantation Coalition, the North American Transplant Coordinators \nOrganization, and the National Kidney Foundation. I would be remiss not \nto also mention the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations, \nwhose members nationwide have worked so tirelessly to bridge the gap \nbetween the immense need for and the inadequate supply of donated \norgans. In my home state of Connecticut, we are well-served by the \ntremendous work of the Northeast Organ Procurement Organization and the \nNew England Organ Bank.\n  Finally, I look forward to working with my colleagues, including \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Gregg, and Senator Durbin, whose commitment to \nthis issue has been unparalleled. I urge Congress to take swift action \non this bipartisan legislation aimed at increasing organ donation and \nsaving lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3333-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3333-S3334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 78--DESIGNATING MARCH 25, 2003, AS ``GREEK \n INDEPENDENCE DAY: A NATIONAL DAY OF CELEBRATION OF GREEK AND AMERICAN \n                              DEMOCRACY''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Carper, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Corzine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nFitzgerald, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr.\n\n[[Page S3334]]\n\nHagel, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nLott, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, \nMr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, \nMr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                               S. Res. 78\n\n       Whereas the ancient Greeks developed the concept of \n     democracy, in which the supreme power to govern was vested in \n     the people;\n       Whereas the Founding Fathers of the United States drew \n     heavily on the political experience and philosophy of ancient \n     Greece in forming our representative democracy;\n       Whereas Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis, a \n     founder of the modern Greek state, said to the citizens of \n     the United States in 1821, ``it is in your land that liberty \n     has fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall \n     imitate our ancestors and be thought worthy of them if we \n     succeed in resembling you'';\n       Whereas Greece is 1 of only 3 nations in the world, beyond \n     the former British Empire, that has been allied with the \n     United States in every major international conflict for more \n     than 100 years;\n       Whereas Greece played a major role in the World War II \n     struggle to protect freedom and democracy through such \n     bravery as was shown in the historic Battle of Crete and in \n     presenting the Axis land war with its first major setback, \n     setting off a chain of events that significantly affected the \n     outcome of World War II;\n       Whereas the price for Greece in holding our common values \n     in their region was high, as hundreds of thousands of \n     civilians were killed in Greece during the World War II \n     period;\n       Whereas President George W. Bush, in recognizing Greek \n     Independence Day on March 25, 2002, said, ``Greece and \n     America have been firm allies in the great struggles for \n     liberty.

America and Greece are strong \n     allies, and we're strategic partners.'';\n       Whereas Greece is a stabilizing force by virtue of its \n     political and economic power in the volatile Balkan region \n     and is one of the fastest growing economies in Europe;\n       Whereas on January 1, 2003, Greece took over the Presidency \n     of the European Union for the fourth time since it joined the \n     Union in 1981 with the message of ``Our Europe: Sharing the \n     Future in a Community of Values'';\n       Whereas Greece, through excellent work and cooperation with \n     United States and international law enforcement agencies, \n     recently arrested key members of the November 17 terrorist \n     organization;\n       Whereas President Bush stated that Greece's ``successful \n     law enforcement operations against a terrorist organization \n     [November 17] responsible for three decades of terrorist \n     attacks underscore the important contributions Greece is \n     making to the global war on terrorism'';\n       Whereas Greece's unprecedented Olympic security effort, \n     including a record-setting expenditure of over $600,000,000 \n     and the utilization of a 7-member Olympic Security Advisory \n     Group which includes the United States, will contribute to a \n     safe and secure environment for staging the 2004 Olympic \n     Games in Athens, Greece;\n       Whereas Greece, geographically located in a region where \n     Christianity meets Islam and Judaism, maintains excellent \n     relations with Muslim nations and Israel;\n       Whereas Greece has had extraordinary success in recent \n     years in furthering cross-cultural understanding and reducing \n     tensions between Greece and Turkey;\n       Whereas Greece and the United States are at the forefront \n     of the effort for freedom, democracy, peace, stability, and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas those and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our 2 nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas March 25, 2003, marks the 182nd anniversary of the \n     beginning of the revolution that freed the Greek people from \n     the Ottoman Empire; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Greek people and to reaffirm the democratic principles from \n     which our 2 great nations were born: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates March 25, 2003, as ``Greek Independence Day: \n     A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American \n     Democracy''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the day \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to submit a resolution \nalong with 52 of my colleagues to designate March 25, 2003, as ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A Celebration of Greek and American Democracy.''\n  One hundred and eighty two years ago, the Greek people began the \nrevolution that would free them from the Ottoman Empire and return \nGreece to its democratic heritage. It was, of course, the ancient \nGreeks who developed the concept of democracy in which the supreme \npower to govern was vested in the people. Our Founding Fathers drew \nheavily upon the political and philosophical experience of ancient \nGreece in forming our representative democracy. Thomas Jefferson \nproclaimed that, ``to the ancient Greeks . . . we are all indebted for \nthe light which led ourselves out of Gothic darkness.'' It is fitting, \nthen, that we should recognize the anniversary of the beginning of \ntheir efforts to return to that democratic tradition.\n  The democratic form of government is only one of the most obvious of \nthe many benefits we have gained from the Greek people. The ancient \nGreeks contributed a great deal to the modern world, particularly to \nthe United States of America, in the areas of art, philosophy, science \nand law. Today, Greek-Americans continue to enrich our culture and make \nvaluable contributions to American society, business, and government.\n  It is my hope that strong support for this resolution in the Senate \nwill serve as a clear goodwill gesture to the people of Greece with \nwhom we have enjoyed such a close bond throughout history. Similar \nresolutions have been passed by the Senate since 1984 with overwhelming \nsupport. Accordingly, I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this important resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I rise before the Senate in support \nof a Senate Resolution submitted today by my colleague Senator Specter. \nThis resolution designates March 25 of this year as ``Greek \nIndependence Day: A day of celebration for Greek and American \ndemocracy.''\n  The people of ancient Greece made important, lasting contributions to \nhumanity in the fields of literature, philosophy, mathematics, and the \nphysical sciences. The greatest part of their legacy, though, is a \nsimple yet powerful idea that was born over 2,000 years ago. It is the \nidea that citizens should possess the power to determine the course of \ntheir Nation.\n  The bonds that join the United States and Greece are deep and long \nlasting. In 1821, Greek Commander in Chief Petros Mavromichalis said to \nthe citizens of the United States: ``it is in your land that liberty \nhas fixed her abode and . . . in imitating you, we shall imitate our \nancestors and be thought worthy of them if we succeed in resembling \nyou.'' Since modern Greece's struggle for independence 182 years ago, \nour countries have stood to together as allies and friends. We have \npeacefully worked together in every major international conflict.\n  Today, Greece continues to embrace the ideals of freedom, democracy, \nand peace. The past few years have witnessed hopeful new steps toward \nthe resolution of a number of the world's longstanding conflicts and \nanimosities. With its strategic location at the nexus of Europe, Asia \nand Africa, Greece has been a key participant in many of these efforts. \nIn particular, it has played a pivotal role in promoting \ndemocratization, economic development and, above all, peace in the \nBalkans.\n  In honoring Greek Independence Day, we pay special tribute to those \nGreek men and women who gave their lives for the common cause of \nfreedom. Greek-Americans can especially take pride in their ancestors' \nsacrifice. The many Greek sons and daughters who have come to the \nUnited States have worked honorably in all areas of American life, \nincluding public service. Greek culture flourishes in American cities, \nadding to our country's rich diversity.\n  It is with great honor that I join my colleagues in recognizing this \nanniversary of Greek independence. Our two great nations have fought to \nmaintain freedom and established democracy throughout the world. In \ndesignating March 25 of this year as ``Greek Independence Day'', we \ncelebrate the freedom that these two great nations represent.\n  Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to my colleagues \nabout this important date.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3335-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3335]]\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 251.

Mr. President, today we have proceeded with the \nPresident's nominations to the U.S. Parole Commission, among others. \nThese individuals were the selections of the White House without \nconsultation with the Democratic leader or with me or other Democratic \nSenators interested in these matters. We have proceeded on the \nPresident's nominees expeditiously and in good faith trusting that the \nWhite House will follow through expeditiously to nominate those members \nto the U.S. Parole Commission that the Democratic leader is \nrecommending to fill the seats allocated to Democrats on what should be \na bipartisan commission.\n  This President has too often in the past proceeded unilaterally on \nwhat have traditionally been bipartisan boards and commissions. Last \nyear the White House caused significant problems for all nominations \nwhen it failed to follow through in a timely way on a commitment made \nto Senator McCain. That led to objections and cloture votes being \nrequired on a series of the President's judicial nominations and \nunnecessary delays with respect to both judicial and executive \nnominations because of objections from the Republican side.\n  With respect to all nominations, I urge the President to begin to \nwork with us. Just as this White House has failed to work with Senate \nDemocrats on judicial nominees, it has often failed to work with us on \nnominations to bipartisan boards and commissions. We would appreciate \nthis White House beginning to work with us rather than dictate to us.\n  Just this week Thomas E. Mann, a distinguished scholar and senior \nfellow in governance studies at The Brookings Institution, wrote a \ncolumn about the deteriorating relations between the White House and \nthe Congress with respect to the nomination and confirmation process. \nWhile I do not agree with all of his observations, I note that he \ncorrectly observed that after the President's campaign as a uniter not \na divider, we did expect more cooperation. And after the attack of \nSeptember 11, when Democrats sought to close ranks and forego \npartisanship, we were disappointed by the continuing partisanship of \nthe White House. Mr. Mann wrote: ``After the 2000 election and then \nagain after Sept. 11, 2001, Democrats expected something akin to a \ngovernment of national unity. Instead, they encountered a president who \nseemed determined to wage institutional, ideological and partisan \nwar.''\n  Mr. Mann concluded by suggesting: ``The only way to break this cycle \nof escalation is for Bush to take pre-emptive action by submitting a \nmore balanced ticket of judicial nominees and engaging in genuine \nnegotiations and compromise with both parties in Congress.'' I agree, \nthat would be a useful development. I add that it would be long \noverdue.\n  Today, on the day the Senate has moved off the Estrada nomination \nbecause of the lack of cooperation by the administration, the Senate is \nwith the consent of every Democratic Senators agreeing to the \nconfirmation of another judicial nominee, the 104th for this President, \nand several executive branch nominees.\n  I ask consent to print Thomas E. Mann's column in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the RollCall, Mar. 5, 2003]\n\n                             Guest Observer\n\n                          (by Thomas E. Mann)\n\n\n         Estrada Caught in ``Poisonous War'' Based on Ideology\n\n       The extended Senate debate on the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has \n     generated pitched battles between party activists around the \n     country and increasingly shrill commentary from pundits. Some \n     claim we are on the verge of a constitutional coup that \n     effectively nullifies a president's power over judicial \n     appointments. Others respond that we are witnessing a \n     legitimate effort by the Senate minority to prevent the \n     packing of the federal judiciary with right-wing jurists.\n       How unprecedented is the tactic embraced by Senate \n     Democrats? What accounts for the partisan struggle now \n     playing out on the Senate floor? Is there any way out?\n       Filibusters have been a prominent feature of the Senate \n     since the early 19th century. While the constitutional \n     framers built no supermajority requirements for the passage \n     of legislation or the confirmation of appointees, the early \n     Senate, unlike the House, did away with its motion on the \n     previous question that would have allowed a majority to cut \n     off debate and proceed with a vote. As a consequence, for \n     virtually all of their chamber's history Senators have been \n     able to postpone or prevent floor action by talking at \n     length.\n       Under pressure from President Woodrow Wilson, the Senate \n     adopted a cloture provision in its rules that allowed a \n     supermajority to cut off debate. For much of the 20th century \n     the filibuster was mostly reserved for issues of great \n     national moment. In the past several decades, the Senate has \n     seen the routinization of the filibuster, to the point where \n     it is commonly accepted by both parties that with limited \n     exceptions, 60 votes are needed to pass controversial \n     matters. Some exceptions are built into the rules. The budget \n     process provides for limited debate on budget resolutions and \n     reconciliation bills, thereby empowering a majority of \n     Senators. Other exceptions flow from informal understandings \n     or norms. One of those norms is that the minority party does \n     not use extended debate to kill judicial nominations favored \n     by a majority of Senators.\n       During periods of divided party government, the Senate \n     majority fan frustrate the president's ability to fill \n     judicial vacancies simply by refusing to schedule committee \n     hearings or votes on nominees. Between 1995 and 2000, roughly \n     a third of President Bill Clinton's circuit court appointees \n     were killed in this manner by the Republican majority, \n     holding open judgeships that President Bush now seeks to \n     fill. The Democrats responded in kind to a number of \n     President Bush's nominees during their brief time in the \n     majority.\n       The crunch comes when one party controls both the White \n     House and Senate. Minority Members can try to delay action on \n     judicial nominees with holds and procedural moves in \n     committee. But their doomsday weapon is\n\n[[Page S3338]]\n\n     the filibuster. The norms of the Senate mitigate against \n     firing that weapon as part of an explicit party strategy. \n     Nonetheless, groups of Senators have engaged in extended \n     floor debate to try to defeat judicial nominations. More \n     than a dozen cloture motions were filed to end filibusters \n     on judicial nominations between 1980 and 2000. But only \n     one judicial nominee was successfully blocked by a \n     filibuster. In 1968 Republicans and Southern Democrats \n     used a filibuster to defeat President Lyndon Johnson's \n     effort to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice.\n       So the Senate Democrats' resort to a filibuster on the \n     Estrada nomination is not unprecedented but it is highly \n     unusual and extreme by Senate conventions. It is the latest \n     escalation in what has been an intensifying ``War of the \n     Roses'' between the parties in Washington. Earlier episodes \n     included divisive battles over the Supreme Court nominations \n     of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas; the winter 1995-96 budget \n     fights that led to government shutdowns; and the long-running \n     independent counsel investigations of Clinton, leading to his \n     impeachment by the Republican House.\n       That war is partly a consequence of razor-thin majorities \n     in the Congress, the increasing ideological polarization \n     between the parties, and the extension of the permanent \n     campaign to the Congress. It has intensified as a result of \n     the circumstances and leadership style of George W. Bush's \n     presidency.\n       Bush was elected in 2000 in the closest and arguably most \n     controversial presidential election in U.S. history. He lost \n     the popular vote but won a bare majority of the electoral \n     vote but won a bare majority of the electoral vote thanks to \n     flawed ballot designs in two Florida counties and to an \n     audacious 5-4 Supreme Court decision to halt a statewide \n     recount.\n       Yet he has governed with great ambition and confidence, \n     asserting presidential prerogatives and advancing a bold \n     conservative agenda through policy proposals and nominations. \n     He has played hardball with Democrats, in D.C. and on the \n     2002 campaign trail, while providing regular sustenance to \n     his conservative base. After the 2000 election and then again \n     after Sept. 11, 2001, Democrats expected something akin to a \n     government of national unity. Instead, they encountered a \n     president who seemed determined to wage institutional, \n     ideological and partisan war. They have decided to \n     reciprocate. The atmosphere is poisonous. Miguel Estrada is \n     now a part of that war.\n       The only way to break this cycle of escalation is for Bush \n     to take pre-emptive action by submitting a more balanced \n     ticket of judicial nominees and engaging in genuine \n     negotiation and compromise with both parties in Congress. \n     That seems most unlikely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3338-1", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 13\n\n       Whereas on January 20, 2003, Libya, a gross violator of \n     human rights and State sponsor of terrorism, was elected to \n     chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (the \n     ``Commission''), a body charged with the responsibility of \n     promoting universal respect for human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms for all;\n       Whereas according to the rotation system that governs the \n     selection of the Executive Board of the Commission, 2003 was \n     designated as the year for the Africa Group to chair the \n     Commission, and the Africa Group selected Libya as its \n     candidate;\n       Whereas South Africa's Democratic Alliance spokeswoman, \n     Dene Smuts, was quoted by the British Broadcasting \n     Corporation as saying that the Government of South Africa's \n     decision to support the election of Libya was an insult to \n     human rights and that African countries ``should have \n     supported a candidate of whom all Africans could be proud'';\n       Whereas Amnesty International has repeatedly documented \n     that the human rights situation in Libya continues to \n     seriously deteriorate, with systematic occurrences of gross \n     human rights violations, including the extrajudicial \n     execution of government opponents and the routine torture, \n     and occasional resulting death, of political detainees during \n     interrogation;\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch recently declared that ``[o]ver \n     the past three decades, Libya's human rights record has been \n     appalling'' and that ``Libya has been a closed country for \n     United Nations and nongovernmental human rights \n     investigators'';\n       Whereas Human Rights Watch further asserted that ``Libya's \n     election poses a real test for the Commission,'' observing \n     that ``[r]epressive governments must not be allowed to hijack \n     the United Nations human rights system'';\n       Whereas the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights urged that \n     ``the Government of Libya should not be entrusted by the \n     United Nations to lead its international effort to promote \n     human rights around the world'';\n       Whereas Freedom House declared that ``[a] country [such as \n     Libya] with such a gross record of human rights abuses should \n     not direct the proceedings of the United Nation's main human \n     rights monitoring body'' because it would ``undermine the \n     United Nation's moral authority and send a strong and clear \n     message to fellow rights violators that they are in the \n     clear'';\n       Whereas on November 13, 2001, a German court convicted a \n     Libyan national for the 1986 bombing of the La Belle disco \n     club in Berlin which killed two United States servicemen, and \n     the court further declared that there was clear evidence of \n     responsibility of the Government of Libya for the bombing;\n       Whereas Libya was responsible for the December 21, 1988, \n     explosion of Pan American World Airways Flight 103 (``Pan Am \n     Flight 103'') en route from London to New York City that \n     crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 passengers and \n     crew and 11 other people on the ground;\n       Whereas a French court convicted 6 Libyan government \n     officials in absentia for the bombing of UTA Flight 772 over \n     Niger in 1989;\n       Whereas, in response to Libya's complicity in international \n     terrorism, United Nations Security Council Resolution 748 of \n     March 31, 1992, imposed an arms and air embargo on Libya and \n     established a United Nations Security Council sanctions \n     committee to address measures against Libya;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 883 of \n     November 11, 1993, tightened sanctions on Libya, including \n     the freezing of Libyan funds and financial resources in other \n     countries, and banned the provision to Libya of equipment for \n     oil refining and transportation;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1192 of \n     August 27, 1998, reaffirmed that the measures set forth in \n     previous resolutions remain in effect and binding on all \n     Member States, and further expressed the intention of the \n     United Nations to consider additional measures if the \n     individuals charged in connection with the bombings of Pan Am \n     Flight 103 and UTA Flight 772 had not promptly arrived or \n     appeared for trial on those charges in accordance with \n     paragraph (8) of that Resolution;\n       Whereas in January 2001, a three-judge Scottish court \n     sitting in the Netherlands found Libyan Abdel Basset al-\n     Megrahi guilty of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, sentenced \n     him to life imprisonment, and said the court accepted \n     evidence that he was a member of Libya's Jamahariya Security \n     Organization, and in March 2002, a five-judge Scottish \n     appeals court sitting in the Netherlands upheld the \n     conviction;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolutions 731, \n     748, 883, and 1192 demanded that the Government of Libya \n     provide appropriate compensation to the families of the \n     victims, accept responsibility for the actions of Libyan \n     officials in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, provide a full \n     accounting of its involvement in that terrorist act, and \n     cease all support for terrorism;\n       Whereas Libya remains on the Department of State's list of \n     state-sponsors of terrorism;\n       Whereas the United States found the selection of Libya to \n     chair the Commission to be an affront to international human \n     rights efforts and, in particular, to victims of Libya's \n     repression and Libyan-sponsored terrorism, and therefore \n     broke with precedent and called for a recorded vote among \n     Commission members on Libya's chairmanship;\n       Whereas Canada and one other country joined the United \n     States in voting against Libya, with 17 countries abstaining \n     from the recorded vote among Commission members on Libya's \n     chairmanship of the Commission;\n       Whereas the common position of the members of the European \n     Union was to abstain from the recorded vote on the selection \n     of Libya as chair of the Commission;\n\n[[Page S3339]]\n\n       Whereas 33 countries ignored Libya's record on human rights \n     and status as a country subject to United Nations sanctions \n     for the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and voted for \n     Libya to lead the Commission;\n       Whereas the majority of the countries that voted for Libya \n     are recipients of United States foreign aid;\n       Whereas the selection of Libya to chair the Commission is \n     only the most recent example of a malaise plaguing the \n     Commission that has called into question the Commission's \n     credibility as the membership ranks of the Commission have \n     swelled in recent years with countries that have a history of \n     egregious human rights violations;\n       Whereas the challenge by the United States to the selection \n     of Libya is part of a broader effort to reform the \n     Commission, reclaim it from the oppressors, and ensure that \n     it fulfills its mandate;\n       Whereas on January 20, 2003, Ambassador Kevin Moley, United \n     States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and \n     Other International Organizations in Geneva, emphasized that \n     the United States ``seek[s] to actively engage and strengthen \n     the moral authority of the Commission on Human Rights, so \n     that it once again proves itself a forceful advocate for \n     those in need of having their human rights protected'' and \n     that ``[w]e are convinced that the best way for the \n     Commission to ensure the ideals of the Universal Declaration \n     of Human Rights over the long-term is to have a membership \n     comprised of countries with strong human rights records at \n     home'';\n       Whereas a majority of the 53 member states of the \n     Commission are participants in the Community of Democracies \n     and signed the Community of Democracies Statement on \n     Terrorism (the ``Statement on Terrorism'') on November 12, \n     2002, at the Second Ministerial Conference of the Community \n     of Democracies held in Seoul, South Korea (the ``Seoul \n     Ministerial''), calling upon democratic nations to work \n     together to uphold the principles of democracy, freedom, good \n     governance, and accountability in international \n     organizations;\n       Whereas the Seoul Ministerial participants declared in the \n     Statement on Terrorism that they ``strongly denounced \n     terrorism as a grave threat to democratic societies and the \n     values they embrace[,] . . . reaffirmed that terrorism \n     constitutes a threat to international peace and security as \n     well as to humanity in general and indeed to the very \n     foundation on which democracies are built[,]'' and stated \n     that ``[t]he most recent terrorist attacks confirm that \n     international cooperation against terrorism will remain a \n     long-term effort and requires a sustained universal \n     commitment'';\n       Whereas the United Nations sanctions against Libya, though \n     suspended, remain in effect; and\n       Whereas Libya's continued status as an international outlaw \n     nation and its continued unwillingness to accept \n     responsibility for its terrorist actions provide ample \n     justification for barring Libya from consideration as a \n     candidate for membership in the United Nations Security \n     Council or any other United Nations entity or affiliated \n     agency: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) strongly condemns the selection of Libya to chair the \n     United Nations Commission on Human Rights (the \n     ``Commission'');\n       (2) commends the President for the principled position of \n     the United States in objecting to and calling for a vote on \n     Libya's chairmanship of the Commission;\n       (3) commends countries that joined the United States in \n     objecting to Libya's selection as chair of the Commission;\n       (4) expresses its dismay at the European Union countries' \n     common position of abstention on the critical vote over \n     Libya's chairmanship;\n       (5) expresses its shock and dismay over the support \n     provided to Libya in its efforts to lead the Commission;\n       (6) highlights its grave concern over the continuing \n     efforts of countries violating human rights and terrorist \n     countries to use international fora--\n       (A) to legitimize their regimes; and\n       (B) to continue to act with impunity;\n       (7) calls on the President to raise United States \n     objections to such efforts during bilateral and multilateral \n     discussions and to direct pertinent members of the \n     President's Cabinet to do the same;\n       (8) calls on countries at various stages of democratization \n     to--\n       (A) demonstrate their commitment to human rights, \n     democracy, peace and security; and\n       (B) support efforts to reform the Commission;\n       (9) calls on the President to instruct the Secretary of \n     State to consult with the appropriate congressional \n     committees, within 60 calendar days after the adoption of \n     this resolution, regarding the priorities and strategy of the \n     United States for the 59th session of the Commission on Human \n     Rights and its strategy and proposals for reform of the \n     Commission;\n       (10) objects to the continued suspension of United Nations \n     sanctions against Libya until the Government of Libya--\n       (A) publicly accepts responsibility for the bombing of Pan \n     American World Airways Flight 103;\n       (B) provides appropriate compensation to the victims of the \n     bombing; and\n       (C) fully complies with all of the other requirements of \n     the United Nations sanctions imposed as a result of Libya's \n     orchestration of the terrorist attack on Pan American World \n     Airways Flight 103; and\n       (11) calls on the Secretary of State to engage Member \n     States of the United Nations to support efforts to ensure \n     that states that are gross violators of human rights, \n     sponsors of terrorist activities, or subjects of United \n     Nations sanctions are not elected to--\n       (A) leadership positions in the United Nations General \n     Assembly; or\n       (B) membership or leadership positions on the United \n     Nations Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations \n     Security Council, or any other United Nations entity or \n     affiliate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"},

Mr. President, the purpose of the morning business is to \nhave Senators speak if they so desire. There have been some Senators \nwishing to speak on the situation in Iraq. The President is having a \npress conference tonight. It would be timely to do that. I say to those \npeople who have indicated a desire to speak, this is their opportunity \ntomorrow. Is that the intent of the leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is the intent. It is important that \npeople take advantage of that opportunity if they so wish.\n  In talking to the leadership on the other side of the aisle, we \nagreed it was important for people to have the opportunity. We have \nbeen very busy over the last several days with the Estrada nomination \nand today the cloture vote. There has been excellent work in terms of \nratification--the vote on the Moscow Treaty. So it has been very busy.\n  We know the Nation is very much concerned with what is going on today \nand over the ensuing days in Iraq, so we did want to make that \nopportunity available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/03/06/senate-section/article/S3339-3", "month": "03", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
