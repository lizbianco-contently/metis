Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2), to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 201 of \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004, \n     having met, have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees \n     on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the Record of May 22, 2003)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there is 1 hour \nof debate.\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only thing I want to say is that there \nis a limited amount of time. If people are not here to use their time, \nthey just don't get that time. The two managers are here. As I \nindicated late last night, the order was entered for a certain amount \nof time for individual Senators. If they are not here, they will not be \nable to use that time later on today.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\n  I would like to refer to the capital gains provisions of the \ncompromise bill. I discussed last night the benefits of seeing capital \ngains reduced to 15 percent, and 5 percent for low-income families and \nindividuals. But I also want to emphasize the simplification that we \nare bringing to the capital gains rates. While we still have the 1-year \ndivision between short-term and long-term capital gains, we have \neliminated the 5-year holding period and the 18-percent rate.\n  It is a small but very important step in actually eliminating lots of \nlines and lots of calculations that taxpayers face in their annual \nreturns. The Joint Tax Committee has stated that there is much need for \nsimplification of capital gains. The Joint Tax Committee notes that \nCongress has received continual testimony that capital gains is a \nsource of enormous complexity. So in this compromise, we make a very \ngood start on an important source of complexity in the Tax Code.\n  Let me make clear for my colleagues that for many middle-and low-\nincome families, we make capital gains as simple as possible. At the \nend of the time period of this bill, middle- and low-income families \nwill pay zero capital gains. Of course, it doesn't get much simpler \nthan that because zero brings it down to nothing.\n  I now would like to deal with the issue of corporate governance that \nwas a significant part of the Senate bill.\n  The Senate bill contained several major provisions that seek to put \nan end to the Enron abuses and corporate shell games that we have all \nlearned so much about recently. These con artists who had keys to the \nexecutive washrooms have devastated the lives of millions of workers \nand shareholders.\n\n  I am proud to have worked closely with my colleague, Senator Baucus, \non so many of these provisions with the goal of addressing and \nreforming corporate governance. While I very much wish we could have \nseen these reforms incorporated in the House-Senate conference \ncommittee, let me be very clear that the snake oil salesmen should not \nbe celebrating. I intend to continue to work very hard to press to have \nthese provisions incorporated into other tax legislation and ultimately \nplaced into the statute books.\n  For example, some of the critical corporate tax shelter provisions \nthat were in the Senate bill are already included in the Charitable \nGiving Act--what we call the CARE Act--because these are used for \n``pay-fors'' in this legislation. The CARE Act will soon go to \nconference with the House.\n  In addition, I expect us to soon revisit provisions regarding \ncorporate inversions where corporations set up overseas offices, \nbasically simply a file drawer. They do this simply to escape taxation.\n  Other legislation that I expect we will have a chance to consider \nagain would include the Baucus-Grassley provisions dealing with fines \nand penalties--ending the loopholes that allow Wall Street firms to \nescape the real costs of their own wrongdoing.\n  I am very proud of the bipartisan efforts of the Senate Finance \nCommittee to shut down corporate tax shelters and promote proper \ncorporate governance.\n  I apologize to my colleagues if it is immodest. But I suggest the \nlegislation contained in the Senate finance bill probably represents \nthe most sweeping tax reforms in a generation to seek to clean up \ncorporations and shut down the pin-striped con artists.\n  I will continue to push for these needed reforms, and I expect that \nwe will have step-by-step success in stopping corporate shelters and \nproviding greater protection to the shareholders and workers.\n  I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Dayton.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nMontana.\n  Mr. President, this tax bill is one of the most dangerous, \ndestructive, and dishonorable acts of Government that I have ever seen. \nIt is a shameful looting of the Federal Treasury by the rich and \npowerful in America--compliments of their friends in Congress. It uses \nevery trick in the budget book to line the pockets of the upper class. \nIt cuts the top tax rates immediately, retroactively, and permanently. \nIt lowers the top rate by almost twice as much as the next three. That \ngives the most rate reduction to people who are making over $370,000 a \nyear, only half of that rate reduction to people making over $150,000 a \nyear, and no rate reduction at all to people in the bottom two \nbrackets--the 10 and 15 percent rates. There is just a tweaking of the \nbottom 10-percent bracket, which provides $100 a year to couples and \n$50 a year to individuals. That is also the only change to a tax \nbracket which is temporary. The top rate cuts are all permanent.\n\n  So let me repeat. An individual with an annual income of less than \n$35,000 gets a tax cut of $50 a year. A married couple, without \ndependents, with an annual income of less than $50,000 gets a tax cut \nof $100. A person with an annual income of over $1 million receives a \ntax cut averaging over $93,000 in the first year alone.\n  Now, one of the very few good provisions in the bill is an increase \nin the child tax credit of $400 per child. That is the one provision of \nany real benefit to middle-income families. But the conference report \ndrops the Senate provision to improve the part of the child tax credit \ngoing to families making $10,000 to $30,000 a year. There evidently was \nnot enough room in this $350 billion tax giveaway to help them. They \nget nothing so the rich get more.\n  The conferees also threw out the Senate's elimination of tax \navoidance loopholes, as the chairman of the Finance Committee just \ndescribed, and he deserves great credit for making the best effort \npossible, along with his Senate conferees, to keep these good Senate \nprovisions in the final report but they did not make it.\n  So Americans working overseas are continued to be allowed to pay no \ntaxes on their first $80,000 of income--$80,000 tax free off the top, \nregardless of expenses or circumstances. They kept the loopholes \nallowing many corporations to move offshore and pay little or no taxes \non their income.\n  You see how perverse this tax bill is. Every part of it is carefully \nconstructed to give as much as possible to the rich and as little as \npossible to everyone else.\n  According to the Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, over half \nof all American households will get a tax cut of $100 or less. The \nhouseholds in the middle-income range will get tax cuts averaging $217, \nand households with incomes above $1 million will get tax cuts \naveraging $93,500 a year.\n  It is like the White House is having a big banquet for the gobbling \nup of America and everybody is invited--except there is one menu for \nthe rich of America and there is another one for the rest of America. \nThe rich start with oysters on the half shells. After they are done, \nthe rest get the shells. Then the rich are served prime rib and filet \nmignon. The rest get Hamburger Helper. The rich wash it down with Dom \nPerignon champagne, and the rest with Boone's Farm. Then the rest are \nasked to leave before dessert because it is too rich for them.\n  Dessert is a dividends and capital gains tax cut. The unearned income \nof the rich and super-rich is to be taxed at only 15 percent rather \nthan between 20 and 35 percent, although, in fact, many of the rich and \nsuper-rich will pay even less than that.\n  Yesterday's Wall Street Journal had a headline: ``Some Investors \nCould Cut Tax to Zero or Close.'' Ronald Pearlman, a tax law professor \nat Georgetown University, is quoted in the Wall Street Journal as \nsaying of the conference report:\n\n       I guarantee it produces very, very low tax rates, possibly \n     even zero.\n\n  So the wealthiest Americans will pay little or no personal income \ntaxes. This tax bill ends this country's progressive Tax Code, and it \nreplaces it with a perverse Tax Code.\n  It was said earlier that lower and lower-middle income taxpayers are \ngoing to get a zero-percent rate on their dividends and capital gains--\nfor all three of them who can use it. While we are at it, why don't we \neliminate their taxes on private jets, ski chalets, and gifts of over \n$500,000?\n  Most lower income or middle-income taxpayers have their dividends in \ntax-free accounts today. There is no additional benefit to them. Very \nfew of\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\nthem have capital gains of any sizable amount to benefit from this \nreduction. These are reductions targeted right toward the rich and the \nsuper-rich, the wealthiest 5 percent, the wealthiest 1 percent of \nAmericans and their unearned income, the income they did not work for \nevery day--get out of bed, go to work, punch a clock, work, come out, \nand go home to their families--they pay at a lower rate on their \nunearned income than working Americans pay on their earned income.\n  There is something wrong here--very wrong here. This conference \nreport is also dishonest. It is intentionally deceptive. It was \nrequired to be limited to a cost of $350 billion. That is what the \nSenate said: $350 billion; that meant of reduced revenues over 10 \nyears. Well, evidently that was not nearly enough for the House \nconferees to feed the greed of everyone lined up at the public trough \nover there. So the conferees and the White House officials decided to \ncheat on the rules, not just a little but a lot.\n  They created these fictions, transparently ridiculous pretenses, that \nthese big tax cuts would take effect there, run for 2 or 3 years, and \nthen stop--end entirely.\n  Well, I guarantee you--because everyone here knows--Congress will act \nnext year to make those new tax cuts permanent, just as this tax bill \nthat we are passing today--I expect we will--contains an additional tax \ncost of $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years. That is the cost during \nthat time of making tax cuts in the 2001 tax bill--the one 2 years go--\npermanent. If and when these new tax cuts that are in this bill today \nare made permanent, then their 10-year cost will be another $1 \ntrillion.\n  Where will that extra $2.3 trillion come from? From raiding the \nsurplus of the Social Security trust fund for the next 10 years and \nthen so-called ``borrowing'' the rest of it. But ``borrowing'' isn't \nreally the right term, because we have no intention of paying it all \nback ourselves. If we did, we would not be behaving this way. No, most \nof our borrowing will be paid by the generation who are children today \nand by generations yet unborn.\n  Borrowing money from future generations without their knowledge or \ntheir consent--reducing their future incomes and standards of living--\nis not borrowing. There are a lot of people now in American prisons who \nare doing serious prison time for that kind of borrowing.\n  This is a tax bill that will cost about $2.3 trillion during the next \n10 years that we do not have, so the rich and the super-rich can have \ntheir taxes reduced or eliminated. No wonder we can't get a copy of it. \nI have not seen a copy. I couldn't get a copy last night of the \nconference report. They don't want anybody to see it. They shouldn't. \nIt shouldn't be passed, either.\n  When I arrived in the Senate almost 2\\1/2\\ years ago, I was so \noptimistic that we would make lives better throughout America by \nsharing our abundance. President Clinton and Congress, at that time, \nwith an expanding economy, produced the first budget surplus in the on-\nbudget account in 40 years, and the surpluses were projected to \ncontinue for each of the next 10 years.\n\n  The other big fund of the Federal Government, the Social Security \nTrust Fund, was also expected to run sizeable surpluses for the next \ndecade. What a great opportunity. There could be prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors, the long-promised Federal share of 40 percent \nfunding for special education, and more important work, and still be \nfiscally responsible. Now it has all been thrown away--or given away--\nto those who do not need it and kept away from those who do.\n  This year's combined Federal budget deficit will be around $400 \nbillion, even though the Social Security Trust Fund will be running a \n$160 billion surplus. That means the non-Social Security account of the \nFederal Government, the so-called on-budget account, which is almost \nall the rest of the Federal Government's operations, will run a deficit \nof about $550 billion--after running a surplus just 3 years ago.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota has used his 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given 1 \nminute more.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In fiscal year 2000, the Federal on-budget revenues, which come \nalmost entirely from personal and corporate income taxes, from estate \ntaxes, capital gains taxes, and excise taxes, totaled 101 percent of \nexpenditures. This year, they will scarcely cover two-thirds of \nexpenditures.\n  The tax base of the Federal Government is being destroyed. Who will \ntell the American people? It is hard for anyone to discern the truth \nfrom all of the conflicting words and numbers; but the American people \nmust learn the truth. They also must act, because the looting of \nAmerica will not stop until Americans stop it.\n  It is not too late. It is almost, but not quite, too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee for a job well done. This has been difficult. When I hear \npeople talking about the tax bill and saying it is really amazing that \nwe sunset some of these taxes and then bring them back--no one wanted \nto do that. The reason we have to sunset some of these taxes is that we \nhad to work within an artificial constraint of $350 billion. That is \nwhy we have sunsets. What we certainly hope to do is not to sunset \nthese tax cuts, the tax relief for hard-working American families, but \ninstead to allow these to go forward. We will have to pass new \nlegislation to do it.\n  Even with these modest tax cuts, we are going to spur the economy. \nPeople seem to forget that the purpose of this bill is to stimulate the \neconomy. Eighty percent of the benefit of lowering the top rate to 35 \npercent goes to small businesses, and small businesses are going to \nreap the benefits. Small business is the job creator of America. It is \nsmall business we want to spur to create jobs. We want to put people \nback to work. The purpose of the legislation is to put people back to \nwork and, in addition, to bring a little equity into the system.\n  Why in the world would we have a penalty on marriage? Why would a \ncouple in Abilene, TX, who make $65,000 a year pay $1,000 more in taxes \njust because they got married? We go a long way toward eliminating the \nmarriage penalty tax with this bill, and we are going to do everything \nwe can to keep that in place from now on. There should not be a penalty \nfor marriage. We should treat everyone equally. The marriage penalty \nbill was mine. It is a part of this legislation. I am going to do \neverything in my power to keep it forever, doubling the standard \ndeduction and doubling the 15 percent bracket when people get married. \nThat is for the lowest income and moderate-income people.\n\n  We are making a giant leap for child tax credits, from $600 to \n$1,000, because it is our families who are suffering so much today. We \nare going to do everything in our power to make the child tax credit \nabsolutely permanent.\n  I want to discuss the State aid package because as we speak this \nmorning, the Texas Legislature is in the last days of its regular \nsession. They meet every other year for 6 months. They are in the last \ndays of that session, and they are grappling with over $500 million. I \nspoke to Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst yesterday. He and the Speaker of the \nHouse, Tom Craddick, are working diligently to cut the budget, to try \nto be fair, try not to cut services too much.\n  Help is on the way. My State of Texas is going to receive more than \n$1.2 billion in aid over the next 2 years. Under this proposal we are \ngoing to pass today, more than $510 million will go for Medicaid help. \nThat is one of the biggest problems my State and many others have. $710 \nmillion will go in block grants for essential government services so \nthey will be able to put this money where it is most needed--$510 \nmillion for Medicaid, $710 million in block grants. And it is going to \nbe this year and next year. I hope this will resolve the problems of my \nState, as it\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\nhas done as much as it can right now. The legislature is grappling with \nit. We are going to help my State and every State in America.\n  We understand the hard times because the Federal Government is \nfeeling it, too. We have increased national defense responsibilities, \nincreased homeland security, and our States have as well. So help is on \nthe way.\n  I am very pleased to have been part of the group who worked on the \nState aid package to try to help. I have been reading the Texas papers. \nI see the problems we face.\n  The committee did an outstanding job. I commend the House. I commend \nthe President of the United States for his leadership. The President \ndidn't just sit on his laurels after doing a great job in Iraq, a \nwonderful job protecting the young men and women of our country; he \nsaid: We are going to put people back to work. The President deserves \ncredit. The Senate and House deserve credit. We will put people back to \nwork in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. President, this bill I call the policy of the three Ds. This is a \npolicy of debt, deficits, and decline.\n  This policy is reckless and irresponsible as fiscal policy. It will \nhurt, not help, economic growth and it is totally unfair. In terms of \nirresponsibility, nothing says it better than this chart.\n  Two years ago, the President told us we would virtually pay off the \ndebt of this country by 2008. Now instead we see, by adopting his \npolicy, we will have a debt of over $5 trillion by 2008. That is just \nthe beginning of the story because that is the publicly held debt. The \ngross debt of the United States is skyrocketing as well, from over $6 \ntrillion at the end of this year to $12 trillion at the end of this \nbudget period, and all of this occurs at the worst possible time. We \nare about to see a demographic time-bomb hit this country called the \nbaby boom generation.\n  This chart shows the Medicare and Social Security trust funds and the \ncost of the tax cuts. What it shows is that when the trust fund goes \ncash negative in the next decade as the baby boomers retire, at that \nvery time the cost of these tax cuts explodes, driving us deep into \ndeficits and debt at levels that are utterly unsustainable.\n  The irony of this package is that it is looting the Social Security \ntrust fund of virtually every dime over the next 10 years to pay for \nthese tax cuts. Of the $2.7 trillion in surpluses in Social Security \nover the next decade, this policy takes $2.698 trillion to pay for tax \ncuts and other expenses--again, at the worst possible time.\n  The news from the Treasury Department is that things are getting much \nworse. Already this year, revenue is running $100 billion below \nforecast. If that continues, we will have the lowest revenue as a \npercentage of gross domestic product since 1959. Two years ago, the \nPresident justified the tax cuts on the basis that revenue was high as \na percentage of GDP. Now it is low, and yet his answer is the same.\n  On this very day when our colleagues on the other side are pushing a \ntax plan that, without gimmicks, would cost $1 trillion, they are also \nadvocating nearly a $1 trillion increase in the national debt--much \nhigher than the last increase in the national debt of $450 billion. \nThis is the biggest increase in the national debt in our history--all \nat the same time they are advocating a tax cut which they say will cost \n$350 billion but which we have already heard from colleagues in the \nChamber is disguised in its true cost. It will cost up to $1 trillion \nif the gimmicks are eliminated.\n  It is ineffective as stimulus because very little of this plan is \neffective this year. Only $55 billion is effective this year. That is \nabout 16 percent of the advertised cost. It is only about 5 percent of \nthe real cost if the gimmicks are eliminated.\n  This plan is grossly unfair. Those who earn over $1 million get a \n$93,000 tax break this year on average. Those in the middle income \nrange get $217. Our colleagues on the other side will say: The rich pay \nmore in taxes, so they should get more of a tax break. They don't pay \nthat much more. This is what the wealthiest among us pay in terms of \nall Federal taxes. They pay 23 percent. But under this plan, they get \n38 percent of the benefit. It is a pretty good investment for \nthem. And, unfortunately, unfair to the vast majority of Americans. Our \ncolleagues say it is a growth plan, a jobs plan. No, it is not. This is \nnot a jobs-and-growth plan. In fact, the people who have been hired by \nthe White House and the CBO to do that kind of analysis tell us this \nplan is worse than doing nothing after 2004. You get a little bit of a \nbump in 2003 and 2004--just a little bit--one-half of 1 percent of GDP, \nwhich is about half as much as you would get with a well-designed \nstimulus package.\n\n  But the outyear effect is negative because it is all borrowed money. \nHere are what the economists are telling us. Ten Nobel laureates:\n\n       The tax cut proposed by President Bush is not the answer to \n     our problems.\n\n  It is not just 10 Nobel laureates. It is the Joint Committee on \nTaxation saying:\n\n       The simulations indicate that eventually the effect of the \n     increasing deficit will outweigh the positive effects of the \n     tax policy. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, this thing is so loaded with gimmicks that it is a \nnow-you-see-it-now-you-don't tax policy.\n  On dividends, it goes from 38.6 percent down to 15 percent. It stays \nthere for 6 years and then jumps up to 35 percent. There is no \nconsistency. The same on small business exemptions. That goes from \n$25,000 to $100,000 in 3 years and then back down to $25,000. It's the \nsame thing on the 10 percent bracket. It wanders around and goes down \nto nothing in 2011, 2012, 2013--all to hide the true cost of this plan. \nHere is the child tax credit. It goes up to $1,000 for 2 years. Then it \ngoes back to $700 for 4 years, then up to $800, then up to $1,000, and \nthen back down to $500 for the last 3 years.\n  Mr. President, this gives credibility a bad name.\n  Marriage penalty. For 2 years, it is at $9,500 to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty, and it drops down to $8,265, giving people a big tax \nincrease in the third year. Then it goes back up to $9,500 in 2009 and \nin 2010, and then it plunges to $7,950.\n  Even a mother could not love this child. This is a bad plan--bad for \nthe economy, bad for the fiscal future of the country. It is going to \nweaken America, not strengthen it.\n  I urge my colleagues to think twice. People are going to be held \naccountable for this vote. This is a scandal in the making. We are \ngoing to read that there are perverse results from this tax policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. I want to respond to the statements just made because it \nbrings up the issue of the Federal debt.\n  We have heard from the other side that we are unconcerned about the \nFederal debt, as if they are concerned about it. I want to remind my \ncolleagues--particularly those on the other side of the aisle--of how \nmany amendments we had during the budget debate and during the omnibus \nappropriations bill debate back in January where there was amendment \nafter amendment after amendment after amendment on the other side of \nthe aisle to spend more money--spend more money.\n  When it came to the budget, there was amendment after amendment after \namendment to take money away from the part of the budget of giving \nauthority for tax relief and reducing that amount of money. Did it go \nagainst the bottom line? No. They took the money they wanted to take \naway from tax relief and spent it someplace else.\n  So don't give me this sort of lesson that they are concerned about \nthe deficit and we are unconcerned about the deficit. If they were \nconcerned about the deficit and they wanted to cut the amount of money \nwe are going to give for tax relief and put it against the bottom line, \nthen I would believe them. But it is just the opposite. When they want \nto spend it someplace else, the bottom line stays the same, the bottom \nline of the budget is not reduced.\n  The problem here is they don't want any tax relief because they want \nto spend it. They think they know better\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\nhow to spend it than the taxpayers. It isn't going to do as much \neconomic good if the 535 members of Congress decide how to spend it. If \nthe people back home spend it, it is going to turn over more times in \nthe economy and create more jobs.\n  They think the American taxpayers are undertaxed and that is why we \nhave a budget deficit. The American people are not undertaxed, and it \nis not undertaxation that is the cause of the deficit. The cause of the \ndeficit is the overspending, and that overspending is best exemplified \nby amendment after amendment. Two times this year we have had those \nvote-aramas, with amendment after amendment to spend more money.\n  This is about giving money back to the American taxpayers. If we are \nworried about the deficit, we will express that worry by spending less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me take on the spending argument \nbecause I have heard it over and over, and it is the biggest canard \noffered on this floor. We have heard before that on our side we offered \n$500 billion of amendments on the supplemental. We did not. They have \ntaken 1-year amendments that were offered singly and accumulated them \nand made them 10-year amendments. We offered $32 billion of amendments \nseparately. They were not offered as a package.\n  Interestingly enough, what our Republican colleagues did is they went \ninto conference committee--which they excluded us from--and they added \n$60 billion in spending. Who are the big spenders? Let's set the record \nstraight. On the budget resolution, we did offer a series of amendments \nto do things such as fund the war, which wasn't in the budget, and to \nfund homeland security, which was inadequately funded in the budget. \nBut we offset every one of those amendments. We paid for them, and the \noverall budget we offered was $1.2 trillion less in debt than the \nPresident's budget plan.\n  Let's talk about who is serious about fiscal responsibility. Who \noffered the serious plans to reduce the growth of deficits and debt? I \nsay to my friends, they told America 2 years ago they had a plan to pay \noff virtually all of the debt by 2008. Do you know what we see now? We \nhave adopted their plan and, instead of paying off the debt, it is \ngoing to be $5.2 trillion of publicly held debt by 2008.\n  The gross debt of the U.S. is going to double during this budget \nperiod--at the worst possible time, right before the baby boomers \nretire. The outcome is as clear as it can be; as clear as it can be. We \nhave record deficits now. The President's budget increases spending by \n$600 billion above the baseline, cuts revenue by $1.6 trillion. There \ncan only be one result: deeper and deeper deficits and debt, and at the \nworst possible time, right before the baby boomers retire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, he just admitted I was right. He said \nevery time they took money away from our tax cut allotment in the \nbudget, they took it to offset spending someplace else. That is exactly \nmy point. They never did take any money away from it to put against the \nbottom line. They took it away because they wanted to spend it \nsomeplace else. They want to continue that money coming into \nWashington. They want more money to spend. I will take them seriously \nwhen they want to reduce the amount of money in the budget for tax cuts \nand put it against the bottom line.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for question? Mr. President, may I \nhave 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 30 seconds more to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, facts are stubborn things, I say to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. The budget we offered on our side \ndid exactly what you were challenging us to do. We had $1.2 trillion \nless in deficits in our plan than the plan offered on your side. You \nsaid you want to cut back on the tax cuts, bring it to the bottom line. \nThat is what we did. As a result, we would have had $1.2 trillion less \nin deficit if our plan had been adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on occasion it sounds as if we are \nredebating the budget. That is not what we are debating. We are \ndebating a growth package. The fact is, last year we did not have a \nbudget. This year we do have a budget. This year we have a tax bill to \nhelp grow the economy.\n  Some of my colleagues on the Democratic side offered a tax bill as \nwell. It was $152 billion. This tax bill is $316 billion. It is not \neven $350 billion. I keep hearing it is $350 billion, but there is \nabout $34 billion in spending. One of the amendments passed with 97 \nvotes. It did not have my vote.\n  My point is, it is a $316 billion tax cut over 10 years. Over those \n10 years, we are going to have revenues of about $25 trillion, $26 \ntrillion. We did load it upfront because we want to have as much \neconomic impact as we possibly can. The economy is very soft, and we \nwanted to grow the economy. We did things to help encourage investments \nand jobs. We were taxing capital investment far too much. We tax \ndividends higher than any country in the world. That is absurd.\n  Basically, we are cutting the dividend tax a little bit more than \nhalf. We did not do as well, in my opinion, as we did in the Senate. \nThat is part of the compromise. We took part of the House provision. We \nare going to tax capital gains at 15 percent and tax dividends at 15 \npercent. I think there is common sense in taxing both at that level.\n  I heard someone say there is nothing in here for low-income people. \nThat is not true. A couple who have two kids get $800 additional in \nchild credit. If they have a combined income of $56,000, they get \nanother $1,200 in marriage penalty relief. That is $2,000. So if \nsomeone says that is nothing, that may mean their tax bracket, one, \ndoes not exceed 15 percent and also, percentagewise, it is probably \nwell over half their tax liability. I just make those points.\n  We also accelerated the rates, as we should. I keep hearing this is a \ntax cut for the wealthy. The maximum tax rate in 1992 was 31 percent. \nWhen we are done with this, the maximum tax rate is going to be 35 \npercent--still significantly higher, still about 13 percent higher than \nit was in 1991. We hear all this demagoguery of class warfare and \npeople trying to play on other people. I disagree.\n  The State aid program is $20 billion. I want to make sure everybody \nunderstands that this is a temporary program--I want that in the Record \nfor--for the States. I have a feeling States may be coming a year from \nnow saying: We need this to be extended, either the FMAP portion or \nassistance going directly to the States.\n  All persons who sponsored this and were critical for getting it in \nthis bill said it is temporary. It is temporary. It shall not be \nextended. Everyone agreed to that--House and Senate. The House did not \nwant it in. Many on this side did not want it in. We agreed to have it \nin have as a temporary program. I wanted to allude to that. Finally, I \ncompliment Senator Grassley for his leadership because, without his \nleadership, we would not have had this bill. We might not have had a \nbudget. Frankly, we have a budget, and we have a bill. Many people are \nthrowing rocks and stones saying this is terrible. We do have a budget, \nand we are trying to do a growth package. We are doing a growth package \njust about double what the Democrats proposed, except the Democrats in \ntheir growth package proposed almost all spending. I think three-\nfourths is spending. This package has real incentives for growth, \ninvestment, and jobs. Let's help the economy. The economy is far too \nsoft. We want to encourage the economy to grow. I think this proposal \nwill do that. Again, I thank my colleague from Iowa for his leadership \nin making that happen. I also thank our leader, Senator Frist. This has \nbeen a challenging process to get both the budget and reconciliation \nthrough. We did the budget on time, almost in record time, and this \nreconciliation bill is the earliest I have seen Congress act. We should \nact because the economy is soft now. It needs assistance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this bill is called the ``Jobs and Growth \nTax Relief Reconciliation Act.'' That name is\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\nwrong. This bill is not about creating jobs and stimulating economic \ngrowth. It is about helping the elite few with large tax cuts, while \nburdening the majority of Americans with a huge debt.\n  Fairness is an American value. And this bill is far from fair.\n  Those making $1 million per year will get a $93,000 tax cut--more \nthan twice the annual income of the typical working family. Meanwhile, \n53 percent of Americans will get less than $100. The average tax cut in \n2003 for those in the middle of the income spectrum will be $217. And \nmarried couples with two children and incomes between $10,000 and \n$21,000 receive no tax cut at all.\n  To make matters worse, the marriage penalty relief that was in this \nbill--something that would have helped most working families--was \nscaled back in order to provide larger tax cuts on dividends and \ncapital gains--something that helps only the elite few. Only about 25 \npercent of Americans receive taxable dividends. And, according to the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, 39 percent of the benefits of \nthat initiative would go to millionaires; another 44 percent would go \nto the top 10 percent of taxpayers; and only 17 percent of the benefit \nwould go to the bottom 89 percent of taxpayers.\n  If most Americans are not getting tax relief in this bill, what are \nmost Americans getting? Debt. This bill is fiscally irresponsible. The \nfederal budget deficit stands at $400 billion--the largest deficit \never. And our national debt is spiraling upward. In fact, later today, \nthe Senate will vote on a bill to increase the debt limit by nearly $1 \ntrillion.\n  These numbers sound abstract. But they have an impact on all \nAmericans. Because of the higher long-term interest rates that will \nresult, economists have estimated that the rising deficits and debts \nwill, by 2012, take $1000 every year out of the pockets of working \nAmericans.\n  And, the Republican leadership has indicated that they intend to come \nback and extend the tax cuts that are sunset in this bill. If those \nprovisions are extended, the cost through 2013 will be between $807 \nbillion and $1.06 trillion--even more deficit and even greater debt.\n  This robs Social Security and Medicare surpluses and borrows from our \nchildren's future. And it denies us the resources we need to defend our \nhomeland from terrorists and educate our children.\n  In these bad economic times--times of high unemployment, slow growth, \nand fragile consumer confidence--our first priority should be to \nstimulate the economy. That is why I believe we need a tax and growth \nbill. The problem is, this bill does not do it.\n  In fact, the one provision in the Senate-passed bill that would have \nprovided a big boost to our economy--the Ensign-Boxer amendment--was \ntaken out of the bill.\n  Our amendment would have lowered the tax rate, for one year only, on \nthe earnings of the foreign subsidiaries of American companies--if \nthose earnings were brought back to the United States and invested in \njobs and the economy. Current official estimates conclude that between \n$140 and $300 billion in domestic foreign subsidiary income would have \nbeen brought back into the American economy during the one-year period. \nThese funds would have helped create American jobs and American \nopportunities with billions of dollars currently left overseas.\n  But that provision, even though it had broad bipartisan support and \npassed the Senate 75-25, was stripped from the bill. The one provision \nthat would have done the most to stimulate the economy was dropped from \nthe bill.\n  I am also disappointed that this bill drops my amendment to require \nthose who fail to pay the child support they owe, to add the amount \nthey owe to their taxable income. It was the morally right thing to do.\n  The conferees also failed to close the business tax loophole for \ngiant Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs). In fact, this bill quadruples that \nloophole. Under this bill, small businesses will be able to deduct up \nto $100,000 of the cost of these huge passenger vehicles in one year at \nleast through 2005. Smaller SUVs and cars are limited to a deduction of \n$7,660 in the first year, and $4,900 in the second year after the \npurchase. This cap is not changed in the bill. But the SUV cap is. As a \nresult, people who do not need a giant SUV for business purposes will \nbuy giant SUVs to take advantage of the much larger tax break.\n  We should scrap this bill and start over. We should pass a bill that \nwould cut taxes for every working American, providing an average \nbenefit of over $1,600 to a family of four making $50,000 a year. We \nshould pass a bill that would provide real assistance to the 8.8 \nmillion Americans who are currently unemployed. We should accelerate \nthe refundability of the child tax credit, accelerate the elimination \nof the marriage penalty, and extend and expand unemployment insurance \nfor those looking for work, including the one million people who have \nalready exhausted their benefits.\n  We should pass a bill that really sparks economic growth. It should \ninclude the Ensign-Boxer Invest in the U.S.A. proposal. It should, as \nthe Democratic plan did, assist small businesses with their health care \nexpenses by providing a 50 percent tax credit in 2003. And very \nimportant for California, it should provide $40 billion in immediate \naid to state and local governments.\n  That would be a good bill to stimulate the economy, provide help to \nthe vast majority of working Americans, and not plunge this nation \ndeeper into debt or plunder the Social Security surpluses. That is a \nbill we should pass.\n  This bill before us should be defeated.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have said from the beginning of this debate that \nmy guiding principle would be the best interests of the people of West \nVirginia. I cannot support the deal that has been reached because it is \nso clearly designed to benefit the elite members of our society at the \nexpense of average taxpayers in West Virginia and across the Nation. \nProposals that could have stimulated the economy and helped working \nfamilies got short-changed to make room for enormous tax cuts for \nwealthy investors. I have little hope that this bill will stimulate \neconomic growth; on the other hand, our national debt will be \nguaranteed to grow if we pass the bill.\n  I would also like to comment briefly on the process that has brought \nus to this point. I am extremely disappointed that this deal was struck \nbehind closed doors in an entirely partisan manner. Since it adds \nhundreds of billions of dollars to our national debt, it affects every \nAmerican now and for the next generation. Whenever we are considering \nsomething of such tremendous importance, the process ought to be \nbipartisan and inclusive. This is not how Americans expect us to \nconduct business.\n  For 2 years, I have fought to ensure adequate fiscal relief to States \nthat are struggling with crippling budget deficits. I am pleased that \nthis bill provides $20 billion in State aid. Our most vulnerable \ncitizens are at risk when States cut Medicaid and other services. And \nany effort that we make to stimulate economic growth would be futile if \nStates are forced to cut spending and increase taxes. Yet this \nlegislation still falls well short of what 80 Senators voted for during \ndebate on the budget resolution earlier this year. I am disappointed \nthat we did not fulfill our commitment to $30 billion in State aid.\n  If we were truly interested in stimulating economic growth and \ncreating jobs we would have not only provided more aid to States, we \nwould have focused tax relief on working families who are the most \nlikely to immediately spend any tax cut. But tax cuts that help working \nfamilies got squeezed to make room for more tax cuts for wealthy \ninvestors. The proponents of this bill may talk a lot about the \nacceleration of the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the \nexpansion of the 10 percent bracket. But all of these provisions are \nset to expire after next year, and they pale in comparison to the new \ntax breaks provided to millionaire stockholders.\n  I fought to expand the child tax credit to serve more families, and \nto provide a greater benefit to those families who currently qualify \nfor only a partial credit. I am disappointed that no such provisions \nare included in this final bill. While I am pleased that the size of \nthe child tax credit increases from $600 to $1,000, albeit for only the \nnext 2 years, I am still worried about the 130,000 children in West \nVirginia who will see no benefit from this increase. We should be doing \nmore to help our neediest families.\n\n[[Page S7077]]\n\n  I am also disappointed that we are spending $35 billion, 10 percent \nof the cost of the bill, to reduce the highest marginal income tax \nrate. Only Americans with more than $312,000 of annual income are \naffected by the highest rate. That is less than 2 percent of our \ntaxpayers nationwide, and in my State of West Virginia it is less than \n1 percent of taxpayers. The income tax cut that had the most potential \nto help hard-working people in my State is the expansion of the 10 \npercent bracket. But this provision, like so many other good ideas, was \nreduced in order to make room for other things. The expansion of the 10 \npercent bracket expires after next year, while the income tax cuts for \nthe wealthiest few stay in place much longer. I cannot condone such \nmisplaced priorities.\n  The most expensive part of this bill is the tax cuts for investors, \nestimated to cost more than $150 billion. These tax cuts are the least \nlikely to help average Americans. While many Americans today are \ninvested in the stock market, they typically hold these assets in \nretirement accounts that already enjoy preferential tax treatment. Only \none-quarter of America's taxpayers will get any benefit from tax \nreductions on dividends or capital gains. And for the vast majority, \nthe benefit will be very small. So why then does it cost so much? \nBecause the wealthy few will receive enormous tax cuts. More than 40 \npercent of all dividend income is claimed by the top 2 percent of \ntaxpayers. Capital gains are even more concentrated among wealthy \nAmericans. I cannot justify huge cuts in dividends and capital gains \ntaxes when the benefits to average Americans are so small.\n  Too many important proposals have been completely left out of this \npackage. Despite the fact that more than 8 million Americans are \ncurrently out of work, many of them for extended periods of time, this \nbill provides no assistance for the unemployed. Incentives for \ninvestment in the construction of new schools or the deployment of \nbroadband services--proposals that could have created new jobs \nimmediately--are completely absent. For a bill euphemistically referred \nto as a ``Jobs and Growth Package'' there is very little here that will \ncreate jobs or growth.\n  Finally, this bill cannot be justified in the contest of our \nGovernment's current fiscal situation. Later today, Congress will be \nasked to increase the debt limit by almost $1 trillion, an \nunprecedented increase. Yet we are about to approve a tax package that \nwill increase the deficit by $350 billion over the next 10 years--more \nwhen interest expenses are included. If this legislation really had the \npotential to help working families and reinvigorate our economy, we \ncould justify increasing deficits. But instead we have short-changed \nthe most important provisions to make room for $150 billion in tax cuts \nto investors. It is unconscionable to ask the next generation of \nAmericans to foot the bill for this legislation. I cannot support it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this conference report reflects the real \npriorities of the Republican Party. It cuts back tax relief for working \nfamilies in order to expand tax breaks for the wealthiest taxpayers. \nThe child credit and marriage penalty relief were both reduced so that \nmore money could be spent on dividend and capital gains tax cuts. As a \nresult of this backroom Republican deal, an average family of four will \nface a tax increase of $850 in 2005, right after the election; while \ntax breaks for the wealthy continue for additional years. The bill \nemploys so many gimmicks to help the rich that even the Wall Street \nJournal called it ``the Great Tax Shelter Act'' of 2003. No wonder this \nlegislation was put together behind closed doors and is being rushed \nthrough Congress with little time for scrutiny. The Republican leaders \nwho authored it know that this bill could not survive in the light of \nday. Clearly, their priorities are not the American people's \npriorities.\n  The Bush administration apparently believes that the biggest problem \nin today's economy is that the rich are not rich enough. Republicans \nthink that if you give tax breaks to the wealthiest taxpayers, they \nwill invest more and the economy will grow. It is called ``trickle-\ndown'' economics. The problem with this theory is that the wealthy may \nnot use the money in ways that create jobs and expand production. If \nthere is no demand because consumers are not buying, companies will not \nproduce more. They will just wait until the economic climate improves.\n  Democrats believe that tax relief and public resources should go to \nAmerica's working families. They are the ones who are struggling most \nin this brutal economy, and they will quickly spend the money. That \nwill create a demand which is needed to get the economy moving again.\n  Two very different approaches to stimulating the economy. Republicans \nkeep making the same mistake. If ``trickle-down'' economics worked, the \neconomy would not be stagnating today. In 2001, at President Bush's \ninsistence, Congress passed one of the largest tax cuts in history, and \nwealthy taxpayers got the lion's share of the tax benefits. America has \nlost more than two and a half million jobs since the first Bush tax cut \npassed. The Republican response is more of the same. This conference \nreport provides more of the same. But the American people want a new \napproach.\n  Over 400 respected economists--including 10 Nobel laureates--say the \nBush plan is the wrong way to go. Unfortunately, the President has \nrepeatedly rejected the pragmatic advice of mainstream economists, and \nopted instead for an ideologically rigid and ineffective strategy.\n  His single-minded commitment to ever larger tax cuts for the wealthy \nas the cure for every economic ailment has made a bad situation worse. \nThe administration has ignored remedies that would provide a \nsignificant stimulus this year, while implementing policies that will \nundermine our future economic strength. As a result, the economy \ncontinues to stagnate, and the number of families facing hardship \ncontinues to grow.\n  Unemployment is still on the rise. It climbed to 6.0 percent in \nApril. There are now 8.8 million men and women unemployed across \nAmerica. The economy has lost more than half a million jobs in just the \npast 3 months, and there is no end in sight. In the absence of an \neffective stimulus from the Federal Government, the economy is not \nlikely to improve quickly.\n  Behind such disturbing statistics are people who need our help. A \nstrong economy allows working men and women to have greater control \nover their lives, and more opportunity to pursue their personal dreams. \nA stagnate economy takes much of that control out of their hands, \nleaving families vulnerable to circumstances they cannot control.\n  Across America, in the last 2 years, workers have lost their job \nsecurity. As layoffs mount, they live in fear of being the next to be \nlet go. There are 2.7 million fewer private sector jobs in America \ntoday than there were in January 2001. Those looking for a job are \nfinding it increasingly difficult to obtain one. The number of long-\nterm unemployed has tripled. The average time it takes an unemployed \nworker to find a new job is the longest it has taken in 19 years. Yet \nthis bill does nothing to directly help these unemployed men and women \nand their families.\n  The pain caused by this destructive wave of economic stagnation is \nnot limited to those who have lost their jobs.\n  Health insurance is becoming less and less affordable for workers and \ntheir families across the country. The Congressional Budget Office now \nestimates that over the course of a year, 60 million Americans go \nwithout health insurance. Nationally, the average cost of health \ninsurance is rising at double digit rates--up by 11 percent in 2001 and \nanother 12.7 percent in 2002--nearly four times the rate of inflation. \nThe health care squeeze on working families is getting tighter and \ntighter.\n  Senior citizens who desperately need prescription drug coverage are \nsuffering, too. The cost of prescription drugs is escalating at double \ndigit rates--increasing an average of 16 percent each year.\n  Children who are being asked to do more in school are receiving less \nsupport. School districts, faced with declining local tax receipts and \nthe failure of the Federal Government to provide promised resources, \nhave been forced to increase class sizes, cut weeks from school \ncalendars, and lay off teachers.\n  The cost of higher education is rising beyond the reach of more \nfamilies. The\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\ngap between the cost of college tuition and the tuition assistance \nprovided by the Federal Government has grown by $1,900 in the last 2 \nyears.\n  Millions of families have seen their retirement savings seriously \neroded. The value of savings in 401(k) plans and other defined \ncontribution plans has declined by $473 billion in the last 2 years.\n  These are the realities American families face today.\n  It is imperative that the National Government respond to the growing \neconomic crisis. There is much that Government can do to stimulate \neconomic growth in the near-term without generating huge deficits that \nwill undermine prosperity in the long term. Unfortunately, the Bush \nadministration has consistently refused to follow such a course of \naction.\n  The Republican plan does not maximize the economic impact in 2003. \nOnly 17 percent of the $350 billion cost of their legislation would \nreach the economy this year, when it is needed to jumpstart a sluggish \neconomy. We could create many more jobs sooner by better targeting the \nresources provided in the legislation.\n  The conference report spends $150 billion reducing dividend and \ncapital gains taxes and $35 billion lowering the tax rate on the \nhighest incomes. These cuts, which constitute more than half of the \nentire cost of the bill, do not provide effective stimulus and they \ntake resources away from proposals that would. It is incredible that \nRepublicans could not find the dollars to extend unemployment benefits \nand to provide tax relief for low-income workers, but they could find \nthe money to pay for these tax breaks benefitting the wealthiest \ntaxpayers.\n  According to an analysis by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, \nthe provisions in the conference report would provide an average tax \ncut of $93,500 to taxpayers with an annual income over $1 million. In \nstark contrast, 53 percent of American households would receive a tax \ncut of $100 or less. The Republican conferees plan is even more tilted \nto the wealthiest taxpayers than the original Bush plan.\n  The few provisions that benefit middle-class families have been \nlimited to just 2 years, while the dividend and capital gains tax cuts \nextend much longer. The conferees also eliminated a Senate provision \nthat would have benefitted 11.9 million low-income children and their \nfamilies, one of every six children in the Nation.\n  The richest 5 percent of taxpayers would receive 75 percent of the \ntax benefits from the dividend and capital gains tax cuts. All of the \ntax benefits from reducing the tax rate on the top income bracket will \ngo to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. They are certainly not the \nones who are struggling to make ends meet in the faltering economy. \nThey are not the ones who need our help. Nor are they the ones who will \nquickly spend the money they receive, creating an immediate economic \nstimulus.\n  The Republican plan is simply not an effective stimulus. The \nreduction of the income tax on corporate dividends, the centerpiece of \ntheir plan, is one of the least effective forms of stimulus, generating \nless than a dime of stimulus for every dollar of Federal revenue lost.\n  A well-designed stimulus plan could generate far more economic \nactivity at a small fraction of the cost of the Republican conference \nreport. The Senate Democratic plan would inject $125 billion into the \neconomy this year, and is designed to maximize the stimulus effect of \neach dollar. That is more than twice as much in 2003 as the conference \nreport, and three times as much as the Bush administration's plan.\n  Three widely respected economic models all show that the Democratic \nplan would generate substantially more growth in 2003 and create a half \nmillion more jobs this year than the President's plan.\n  One of the few positive provisions in the conference report is the \n$20 billion in assistance to States, $10 billion through the Medicaid \nProgram, and $10 billion in general financial aid. The current fiscal \ncrisis in the States is the most severe in decades.\n  It is important to remember that more people need to rely on State \nand local programs in an economic downturn. The number of people \neligible for Medicaid grows substantially in times of recession, and \nmany other costs rise as well. Without jobs and without health care, \nfamilies have nowhere else to turn. We have an obligation to make \ncertain that the needed resources are available to them. While the $20 \nbillion of financial assistance to the States is a step in the right \ndirection, the level of aid is clearly inadequate. Congress should be \nproviding at least double this amount. A number of States will also \nlose significant State tax revenue due to the impact of tax cuts \ncontained in the conference report. Thus, the net amount States will \nreceive will be below even the $20 billion.\n  The Republican authors of the dividend and capital gain tax cuts in \nthe conference report intend those tax breaks to be permanent. They \nhave repeatedly said so. If not arbitrarily sunsetted after 2008, the \ndividend and capital gains provisions alone would exceed the $350 \nbillion which is supposed to be the total cost of the entire bill over \nthe next 10 years. The real cost of the bill before us is far in excess \nof $350 billion. If all its provisions were extended for the full \ndecade, as our Republican colleagues intend, the real cost would be \ncloser to $1 trillion.\n  The conferees have resorted to this ``sunsetting'' subterfuge in \norder to evade the requirements of the Budget Act. But, what they \ncannot evade is the adverse economic impact their one-trillion-dollar \nraid on the public Treasury would have. It will not stimulate the \neconomy. In fact, it could well prolong the recession by leading to an \nincrease in long-term interest rates, harming the ability of businesses \nto create new jobs. It will add enormously to the deficit, making it \nmuch more difficult for us to effectively address the Nation's urgent \nneeds in job creation, in education, in health care, and in homeland \nsecurity. Those are the real priorities of the American people. \nUnfortunately, they are obviously not the priorities of the Bush \nadministration and the Republican majority.\n  An NBC News/Wall Street Journal public opinion survey conducted over \nthe past week shows that a substantial majority of the American people \ndo not believe these tax cuts are the way to create jobs. By a margin \nof 64 percent to 29 percent, they think there are better ways to \nimprove the economy than to cut taxes. Sixty-eight percent believe the \nPresident's economic policy ``relies too heavily on tax cuts and not \nenough on direct job creation''; and 66 percent believe his plan \n``benefits the wealthy more than average people.'' The American people \nare not being fooled by this bill. They know precisely what it will \ndo--benefit the wealthy; and what it will not do--stimulate the \neconomy. They also understand that extravagant tax breaks for the rich \nmean that the resources will not be available to address America's real \nneeds. By a margin of 55 percent to 36 percent, they would prefer to \nuse limited public dollars to help pay for health care than to finance \na tax cut.\n  The conference report which the Senate is about to pass by the \nnarrowest of margins does not reflect the priorities of the American \npeople. Unfortunately, their voices were unable to penetrate the closed \nroom where the Republican leadership wrote this irresponsible bill. If \na majority of Senators would have the courage to vote no, we could \ndefeat it and begin work on a genuine stimulus bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the tax \nreconciliation bill conference report that is being considered by the \nSenate today because this tax cut bill is not fiscally responsible. \nWhen President Bush entered the White House, our country enjoyed a \nrecord budget surplus, but the fiscal irresponsibility of this \nadministration has quickly turned that surplus into record deficits. \nAnd now this bill that was cooked up in secret between the White House \nand Congressional Republicans without any input from Congressional \nDemocrats will bring our country further into debt, lead to more hard-\nworking Americans losing their jobs, and put a greater share of the tax \nreceipts in the pockets of the Nation's most privileged.\n  I voiced several concerns about this tax bill when the Senate voted \non it last week. Now that the conference report is finished, I have \neven more. First, while I am pleased to see that this bill does contain \n$20 billion in financial assistance to ailing State and local \ngovernments, I am very concerned that the tax cuts in this bill\n\n[[Page S7079]]\n\nwill once again wreak havoc on our already disastrous State budgets \naround the country. In my home State of Vermont, the State legislature \nstopped basing its State income tax on the Federal rates because of the \ncostly cuts called for in the 2001 tax bill. Now, Vermont is going to \nbe faced with somehow making up an additional $35 million in revenue \nbecause of the dividends and capital gains rate reductions in this \nbill. This is a very large amount of money for a State whose population \nis only 609,000. How will Vermont and the other States possibly make up \nthese lost revenues without massive cuts to essential health, \neducation, and homeland security services?\n  Second, these tax cuts are tilted even more heavily to the very \nwealthy than the tax cuts the President championed in 2001. Just look \nat the rate reductions. For the middle three income brackets in this \ncountry, rates would drop by 2 percentage points, but the top rate will \nfall by 3.6 percentage points. And according to the Center on Budget \nand Policy Priorities, 80 percent of dividend income goes to households \nwith incomes over $100,000. Sadly, this administration has chosen to \nsupport tax policies where affluent people will reap enormous benefits, \nwhile working families will receive very little tax relief.\n  Third, this plan is riddled with Enron-like tax gimmickry by \npretending that most of the provisions will sunset or expire at some \narbitrary date in the future--dates chosen not to make good tax policy, \nbut rather to make all the revenue losses fit into the $350 billion \npot. The income tax rates and business expensing provisions will expire \nin 2006, and the dividends and capital gains rates will expire in 2009. \nBy doing so, this bill attempts to jam in as much of the President's \nmisguided dividend tax proposal as possible into the Senate's $350 \nbillion limit at the expense of more reasonable tax reform provisions \naimed at low- and middle-income working families. It is obvious that \nproponents of these tax cuts have no intention of allowing any of these \nprovisions to expire and, in fact, will come back to the floors of the \nHouse and Senate again and again asking for them to be made permanent. \nInstead of acting in a fiscally responsible manner, they are masking \nfrom the American people the true, astronomical costs of this bill.\n  And fourth, these cuts will push our country deeper in debt. Earlier \nthis month, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office increased its \nFederal budget deficit projections for fiscal year 2003 from $246 \nbillion to a record $304 billion. When the Bush administration came \ninto office, there was a projected $5.6 trillion 10-year surplus. \nBefore this latest irresponsible tax bill, the $5.6 trillion surplus \nhad shrunk to $20 billion. If this bill is enacted, that $20 billion \nwill become a $1.8 trillion deficit--a fiscal swing in the wrong \ndirection of $7.3 trillion in just 2 years.\n  Passing another enormous tax cut this year will only amplify this \ntrend of growing deficits and add to the economic burdens our children \nand grandchildren will inherit. Increasing deficits will decrease \nnational savings and increase long-term interest rates--effectively \nlowering the incomes of working Americans. At the same time the Bush \nadministration is pushing for Congress to pass a $1 trillion increase \nin the Federal debt limit--the largest single jump ever--that does not \naccount for the $350 billion in additional tax cuts that are part of \nthis tax bill. I just do not think we can afford another large tax cut \nat this time until we get our own fiscal house in order.\n  Clearly, this tax cut plan is not about growing the economy or \ncreating jobs. It is about starving the Government and wooing some \nvoters. In fact, leading economists have stated repeatedly that the \nelimination of taxes on dividends paid to investors--the centerpiece of \nthe President's tax cut proposal--would do very little to spur economic \ngrowth or reduce the Nation's jobless rate. Even Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan has questioned the long-term implications of \nthe President's proposal by stating in testimony before the Senate \nBanking Committee in February: ``I am one of the few people who still \nare not as yet convinced that stimulus is a desirable policy at this \nparticular point.''\n  In 2001, I voted against the Bush tax cut bill because it was too \nskewed toward the wealthiest Americans and too fiscally irresponsible. \nSince then, we have gone from record surpluses to record deficits, and \nthe economy is still floundering. In fact, over 2,200 jobs have been \nlost in Vermont since the beginning of the Bush administration. Passing \nanother enormous tax cut this year will only continue this trend and \nincrease the economic problems that our children and grandchildren will \ninherit.\n  Earlier this year, the President said we should not pass our fiscal \nproblems on to future Presidents, Congresses, and generations. I agree \nwith him. Unfortunately, this tax cut bill will drive us deeper into \ndebt and will do exactly what the President says we should avoid, \nburden our children.\n  As I said when this bill passed the Senate, I have two of the world's \nmost perfect grandchildren. And while the promise of another tax cut \nsounds great, I am not going to ask my grandchildren and everyone \nelse's grandchildren to pay for it. It is not right. It is not fair. \nAnd it is not the American way.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the growth \nand jobs tax bill conference report before the Senate today. I first \nwish to congratulate and thank the chairman of the Finance Committee \nand the majority leader for their tireless efforts in working out a \nvery difficult compromise. Their hard work made it possible for us to \nvote on this major tax cut legislation today--legislation that will \nmake a big difference in the lives of Utahans and Americans across the \nNation.\n  The conference report before us is a major accomplishment, for the \nU.S. economy, for the American people, and for President Bush and Vice \nPresident Cheney. It is the culmination of months of very hard work \nthat began with the President's release of his jobs and growth plan \nlate last year. This was a bold and brilliant plan designed to help our \neconomy over the next year while also removing long-standing barriers \nto long-term growth.\n  At the heart of the plan was one overriding objective--to kick our \nsputtering economic engine into high gear so we could finally shake off \nthe listlessness that has lingered since the double whammy when \nrecession hit in 2000 and terrorists struck our homeland in September \n2001. Although we have emerged from recession, the recovery has been \nvery slow and new job creation has not kept up pace with jobs that have \nbeen lost.\n  I am seeing this in Utah, where our State's economy has been hit \nharder than many by the downturn. My State has a highly educated \nworkforce, and we have more high-tech jobs, more commercial \nconstruction jobs, and more tourism jobs than many other States. Those \nsectors have suffered. Utah's unemployment rate was 5.3 percent last \nmonth. Compared to the 3 percent unemployment rate we had just a couple \nof years ago, this is unacceptable. Along with the President and many \nof our colleagues, I have been calling for a strong prescription to \nhelp get our economy, in Utah and across the country, back to its full \npotential.\n  To accomplish this, the Bush plan focused on three actions--\naccelerating the already enacted but yet to be phased in tax cuts from \n2001, increasing incentives for businesses to invest in productive \nequipment and grow, and addressing the debilitating and unfair effects \nof taxing the profits of corporations twice. I am happy to report that \nall three of these elements are present in the conference report.\n  The conference report speeds up the tax rate cuts that Congress, on a \nbipartisan basis, passed just 2 years ago. The small amount of rate \nreduction from the 2001 Tax Act that has already taken effect has \nserved to lessen the blow of the recession. These across-the-board rate \nreductions were the right remedy, but their phase-in has been too slow. \nBy accelerating the remainder of these cuts, effective this year, we \ncan put the full dosage of medicine to work on what remains a sick \neconomy.\n  This tax bill will cut taxes for practically every American who pays \nincome tax. This will provide great assistance to our economy in two \nways. First, it will put cash into the pockets of American workers \nimmediately. Almost as soon as this bill is signed into law by the \nPresident, the Internal Revenue Service will release new tax \nwithholding tables that will reflect the\n\n[[Page S7080]]\n\nlower tax rates. This means an immediate raise in pay for almost every \nU.S. worker.\n  Second, lower tax rates will encourage Americans to work harder, to \nsave more, and invest a higher amount of their income. This serves us \nwill both in the short run and over the longer term.\n  We cannot forget the huge effect these tax rate reductions will have \non the small businesses of America. It seems that many of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle refuse to recognize the fact \nthat about 80 percent of small businesses pay taxes at the individual \ntax rates. Rather than being the giveaway to the so-called ``wealthy'' \nthat opponents of this tax cut accuse it of being, this is a first-\nclass jobs creation bill.\n  Moreover, the bill before us includes significant tax relief for \nmarried couples suffering from chronic marriage tax penalties. While we \nstill cannot say these unconscionable tax effects are totally \neliminated from the Internal Revenue Code after the effective date of \nthis measure, we are making major strides in this endeavor.\n  The acceleration of the child tax credit included in the conference \nreport will make a big difference to families in Utah and all across \nAmerica. To families struggling to raise their children, this bill \nspells relief, both immediately and also for 2004.\n  The second objective accomplished in the Jobs and Growth Tax Act is \nto spur investment by business entities. Our recent recession was not \none born of the lack of consumer spending, but of the dearth of \nbusiness investment.\n  Last year's economic stimulus bill included a provision that has \nproven effective in increasing business investment--a 30-percent bonus \ndepreciation deduction for the first year. The bill before us includes \na feature that builds on this provision, and increases the incentive to \n50 percent. I have been a strong proponent of bonus depreciation, and \ndespite this not being in the Senate version of the bill, I am pleased \nthat this provision survived in the conference report.\n  And this is not all. One of the most important elements of the \nbill before us is the increase in the amount of new equipment purchased \nthat smaller businesses can write off immediately. Not only is the \namount of investment allowed to be expensed quadrupled under the bill, \nbut larger businesses can now take advantage of the incentive. This \nbipartisan and bicamerally supported feature should result in some \nquick job creation.\n\n  The third objective of President Bush's tax plan was to address the \nonerous and unfair double taxation of corporate dividends. Although the \ndividend provision in the conference report is not the same as that \nenvisioned by the President, it is a very significant tax cut that will \nhave positive ramifications for the economy and for corporations and \ntheir shareholders, for years to come.\n  The President's original plan called for the elimination of the \ndouble taxation of corporate dividends by providing an exclusion for \ncorporate earnings passed through to shareholders to the extent that \nthe corporation paid tax on those earnings. This was a bold and \nlaudable goal that would have far-reaching effects on the very nature \nof how corporations are established, operated, and governed in this \nNation. This was tax reform in the truest sense. And like all real \nreform, it was met with jeers, criticism, and legitimate concerns.\n  I want to congratulate many of my Senate colleagues for achieving the \ndifficult task of passing the Senate version of the bill, which \nincluded the full exclusion of corporate dividends at the individual \nlevel, albeit for a relatively short time. This was a major legislative \naccomplishment, and Senators Nickles, Kyl, Lott, and many others \ndeserve our gratitude, along with Chairman Grassley and the leadership, \nfor its attainment.\n  The complete elimination of the double tax on dividends should remain \nour long-term goal. It was not achieved in this conference report. The \npolitical and time constraints placed on the Senate made this \nimpossible. However, I want to emphasize that our inability to achieve \nthis lofty goal, which has been the objective of policymakers for \ndecades, should not overshadow the huge triumph we have achieved in the \nconference report--the very substantial reduction of tax on both \ndividends and capital gains for all taxpayers.\n  Investors in this country--and this now includes over half of all \nAmericans--will wake up tomorrow to find a far greater reward for their \ninvestments, whether it be in stocks, bonds, real estate, or other \nproductive assets. A basic economic axiom is that if we want more of \nsomething, we should tax it less. By lowering the tax on the fruits of \ninvestment, both in the form of capital gains and of dividends, we will \nget more investment. This tax cut on investments will bode well for our \neconomy both in the next few months and years, and for decades to come.\n  The conference report before us cuts the tax on dividends by more \nthan half for taxpayers in the higher tax brackets, and it eventually \neliminates the tax altogether for those in the lower two brackets. For \ntaxes on capital gains, it cuts the top rate by 25 percent for most \ninvestors, and again, eventually eliminates them for millions of \ntaxpayers in the lower tax brackets, who might be just starting out \nwith their first investments. This is a huge change, and it will have a \nhuge impact on investment in America by lowering the cost of capital \nand giving a huge boost to the stock market.\n  We should not underestimate the positive effects these changes will \nhave on our economy. When we lowered the maximum capital gains tax rate \nfrom 28 percent to 20 percent in the 1997 tax act, the effect on the \nstock market, and on receipts to the Treasury, was very significant. In \nfact, a Standard and Poor's DRI study on the effects of the 1997 \ncapital gains tax cut indicated that 25 percent of the increase in \nstock prices that was enjoyed after 1997 was due to the cut in the \ncapital gains tax. Treasury receipts soared from capital gains \nrealizations and we were able to balance the Federal budget.\n  Moreover, the study showed that the 1997 capital gains tax cut also \nhad a significant impact on the lives of average Americans by \nincreasing productivity growth, which caused the standard of living to \nrise. There is no reason to think that the reductions on taxes on \ncapital gains and dividends included in this bill will not have similar \neffects in 2003 and beyond.\n  All in all, we should be very pleased with this bill's dividends and \ncapital gains provisions. They will have a very positive effect on \neconomic growth and serve as a substantial platform from which to seek \nfurther progress in the future, even that of the total elimination of \nthe double tax on dividends.\n  The happiness with which I greet this conference report is not \ncomplete. It is not perfect, by any means. Like all of my colleagues, I \nsuppose, I would have written a different bill.\n  For example, I am disappointed that the conference report does not \ninclude the Medicare geographic equity provisions approved by the \nSenate. These provisions, which I strongly support, would have provided \nmore equitable reimbursement rates to Medicare providers in rural \nStates.\n  However, I am encouraged that the President has signaled his support \nfor addressing this matter through the Medicare legislation that the \nSenate will be considering in the next month. To me, it is absolutely \ncritical that Medicare beneficiaries in rural States like Utah have \naccess to quality health care. In my opinion, the best way to \naccomplish this goal is by passing legislation which ensures that \nMedicare providers in rural areas are fairly compensated. I will \ncontinue to work with my Senate colleagues on this crucial issue until \nthis legislation is signed into law by the President.\n  Moreover, there are many other tax provisions that were included in \nthe Senate version of the bill that would have made excellent additions \nto this conference report. Among these are provisions supported in an \namendment on which I was joined by a bipartisan group of our colleagues \nthat would have provided significant benefits to small businesses \noperating under subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. I hope we \ncan find a way to address these important issues in another bill later \nthis year.\n  In conclusion, the recession that began in 2000 was real, and our \nslow recovery is leaving behind pockets of real suffering, both in Utah \nand across our Nation. But thanks to our President's policies, the \nFederal Reserve's aggressive, preemptive, rate-cutting, and the\n\n[[Page S7081]]\n\nflexibility of our free-market system, our Nation has had unemployment \nrates much lower than in past recessions. But Congress needs to do \nmore, and to act now, and this conference report is a vital part of the \nsolution.\n  If we combine this growth and jobs package with some modest restraint \non the spending side and some commonsense legal liability reforms, we \ncan grow the economy faster over the next year, and we can set the \nstage for another decade of record job growth.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Grassley and the Senate leadership for their \nhard work, and I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the fiscally irresponsible \nand unfair tax cut which is before the Senate because it is not what \nour country needs. It is ironic that on the same day that a final vote \nis being taken on this huge tax cut package, the Republican majority \nalso is bringing to the floor legislation that would raise the limit on \nthe national debt by $984 billion, the largest in our Nation's history.\n  This tax cut bill has more deceptions in it than an Enron financial \nstatement. It purports to cost only $350 billion over the next 10 \nyears, but its true costs are masked by multiple ``now you see them, \nnow you don't'' gimmicks that will in reality cost up to a trillion \ndollars over the next 10 years. With deficits of over $300 billion \nprojected for this year and the next, the last thing we need are huge \ntax cuts that will serve to dig us that much further into the deficit \nditch. Future generations deserve better.\n  Furthermore, this approach will be largely ineffective in providing \nour economy the immediate jumpstart it needs. By giving too much to \nthose who need it the least--the average 2003 tax cut for a millionaire \nwill be about $93,500; the average 2003 tax cut for someone in the \nmiddle of the income spectrum will be $217--the bill will be far less \neffective in stimulating the economy than it would be if the tax cuts \nwere directed to taxpayers of more modest means who would spend the tax \ncut now. In addition, only 17 percent of this package goes into effect \nin 2003, when we need it, but instead will take place years down the \nroad. Our economy is struggling right now. Eight-and-a-half million \nAmericans are out of work; 2.7 million private sector jobs have been \nlost since the beginning of this administration. Michigan lost 17,000 \njobs just last month, the most of any State in the country. What we \nneed are immediate jobs and relief, not more of the same ``trickle-\ndown'' policies that have been tried and that failed in the past.\n  Expert commentators have pointed out that this bill will make it \neasier for corporate and upper income taxpayers to use tax shelters to \neven further reduce their tax bills. Instead of ending the so-called \ndouble taxation of dividends, this bill provides those with the means \nto accomplish it a roadmap to no taxation. That's just plain wrong. \nProviding large tax cuts to the wealthy in the hopes that the benefits \nwith trickle down to everybody else hasn't worked before, and there's \nlittle reason to think that it will work now. Following the same \napproach that failed time and again just doesn't make sense. Just 2 \nyears ago, President Bush was promising that his first massive tax cut \nof $1.4 trillion would jumpstart the economy and create jobs. It \ndidn't.\n  Moreover, I am disappointed that the conference report stripped out \nprovisions that were included in the Senate-passed bill that would have \ncracked down on corporations who engage in sham transactions involving \noffshore tax havens. Loopholes like these encourage investment \noverseas, not here in America. We should be closing down corporate \nloopholes, not preserving them.\n  While I am pleased that this bill contains some funds to assist our \nstruggling State and local governments, it does not do nearly enough. \nOur States currently are facing their worst fiscal crisis in over 50 \nyears, with many being forced to raise taxes or cut vital services like \nMedicaid in order to balance their budgets. Instead of doing all that \nwe should to assist them, this bill includes a dividends reduction \nprovision that will actually strip States of revenues, something which \nwill stimulate neither jobs nor growth.\n  I supported and voted for an alternative tax package that was about \ncreating jobs now, when we need it, in a way that did not mortgage our \nfuture.\n  The plan I supported was estimated to put more than 1 million people \nback to work by the end of 2004 at a fraction of this bill's costs. It \nwould have cut taxes for every taxpaying American, providing a tax cut \nof $1,630 to a family of four through a wage credit, an acceleration of \nthe child tax credit, and an elimination of the marriage penalty. I \nwould have helped small businesses by providing them with a 50 percent \ntax credit to help employers maintain health coverage for their \nworkers, and would have provided large and small companies with \nincentives to invest and create jobs by allowing small businesses to \nimmediately write-off more investments and providing bonus depreciation \nto all companies. It also would have provided unemployment benefits for \nnearly 4 million laid-off workers, including those who have already \nexhausted their benefits. What our sagging economy needs right now is \nimmediate jobs, growth, and stimulus, and that's what the plan I \nsupported offered.\n  Insted, what will pass today is a package that is the wrong medicine \nfor our ailing economy. It will create fewer jobs than what is needed. \nIt will slight middle-class families in favor of the wealthy. And it \nwill dramatically increase the deficit and national debt and drive up \ninterest rates which will make it more expensive in the future to buy a \nhouse, pay for college, or pay off credit card debt. This is not what \nAmericans need. I cannot support this legislation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today regarding the conference \nagreement on the jobs and growth tax package that is before the Senate.\n  I very much regret I am unable to support this final conference \nreport, specifically as it relies on artifical ``sunsets'' to mask the \ntrue size of the tax cuts. Regrettably, it represents neither sound \nfiscal nor economic policies and could balloon Federal budget deficits \neven further. Indeed, at its heart, this is a trillion-dollar tax cut \nmasquerading as a $350 billion tax cut, and in keeping with the \nprinciples I have outlined from the outset of this debate, I cannot \nsupport it.\n  From the beginning, I have stated my concern not only about the size \nbut also the content of any tax cut package. Because we need a strong \nstimulus to create jobs and grow the economy--while accomplishing this \nwith sound policy and without creating deficits in perpetuity. While I \nam pleased this bill technically adheres to the agreement I reached to \nlimit the overall size of the growth package of $350 billion over 10 \nyears, it shortchanges some of the most stimulative aspects with \nsunsets that could lead to larger Federal deficits.\n  Even proponents of the package acknowledge that they do not expect \nthe tax cuts to expire or sunset as anticipated, so this package will \nlikely grow to a true 10-year cost of at least $650 billion or even $1 \ntrillion. In other words, with the sunsets, it can be said this is more \nlike $350 billion over 2 years. And indeed, nonpartisan public policy \norganizations like the Tax Policy Center at the Brookings Institution, \nand the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, have estimated the \noverall 10-year cost of the tax cut legislation ranging from $659 \nbillion to more than $1 trillion.\n\n  At a time when we are facing historically high budget deficits \nexpected to exceed $400 billion this year alone--the largest in \nhistory--this tax cut may grow deficits to levels economists fear will \nbe unsustainable. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said again \njust this week, ``deficits do matter'', and could reduce future \neconomic growth.\n  Furthermore, I have made a priority of providing the type of short-\nterm economic boost needed to encourage job creation and spur growth in \nthe economy. I have based my approach to this package on the \nstimulative portions of the President's jobs and growth package, which \ntotaled $329 billion, and fiscal relief for States and local \ncommunities, which totaled $20 billion.\n  Moreover, the conference package reduces the size and impact of \nproposals such as acceleration of the child tax credit, marriage \npenalty relief, and the duration of proposals to spur investment by \nsmall business, with hidden costs of between $319 billion and $709\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\nbillion if the tax cuts were extended for the life of the bill.\n  I would also note for the record that the conference agreement \neliminates the refundable portion of the child tax credit that I \nsponsored along with Senator Lincoln that extends the reach of the tax \npackage to all full-time working families. The elimination of this \nprovision, estimated to cost about $4 billion over the life of the \nbill, will exclude about 12 million children nationwide, and 40,000 \nchildren in Maine, who would otherwise benefit from the legislation.\n\n  I have made clear from the start that I agree with President Bush's \ngoal of passing a stimulus plan to encourage growth in the economy and \ncreate jobs. I have also discussed my concern that creating \nunsustainable, long-term deficits would seriously inhibit our ability \nto address pressing domestic challenges--such as strengthening Social \nSecurity and Medicare--as well as subject future generations to the \ncorrosive effects of the higher interests rates that result from \ndeficits.\n  As a result, I joined with Senators Voinovich, Baucus, and Breaux in \nsigning a letter before consideration of the budget resolution to limit \nthe size of the tax package. In that letter, we stated our belief that \n``our nation would benefit from an economic growth package that would \neffectively and immediately create jobs and encourage investment.'' But \nwe also expressed our belief that ``any growth package that is enacted \nthrough reconciliation this year must be limited to $350 billion in \ndeficit financing over 10 years and any tax cuts beyond this level must \nbe offset.'' This has been a critical guiding principle for me during \nthis process.\n  That is why I supported the strong stimulus plan I helped craft in \nthe Senate Finance Committee, which incorporated--within the $350 \nbillion 10-year framework--all of the stimulative aspects of the \nPresident's growth package in their entirety, provided significant \ndividend tax relief that would have reached all investors, and \neliminated the double tax on dividends for 84.7 percent of all \ntaxpayers.\n\n  Senator Gordon Smith and I were also able to secure within that \nFinance Committee package a measure that conveyed $20 billion in fiscal \nrelief to States and local communities--and I am disappointed that this \nconference report limits this relief to States only, ignoring the needs \nof our municipalities. Under the conference report, the $20 billion is \ndivided equally between the Federal Medicaid Assistance Percentage, or \n``FMAP'', and $10 billion in flexible grants to State governments.\n  As I have stated in the past, State fiscal relief is crucial to \nstimulating the economy--as 46 of the 50 States, including Maine, are \nfacing budget shortfalls due to lower than predicted revenues because \nof the depressed economy and September 11; increased costs associated \nwith Federal mandates; and, increasing health care costs. There is no \nquestion the Federal Government must provide fiscal relief--and this \nwill go a long way toward stimulating growth in the economy. Yet I \nremain distressed that conferees chose to omit aid for local \ngovernments.\n  Finally, this legislation will quadruple the amount a small business \ncan expense, from $25,00 to $100,000. As Chair of the Senate Committee \non Small Business, I certainly support this. However, regrettably, this \nlegislation before us will also sunset this provision after just 3 \nyears. I am disappointed there are those who chose to tap this \nstimulative measure to finance long-term changes to law.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I would like to be able to say I \nsupport this package--I would like to vote for it, but I am unable, as \nit runs counter to the principles I have laid out during this entire \nprocess in terms of the size of the cuts and the content of the \npackage. Therefore, I will not be supporting this conference report.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed for our brave \nmilitary men and women that the conferees for the Jobs and Growth Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2003 decided to omit the Senate-passed \nArmed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 from the conference report.\n  I offered an amendment to the tax bill that would add the Armed \nForces Tax Fairness Act of 2003, which has been previously passed by \nthe Senate. The amendment was accepted by unanimous consent. Since this \nlegislation has already passed numerous times in the Senate, I believed \nthat the conferees would include this important legislation for our \nmilitary in the conference report without hesitation. But again, \npolitics ruled the day.\n  Despite the recent successful war in Iraq, which highlighted the \nbravery and sacrifice of our military, the conferees provided nothing \nfor them in this so-called growth bill. The only thing growing will be \nthe tax breaks for the wealthiest citizens of this country. And in a \ntime where we are also facing growing deficits and must also pay for \nthe cost of the war, what the conferees did in the interest of \n``getting a deal'' was the height of irresponsibility.\n  What the conferees denied was much-needed tax relief for our men and \nwomen in uniform whose sacrifice and commitment are the foundation upon \nwhich the freedom we all enjoy has been built. How they can deny these \ncommitted men and women who defend our country simple fairness is \nbeyond understanding.\n  One of the provisions in the legislation that the conferees dismissed \nfrom inclusion in the conference report is what is popularly known as \nthe Military Homeowners Equity Act. This legislation would allow \nservice members, who are away on extended active duty, to qualify for \nthe same tax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main \nresidence as other Americans. Secretary of State Colin Powell fully \nsupports this legislation, and this legislation enjoys overwhelming \nsupport by the senior uniformed leadership--the Joint Chiefs of Staff--\nas well as outgoing Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch \nDaniels, the 31-member associations of The Military Coalition, the \nAmerican Foreign Service Association, and the American Bar Association.\n  The average American citizen participates in our Nation's growth \nthrough home ownership. Appreciation in the value of a home allows \neveryday Americans to participate in our country's prosperity. \nFortunately, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 recognized this and \nprovided this break to lessen the amount of tax most Americans will pay \non the profit they make when they sell their homes. Unfortunately, the \n1997 home sale provision unintentionally discourages home ownership \namong service members and Foreign Service officers.\n  What we are doing is not creating a new tax benefit. We are merely \nmodifying current law to include the time members of the military are \naway from home on active duty when calculating the number of years the \nhomeowners has lived in their primary residence. In short, this bill is \nnarrowly tailored to remedy a specific dilemma.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to \nmillions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes \nthat affect individuals, families, investors, and businesses. It was \nalso one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent history.\n  As with any complex legislation, there are winners and losers. But in \nthis instance, there are unintended losers: members of the military and \nForeign Services.\n  The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a \nmuch-needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 act, taxpayers received a one-\ntime exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal \nresidence, but the taxpayer had to be at least 55 years old and live in \nthe residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This provision \nprimarily benefited elderly taxpayers while not providing any relief to \nyounger taxpayers and their families.\n  Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under this law, \ntaxpayers who sell their principal residence on or after May 7, 1997, \nare not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale, joint \nfilers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they make from \nselling their principal residence. The taxpayer must meet two \nrequirements to qualify for this tax relief. The taxpayer must, one, \nown the home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale, and, \ntwo, live in the home as their main home for at least 2 years of the \nlast 5 years.\n  The bipartisan cooperation that resulted in this much-needed form of \ntax relief is commendable. The home sales\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\nprovision sounds great, and it is. Unfortunately, the second part of \nthis eligibility test unintentionally and unfairly prohibits many \nservice men and women who are deployed overseas from qualifying for \nthis beneficial tax relief.\n  Constant travel across the United States and abroad is inherent in \nthe military and Foreign Service. Nonetheless, some service members and \nForeign Service officers choose to purchase a home in a certain local, \neven though they will not live there much of the time. Under the new \nlaw, if they do not have a spouse who resides in the house during their \nabsence, they will not qualify for the full benefit of the new home \nsales provision because no one ``lives'' in the home for the required \nperiod of time. The law is prejudiced against families who serve our \nNation abroad. They would not qualify for the home sales exclusion \nbecause neither spouse ``lives'' in the house for enough time to \nqualify for the exclusion.\n  This bill simply remedies an inequality in the 1997 law. The bill \namends the Internal Revenue Code so that members of the military and \nForeign Service will be considered to be using their house as their \nmain residence for any period that they are assigned overseas in the \nexecution of their duties. In short, they will be deemed to be using \ntheir house as their main home, even if they are stationed in Iraq, \nAfghanistan, Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, in the ``no man's land,'' \ncommonly called the DMZ between North and South Korea, or anywhere else \nthey are assigned.\n  In the wake of September 11, our Armed Forces are now deployed to an \nunprecedented number of locations. They are away from their primary \nhomes, protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so \ndear. We cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing \ntheir job. Military service entails sacrifice, such as long periods of \ntime away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not use the Tax Code to \nheap additional burdens upon our women and men in uniform.\n  The Taxpayers' Relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping \ntax relief to all Americans, including those who serve this country \nabroad. It it true that there are winners and losers in any tax code, \nbut this inequity was unintended. Enacting this narrowly tailored \nremedy to grant equal tax relief to the members of our military and \nForeign Services restores fairness and consistency to our increasingly \ncomplex Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, the case is clear. The conferees should have included \nthe Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 in the conference report for \nthis tax relief bill. If they can look into the eyes of all the men and \nwomen in our military who have committed themselves to the defense of \nthis country in Iraq and elsewhere around the world, and justify how \nthey spent billions of Federal dollars to cut taxes for our Nation's \nwealthiest at their expense, then the process is clearly broken. And \nthat is a disgrace for which they are solely responsible.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the \nconference report on the tax cut legislation that the Senate just \nconsidered.\n  I find it regrettable that we were forced to speed through debate on \nthe tax cut bill last week, and were once again forced to hurry through \nthis conference report. This is probably the most important bill that \nwe will be debating and voting on this year. Its repercussions will be \nfelt for years to come, and yet it seems that very little thought has \nreally been given to it.\n  Regrettably, I could not in good faith support this Reconciliation in \nits current form for three reasons.\n  First, it will be ineffective in reviving the economy now.\n  Second, it is irresponsible insofar as it adds tremendously to the \nnational debt for no compelling purpose.\n  Third, it is unfair to working families across the country insofar as \nit drains resources from investments in education and health care to \nfund tax breaks that overwhelmingly benefit the most affluent.\n  I will discuss these points in turn.\n  First, the resolution we have before us fails to effectively address \nthe needs of our country. Instead of investing in a stronger economy \nfor the future, the conference agreement provides little assistance and \nstimulus to our struggling economy now.\n  In the nearly 2\\1/2\\ years since the President has come into office, \nour nation has suffered a dramatic decline. We went from unparalleled \njob creation, economic growth, and opportunity to skyrocketing deficits \nand national debt, high unemployment, and uncertainty about the future.\n  Contrary to the claims of its proponents, it is by no means certain \nthis conference agreement will create jobs or provide millions of \nworking families with the relief they need. What is certain, however, \nis that it will drastically increase the national debt, and severely \nweaken key national priorities including homeland security, education, \nand health care.\n  According to Economy.com, the massive deficits that will be caused by \nthe administration's tax cut will decrease gross domestic product by \n0.25 percent annually beginning in 2005. GDP will be lower by 1.0 \npercent in 2013 than it would be without the Bush plan. The result is a \nloss of 750,000 jobs by 2013 according to Mark Zandi, a well-respected, \nnon-partisan economist at Economy.com.\n  The administration's policies are not considered to be ineffective on \na partisan basis, they are considered to be ineffective on a bipartisan \nbasis, as well.\n  Republican Senators have voiced concern about the ineffectiveness and \nirresponsibleness of this proposal.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve has said that these large tax \ncuts, if not paid for by offsetting cuts in spending, will drive us \ndeeper into deficit and that such high deficits and debt will actually \nhurt our long-term economic growth.\n  Other respected conservative economists have also warned us about the \ndirection we are taking. For instance, AEI economist Kevin Hasset \nstated that the proposal, by cutting taxes in one year and then raising \nthem in another, ``is one of the most patently absurd tax policies ever \nproposed,'' Similarly, Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition said that \nthe tax plan passed by the Senate just keeps ``building one gimmick on \ntop of another gimmick.''\n  However, this administration continues to turn a deaf ear to their \nwarnings, as it pursues its discredited economic theories.\n  Second, this conference agreement is irresponsible.\n  Two years ago, economists projected record surpluses; now they \nforecast record deficits. Recently the Congressional Budget Office \nraised its estimate of the deficit this year to more than $300 billion. \nThis is the largest federal deficit ever in the history of our country. \nAnd it does not include the tax cut that is before us.\n  It is a fact that high deficits mean an increase in long-term \ninterest rates on small business loans, families' mortgages, and \neducation loans. These deficits therefore act as a hidden tax on \nworking people.\n  Also the cost of all of the President's tax cuts and the deficits \nwill explode just as baby boomers start to retire. Over the next ten \nyears, more than $2 trillion will be raided from Social Security in \norder to pay for the President's tax cuts and spending plans. The \nSocial Security surplus is going to be consumed.\n  Last month, Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin \nsaid that the retirement of the baby boomers will drive spending on \nSocial Security, Medicare and Medicaid alone from 8 percent of the \neconomy's output today to 14 percent in 2030, and to 21 percent by \n2075. When you also consider national defense, homeland security, \neducation, health care, and other vital national priorities, you are \nleft with a fiscal breakdown. But again, the administration is ignoring \nthese warnings.\n  At the very time the President is asking for massive tax reductions, \nhe is also asking for the largest debt limit increase in the history of \nthe United States. He is seeking an increase of $984 billion. The \nPresident has dug this economy into a debt hole. He needs to stop \ndigging. Yet, instead, he is reaching for a bigger shovel.\n  From coast to coast, states are facing the most serious fiscal crisis \nsince World War II. States are in need of fiscal relief now. In \nConnecticut, we know that all too well. While there is a State relief \npackage in the conference agreement, the overall agreement is going to\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\nhurt States not help them since this legislation will mean less \nresources for Connecticut and other States to invest in infrastructure, \neducation, homeland security, and health care for needy children and \nthe elderly.\n  Americans all over the country have expressed their opinions in poll \nafter poll. They believe that we should not be passing a massive tax \ncut if it means cutting Medicare, if it means cutting social security, \nand if it means cutting education. This conference agreement ignores \nthe concerns of the American people.\n  Third, this tax bill is unfair to working families.\n  Yesterday's Wall Street Journal had an article that says that through \nthe President's tax proposal, some affluent investors may be able to \navoid paying almost any taxes. Their tax bill would be almost near \nzero. This is unfair to middle-class Americans.\n  It is bad enough that we are going to force our children and \ngrandchildren to shoulder the costs of this tax cut.\n  It is bad enough that this costly and irresponsible tax cut will \nbring about an average tax cut of $93,500 to tax filers who earn more \nthan $1 million, while those households in the middle of the income \nspectrum, which includes the average family in Connecticut, would \nreceive a tax cut of about $217.\n  It is bad enough that according to an analysis done by the Tax Policy \nCenter, 36 percent of all U.S. households would receive no tax cut \nwhatsoever in 2003 under the conference agreement, and 53 percent of \nhouseholds would receive a tax cut of $100 or less.\n  This bill also fails to address a crisis affecting Americans and \nsmall businesses--the burden of the high costs of health insurance. In \nthe past year alone, health care premiums for businesses have risen \nmore than 13 percent. This is extremely burdensome for small \nbusinesses, which employ 50 percent of the workers in this country. The \nDemocratic alternative to the tax bill, which did not pass, provided \nsmall businesses with a 50 percent tax credit in 2003 to help pay their \nshare of insurance premiums. This conference agreement that is before \nus contains nothing to assist small businesses that are struggling to \nkeep their employees insured during these times when cash is tight and \nhealth care costs are rising.\n  In order to fit the massive tax breaks for the most privileged into \nthe $350 billion limit that was agreed upon, the marriage penalty \nrelief and the child tax credit increase will expire next year, which \nmeans a tax increase of $850 for a family of four with an income of \n$40,000 in 2005. Also, the small business expensing and bonus \ndepreciation provisions, which would encourage business investments and \nprovide them with needed relief, will also expire. This is essentially \nincreasing taxes on small business owners.\n  In closing, I believe that the conference agreement before the Senate \nfails the test of common sense. It also fails the test of common \ndecency. At a time of war, at a time of economic stagnation, at a time \nof rising national debt, and of rising national concern about how we \nwill educate America's children and care for the health needs of our \npeople, one might expect our national leaders to pursue policies \ncalling for shared sacrifice to achieve shared benefits. Regrettably, \nthat is not the case. This administration has a clear vision: to \nbenefit the privileged few even if it means sacrificing the hopes and \naspirations of the rest of the people. We can do better as a Senate, \nand do better for our country.\n\n\n                       ceo signature legislation\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, as you know I have had a longstanding \ninterest in an issue that requires chief executive officers to sign \ntheir company's tax returns. My amendment has been made part of the \ncorporate inversion provisions as well as the CARE Act. I am hopeful to \nhave this provision enacted into law because I believe that if Joe \nSixpack is required to sign his tax return for his family and sign the \noath that says ``Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have \nexamined this return and accompanying schedules and statements and to \nthe best of my knowledge and belief they are true, correct and \ncomplete'', why shouldn't Josepheus Chardonnay be required to sign that \nsame oath for his big corporation?\n  I understand my CEO provision came into the current tax bill when the \nunderlying corporate shelter language was included and that it has been \ntaken out at the same time that the corporate inversion language was \ntaken out of the tax bill.\n  I would just like to reiterate that I am still interested in getting \nthis CEO signature provision enacted into law. I think it is an \nimportant tool for improving corporate accountability. I would like to \nask my colleague Senator Grassley if we may continue to work with the \nCommittee on Finance to get this amendment enacted in either the CARE \nAct or the next best legislative opportunity.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very much aware of Senator Miller's \ninterest in this provision. As you know, the Finance Committee has \nsupported his provision by including it in two separate pieces of \nlegislation that our committee considered this year. We had hoped to \ninclude it in this bill, even if the corporate shelter language was not \nincluded. Unfortunately, this measure has a negligible revenue effect \nand could possibly violate the Byrd rule. Accordingly, we were obliged \nto remove it from the bill. I give Senator Miller my commitment, \nhowever, that we will continue to work with him on opportunities to get \nthis amendment enacted into law this year. I would also add that I \ndiscussed this provision with Mr. Thomas, the chairman of the House \nWays and Means Committee, and his staff, and they indicated a \nwillingness to examine and explore the measure in conferences on future \nbills.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank the Senator and look forward to having this \nmeasure brought back to the Senate floor before the end of this year.\n\n\n                  Child Care Funding Within State Aid\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has shown remarkable \nleadership abilities by stewarding through the Senate a tremendous \neconomic stimulus bill, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation \nAct of 2003. I recognize this was no easy task and I want to compliment \nthe Senator on his hard work and successful negotiations in getting the \nbill through a difficult conference with the House. The Nation and the \neconomy will benefit from this great work.\n  I understand the final version of this bill we are considering today \ncontains $20 billion for State aid, with $10 billion of that aid going \nto States to help them pay for a state's essential government services. \nI believe the States will be very grateful for Congress' willingness to \nprovide these funds.\n  Although the bill clearly says that States may spend these funds on \n``essential government services,'' I believe that the States would \nappreciate some clarification as to the definition of ``essential \ngovernment services.'' I refer specifically to whether these funds may \nbe used to pay for child care. In my home State of Utah, there is a \ngreat need for child care funding to help parents in or near poverty \nhave a safe place for their children to stay while they work to provide \nmoney for their families. However, I believe this need is not a Utah-\nspecific issue, but a nationwide problem that needs to be addressed.\n  I understand the distinguished Senate Finance Committee chairman has \na long history of supporting initiatives which not only help children, \nbut help families who may be on the cusp of self-sufficiency and I \nthank you for your efforts in this regard.\n  To this end, I would just like to clarify for the record that it is \nthe intent of Congress to include child care expenses as an acceptable \nexpense under the ``essential government services'' clause in the \nlegislation, ensuring that States may use the $10 billion provided in \nthe bill for child care expenses?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would say that as my good friend, the Senator from \nUtah, knows, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 \nis first and foremost an economic stimulus bill. The most effective aid \nthe Federal Government can give to States or individuals is a healthy \neconomy with a robust job market. Without jobs, families with children \nwon't need child care services and won't have any way to pay the family \nbills.\n  I thank the good chairman of the Judiciary Committee and understand \nhis concern over the State aid portion of the legislation. We have \ntried to provide as much leeway as possible to the\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\nStates. However, it would be impossible to list all of the acceptable \nactivities for which a state could use his money. Therefore, the \nCongress has broadly defined the allowable activities for which States \ncould spend their temporary fiscal relief dollars.\n  Therefore, my answer to the question posed to me from the Senator \nfrom Utah is yes. We did intend for child care expenses to be included \nas an element of ``essential government services'' provided that a \nstate is currently operating a child care program and expenditures for \nchild care were permitted under the most recently approved budget for \nthe State.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am very appreciative to the Senator from Iowa for this \nclarification. I know it will be very helpful to those families who \nrely on these services. I thank the distinguished Finance Chairman for \nhis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as this debate on the budget \nreconciliation bill comes to a close, I congratulate the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley. He has done a very good job with \na very difficult task. For him, the race has not been easy. Even though \nsome may not have thought it possible, he has come to the finish line \ntoday.\n  In some ways, the conference report has responded to the debate in \nthe Senate. For example, the conference report did move roughly three-\nfifths of the benefits of the package into the first 2 years. That is \nclearly more stimulative than the structure of the bill that went to \nconference.\n  I also wish to commend Senator Grassley, Senator Voinovich, and \nSenator Snowe for doing what they could to restrain the total size of \nthe bill. Senator Voinovich kept his promise and forced the conferees \nto keep the conference report, on its face, within the $350 billion \nSenate agreement.\n  Unfortunately, this tax bill busts through the $350 billion with a \nseries of gimmicks to hide the true cost of the bill. In this time of \nincreasing deficits, we must live within limits. This conference report \nfails to do so. Instead, it uses a series of sunsets to shoehorn large \ntax cuts into a small budget window. In the words of a conservative tax \ncut advocate, Stephen Moore, ``It's bigger than it looks.''\n  The conferees have designed a tax cut that is one big yo-yo. Now you \nsee it, now you don't. Child credit is increased for 2003 and 2004. \nThen it is taken away. Part of the marriage penalty is eliminated for \n2003 and 2004, and then the penalty comes back. The 10-percent tax \nbracket is expanded for 2003. Then it reverts back. Even the dividend \ntax cut disappears after 2008. If accounting gimmicks and financial \nstatement manipulations were intolerable for corporate America, then \nwhy not for the Congress?\n  Further, this conference report is not fair to working Americans or \nto our military personnel. The benefits of this bill are skewed heavily \nto the elite. One of the beauties of America is that we work to treat \npeople equally, but this bill does not treat all Americans alike. We \nare not being brought together as Americans.\n  The bill lowers the rate for dividends, it lowers the tax on capital \ngains, and it increases the tax on 1.6 million more Americans by \nforcing them into the alternative minimum tax in 2005. The bill says it \nis a priority to ensure that only the people who pay full freight are \nthose hard-working Americans who earn their income in wages.\n  The bill that returned from conference also stripped out provisions \nto provide tax relief for those serving our country in the armed \nservices--those serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and across the globe.\n  This conference report does less than it could to rebuild the \nAmerican economy. It misdirects its tax breaks to those more likely to \nsave them and less likely to spend them immediately.\n  The bill increases the budget deficit and lays the bill at the door \nof our children and our grandchildren, it fails to follow in the \nAmerican tradition of fairness, and the bill is simply not structured \nto be effective in rebuilding the American economy.\n\n  This week, Alan Greenspan expressed his dismay at the lack of budget \ndiscipline in Washington, especially with the failure to take seriously \nthe significant budget problems looming because of the aging and baby \nboom generations. In his words, ``The silence is deafening.'' I will \nnot be part of that silence.\n  I urge Senators to consider what they are doing today. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this conference report.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for the hard work they have done. We can go into great details. \nWe have been doing that for weeks. The point is, we have a problem with \nthe economy. Our purpose here is to do something to stimulate that \neconomy. This bill will do that.\n  We have been through all the details. We have been through it in \ncommittee. We have been through it on the floor. We have been through \nit on the conference committee. Now we are back. It is time to do \nsomething to create jobs in this country. This bill will do it.\n  I thank the leadership for their help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  As we wind down debate on this bill, it is very important that I give \nappropriate thank-yous to people who have worked so hard on putting \nthis bill together. I am talking about the staff of the Finance \nCommittee and the Joint staff, both Republican and Democrat: Chief tax \ncounsel, Mark Prater; chief of staff, Kolan Davis; Ed McClellan, Dean \nZerbe, Christy Mistr, Diann Howland, Elizabeth Paris, and Brad Cannon; \nmembers of the health staff of the Finance Committee: Colin Rosky, \nJennifer Bell; members from the Budget Committee staff: Chief of staff, \nHazen Marshall; Cheri Reidy, Beth Felder, and Rachel Jones; Staff of \nMajority Leader Frist and Assistant Majority Leader McConnell, \nincluding Lee Rawls, Eric Ueland, Rohit Kumar, Bill Hoagland, and Mike \nSolon.\n  All of the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation worked through \nthe night on many occasions. As one who was caught in the crossfire on \nthis bill, I can appreciate when they take the heat from both sides on \nrevenue estimates.\n  I would especially like to thank George Yin, Mary Schmitt, and Bernie \nSchmitt of the Joint Tax Committee. I wish more of the participants in \nthe tax legislative process realized how tough the Joint Tax's job is; \nconferee staff, including Evan Liddiard and Garett Jones with Senator \nHatch's office; Laura O'Neill with Senator Lott's office; Lisa Wolski \nand Lawrence Willcox of Senator Kyl's staff.\n  Senate legislative counsel, these folks, of course, are true legal \nwizards who do excellent work under amazing pressure. This group \nincludes Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, and Ruth Ernst. Then a team of \npeople who worked on the State aid issue so much: Ted Totman, Steve \nRobinson, Becky Shipp, Leah Kegler, Michaela Sims, and Amy Tejra with \nBen Nelson's staff, and Michael Bopp with Senator Collins; Treasury \nDepartment staff, including Pam Olson, Greg Jenner, J.T. Young, and \nDrew Lyon; the administration staff, including Ziad Odjakli, O. Jack \nLee, Christine Burgeson, Candi Wolff, and David Hobbs.\n  Finally, I would like to thank Senator Baucus's Finance Committee \nstaff who assisted in the creation of a better product during times \nwhen we were able to work collaboratively: Jeff Forbes, Bill Dauster, \nRuss Sullivan, Matt Jones, Pat Heck, Anita Horn-Rizek, Liz Liebschutz, \nand Jonathan Selib. I really appreciate all of that.\n  I am very pleased with the bill that is before us today. We have \ngiven the country some very good tax relief and investment incentives. \nBut there is one provision in the bill that I intend to change, and \nthat is to let the inverters of the world know they better be on \nnotice, as far as I am concerned.\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\n  The new 15 percent tax rate applies to dividends paid by foreign \ncorporations to their U.S. shareholders. That is good policy.\n  What is not good policy is when those dividends are paid by a phony \nforeign shell corporation created by a U.S. corporate inversion. In an \ninversion, a U.S. corporation pretends to move its headquarters to a \nphony shell corporation that is nothing more than a folder in a filing \ncabinet or a post box in a tax haven. With this phony tax haven parent \ncorporation in place, the U.S. company is positioned to rip its taxable \nincome out of the United States through artificial interest payments to \nthe tax haven shell, which are legally deductible on its U.S. return. \nThis structure also allows the corporate inverter to move U.S. assets \noffshore and outside the reach of the IRS on a tax-free basis.\n  I question whether it is proper to allow a tax cut for dividends from \na corporate inversion. The House blocked my efforts to insert this ban \nin today's legislation. Because the President wanted the Jobs & Growth \nbill on his desk by Memorial Day, I chose not to block the legislation \nover this issue.\n  I acknowledge that it is the shareholders who would be denied the \nrate reduction, and not the corporate management that engineered the \ninversion. But an inversion requires shareholder consent. Usually \naround 60 percent must approve of the inversion. So do not let it be \nsaid that all shareholders are innocent bystanders in an inversion. \nThose who disapprove of the transaction are always free to sell their \nshares.\n  We should not give a tax cut that benefits an inversion, and I will \ncontinue to examine this issue and hopefully put a stop to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend the chairman for raising this \nissue at conference. It is a very serious issue; that is, whether \ncorporations that invert should enjoy the privileges of some of the \nprovisions of the bill about to be passed and soon signed by the \nPresident.\n  I say to my good friend that I want to work with the chairman in \ndefining what the proper way is to deal with dividends paid by \ncorporations who invert. I hope to find a good solid solution.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman and the ranking member have both \nconsumed all of their time.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are about to vote. Prior to the \ntime we cast our vote, I wanted to make some final comments on this \nbill. We have been debating this issue now for several months. Above \nand beyond anything else, economists from virtually all philosophical \nbackgrounds have urged us to be responsible. They have said if you are \ngoing to do anything regarding fiscal policy, make sure you do not make \nthe problem worse. They advised us to be immediate, make sure we have \nthe greatest impact immediately.\n  Finally, they said whatever you do, make sure you attempt to be \neffective. There are a lot of ways to cut taxes. Some are effective in \nstimulating the economy and others are not.\n  I firmly believe this bill fails on all counts. What is more \nremarkable is that this bill represents, in my view, a strategy that \nwas employed just 2 years ago, with disastrous results. In the name of \neconomic stimulus, the administration demanded that we pass a tax bill \nto stimulate jobs 2 years ago, and the result, of course, is now \nobvious to us all: 2.7 million jobs have been lost since 2001.\n  Economy.com, one of the prestigious analytical firms that has looked \nat this bill, predicts this bill might create 600,000 jobs for 2004, \nbut then, according to Economy.com, we could see the loss of 750,000 \njobs as a result of the passage of this bill during the next 9 years.\n  Not only is this bill grossly ineffective, I believe it is \nirresponsible, unfair, and duplicitous. First, it is irresponsible \nbecause the money for this plan comes directly from Social Security. \nHow many businesses would borrow from pension funds to pay a dividend? \nYet that is exactly what this bill does. It borrows the money to pay \nout tax cuts in large measure just as pension funds would be borrowed \nto pay a dividend.\n  It is irresponsible because we are cutting taxes by approximately \n$800 billion, if there were no sunset, with a $400 billion deficit this \nyear. It is irresponsible because just as we pass this bill, we will be \nasked to vote on a debt limit increase of $984 billion sometime later \ntoday. It is irresponsible because this tax cut means less investment \nin education, less investment in homeland security, less investment in \nprescription drug coverage.\n  Second, this bill is remarkably unfair. It is steeply tilted against \nthe middle class and toward the elite few but provides little or no \nbenefit to the vast majority of Americans. A typical South Dakotan, \naccording to all the analyses I have seen, would receive less than $100 \nwhen this bill passes.\n  Finally, this bill is duplicitous. The gimmickry in this bill has \nenough sleight-of-hand budget tricks to make an Enron accountant blush. \nEconomists say the now-you-see-it, now-you-don't kind of tax cut is the \nworst kind. What they want is stability. What they want is certainty. \nWhat they want is an absolute assurance that they are not going to see \nchanges year in and year out with the Tax Code. That is exactly what \nthis Tax Code does. I believe our colleagues did the tax equivalent of \na triple back flip off the high dive and they belly-flopped. It is a \nbelly flop we will all feel.\n  Americans have said in poll after poll we ought to be very careful \nabout passing tax breaks if it means cutting Medicare; that they oppose \nnew tax breaks if it means cutting Social Security; that we ought not \nhave new tax breaks if it means cutting homeland security; that we \nshould not see new tax breaks if it means cutting education. This bill \nturns its back on the American people. That is why I will vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take this opportunity prior to this \nimportant, significant vote to thank and congratulate the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Chairman Chuck Grassley, and his staff on the \ntremendous work they have done over the past several days but really \nover the past 30 days to bring the Senate to this conclusion in 3 \nminutes or so. I also thank the ranking member and his staff and \nespecially the staff of the Joint Tax Committee for the long hours and \nwork they have devoted to legislation that is straightforward in what \nit accomplishes, to create jobs and grow the economy, which is quite \ncomplex when you look at the moving parts where we have had to marry \nthe House bill with the Senate bill.\n  In many ways, in large part because of a number of discussions that \nseem a long time ago, it was just 2 weeks ago the Finance Committee met \nits instructions under this year's budget resolution to report a tax \nreconciliation bill to the Senate, a bill complying with this year's \nbudget instructions to craft an economic tax stimulus bill. That was \njust 2 weeks ago. It was just 1 week ago last night that the full \nSenate passed and sent to conference a revised tax reconciliation bill.\n  We are here this morning with an opportunity to pass and send to the \nPresident a bill that will provide immediate relief to millions of \nAmerican families, businesses and, indeed, States. And it will create \njobs.\n  Economists say again and again our economy in this country is like a \ngreat ship that cannot be turned around quickly, but while our economy \ntoday is moving in the right direction and it does not need to be \nturned all the way around, it clearly needs to pick up pace. We need to \nstoke those boilers in that ship, that ship being the economy, in order \nto create those jobs.\n\n  Of the $350 billion stimulus and growth provided in the bill before \nthe Senate this morning, nearly 60 percent, or $200 billion of this tax \nand fiscal relief is provided this year and next. It is immediate. It \nis short-term stimulus to grow the economy and jobs. I add that this is \nmore stimulus in the first few years than either the President's \noriginal proposal or the House bill or the Senate bill. This is a major \nstoking of those boilers in that economy, in that ship of the economy.\n  In a few moments I believe we will pass what is the third largest tax \nrelief\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\npackage in history. This is a great victory for the American people. \nWhy? We talk about the big numbers and I talked about the $350 billion, \nbut the wonderful thing is it boils down to greater job security for \npeople who may be listening at this moment, people who are looking for \njobs or want jobs. It elevates that sense of security for them. Why? \nBecause it creates jobs. It grows the economy. It means if you do not \nhave a job and you wake up and open the newspaper and you are looking \nthrough those classified ads, you are more likely to get a job after \npassage of this bill. It means if you have a job today but you feel \ninsecure about it because the economy is not moving quite as fast or \nquite as quickly, it is more likely you will be able to keep that job \nand it will be with you long term and you do not have to worry every \nmorning when you wake up about losing that job. The bill stimulates the \neconomy and it stimulates job creation. What we have been able to \nfashion after a lot of negotiation, a lot of compromise on both sides \nof the aisle and in this body, with the other body, and in addressing \nthe President's initial proposal, is a bill that does it now; it moves \nthe stimulus up to now when people want it.\n  If you are a schoolteacher, you will this year have more money to \nspend on your children's clothes or you will be able to make those \nmortgage payments a little bit easier than you did 6 months ago or last \nyear. If you are a mom and dad and you have three children, it means \nyou will receive $3,000 this year. You will receive $3,000, if you have \n3 children, in child tax credits to spend on their needs. Maybe you \nwill be able to buy them each that computer they need, that they \ndeserve, to stay in tune with what we can provide in education today.\n  Twenty-five million Americans will receive this child tax credit this \nyear, now, with passage of this bill. If a policeman and a teacher are \nmarried and are unfairly paying more in taxes--you are paying more in \ntaxes because you are married than if you were not married--relief is \non the way when we pass this bill.\n  As we all know, most jobs--probably 70 percent or 80 percent is the \nfigure we use--most jobs are created by small businesses. That is a \nfact. It is not the large corporations that provide jobs; it is the \nsmall businesses. It is the small businesses where ideas arise, where \ninnovation takes place, where capital is consumed, is invested, where \nexpansion takes place, and jobs are created. They are the engines of \neconomic growth and will be in this bill we will pass in a few moments. \nThe small businesses are directly and specifically stimulated in terms \nof growth, investment, and expansion. They will hire more people, \nthey will create more jobs.\n\n  With passage of this bill, if you have a job, no matter what the job \nis, whether it is a low-paying job or a high-paying job, you will be \nbetter off. Your family will be better off. You will have more money. \nOur Government is simply saying, We trust you with the money you earn. \nWe are saying, once again, It is your money. We are saying, You are the \nbest steward of the resources that you earn, to save, to invest, to \nspend on your family, on your small business. Today, after the \nPresident signs this bill that was passed by the House last night and \nwill be passed by the Senate today--and you can say this to every \nsingle American--you will have more money and will pay less in taxes.\n  In closing, I thank the President of the United States and the Vice \nPresident. The President has shown remarkable leadership in putting \nforth this jobs-and-growth package, in promoting it in every step long \nthe way. True leadership.\n  I also thank the Vice President, our own leader in the Senate, who \nhas worked literally nonstop over the last several days to help us \nmarry the original House proposal with that Senate proposal. We thank \nthem for their leadership.\n  Indeed, this bill accomplishes the goals we all share in this body; \nthat is, to move America forward, to grow the economy, and to create \njobs and job security for all Americans. Now let's move to pass this \nbill that will, indeed, benefit all Americans.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report accompanying \nH.R. 2.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 196 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before we turn to the debt limit bill, I \njust have a couple of remarks to make.\n  Putting this tax bill together that was just passed has been a \ndifficult task and made more difficult by the politics involved. \nNonetheless, the Finance Committee staff--both Democrats and \nRepublicans--worked very well together, I think in a bipartisan \nfashion, to help get us where we are.\n  I thank the Finance Committee staff for their counsel and for their \nhard work. They spent many long hours on this legislation.\n  I appreciate the cooperation we received from the Republican staff, \nparticularly Kolan Davis, Ted Totman, Mark Prater, Christy Mistr, Ed \nMcClellan, Elizabeth Paris, Diann Howland, and Dean Zerbe.\n  I also thank my staff for their hard work and dedication, including \nJeff Forbes, Russ Sullivan, Bill Dauster, Matt Jones, Liz Liebschutz, \nPatrick Heck, Anita Horn Rizek, Jonathan Selib, Lara Birkes, Liz \nFowler, Alan Cohen, Tom Klouda, and Kate Kirchgraber.\n  I also thank our dedicated fellows: Alisa Blum, Mark Kirbabas, Rhonda \nSinkfield, and Renee Johnson.\n  Finally, I thank our intern, Mike Wiedrick, who joined the Finance \nCommittee the week of the markup of this bill and did not miss a step.\n  Particularly, I thank the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation \nfor their invaluable service. They worked very hard under very \ndifficult circumstances. I know I speak for all Members in commending \nthem.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, the Senate voted today on a so-called ``jobs \nand growth'' package. I voted against this package, Mr. President, \nbecause I'm still looking for the part of the package that will result \nin jobs and economic growth. In fact, I would like to take this \nopportunity to explain to my colleagues, and the people of Wisconsin, \nwhat exactly it is that I have found in this package, and what it's \nlacking.\n  As I look through the conference report before us, I have found \nproposals that fall far short of helping to boost our economy and \ncreating jobs for the American people. The cost of this\n\n[[Page S7088]]\n\npackage, which is much higher than estimated due to the gimmick of \nsunsetting provisions, will only increase our already record-setting \ndebt. As great an economic authority as Alan Greenspan has made it \nclear that growing debt and increasing interest rates will do nothing \nto create jobs or benefit the economy. In fact, just the opposite will \nresult.\n  In addition, this package includes provisions that will \noverwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, again to the detriment of the \neconomy and the jobless. How do you create consumer demand by giving \nmoney to those least likely to spend it? How do you create jobs by \nrewarding those who are so rich they obviously have high paying jobs or \ndon't even need them?\n  Those are a few of the provisions that are included in this bill. \nWhat is not included? There is not enough money going to help the \nStates out of their fiscal crises. My State of Wisconsin is facing a \nbudget gap of nearly $300 million. How can I vote for a package that \ndoes so little to close that? While I support the meager amount that \nwas included in the final bill, I am disappointed when I compare it to \nwhat we could and should have done. In addition, I strongly oppose the \ndividend tax provisions that, in States such as Wisconsin, which tie \ntheir definition of taxable income to the federal definition, will suck \nback over half of the state aid the bill includes. Our struggling \nStates don't need that kind of legerdemain--sending a small, temporary \ncash infusion while enacting a long-term erosion in their tax base.\n  In addition, I am equally disappointed that many of the provisions \nthat would have actually helped middle and lower class families will \nsunset after 2004, providing little or no benefit to the families who \nneed it the most. The bill drops a Senate provision to accelerate a \ncomponent of the child tax credit that would have directly benefited \nworking families across the country. The bill does not have real relief \nfrom the alternative minimum tax, a provision that will increasingly \naffect middle class families over the coming years. Finally, in the \nlong list of examples of what this bill lacks, several of the loopholes \nthat would have been closed under the Senate bill have been left out of \nthe conference report, allowing companies to continue to use a myriad \nof tax shelters.\n  As I review what is in this bill, and what isn't, I am confident that \nthe majority of the people of Wisconsin will not benefit from what we \nhave done here today. It is for their interests that I have to work, \nand I cannot in good conscience support a bill that will not benefit \nthem.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nfinal version of the reconciliation bill, which has emerged from \nconference committee.\n  Last week I came to this floor to express my opposition to the tax \ncut which emerged from the Senate. And I believe that the bill which \npassed the House was no better. Unfortunately, this conference report \nhas even less to recommend it than either of those bills.\n  This bill will add an additional $350 billion to our deficit over the \nnext 5 years, all of which will be paid for by future generations of \ntaxpayers. Even worse, it contains so many sunsets and phase-outs that \nit makes a mockery of our tax code.\n  Some provisions last only through the end of next year and others \nphase out in each subsequent year, until the whole tax cut is finished \nby the end of 2008. This bill is a patchwork quilt of temporary cuts \nand provides neither short-term stimulus nor long-term structural tax \nrelief. Indeed, all it provides is a great deal of uncertainty to the \naverage American taxpayer.\n  Rather than view the reluctance of the Senate to pass a large tax cut \nas a sign of concern over our historic federal budget deficits, the \nconferees used a grab-bag of tricks to stuff a $1.1 trillion tax cut \ninto a $350 billion package. Many of those cuts are likely to become \npermanent, which will further increase deficits and the federal debt.\n  Quite frankly, I am not fooled by this slight of hand, and I am sure \nthat the average American will not be either.\n  By lowering tax rates on both dividends and capital gains, the \nConferees ensured that this bill is even more regressive than the \nPresident's original proposal, because capital gains income is skewed \neven more to the wealthiest Americans than dividend income.\n  Between now and 2006, the period during which the majority of the tax \ncuts are in effect, 54 percent of the tax cuts will go to the 5 percent \nof Americans who earn over $150,000 annually. The top one percent of \nAmericans, who earn an average of just over $1 million annually, will \ntake away 37 percent of the tax cuts.\n  In those areas that count most, this bill provides very little \nrelief. It provides $20 billion in state aid, which is a start, but \nwhich is much less than the $40 billion which is required to have a \nmeaningful impact on state budget deficits, which in many cases have \nreached crisis proportions.\n  At the same time, this bill strips out a provision in the Senate-\npassed bill which would accelerate the refundability of the Child Tax \nCredit for families earning $10,000 to $30,000 per year. In fact, 29 \npercent of married and head of household filers will receive no tax cut \nin 2003 under the bill, while higher-earning families will receive a \n$400 rebate check this year.\n  And this bill preserves the most regressive portion of the tax cut--\nthe cut to taxes on dividends and capital gains--through 2008, while \ncuts targeted at middle income families, such as marriage penalty \nrelief, are only provided for 2 years.\n  Mr. President, this tax cut makes no sense--no sense at all. It \nprovides little benefit to those taxpayers who are likely to generate \nnew consumer demand, and instead boosts the income of wealthy taxpayers \nwho will spend little if any of it on goods or services.\n  Keep in mind that the 2001 tax cuts are only now coming into full \neffect. In June of 2001, I voted in favor of a $1.35 trillion tax cut, \nwhich remains the largest tax cut in history. That tax cut will return \n$300 billion to American taxpayers by the end of next year, and will \nprovide $90 billion in tax relief this year alone.\n  The top 1 percent of taxpayers, who will receive 37 percent of the \nbenefits included in the Reconciliation bill, are already scheduled to \nreceive an average of $11,300 in tax relief this year.\n  There is simply no reason to add another tax cut on top of what was \nalready the largest cut in history, particularly when every dollar in \ntax cuts must be paid for by new debt.\n  Gross Federal debt currently stands at $6.7 trillion. If the \nprovisions in this tax cut are permanently extended, as this \nAdministration intends, then our federal debt will rise to $12 trillion \nby the end of the decade.\n  The President claimed that any deficits created by his fiscal policy \nwould be ``small and short-term.'' It does not take an accountant to \nunderstand that the deficits now projected by the Congressional Budget \nOffice are neither small, nor short-term, and, in fact, will not fall \nbelow $300 billion before 2013, if the Social Security surplus is \nexcluded.\n  Our on-budget deficit in 2003 alone will exceed $500 billion. That \nmeans that nearly one-quarter of our $2.2 trillion in gross Federal \nspending is financed through deficit spending. There is nothing \ncyclical about a deficit of one-quarter of your total spending--rather, \nit is a structural deficit that cannot be sustained.\n  Deficits of the magnitude we are now incurring will drive up long-\nterm interest rates and stifle economic growth.\n  If you or I were to walk into a bank and ask for a loan, and we told \nour bank officer that we expected to earn $30,000 per year for the next \ndecade, but spend $40,000 per year over the same period, we would be \nlaughed out of the building. But that is exactly what our Federal \nGovernment is now planning to do.\n  This is unconscionable, and this is why I have voted against this tax \nbill.\n  The fact that, later today, we must vote to increase the Federal debt \nlimit stands as a clear indication of the very grave fiscal straits in \nwhich we now find ourselves.\n  It has taken just 2 years to squander our hard won budget surplus, \nand we are forced to vote to increase the debt limit because this \nadministration, along with this Congress, are placing irresponsible tax \ncuts ahead of fiscal discipline and common sense.\n  In this year's State of the Union message, President Bush stated: \n``We will not deny, we will not ignore, we will not pass along our \nproblems to other\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\nCongresses, to other presidents, and other generations.''\n  Well, Mr. President, by voting to increase our debt limit, we are now \nhandling an additional $984 billion dollar debt as our gift to those \nfuture generations.\n  This is why I am voting for an amendment offered by Senator Baucus \nthat would increase the Federal debt limit by $350 billion, an amount \nwhich will ease the current pressure on our Treasury but force us to \nreview our fiscal policy within the next 9 months.\n  This, to me, is the prudent course given our current fiscal straits. \nTo increase the debt limit by $984 billion all at once is to write \nourselves a 2 year free pass at the expense of regular review. It is, \nwithout question, the wrong thing to do.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, putting this bill together has been a \nchallenging task. Many Senators have played important roles in this \nlegislation but it could not have been done without the contributions \nof our staff. Without the aid of these individuals, the work of this \ninstitution would be impossible to accomplish. I would like to \nrecognize the hard work and dedication of those staff members whose \ncontributions to this legislation have been critical and without whom \nwe would not have been able to pass this very important bill.\n  On the Finance Committee, I want to recognize the contributions of \nChairman Grassley's staff. On the tax side, I want to especially thank \nthe committee's chief tax counsel, Mark Prater, the committee's staff \ndirector Kolan Davis as well as Ed McClellan, Dean Zerbe, Christy \nMistr, Diann Howland, Elizabeth Paris, and Brad Cannon. I also want to \nthank Ted Totman, Steve Robinson, Leah Kegler, and Becky Shipp for \ntheir work on the State aid provisions.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Chairman \nNickles' Budget Committee staff, including Rachel Jones, Hazen \nMarshall, Beth Felder, and Cheri Reidy. I should also thank Lisa Wolski \nand Lawrence Willcox of Senator Kyl's staff, whose efforts were \nintegral to the success of this bill.\n  Also integral to our efforts was the work of the entire staff of the \nJoint Committee on Taxation and the Senate Legislative Counsel's \noffice. Specifically, George Yin, Mary Schmitt, and Bernie Schmitt of \nthe Joint Committee and Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, and Ruth Ernst at \nLegislative Counsel. They have all put in long hours to help bring this \nbill to completion.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of those individuals \nfrom the administration, all of whom dedicated significant time and \neffort to this bill. From the White House, I would like to thank Ziad \nOjakli and Christine Burgeson from the Legislative Affairs Office and \nPam Olson, J.T. Young, John Kelly, and Greg Jenner from the Department \nof Treasury. Without their efforts and cooperation, this bill could not \nhave come to pass.\n  Finally, I would like to thank my staff and Senator McConnell's staff \nfor their work in getting both a bill and then a conference report \nthrough the Senate in just over a week's time. From Senator McConnell's \noffice, I would like to especially thank Kyle Simmons and Michael \nSolon. From my office, I would like to thank Lee Rawls, Eric Ueland, \nBill Hoagland, and Rohit Kumar.\n  These staff members have worked diligently and largely in anonymity. \nGiven all that they have done in service to their country, I think it \nis appropriate to recognize their work publicly so the rest of the \ncountry knows, as we all know, how well we are served by our staff.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

We will offer them, and there will be short \ntime limits, maybe 10 minutes per amendment.\n  The first one will be offered by the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, the ranking member, Mr. Baucus. Senator Kennedy will have one \non unemployment. I will have a sense of the Senate on Social Security. \nThere will be a couple of others.

The clerk will report the next order of business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 51) increasing the statutory \n     limit on the public debt.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today we are discussing legislation to \nraise the statutory limit on the Federal debt, the ceiling on how much \nthe Treasury Department can borrow. It is a very important matter.\n  The Federal debt is like the family credit card. Sooner or later you \nhave to pay down the debts that you have already incurred. If you \ndon't, your credit rating will suffer. The way the Government raises \nthe debt limit is also like a family who just keeps calling the bank \nevery time they hit the credit limit and asks the bank over and over \nagain for an increase in their credit limit without regard to anything \nelse. Rather than pay down their debt, they just keep on asking for a \nhigher debt limit.\n  When the credit card bill comes, it is a time to reassess the \nfamily's budget. It is a time to review the debts and to control the \nfuture spending. The fiscally responsible approach is that of the \ntypical Montana family who, rather than just ask for an increase in \ntheir credit limit, sits down at the kitchen table and reassesses their \nbudget. And so should we.\n  Let's put this in perspective. This debt limit increase is one big \nbill. This bill calls for an increase of almost $1 trillion. I have a \nchart behind me that shows the increase of the debt limit. This bill \ncalls for an increase of $984 billion in the debt ceiling, nearly $1 \ntrillion. This will be the largest debt limit increase in history. This \nwill be an increase of about $3,400 in debt for every man, woman, and \nchild in America. That is signified by the column on the right, which \nis the debt limit increase being asked for here.\n  That is just the increase. The debt subject to limit is already more \nthan $22,000 per person. This $3,400 increase would come on top of \nthat. Before this bill, the largest increase was in 1990, under the \nfirst Bush administration. Then the Government increased the debt limit \nby $915 billion.\n  Since 1990, the Government has increased the debt limit five times. \nThe average of those five increases was about $450 billion. So $984 \nbillion is a very large number. It is out of line with the most recent \nprecedents. It is too large a number for us to make now.\n  As this debt limit increases, it is just the tip of the iceberg. The \nbudget resolution lays out the fiscal course on which we are headed. \nPage 4 of the budget resolution says in black and white: If we follow \nthe budget resolution, the debt will grow to $12,040,000,000,000 in \n2013. That is page 4 of the budget resolution Congress passed. That \nwould be $39,000 in debt for every man, woman, and child in the country \nin 2013, 10 years from now. Following the budget resolution, of course, \nwould leave a legacy of nearly $40,000 in debt for every American child \ncoming into the world about the time the baby boomers arrive.\n  I come from a State where the average income per person is about \n$22,000. So these are large numbers. This large debt means that the \nFederal Government has to spend the first dollars it receives to pay \ninterest on past debts. Before the Government can spend a cent on \nnational defense, education, it would have to set aside $157 billion a \nyear on net interest on the debt. More\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\nthan 11 cents on every on-budget tax dollar has to go directly to pay \nnet interest before the Government can spend on any current needs.\n  That is a debt tax that every taxpayer has to pay. It is a debt tax \nthat robs this generation and future generations of the ability to make \ntheir own fiscal choices.\n\n  The time has come for us to reassess our budget. This is a time to \nlook to see where we are and how we got here. Not long ago our country \nwas paying down the debt. When the Government ran budget surpluses in \nthe late 1990s and the beginning of this decade, it reduced the \nGovernment's demand on the credit markets.\n  From 1998 to 2001, the Government reduced debt held by the public by \n$448 billion. That is demonstrated by the chart behind me to my \nimmediate left. It shows from 2000 to 2003, about 33.1 percent was the \ndebt ratio to GDP; that is, we were paying down the debt. That is that \nsteep declining solid red line with the debt being paid down.\n  When the Government returned to budget deficits at 2002, it began, \nonce again, to mount up debt held by the public. In 2002, the \nGovernment ran a deficit of $158 billion. The deficit this current year \nwill be much higher.\n  In January 2001, the Congressional Budget Office projected surpluses \nof $5.6 trillion for the next decade. That was 2001. Now CBO projects \nthat the President's budget will result in deficits of $2.1 trillion \nfor the same period. Thus, CBO's projections of the decade to come have \nchanged by almost $8 trillion in just 2 years. Imagine, an $8 trillion \ndifference in just 2 years--from a $5.6 trillion surplus to a $2.1 \ntrillion deficit.\n  These are times of great uncertainty for budget projections. The \nrecent budget projections have continued this trend. In its May budget \nreview, CBO made a new larger deficit projection for fiscal year 2003. \nAccording to that new review, the most recent, CBO now expects that the \nGovernment will end 2003 with a deficit of over $300 billion. That is \ncompared with its March baseline of $246 billion. So the budget \nresolution projection of $12 trillion debt limit for 2013 may \nunderstate the debt we will pass along to future generations. That is \ncertainly clear if we stay on the present course. And all these deficit \nfigures are for the total budget deficit before netting out the \nsurpluses contributed by Social Security.\n  Since the Social Security reforms of 1983, Social Security has been \nrunning surpluses. I will never forget Alan Greenspan headed that \ncommission; Senators Dole and Moynihan were on it. They came up with \ngood suggestions for the Congress to pass, and we did. Consequently, \nsince the recommendations, Social Security has been running surpluses. \nThe goal of doing so was to increase national savings in anticipation \nof the retirement of the baby boom generation starting in the next \ndecades. Senator Moynihan would constantly remind us of that date. If \nwe had balanced the rest of the budget, we would have increased \nnational savings.\n  But the rest of the budget has not been in surplus. It is not in \nsurplus now. So these trust fund surpluses have masked the size of \nGovernment deficits.\n  The Government's deficits are thus much larger than they appear. As \nthe baby boom generation begins to retire, Social Security's annual \nsurpluses will eventually turn into deficits. Moreover, CBO projects \ndeficits for the rest of the Government will continue as far as the eye \ncan see. So the true larger size of the Government's budget deficits \nwill become all too apparent in the next decade.\n  This debt limit bill is very much related to our budget deficits and \nthe coming budget pressure from the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. Think of our children and our grandchildren trying to make \nends meet in their lives. When this generation piles up debt, it is \nimposing a tax on them. It is raising their taxes. We have a moral \nobligation, I believe, to act as good stewards of what we have been \ngiven, whether it is in the environment or the economy. We have an \nobligation to leave things for our children and grandchildren in at \nleast as good shape as we found them.\n  This is a great country of which we can be proud. We have weathered \nmany storms in the past--economic and otherwise.\n  We live in times of great uncertainty and great challenges. A good \nsteward would not tempt the fate. A good steward would ensure that we \ndo not add to the challenges our children will have to face.\n  In too many spheres, there has been too much seeking after rewards \nfor this generation, for now. Rather, we should exercise \nresponsibility. We should ensure that we act as guardians of future \ngenerations. After all, we are not all going to be here forever.\n  It is time to reassess. It is time to change course. First, we need \nto stop making the deficits and the debt worse. We need to put the \nbrakes on the size of spending increases and tax cuts.\n  This debate is very much related to the one just concluded on the tax \nbill. We need to limit the size of future tax cuts. And wherever \npossible, we need to pay for tax cuts, as we did with the CARE act and \nthe military tax bill. Stop the gimmicks. Be honest about long-term \ncosts.\n  Second, we need to extend and strengthen our budget process \nconstraints. The pay-as-you-go rule and the appropriations caps \ncontributed to the fiscal responsibility of the 1990s. We need to \nfollow the rules.\n  Third, the debt limit itself should provide a much needed brake on \nfiscal irresponsibility. We should not increase the debt limit by the \nlarge amount that the House of Representatives proposes. Rather, we \nshould force the Government to reassess its fiscal situation again \nlater this year--not next year as the House contemplates--when we will \nhave a clearer picture of how the economy and budget are faring.\n  Returning to the analogy of the family credit card, the credit limit \non the credit card is a check on future spending. Similarly, with the \ndebt limit, a smaller increase now will ensure that we in Congress \naddress the Government's fiscal policy again later this year.\n  So this is an important debate. It may not be a glamorous issue, but \nit is a very important one. We have a weighty responsibility. This is \nan issue that the Senate should debate. Certainly, we should not hide \nbehind the rules to avoid votes, as the House of Representatives has \ndone. Certainly, we should not flee from the issues, and to a recess, \nwithout full consideration of this issue.\n  We will address it best if we do not simply approve this bill without \namendment. Rather, we need to debate and understand why we are here. We \nneed to scale back this too large amount. If the Senate doesn't reduce \nthe size of the debt increase, I will oppose it. And we should add \nprocedures to ensure greater fiscal responsibility in the future.\n  Only by taking these steps will we be meeting our responsibility. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in that effort.\n  At the appropriate time, I will offer an amendment to reduce the \nincrease in the debt limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have just a couple of remarks. I think we need to \nunderstand where we are. I think most of us do, as a matter of fact. We \nhave heard from the Secretary of the Treasury, of course, on the final \naction by the Treasury to provide room for the debt limit. It has to be \ndone by May 28, which is very soon.\n  The House has acted. The House is no longer there. I think the \namendment we will soon hear about would tide us over until maybe \nAugust, instead of doing it for another fiscal year, so we know where \nwe are.\n  There is a very big difference between public debt and the debt held \nby the trust funds. I will wait until the chairman comes back to go \ninto that in detail.\n  I think those who are proposing these amendments ought to explain how \nthis is going to work, since the House is not there and they have \nalready acted. Of course, it just ruins the system we are in now. The \nfact is, we need to go forward. I suggest we move on with the \namendments. I have to say to my friends that I hope we reject these \namendments because it doesn't make sense not to go ahead with what has \nbeen passed in the House. We know we have to do it. It has to be there. \nThen I will be interested, as we go through time, in talking about \nspending with the Senator from Montana because\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\nthat has not been something that has been under control on the other \nside of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate is considering legislation to \nraise the statutory debt limit by $1 trillion.\n  This increase is the largest in the history of the Republic--\nsurpassing by a whopping $100 billion the record that was set by the \nfirst President Bush in 1990. What's more, it would be the second \nincrease in the debt ceiling since this President took office in \nJanuary 2001.\n  The Treasury Secretary recently wrote to the Congress stating that \nthe current statutory debt ceiling would only be adequate to ensure the \noperations of Government through the end of May. The administration has \ntried to excuse the need to raise the level of borrowing authority. \nAmong its scapegoats, the administration blames economic weakness. It \nblames the September 11 attacks. It blames the corporate accounting \nscandals of last summer.\n  That scapegoating may help this administration to explain how it lost \n$5.6 trillion of budget surpluses in less than 2 years, but it doesn't \nexplain why they need to increase the national debt by an additional $1 \ntrillion. It doesn't explain why this administration is pushing for new \ntax cuts when we don't even have the money to pay for tax cuts that \nhave already been enacted into law.\n  To quote President Ronald Reagan, ``the American people deserve a \nPresident who has the courage to give answers instead of mak[ing] \nexcuses.''\n  So far, only $202 billion of the $1.35 trillion tax cut package \nsigned into law in 2001 has gone into effect. That means $1.15 trillion \nin tax cuts are set to phase in over the next 8 years. In addition, the \nPresident is pushing for $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts. That is a total \nof $2.65 trillion in tax cuts that would have to be paid for in the \ncoming years under the President's policies.\n  But there is no money to pay for them. The cupboard is bare. The \nvault is empty. There is nothing left under the mattress. The moths are \nflying out of the wallet of the U.S. Government.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reported a $248 billion deficit for \nthe first 6 months of the current fiscal year. That deficit is expected \nto increase to nearly $400 billion before the end of the fiscal year. \nThat is $400 billion--$110 billion higher than the record set in 1992 \nduring the first Bush administration.\n  We will have to borrow the money not only to pay for new tax cuts, \nbut to pay 85 percent of the tax cuts already enacted into law and \nscheduled to become effective in the coming years.\n  That is why the administration is pushing the Congress to increase \nthe statutory debt limit by $1 trillion--so that we can borrow the \nmoney to pay for these tax cuts.\n  The ship is sinking and this administration is drilling more holes in \nthe bottom of the boat. Administration officials are already beginning \nto jump ship. Paul O'Neill left the Treasury Department last December, \nalong with the President's economic adviser, Larry Lindsey. White House \neconomist Glenn Hubbard left last February. And now Mitch Daniels is \nfleeing the budgetary quagmire he helped to create.\n  The Republican-passed budget, which assumes the President's budget \nproposals are enacted into law, estimates that the statutory debt limit \nwill increase from its current level of $6.4 trillion to $12 trillion \nby 2013. This legislation to increase the debt ceiling by $1 trillion \nis just the beginning of an administration effort currently underway to \ndouble the size of the national debt by $6 trillion in just 10 years.\n  And that rise in the debt limit does not include the total costs of \nthe war in Iraq. It does not include necessary investments that must be \nmade to protect the Nation from terrorists. Nor does it include an \nadequate prescription drug benefit, or a host of other urgent \ninvestments that need to be made in education, health care, veterans \nservices, and other essential infrastructure.\n  Most alarmingly, that debt limit increase does not include the costs \nof providing for the soon-to-be-retiring baby boomers, and the \nresulting financial pressures on the Social Security Program.\n  According to the latest Social Security Trustees Report, Social \nSecurity trust fund expenditures will exceed revenues beginning in \n2018, when there will be an estimated 65 million Social Security \nbeneficiaries. The President's budget said ``These high and perpetual \ndeficits make it obvious that Social Security and Medicare are in deep \ntrouble.'' Yet there is nothing in the President's budget or the \nRepublican-passed budget resolution that sets aside a single dime to \ndeal with the impending Social Security funding crisis.\n  When this President took office, he told the American people that \nevery dollar of the Social Security surplus would be saved. But taking \ninto account the President's proposed $1.5 trillion in new tax cuts, we \nwill not only spend every dollar of the $2.2 trillion Social Security \nsurplus through 2011, but we also will have to borrow more than $1.7 \ntrillion to cover the President's spending and tax cut proposals.\n  It took the entire history of the Nation to accumulate $5.6 trillion \nin debt by fiscal year 2001. Under the President's budget proposals, as \nincorporated in the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution, this debt would \ngrow by over 100 percent in just 10 years. The United States fought \nWorld War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war, and even then our \nnational debt grew only by $865 billion, from $43 billion in 1940 to \n$908 billion in 1980. Under President Bush's budget proposals, it will \ngrow by almost seven times that amount in just 10 years.\n  A national debt of that size amounts to $41,370.54 for every man, \nwoman, and child in this country. That is more money than is annually \nearned by over half of the households in this Nation. That is enough \nmoney to put a down payment on half a dozen houses in West Virginia, to \npay for a 4-year college education at West Virginia University, with \nmoney left over, or to pay eight times over for the annual health care \ninsurance of a family of four.\n  Like a carney at a circus sideshow, the Bush administration is asking \nthe American people to step up to a barrel, and slap down $41,340 to \nwin a $1,083 tax cut prize. The American people are being lured into \nthe tent by big promises and folksy talking. In his January 28 State of \nthe Union address, the President said, ``We will not pass on our \nproblems to other Congresses, other Presidents, and other \ngenerations.''\n  What will happen when the carney pulls back the curtain and the \nAmerican people realize that they have been swindled? We hear much \nrhetoric about providing the American people with tax relief. Yet \nnothing is said about debt relief for the American public, which will \nbe borne by generations to come long after the tax refund checks have \nbeen cashed.\n  So when the administration tells the American people that this debt \nincrease was brought on by factors beyond its control, the American \npublic should also realize that the administration, with eyes wide \nopen, has chosen to strap this crushing debt burden to their backs. No \nmatter how fair and equitable this administration claims its tax cut \nproposals to be, the tax refund checks will do nothing to save Social \nSecurity, and to cover the costs of the debt burden that American \nfamilies will be paying for decades to come.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, since December 2002, the Treasury \nDepartment has made three requests to Congress for an unspecified \nincrease in the debt limit. Last year, the administration asked for a \n$700 billion increase, but Congress wisely trimmed it to $450 billion. \nThe $984 billion increase we will pass today will be the largest \nincrease in the debt limit ever, and it is twice as high as the average \nfor the last five increases. This level of increase represents about \n$3,400 for every man, woman and child in the United States--or more \nthan 17 times what the median American family will receive in tax cuts \nunder the conference agreement passed earlier today by one vote.\n  We need to be clear about a few things here in the Senate. The \neconomy is growing very slowly, and every American has experienced the \ncurrent slowdown in very personal ways: 2.5 million jobs have been \nlost, long-term unemployment has skyrocketed; lifetime savings have \nbeen wiped out by greed, bad judgment, and criminal activity; personal \ndebt has increased and bankruptcies are up; and the stock market has \nplunged more than 30 percent. Record budget surpluses have turned into \ndeficits as far as the eye\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\ncan see--nearly $500 billion this fiscal year alone when Social \nSecurity is excluded, the largest deficit in history. We have seen the \nweakest level of economic growth and business investment in 50 years. \nWe are spending the entire Social Security surplus in every year of the \nPresident's budget plan and failing to make necessary investments in \neducation, infrastructure, and homeland security. Yet we have the money \nto drastically cut the tax on stock dividends, giving millionaires an \naverage annual tax cut of about $90,000. It makes no sense given the \ncurrent state of the economy and the world. We are governing based on \nideology rather than pragmatism.\n  President Bush, who inherited large and rising surpluses totaling \n$5.6 trillion over 10 years, likes to say that the change in the budget \npicture--and frequent requests for increases in the statutory debt \nlimit--are a result of a slow economy and September 11. Those factors \nundoubtedly play a role, but every single independent analysis shows \nthat the largest factor behind the long-term change in the budget \noutlook is the President's tax policies. The rising deficits and debt \nthat will result in higher taxes on our children can be laid squarely \nat his feet, because most Republicans in Congress are too afraid to say \nno to this President.\n  If there are any doubts, just add up the numbers. Not including \ninterest, President Bush has proposed nearly $3 trillion in tax cuts \nover 13 years since taking office. It is worth pointing out that more \nthan half of this total--$1.63 trillion--was proposed this year, after \nthe budget returned to perpetual deficits. Adding interest, the total \njumps to $3.8 trillion. What happened to the promise not to spend the \nSocial Security surplus? We are borrowing from our children for every \ndollar of these tax cuts--tax cuts that will go predominantly to those \nearning more than $200,000 per year. And the tax cut we passed today, \nbecause of its gimmicky phase-outs that future Congresses may not allow \nto happen, is really a trillion-dollar tax bill. The Speaker of the \nHouse admitted as much. When do we admit that we are cutting taxes too \nmuch? What happened to the Republican Party of the 1980s, that railed \nagainst deficits and insisted on balanced budgets? What happened to the \ntrue conservatives, those who look to cut spending and taxes in order \nto stand for ``less government''? Where is the principle, when almost \nevery Republican in the Senate votes for every spending increase and \nevery tax cut? We should call it what it is: borrow-and-spend \neconomics. And our kids will pay for it for decades to come.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about \nthe pending legislation, which raises the Federal debt limit by almost \n$1 trillion. In my view, this legislation shows very clearly that the \nfiscal policies the President has pursued over the last 2 years are \nimprudent and reckless.\n  We are considering today an increase of $984 billion in the Federal \ndebt ceiling, which is expected to carry the Government through to \nSeptember 2004. In other words, the Treasury Department will need to \nborrow almost $1 trillion more than is currently authorized--some $6.4 \ntrillion--over the next 16 months to fund Government operations. This \nwould be the largest single increase in the debt limit ever. We are \nreally talking about an increase of historic proportions in our Federal \ndebt.\n  It is enlightening to look back at where we were when President Bush \ntook office. In January 2001, the Congressional Budget Office projected \nthat our net debt to the public would decline to $36 billion by 2008. \nAt that time, the President claimed that his budget would allow us to \nachieve ``maximum possible debt retirement.''\n  Now, only two years later, the President is seeking to increase the \ndebt limit. In fact, under the President's policies, publicly-held debt \nwill rise to $5 trillion in 2008--a staggering 36.4% of GDP. Gross \nFederal debt, which includes our commitments to Social Security and \nMedicare, will nearly double from $6.7 trillion this year to $12 \ntrillion 10 years from now. Instead of achieving ``maximum possible \ndebt retirement,'' the President is asking for historically high debt \nincreases.\n  It is critically important to understand how seriously our economic \nsituation has deteriorated under this administration. When the \nPresident took office, he inherited a 10-year surplus estimated at $5.6 \ntrillion. Now with the policies that he has enacted and the policies \nthat he is proposing--in particular, this very heavily weighted tax cut \nfor the benefit of upper-income people--we will go from projecting a \n$5.6 trillion surplus to projecting a $2.1 trillion deficit over that \nsame period. That is a seismic shift in our position.\n  I want to underscore one other thing that has happened. Twenty years \nago, the United States was a creditor nation, internationally, to the \ntune of about 10 percent of our GDP. So we were in a strong economic \nposition internationally.\n  Now, because of the deterioration of our position over those \nintervening two decades, we are a debtor nation, to the tune of about \n25 percent of our GDP. Again, a seismic shift in our international \nposition, which places us very much in the hands of others. Because we \nare running these huge deficits year-in and year-out, we have become \nenormously, inordinately dependent on the influx of capital from abroad \nin order to sustain ourselves.\n  I am reminded of Tennessee Williams's Blance Dubois in ``A Streetcar \nNamed Desire,'' where she had that wonderful line: ``I have always \ndepended on the kindness of strangers.'' That is what has happened to \nthe United States in the international economic scene. We have \ndeteriorated into this debtor status so that we are now dependent upon \nthe kindness of strangers. That is not where the world's leading power \nshould find itself.\n  Of course, the years since President Bush took office had been \ndifficult. The economic downturn, combined with the attacks of \nSeptember 11 and the war with Iraq, have contributed to the decline in \nFederal revenues that have led to the need to increase the debt limit. \nAnother cause of that decline as the massive tax cut the President \npushed through in 2001. As many of us said at the time, enacting such a \nlarge tax cut based on optimistic projections of a surplus that may \nnever appear was the height of recklessness.\n  But the recklessness we saw in 2001 may actually be exceeded by what \nwe are seeing today. Now, we are facing massive deficits, not \nsurpluses. In fact, CBO's most recent projection is for a deficit of \nover $300 billion this year, the largest one-year deficit in our \nNation's history. The Treasury Department recently reported a deficit \nof over $200 billion in the first 7 months of fiscal year 2003, more \nthan three times the level at this point last year. We are so deeply in \ndebt that we are being called upon to raise the debt limit by almost a \ntrillion dollars. This increase comes on top of a $450 billion increase \njust last year. Our debt is skyrocketing with no end in sight.\n  Despite the change in our fiscal circumstances, the President is \npushing for exactly the same economic policy he put forward in 2001: \nyet another round of massive tax cuts skewed toward the wealthy. Our \ncolleagues across the aisle have been in such a hurry to enact this \nlarge tax cut that they chose to pass it through the Senate ahead of \nconsideration of the debt limit, as if trillions of dollars in Federal \ndebt is irrelevant to the decision to cut taxes.\n  Our economy is facing serious difficulties. Over the past six months, \nwe have grown at an average rate of only 1\\1/2\\ percent, far less \ngrowth than what we ought to experience. Unemployment is up to 6.0 \npercent; it has not been higher since July 1994.\n  Despite these realities, the administration has not yet supported \nsensible economic programs, but has continued to push for massive new \ntax cuts, skewed towards the very wealthiest Americans, which will \nleave us with record deficits and debt. The increase in Federal debt \nthat we are considering today will have a real impact on our economy, \nputting upward pressure on interest rates, and siphoning off resources \nthat could be used for other purposes simply to pay the interest on our \ndebt.\n  What we need is responsible approaches to put our economy back on \ntrack, not another round of massive tax cuts to benefit the wealthiest \namong us. Senator Daschle and other Democratic leaders have offered a \nresponsible package that would create twice as many jobs as the \nPresident's package over the remainder of this year, extend \nunemployment insurance\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\nbenefits, and provide aid to State and local governments to forestall \ndevastating program cuts and tax increases on millions of Americans. \nThis alternative would provide over one million jobs at only a fraction \nof the cost of the President's proposal or those put forth by \nCongressional Republicans. It would create real jobs and economic \ngrowth without mortgaging our future through tremendous increases in \ndeficits and debt.\n  The fact that the President is pushing for massive tax cuts at the \nsame time the Congress is being asked to add almost a trillion dollars \nto the Federal debt ceiling is beyond reckless--it places in jeopardy \nour future economic strength and the economic security of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is ironic that on the same day that the \nRepublican majority passed a huge tax cut package that will cost, \nwithout the gimmicks, up to a trillion dollars over the next 10 years, \nthey also are asking us to raise the limit on the national debt by $984 \nbillion, which would be the largest increase in our Nation's history.\n  Just 2 years ago, the President asserted that passage of his massive \n$1.4 trillion in tax cuts would still allow us to eliminate our \npublicly held debt by 2008. Under the budget resolution that was passed \nrecently, it's estimated that our publicly held debt will be over $5 \ntrillion by 2008. So, under this Administration's fiscal policies, we \nhave gone from an estimate of zero in publicly held debt in 2008 to an \nestimate over $5 trillion in publicly held debt in 2008. That's an \nastounding reversal by any measure.\n  The President also said that his past tax cuts would create jobs. \nThat doesn't jibe with the fact that we've lost 2.7 million private \nsector jobs since President Bush took office, many of those since his \nlast tax program was adopted.\n  We need to increase the debt limit, but we need to do it in a \nfiscally responsible way. Instead of increasing it by a trillion \ndollars, let's make the increase more reasonable, like the $350 billion \nincrease that Senator Baucus is advocating. This will give us the \nopportunity to assess our fiscal policies sooner rather than later, to \nreview our economic situation prior to making significant decisions \nwhich could harm us down the road. In light of our struggling economy \nand the huge deficit ditch that we find ourselves in, an opportunity \nfor review sooner rather than later is essential to the economic and \nfiscal health of our Nation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the vote that \njust took place to increase the debt ceiling.\n  The national debt is growing larger and larger, and yet just several \nhours ago the Senate passed another massive irresponsible tax cut that \nwill add to our debt and lead this Nation down a fiscally perilous \npath.\n  Two years ago, the President assured the Nation that if we adopted \nhis tax cut, we would see job growth, and we would still be able to \neliminate the publicly held debt by 2008. The result was far from this.\n  In the more than 2 years that he has been President, 2.7 million jobs \nhave been lost, and we are now having to increase the debt to $7.384 \ntrillion, an increase of $984 billion--almost $1 trillion. This is the \nlargest debt increase in the history of our country.\n  The debt limit was last increased on June 28 of last year by $450 \nbillion. Prior to that increase, the limit had not been raised since \nAugust 1997.\n  The administration's request to raise the debt limit by almost $1 \ntrillion confirms that it is unwise to make long-term commitments to \ntax cuts based on shaky projections and gimmicks. I truly think this \nincrease is a mistake, and for that reason I voted against the debt \nlimit increase.\n  Just several hours ago, the Senate approved a $350 billion tax cut \nthat will further deteriorate our fiscal outlook. It will worsen the \nalready skyrocketing deficit and our national debt.\n  Increasing deficits will decrease national savings and increase long-\nterm interest rates, which effectively lowers the incomes of working \nAmericans. Also, the national debt is not free. The hard working men \nand women in this country have to pay interest on the debt for decades, \nand when the deficit is high, it requires so much Federal borrowing \nthat it displaces private investment and pushes up interest rates on \nmortgages, consumer credit, business borrowing, and capital investment. \nThis in turn leads to less private investment, which reduces the size \nof the economy and future standards of living in the long run.\n  There are consequences to our actions, and yet the administration and \nthe majority of this Congress are turning a blind eye to these \nconsequences.\n  We unfortunately are in a position where we have to increase the \ndebt, because we do not want to see the country in default. But we \nshould be doing it in a responsible manner which is why I voted in \nsupport of an amendment which would have increased the debt limit by \n$350 billion.\n  An amendment was also proposed today that would have prohibited the \nTreasury Department from disinvesting the Social Security trust fund to \nstay under the debt limit. This amendment would have kept the Social \nSecurity trust fund safe for our retirees, and yet it was defeated by \nthis body under the leadership of the majority party.\n  I believe we have a responsibility in the Senate to always do what is \nright for future generations. I think that the tax cut that was passed \nearlier today, and the debt increase that was passed several moments \nago, fails to take the needs and hopes of future generations into \nconsideration.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, President Bush inherited the strongest \neconomy in history and has run it into the ground. When he took office \nin January 2001, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, was forecasting \na cumulative, 10-year budget surplus of $5.6 trillion. Now, the CBO is \nforecasting a 10-year deficit of $2.1 trillion.\n  You can't mangle the economy that badly by accident; it has to be by \ndesign.\n  The design is something that President Bush's father once called \n``voodoo economics.'' The theory behind ``voodoo economics'' is that \nmassive tax cuts for the wealthiest among us will somehow ``stimulate'' \nthe economy.\n  The theory should be discredited by now. It certainly didn't work in \n2001. Since the 2001 tax cuts, unemployment has risen by nearly 50 \npercent. Two point seven million Americans have lost their private \nsector jobs under the Bush administration; that is about 3,100 people \neach and every day since he took office, 129 people each and every \nhour, or more than 2 people each and every minute.\n  And yet, as Ronald Reagan would say, ``there you go again.'' Just a \nshort while ago, the Republicans passed another ill-advised tax cut \nskewed to the rich, this one costing $318 billion over 10 years.\n  The only people who will get jobs under the reconciliation bill the \nRepublicans just adopted are lawyers and accountants. As Warren Buffett \nput it the other day in the Washington Post, ``Overall, it's hard to \nconceive of anything sillier than the schedule the Senate has laid out. \n. . . The manipulation of enactment and sunset dates of tax changes is \nEnron-style account-\ning . . .''\n  Mr. Buffett went on to point out that ``giving one class of taxpayer \na `break' requires--now or down the line--that an equivalent burden be \nimposed on other parties.''\n  That brings us to H.J. Res. 51. Apparently without embarrassment, the \nRepublicans are willing to vote for another tax cut at a time when we \nare looking at record budget deficits, and then--on the very same day--\nvote for the biggest debt ceiling increase in history, $984 billion.\n  The Republicans' strategy has been to back up the consideration of \nH.J. Res. 51 so that it is the only thing standing between us and the \nMemorial Day recess. They want to pass it with as little debate and as \nquickly as possible.\n  They certainly don't want to amend it. That would send it back to the \nHouse, which would be a problem. House Republicans didn't have the \ncourage--and probably didn't have the votes--to pass H.J. Res. 51. So, \nin a bit of legerdemain that would make President Bush's close friend \nKen Lay proud, they ``deemed'' themselves to have passed it as part of \nthe fiscal year 2004 budget resolution.\n  Let me try to put this debt ceiling increase in perspective. \nPresident Bush wants $984 billion. That is more than the total debt \noutstanding when Ronald Reagan took office. In other words,\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nit took this country 200 years to get its debt up to the amount that \nPresident Bush wants to add in the 11 months since the last debt \nceiling increase.\n  Because of the disciplined economic policies that congressional \nDemocrats and the Clinton administration enacted between 1993 and 2000, \nthe debt ceiling stayed at $5.95 trillion from 1997 to 2001. Debt held \nby the public actually declined from $3.7 trillion to $3.3 trillion.\n  President Bush's ``voodoo economics'' necessitated a debt ceiling \nincrease for the first time in 5 years to $6.4 trillion last June and \nnow he is back for another $984 billion.\n  In essence, President Bush inherited a ``credit card'' with a $5.95 \ntrillion ``limit.'' He wanted to borrow more to pay for his first round \nof tax cuts, so he went to the ``bank''--which I call the Bank of Our \nChildren's Future--and got a credit increase last June. But it wasn't \nenough, so he is back again, asking for another, bigger credit \nincrease.\n  But here's the rub: we all get stuck paying his bill. Right now, that \nbill is over $22,200 for every man, woman, and child in America. \nPresident Bush wants to add another $3,400 to your share of the bill in \none fell swoop. For a family of four, that is a total of $102,400.\n  And don't forget: when you run up charges on your credit card and \ndon't pay the balance in full, you get stuck paying interest, too. For \nthat family of four, the interest cost would add another $33,000 over \nthe next 10 years.\n  President Bush just can't wait to get that credit increase so he can \npay for his newest tax cuts. That is why I think we should stamp credit \ncard ``Over the Limit.''\n  I think it is important that each and every American understand what \nis at stake here.\n  Each year, when Americans get their Social Security account \nstatements, I think those statements ought to include, in plain \nlanguage, information about the public debt, each person's share of \nthat debt, and the extent to which the Social Security trust fund is \nbeing raided.\n  Then, they can make an informed decision about whether they want tax \ncuts that do nothing to help the economy but do contribute to budget \ndeficits ``as far as the eye can see'' and put a knife to the throat of \nSocial Security, Medicare, and other vital programs.\n  I don't have the time today to discuss why the President and his \nRepublican allies in Congress are pushing policies that deliberately \ncause deficits; suffice it to say, for now, that it is part of their \ngrand strategy to cripple government permanently.\n  I will have more to say about that on another day.\n  In the interim, I urge my colleagues to vote against bailing out the \nBush administration and its allies here in the House and Senate. They \nhave mishandled our economy in a monumental way. People ought to be \ninformed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 833\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 833.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the amount by which the statutory limit on the \n                       public debt is increased)\n\n       Strike ``7,384,000,000,000'' and insert: \n     ``6,750,000,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is simple. This amendment \nwould reduce the amount by which we are raising the debt limit to $350 \nbillion. That is $634 billion less than the underlying bill.\n  The legislation the House sent to us would raise the debt limit by \n$984 billion. That would be the largest debt limit increase in history. \nThe previous record was $915 billion in 1990, under President George \nHerbert Walker Bush.\n  The average of the five debt ceiling increases since 1990 has been \n$450 billion. Plainly, the debt limit increase in the bill before us is \nout of proportion with recent precedent.\n  We should not raise the debt limit by so much. We should increase it \nby an amount significantly smaller than $984 billion.\n  It is very easy to explain why we have a smaller increase. It is \nbecause we are living in uncertain times, unpredictable times. I have \nsort of a pet theory that increases in technology, particularly \ncommunications technology, which makes our society much more complex \nand uncertain--not only for the U.S. but for the world--and we are \nexperiencing the effects of actions in the world, from terrorism and \nSARS--make it difficult for the U.S. to rely on the best of \nprojections.\n  The best of projections indicate that the fiscal condition of the \ncountry is unhealthy for both the current year and future years. This \nis especially troubling because the baby boom generation will begin to \nretire in a few short years. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid \nexpenditures will soar, putting enormous strains on the Federal budget.\n  And new projections of even the short run keep showing conditions \nworsening, even when only a short time has elapsed since the previous \nestimate. Most recently, the CBO increased its forecast of the current \nyear deficit by more than $55 billion. That is over just 2 months. If \nyou project that out, that means in a year--6 times 55--that is about a \n$330 billion difference.\n  Under these circumstances, Congress should reexamine the fiscal \nsituation later this year. To ensure that this occurs, the size of the \ndebt limit increase must be significantly smaller than $984 billion. We \ncannot wait until next year--late next year or in the summer of next \nyear as contemplated by the underlying proposal--to examine and \nreexamine our budgetary problems. A $984 billion debt limit increase is \njust not responsible.\n  I made the credit card analogy a couple of times. I will say it once \nagain. A $984 billion debt limit increase is like a family that wants \nthe credit card bill to come only once a year. If the credit card bill \ncame only once a year, the family might well not talk about the family \nbudget quite so often. As a result, they would probably not maintain as \ngood control of the budget as they would with a monthly statement. \nThere is reason the bank sends bills more frequently, sends statements \nout monthly. It ensures more frequent review of the debt limit. That is \nall my amendment would require. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, the fact is, it is great to talk about all \nthe options, but the Treasury faces a payment obligation in late May. \nThat cannot be met without an increase in the statutory debt limit. If \nwe amend the resolution, we will have to go back to the House of \nRepresentatives and possibly require a conference that would delay it \nuntil June. We cannot wait until June. The Secretary made it clear. He \nhas taken all prudent and legal steps to avoid reaching the statutory \ndebt limit. Treasury will only provide room until May 28, as I have \nsaid, next Wednesday, in the middle of the Memorial Day recess period \nwhen Congress will be out of town. Failure to act puts in jeopardy over \n$40 billion in Social Security and Medicare benefits the first week in \nJune. I repeat, we have no choice. We must act today.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 29 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to make clear that I have not heard \none substantive reason against this, not one. Rather, the argument \nagainst this is the House is gone. We all know the House has gone \nbecause they do not want to vote on this issue. They planned to have \nthe Senate bring the debt limit up at this time. The House planned to \nleave before the debt limit came up. They planned that so they do not \nhave to vote on the issue. The other side plans to vote down all \namendments so they do not have to go back to the House. It is a \ngimmick. It is a game.\n  There is not one word of substance as to why we should not have a \nsmaller\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\ndebt ceiling rather than a full year. I think it is time to call it as \nit is and explain what has happened here. What I explained is what is \nhappening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have one comment. The fact that the \nSecretary of the Treasury cannot meet the bills before we come back is \npretty good evidence, and I hope we vote that way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back my time. I believe the yeas \nand nays have already been ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 833. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 197 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Byrd\n       \n  The amendment (No. 833) was rejected.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. These are important amendments. I believe Senators should \nlisten to debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes and enter \ninto a colloquy on a very important subject with the senior Senator \nfrom Connecticut.\n  I yield to him for that purpose.\n\n\n                     Asbestos Lawsuits Legislation\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, yesterday there were reports in the stock \nmarket that companies facing asbestos-related lawsuits had falling \nstock prices, some of them rather precipitously, in the New York stock \nexchange. USG fell more than $2, 17 percent; Georgia Pacific, Crown \nHoldings, R.W. Grace, and on and on, companies that have the potential \nof significant lawsuits.\n  The Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Utah and the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, as well as the Senator from Delaware, are trying to pull \na bill together. We have not done that yet.\n  I thought it important before we leave on this break to express to \nour colleagues that we are working very hard to come up with a \ncompromise proposal on the asbestos issue. We have taken major steps in \nthat direction, working with organized labor, with the insurance \nindustry, with the insured, and many others that have a stakeholding in \nthe outcome of this particular effort. It is a critically important \neffort.\n  We say to those out there wondering whether or not we will be able to \nget a bill, we believe we will. It will take time. It is hard work to \npull this together properly. It is a lot of detailed work that needs to \nbe done. We thought it was important to send a message to those \ninterested in the subject matter that we are confident it can be done. \nWe will have to work very hard in the coming days, particularly over \nthis break, to try to resolve the differences that exist, and they are \nnot insignificant. We believe there is such good will on the part of \nall to resolve this matter that it is in our interests to spend the \ntime and effort.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, who has \nbeen tremendously helpful and productive in working with us. I yield to \nhim for any comments he may want to make. We are all determined to get \na bill. We believe we can get that done. It will take hard work.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut \nfor his words. We need to come together to craft effective legislation. \nIf we do, we will resolve this asbestos litigation crisis.\n  The senior Senator from Connecticut has done yeoman service in \nbringing together the affected industries--the insurance companies, \nlabor, and others--in meeting after meeting. I convened the first \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing last September on asbestos \nlitigation. We wanted to begin a bipartisan dialog about the best way \nto provide fair and efficient compensation, both to current victims and \nthose yet to come.\n  Since last fall we have learned a lot about the harm wreaked by \nasbestos exposure. The victims continue to suffer, the numbers continue \nto grow, but the businesses involved in the litigation, along with \ntheir employees and their retirees, are suffering from the economic \nuncertainty surrounding this issue.\n  More than 50 companies have filed for bankruptcy because of asbestos-\nrelated bills. We have a lose-lose situation. The victims who deserve \nfair compensation do not receive it, and the bankrupt companies cannot \ncreate new jobs or invest in the economy. That is why Senator Dodd and \nI have been working for months with Senator Hatch, Senator Carper, \nSenator Nelson, Senator DeWine, and others trying to bring together \nindustry and labor and others for a national trust fund solution. The \nsummit Senator Dodd had last month of all the stakeholders is bringing \nthem closer together to find common ground.\n  We have made great progress since that summit. I have heard from all \nthe parties involved since Senator Dodd brought them together. They \nfound that some of the differences they had started to go away. \nChairman Hatch has worked hard drafting asbestos legislation. He put in \na draft yesterday.\n  I agreed to take all these cases, if we can, out of the tort system, \nand establish a national trust fund. I agree the national trust fund \nhas to contain medical criteria to quickly compensate legitimate \nvictims and weed out frivolous claims. Our effort is so unprecedented \nthat we have to work closely together.\n  I close with this: The only kind of legislation that will pass \nthrough here this year or next is going to be consensus legislation. If \nwe are going to have consensus legislation, we must all continue to \nwork on a final plan. We are not there yet. We are getting closer. We \nare still not there.\n  I commend the Senators on both sides of the aisle. We will work \ntogether throughout the recess in the hopes we can get back to that.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if I may just conclude, I thank again the \nSenator from Vermont for his comments. He has outlined this very well. \nIt must truly be a no fault system. It must be truly no fault so both \nindustry as well as victims have certainty. Medical criteria, medical \nmonitoring--a variety of other provisions must be part of the effort.\n  Those are major agreements that have already been struck. Getting \ndown to the details is the hard part. We are confident it will happen. \nIt will require a lot of work. It can't be done on the fly, if we are \ngoing to take the unprecedented step dealing with the asbestos issue.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 834\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have an amendment at the desk. I ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 834.\n\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Social Security cost-\n              of-living adjustments should not be reduced)\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Without Social Security, \n     forty-eight percent of beneficiaries would be in poverty \n     today.\n       (2) In order to protect benefit levels against inflation, \n     Social Security beneficiaries receive an annual cost-of-\n     living adjustment (COLA) based on Consumer Price Index for \n     Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).\n       (3) The January 2003 COLA provided only a 1.4 percent \n     increase in Social Security benefits, increasing the average \n     monthly benefit for all retired workers by only $13 (from \n     $882 to 895).\n       (4) Annual growth in Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket \n     health care costs for retired individuals on fixed incomes \n     far exceeded the small COLA increases provided to Social \n     Security beneficiaries.\n       (5) Reducing COLAs will disproportionately harm low-income \n     Social Security beneficiaries and push millions of seniors \n     into poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Social Security cost-of-living adjustments should not be \n     reduced.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that there be a 10-minute \ntimeframe, equally divided, with no second-degree amendments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I cannot hear the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator restate his unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I asked first that the amendment be considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Are we talking about the time limit? I objected to the \ntime limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. We \ndispensed with the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. Daschle. I then asked that the amendment be considered under a \ntime limit of 10 minutes, equally divided, with no second degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order so we can \nhear all Senators who request to speak.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I just want to ask my leader if he can \ngive me 60 seconds in the debate to speak in favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Since we are not working under a time agreement, I will \nbe happy to provide whatever time the Senator may require.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for his generosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we all understand how critical the \nSocial Security Program is to senior citizens. It is now estimated that \n48 percent of all seniors today would live in poverty were it not for \nSocial Security. It is a critical program for all of us and for our \nparents.\n  It is a program of extraordinary import to people in rural and urban \nareas alike. Obviously, over the course of the years, the Social \nSecurity Administration has seen fit to offer cost-of-living \nadjustments in order to ensure that the purchasing power of our seniors \nis not eroded. Every year, that cost-of-living adjustment is based on \nthe consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers.\n  Unfortunately, over the last couple of years, that index has been \nvery low. As a matter of fact, in 2003 the cost-of-living allowance \nprovided only a 1.4 percent increase in Social Security benefits. That \namounts to an average monthly benefit of about $13, from $882 to $895. \nThe growth in the Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket health care costs \nfor retired individuals on fixed incomes far exceeded that meager cost-\nof-living adjustment.\n  So we find ourselves in a situation where a number of our colleagues \nhave suggested that perhaps one way to deal with what they call Social \nSecurity reform is to reduce the cost-of-living adjustment; in fact, in \nsome cases to eliminate the cost-of-living adjustment.\n\n  That is the purpose of this amendment. As we consider increasing the \ndebt limit by $894 billion, as we consider all of the different \napproaches to how we are going to reduce that debt, there is a growing \nnumber of those who are suggesting that perhaps one way to do it is to \nlimit benefits under the Social Security Administration.\n  This amendment simply says, as we consider all of the options, let us \nat least agree on one thing. Let us at least agree that we are not \ngoing to touch the cost-of-living allowance for seniors when that \nallowance is only $13, on average, if we look at the last couple of \nyears.\n  It is a simple amendment. It is a reaffirmation, however, of the \nimportance of Social Security, our affirmation of the importance of \nmaintaining the Social Security purchasing power, our affirmation of \nthe importance of a cost-of-living adjustment. That is all it is. \nCertainly it is directly relevant as we consider the implications of \nraising the debt limit by some $894 billion.\n  I hope we can get unanimous support for an amendment of this kind, \nand I yield the floor and yield such time as the Senator from \nCalifornia may require--I yield the floor and, since we are not working \nunder a time agreement, I recognize I cannot yield the floor for a \ncertain time so I just yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will not be long at all, but I just \nwant to support this amendment by my leader, Senator Daschle. It is \nreally simple. It says it is the sense of the Senate that Social \nSecurity recipients should not be denied their cost-of-living \nadjustment.\n  We have just, unfortunately, passed the tax break for the wealthiest \nfew in this country. It is astounding to me, it is sad to me, to think \nthat those in this country who work hard every single day, the average \nAmerican family, maybe will get $100--but, by the way, probably might \nnot even get that much--whereas the millionaires, the people who seem \nto touch the heartstrings of the Republicans, are going to get \nthousands of dollars every single year. And by some magic--magic--this \nis going to create jobs.\n  We have been there and we have done that. What do my Republican \nfriends say now? Oh, my God, we just did the tax break for the wealthy \nfew. We had better increase the debt burden on all Americans so we can \nreally come through with our promise. This debt, this additional debt \nis almost $1 trillion more.\n  What is my leader saying? He is saying: At least, at the minimum, \nthere are a few things we should hold dear. One of those is a \ncommitment to the people who are on Social Security. If my colleagues \nvote no against this--and, by the way, what an excuse they have: The \nHouse has gone home.\n  Well, too bad. Let the Speaker of the House bring back the people of \nthe House. Let the Republican Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert, \nbring back the people of the House to vote for the people of this \ncountry. What an excuse. They are going to vote no, and they are going \nto go home and say: I was really for you, but I had to vote no because \nif I voted yes, then Denny Hastert would have had to bring back the \npeople who represent you in the House.\n\n  It is time we stood up here for the people, not the wealthiest, the \nmillionaires, and giving excuses as to why what you are doing here is \ngood for the people.\n  I support my leader, and I will support a number of amendments here \nto keep a commitment to the average working families, and to seniors, \nand the children of this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from South Dakota has merit. I support the \namendment. However, the adoption of the amendment to the resolution \nwill require it to be sent back to the House, which\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\nwould delay the increase in the statutory debt ceiling and jeopardize \nthe payment on time of benefits such as Social Security and Medicare, \nas well as meeting Government obligations. Ironically, it probably has \nmore threat to payments on Social Security than not doing it.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be withdrawn, \nthat upon the passage of H.J. Res. 51, the withdrawn amendment be \nconsidered offered as an original resolution, that the Senate proceed \nto immediate consideration of the resolution, that it be deemed to have \nbeen read three times and, without intervening debate or motion, the \nresolution be deemed agreed to and the motion to reconsider be deemed \nto be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I object.\n  Madam President, if I could be heard on the objection, we have no \nobjection to taking up the legislation freestanding. But because of the \nintricate relationship between Social Security and increasing the debt \nlimit, we see no reason to separate these. This should be an amendment \non debt limit. I believe the House ought to take up this matter. There \nis no reason why they can't vote on it this morning. There is no reason \nwhy this can't be addressed prior to the end of the week. We hope we \ncan have a vote, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask for a count.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  Mr. NICKELS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, a vote in favor of the amendment offered \nby my colleague, Mr. Daschle, would prevent timely enactment of H.J. \nRes. 51. Swift passage of a clean bill allows the measure to move as \nquickly as possible to the President for his signature. Any delay will \nlead to a default on the national debt and the inability of our \ngovernment to meet its financial obligations, including its obligation \nto pay Social Security checks on time.\n  With the House adjourned for the Memorial Day recess, I am concerned \nthat any further delay in enactment of the debt limit bill will cause \nSocial Security beneficiaries to receive their monthly checks much \nlater than scheduled. While I agree with Senator Daschle that the COLA \nshould not be reduced, ironically, his amendment would immediately hurt \nthose seniors for whom Social Security is a lifeline by delaying \nreceipt of their checks. I would never vote to cut or tax Social \nSecurity benefits. With far too many seniors on limited budgets, I \ncannot support adoption of an amendment that could lead to a delay in \nthe delivery of these vital benefits.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I have just a couple of comments.\n  This resolution says please don't cut cost-of-living adjustments on \nSocial Security. No one in either House--either body--contemplated \ncutting COLAs. Our colleague from Wyoming said we are willing to pass \nthis but pass it freestanding--not as an amendment to the debt limit.\n  Just so we know what the facts are, the House worked really late last \nnight--until 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning, and they have left \ntown. So we have to pass a debt limit clean. If we don't pass it clean, \nyou are jeopardizing Social Security. You are jeopardizing Medicare.\n  We should do exactly what the Senator from Wyoming said. Let us pass \nthis freestanding and not as an amendment to the debt limit.\n  The Senator from Wyoming asked unanimous consent to pass this \nseparately from the debt limit. That was objected to by the Democrat \nleader.\n  I will just tell our colleagues that it is our intention to table \nthis amendment at this point, because for whatever reason--political \npurposes--they want a rollcall vote. Just to tell our colleagues, when \nwe conclude passage of the debt limit, we will pass this freestanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to table the amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: I thought the \nyeas and nays had already been ordered on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays were ordered on the \nunderlying amendment. That does not preclude a motion to table.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I state an inquiry? Would it be possible under the \nrules of the Senate to hear from our leader for 1 minute since this \ntables his amendment and he has not had a chance to say why it is being \ntabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is possible by unanimous consent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would so move.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  The clerk will call the roll on agreeing to the motion.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 198 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Byrd\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Massachusetts has agreed \nto 15 minutes equally divided on this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We would like to have 12 minutes on our side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this is an issue with which this body \nshould be familiar, the whole issue of unemployment compensation. Let \nme tell you exactly what this proposal does. It has two parts. First of \nall, it extends the current program of 13 weeks of benefits until \nDecember 31, just as the House did last night by a vote of 409 to 19. \nThat is what the House passed last night. That is one of the two \nprovisions.\n  The second provision is it provides 13 weeks of benefits to the long-\nterm unemployed who have exhausted their benefits and still cannot find \na job. That is $2.5 billion. The total cost is $9 billion.\n  Madam President, just to review very quickly, we have 8.8 million \nunemployed. We have 2.8 million job openings. These are the figures \nfrom the Department of Labor. So, obviously, it has been very difficult \nfor millions of Americans who have held unemployment compensation to \ncontinue to be able to find any jobs, so they have exhausted their \nbenefits. This particular proposal will provide those benefits for \nabout a million of the unemployed.\n  Madam President, I just draw the attention of the Senate to the \nactions that were taken on a similar issue by Presidents Dwight \nEisenhower, John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, \nRonald Reagan, both Presidents Bush and Bill Clinton. Every one of \nthose Presidents signed extended unemployment compensation--most \nincluded the individuals who had exhausted their unemployment \ncompensation. Every one of those Presidents has done that. That is \nexactly what we are proposing to do here in a modest program, to reach \nthose who have already exhausted their unemployment.\n  I will not take a great deal of time to talk about the hardship many \nunemployed are facing. These are the facts: More than half of the \nunemployed adults have had to postpone medical treatment--57 percent--\nor cut back on the spending for food--56 percent; 1 out of 4 have had \nto move out of their house and move in with friends and relatives; 38 \npercent lost telephone service or are worried about losing their phone; \nand more than a third have had trouble paying their gas or electric \nbills.\n  These are real American families who have worked hard, paid into the \nfund, and are in hard times. The fund itself is in surplus. It can \nafford this kind of a commitment.\n  Finally, when you look at what the Senate has done a few hours ago--\ngiven some $350 billion in tax breaks, primarily to the wealthiest \nindividuals--we are asking for fairness for workers\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\nin this country who need this helping hand. Other Republican and \nDemocrat Presidents have found reasons to do that. That is simply what \nthis amendment is about.\n  The point has been raised: Senator, you have had your vote on this. \nYou have had your vote once, twice, or three times. That is right. We \nare going to have a vote on it four times, five times, six times, or \nseven times until we are able to get this passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the decisions we are making in the Senate \ntoday say a lot about our values, who we are, what we care about. \nEarlier today, the Vice President cast the tie-breaking vote that \nenabled wealthy investors to cut their taxes by tens of billions of \ndollars. It does virtually nothing for ordinary Americans.\n  If you look at this bill, for the next 5 years, the very little help \nworking people get gets smaller and smaller, while the help for people \nwho live off of their wealth gets bigger and bigger.\n  So this bill values wealth over work. It is just that simple. Now we \nhave an amendment from the Senator from Massachusetts that is about \nhelping people who are hurting today. This is not an abstraction. I \nhave been all over this country. Anywhere you go in America, you meet \npeople who are looking for work, and they cannot find it. These are \ngood, salt-of-the-earth people. They want to work. They have worked all \ntheir lives. There is no job available for them. They are trying to \nfeed their families, trying to pay the rent. These are people who \ncannot find a job because this administration--President Bush's \nadministration--has killed over 2 million jobs. They are going from \nfactory to factory and store to store trying to find work--whether it \nis at a textile mill, drycleaner, or McDonald's. They cannot find work. \nThey have been looking for months.\n  So the question for the Senate is very simple: Will we help a million \npeople who are unemployed, through absolutely no fault of their own--\ngood, working people who have worked all their lives? The Senate has \nalready proven today that it cares about the wealthy. Now the question \nis, Do we care about people who have spent months looking for work, who \nhave worked all their lives, who want to take care of their families, \nput food on the table, pay the rent but they cannot find a job? That is \nthe question presented by this amendment. The response will show the \nvalues of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in supporting the \nKennedy amendment. We are trying to help over 1.1 million Americans who \nexhausted their benefits. These are hard-working Americans who paid \ninto the unemployment trust fund. Now is our opportunity to help them. \nI believe it is our obligation. Here is an interesting point on this \nrecession. In the 20th century, the average bottoming out of \nunemployment comes within 15 months of the beginning of the recession, \nbut we have seen 25 months of continuing unemployment. This, indeed, is \nthe longest in terms of the persistence of long-term unemployment that \nwe have seen since the 1930s.\n  These people need our help. The trust fund has the resources. We \nshould vote today to give these people benefits. As Senator Kennedy \npointed out, in every other recession every other President has done \nit. There should be no exception today. If we want to help 1.1 million \nAmericans, just as we helped lots of fortunate Americans today, we \nshould support this amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What are the people to do? They have exhausted their \nunemployment insurance benefits in a labor market that, instead of \nopening up so there are opportunities for jobs, is actually closing \ndown. The unemployment rate has now risen to 6 percent. The number of \nlong-term unemployed is at a near 20-year record. The other side is \ntalking about doing some kind of an extension, but as I understand it, \nthey will not cover exhaustees; is that correct? Is that the Senator's \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. REED. Yes. It is my understanding that 1.1 million Americans have \nexhausted their benefits, and they are still looking. They are well-\ntrained, well-skilled people. The jobs are gone. They want to work. We \nare ignoring them--we are not, but the other side's proposal totally \nignores them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think it is imperative to focus on the fact that we \nhave people who have exhausted their benefits for the time period given \nto them, and they are not able to get a job. The argument is always \nmade that they ought to get out and find a job. That is one of the \npremises of the system. But the job market is getting worse, not \nbetter.\n  Where are they going to find these jobs? How are they going to \nsupport their families? Furthermore, money has been paid into the \nunemployment insurance trust fund to build up a balance in order to \nmake payments when we hit hard economic times.\n  Those surpluses that have been paid in are now about $20 billion. The \npurpose of paying them in to the fund is to draw on them when we hit \neconomic times such as we are now confronting. This economy remains \nsoggy. It is not picking up. We have the very human problem of people \nwho have worked that are now left out. You do not collect unemployment \ninsurance benefits unless you have built up a work record. In order to \nget the benefits, you must have an established work record. So we are \nnot talking about nonworkers. By definition, we are talking about \nworkers, people who have an employment record.\n  Through no fault of their own hard-working people have lost their \njobs because the economy has gone soft. If you are at blame, you do not \nget unemployment; that is another provision of the system. They have \ndrawn unemployment insurance benefits for a limited period of time. \nThey then exhaust them. What are they to do?\n  The answer, ``You ought to go find a job,'' might be an answer in a \ntime when the job market is opening up, but the job market is closing \ndown. The unemployment rate is rising, and the proposal of the able \nSenator from Massachusetts which would encompass these exhaustees is \nextremely important.\n  Furthermore, it would provide an impetus to the economy in providing \nsome stimulus to get the economy moving again.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Will the Senator from Maryland yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly, I yield for a question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I am interested in your----\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor and \nhas yielded for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for a question.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. The Senator's understanding of Senator Kennedy's \namendment. I am concerned with the point you are making because just \ntoday the Boeing Company has announced it is sending warrant notices to \nanother 1,150 employees. We have already had thousands--5,000--bringing \nthe total to 3,000 employees laid off, and now we are hearing about \nanother 1,100 today who will receive layoff notices probably in June or \nJuly.\n  This amendment would cover both employees--those who have already \nexhausted their benefits and employees who, in the next several months, \nwill run out of benefits; is that your understanding?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is my understanding, but the Senator makes a very \nimportant point in the context in which she presented it. Typically, \nafter the earlier layoffs that the Senator talked about at Boeing, the \neconomy would have picked up again. Boeing would have resumed work and \nwould have started hauling people back in off of the unemployment rolls \nand putting them back to work.\n  The fact that they are now laying off additional people confronts us \nwith providing for them, which the extension the other side is talking \nabout may do, but it does not provide for going back and picking up the \nprevious people who were laid off and who have exhausted their \nbenefits.\n  The economy is not working the way it has traditionally worked. It is \na very serious concern. The earlier people, instead of being called \nback because\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\nBoeing's job orders are picking up, in fact confront a situation in \nwhich Boeing is now laying off even more people.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank the Senator for that clarification because that \nis the point.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. We have to take care of those who have lost their \nbenefits. The reason we should do that is your very point in your \nclarification that it is not getting better. I thank you for your \nclarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may only yield for questions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Have we answered the able Senator's question, I hope, \nin the course of this discussion?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Will the Senator from Maryland yield for an additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. As I look at the proposal of the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the specific financial hardships of unemployment, is \nit the position of the Senator from Maryland that in the absence of \nextending unemployment benefits to those who have already exhausted \ntheir benefits, there is no opportunity on the horizon for them to have \nincome because the jobs are just not there?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Exactly. These people, in effect, will fall off the \ncliff, and they are hard-working people. They would not have gotten the \nunemployment benefits to begin with if they had not had a job record, I \nsay to the able Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Does the Senator from Maryland have any idea how many \nof the people who have exhausted their benefits have children in their \nhomes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I do not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is yielding for a question.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Would it surprise the Senator from Maryland that the \nnumber of parents who have been unemployed for 6 months or longer has \nincreased 245 percent?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think that is consistent with the economic slowdown--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. Senators are \nreminded to address questions through the Chair.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, if I can continue in this line of \nquestioning with the Senator from Maryland. Is the Senator from \nMaryland aware that in the year 2000, there were approximately 176,000 \nlong-term unemployed parents but that last month there were 607,000?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I did not know the exact figures but I knew there has \nbeen a very significant increase. That reflects the broader fact that \nthe number of the long-term unemployed has now risen, not just parents, \nwhich was the thrust of the Senator's question, but the number of long-\nterm unemployed has risen to just under 2 million. These are the \nhighest numbers we have had in almost 10 years.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Is it correct that the Senator from Massachusetts----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, a further question to the Senator from \nMaryland: Is it correct that in previous years with previous Presidents \nand Congresses, the concern about long-term unemployment has let us, as \na nation, provide benefits for those people who have exhausted their \nsource of income and cannot find a job?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is my understanding, and it is further my \nunderstanding that the extensions which have been done thus far in this \nrecession compare very poorly with what was consistently done in \nprevious economic downturns under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations. It is a very marked contrast that the response this \ntime to the unemployed problem falls far short of what occurred in \nprevious economic downturns.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Finally, Madam President, to the Senator from Maryland, \nis the Senator from Maryland aware that the rate at which people are \nexhausting their unemployment benefits, without finding a job in this \njobless economy that we are currently experiencing, was at its highest \nlevel ever recorded in February and its second highest level ever \nrecorded in March, and that for 23 straight months the private sector \nhas lost jobs, the longest stretch since World War II; is the Senator \nfrom Maryland aware of that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is a very dramatic statement of what is happening \nout there in terms of the shrinking of the job market and the \nincredibly difficult situation in which the unemployed find themselves. \nAs the Senator has emphasized in particular, those who are parents are \nconfronted with how they are going to provide for the needs of their \nfamilies. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to, if I can, ask the Senator a question as \nwell. Is the Senator aware that there are 18,000 members of the Armed \nForces who have left the military and are now unemployed?\n  These are men and women who were serving in the military in recent \ntimes, are now unemployed, are now depending upon unemployment \ncompensation, brave men and women who served this country gallantly and \nare now dependent upon unemployment compensation. They will be at risk \nas well.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In response to the Senator's question, that is just \nanother dimension with respect to this problem. This problem really \nreaches throughout our society. As the able Senator from North Carolina \nstated earlier, he is encountering it all across the country. The \nformer military personnel bring another dramatic dimension to this \nproblem and the necessity, in my view, to enact the amendment the \nSenator from Massachusetts has offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. This has been a very interesting dialog, but it has \nabsolutely nothing to do with this bill. Yesterday we made a unanimous \nconsent request to pass a clean extension of unemployment compensation. \nThe House has now passed a bill. We will ask unanimous consent again to \npass a clean extension of unemployment compensation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will not yield. We have voted on this three times \nalready this year. Some people on the other side say this is such a \ngreat issue, we are just going to get to vote on it a lot, and so now \nthey offer it on a debt limit bill. Incidentally, they happen to know \nthe House has already left. They know we have to pass a clean debt \nlimit bill. They know a budget point of order lies against it. They \nknow it is nothing but political gamesmanship.\n  I told our colleagues yesterday that they jeopardized passing a clean \nextension of unemployment comp. We could have done it yesterday. I hope \nwe can do it today. Instead, they do not want to pass just a clean \nextension, they want to increase the program.\n  This amendment we are looking at today is a little different than the \namendment we looked at last time. It has not had a hearing. It has not \nbeen vetted. It is not the bill that passed the House. The House has \nalready left town. So if my colleagues want to do something to help \npeople who are losing their unemployment compensation, they have to \npass the House bill--and they are not in session, they have left. So \nwe----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. No, I am not yielding.\n  If we take this modification, this change, on the debt limit bill, it \nwill complicate the debt limit bill. If we amend unemployment comp that \nwe are going to try to pass later by unanimous consent, that will not \npass. We want to provide assistance to them, and we can pass a clean \nextension for the next 7 months. That happens to be nearly the same \nthing the Senator from New York and I did in January. It happens to be \nnearly the same thing the Senator from New York and I did last \nNovember.\n  So if my colleagues want to help people who have lost their \nunemployment benefits, we can pass a clean extension. We are not going \nto pass a major expansion, as this amendment would propose. This \namendment would allow some people to receive 59 weeks of benefits--of \nunemployment comp. We are not going to do it. I will tell my colleagues \nthat right now. So they can make all the speeches they want, but some \nof us want to pass this bill and move on.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Byrd) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 199 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Byrd\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask before the next vote that we have \n10-minute votes in the future. I ask unanimous consent the following \nvotes be 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The next amendment we have in order is that offered by \nSenator Feingold, but Senator Kennedy is here, wishing to present a \nunanimous consent request.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, just for the information of our \ncolleagues, I think we stated this before, but I want to repeat it. It \nis our intention to ask unanimous consent to pass the House-passed bill \non unemployment compensation upon completion of the debt limit \nextension. It is also our intention again to ask unanimous consent to \npass the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that the Senate would not \ncurtail COLAs. No one was planning on doing it, but because we had an \namendment earlier I think we want to clarify that. We will pass both of \nthose on freestanding items upon completion of the debt limit \nextension.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, having listened to the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent the Senate proceed to the consideration of the House \nunemployment compensation bill, H.R. 2185, which the House passed last \nnight by a vote of 409 to 19, that the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and the \npreceding all occur without intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, we are in the process, I think the Senator from \nMassachusetts knows, of trying to clear that on this side of the aisle. \nThe Senator from Oklahoma has indicated we expect to be able to pass \nthe House-passed unemployment extension later in the day. We cannot, \nhowever, clear it at this particular moment. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just to repeat, I tried to do that yesterday, and the \nSenator from Massachusetts objected--or somebody from the other side of \nthe aisle objected. I just want to make that point as well. Some of us \ntried to pass a clean extension yesterday and I urged my colleagues to \ndo it and it was objected to. Now we have had a couple of votes. I hope \nwe can clear it and will pass the House-passed bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, the objection is \ncoming from the Republican side to the bill that passed last night in \nthe House of Representatives 409 to 19. We are prepared. We believe it \nshould include exhaustees. But we want to find the earliest time to let \nthose people who are unemployed know that the Senate is going to be \nresponsive. It passed last night. We are asking now that it be passed \nright now.\n  If there is going to be an objection by the Republican leadership, \nthe Record ought to reflect that. We are prepared.\n  This is our first priority--to say to those who are receiving \nunemployment compensation that they will continue to receive it.\n  Do I understand there has been an objection by the Republican \nleadership?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Otherwise, I renew the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection was heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the majority be willing to enter into a \ntime agreement on the amendment offered by Senator Feingold in relation \nto pay-go? He has agreed to 15 minutes on our side. I ask that in the \nform of a unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Reserving the right to object, 15 minutes on that side. \nHow much on this side?\n  Mr. REID. Whatever you want--15 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Ten minutes on this side would be more than sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield for the purpose of a question.\n  Mr. REID. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma wouldn't yield for \na question that I wanted to ask earlier but he said the reason we can't \namend this bill even a little bit is because the House was not here. I \nask my friend from Wisconsin: Does he think it would be a good idea to \nask the House leadership to call on Governor Ridge to send all the \nairplanes he has available to see if they can return?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It sounds like a good plan. I hope that is done while I \noffer my amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate so much the concerns of my \nfriend and colleague from Nevada about being able to find legislators \nwho have wondered afar from the legislative field. We did have a slight \ninvasion in our State by a few Democrat legislators who were somewhat \nfretting but I am happy to report they returned safely to the State of \nTexas, much to the appreciation of both States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 835\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold], for himself, Mr. \n     Carper, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms. Cantwell, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 835.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To extend the current-law pay-as-you-go requirement)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . EXTENSION OF PAY-AS-YOU-GO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 275(b) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\n     Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 note) is amended by striking \n     ``2006'' and inserting ``2008''.\n       (b) Extension of Pay-As-You-Go.--Section 252 of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 \n     U.S.C. 902) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``2002'' and inserting \n     ``2008''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``2002'' and inserting \n     ``2008''.\n       (c) Application.--Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 902), as \n     amended by this section, shall not apply to direct spending \n     and receipts legislation enacted prior to the enactment of \n     this section.\n       (d) Effective Date.--the amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect September 30, 2002.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Carper, the Senator from Washington, Ms. Cantwell, \nand the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, in offering this \nstraightforward amendment. Our amendment would simply extend the pay-\nas-you-go law that has been in force in one way or another since 1990.\n  On October 16 of last year, Senators Conrad, Domenici, Gregg, and I \njoined to offer an amendment to extend the budget process. The Senate \nagreed to our amendment, but with a modification that limited the \nextension to April 15.\n  During debate on the budget resolution, a number of us offered an \namendment to extend the critical budget process rules, known as pay-go, \nand I was pleased that the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. \nNickles, accepted our amendment.\n  I regret that this absolutely critical budget rule was dropped in the \nfinal version of the budget resolution. In its place, the conference \ncommittee approved a far weaker set of rules. In fact, instead of \nacting to restrain the fiscal appetites of Congress, the rules \nestablished in the budget resolution actually whet those appetites.\n  They carve out an enormous exception in the pay-go rules, exempting \nover one-and-a-half trillion dollars in tax cuts and spending increases \nfrom the sensible restraints we had long imposed on ourselves.\n  The result is that we are currently legislating in an environment \nthat is almost completely unconstrained by any budget discipline at \nall.\n  Were our budget position stronger than it is, the lack of budget \nrestraint would be troubling enough. But given the extremely serious \nfiscal challenges we face, the inadequate budget rules adopted in the \nbudget resolution are simply and grossly irresponsible.\n  The last two years have seen a dramatic deterioration in the \ngovernment's ability to perform one of its most fundamental jobs--\nbalancing the nation's fiscal books.\n  In January of 2001, the Congressional Budget Office projected that in \nthe 10 years thereafter, the government would run a unified budget \nsurplus of more than $5 trillion.\n  With the adoption of the budget resolution, we are now facing unified \nbudget deficits of $1.7 trillion through 2013. That is a dramatic swing \nof nearly $7 trillion, just in the space of a little more than two \nyears.\n  And without counting Social Security, we are expected to run deficits \nof $4.5 trillion through 2013 under the policies outlined in the budget \nresolution. And many have noted that the assumptions on which those \nprojections are based are overly optimistic, that in particular they \nassume spending levels that Congress is unlikely to observe.\n  This kind of budgeting is absolutely reckless. There is no other word \nfor it. And the lack of adequate rules compound the damage.\n  We must stop running these debilitating deficits.\n  We must stop running deficits because they cause the government to \nuse the surpluses of the Social Security trust fund for other \ngovernment purposes, rather than to pay down the debt and help our \nnation prepare for the coming retirement of the baby boom generation.\n  We must stop running deficits because every dollar that we add to the \nFederal debt is another dollar that we are forcing our children to pay \nback in higher taxes or fewer government benefits.\n  When the government in this generation chooses to spend on current \nconsumption and to accumulate debt for our children's generation to \npay, it does nothing less than rob our children of their own choices. \nWe make our choices to spend on our wants, but we saddle our kids with \ndebts that they must pay from their tax dollars and their hard work. \nAnd that is not right.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment to reinstate the budget \nstatute under which we operated for many years. We need a strong budget \nprocess. We need to exert fiscal discipline.\n  This amendment would simply return us to the pay-go budget discipline \nthat was in effect until September of last year. It would reinstate the \nacross-the-board sequester law that imposed some useful budget \ndiscipline during the 1990s.\n  That is what this amendment would do. It is the least that we should \ndo to ensure fiscal responsibility and sound budgeting.\n  We must stop using Social Security surpluses to fund other government \nprograms. We must stop piling up debt for our children to pay off. We \nmust continue the discipline of the budget process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to Senator Feingold \nand join with him and Senators Cantwell and Feinstein in offering this \namendment today.\n  The budget enforcement requirements first established in the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990 were important factors in the successful \nbipartisan effort over the course of the 1990s to bring our Federal \nbudget deficit under control.\n  At a time now when our deficit is again growing rapidly, it is most \nunfortunate that these budgetary constraints have been allowed to \nlapse.\n  One of the most important of the 1990 controls was the so-called pay-\ngo law. The pay-go law requires the Congress to live under the same \nconstraints as most typical American families.\n  American families--at least most of us--understand very well that if \nthey want to spend more lavishly, they must find some way to bring in \nmore income. Similarly, if one parent decides to leave the workforce to \nstay at home, then the family must find a way to make do with less.\n  Put simply, pay-go required that we acknowledge these same simple \nrealities of life. It required the Congress come up with the revenues \nto pay for any new entitlement spending or else find ways to \naccommodate that new spending by tightening our belts somewhere else. \nIt required that should Congress decide to reduce the revenues we use \nto pay for Federal spending, either we have to cut the spending those \nrevenues financed or else find new revenues to pay for that same \nspending.\n  The purpose of pay-go is to prevent Congress and the President from \nrunning up the bill on our Nation's credit card, which is exactly what \nwe are doing today, to the tune of nearly $1 trillion.\n  The pay-go law expired last fall, as Senator Feingold has said, as \ndid the discretionary spending caps that were also part of the \nsuccessful formula that brought the deficit under control by the end of \nthe 1990s.\n  A related pay-go rule that we had here in the Senate was extended \nuntil this April 15. It was then replaced with new rules that are \nwidely acknowledged to be weak and porous. The statutory pay-go \nrequirement--the legally binding requirement--has not been renewed at \nall. This is a serious mistake.\n  We cannot undo today all the actions over the last 2 years that have \nled us to the point we are, but here we are preparing to raise the \nceiling on the Federal debt by nearly $1 trillion. Today alone, we will \npay $1 billion in interest on our national debt--not on debt service, \nnot on principal payment--just on interest, $1 billion today alone.\n  By this time next year, some 20 cents of every revenue dollar we \ncollect for the Federal Treasury will go to pay just for interest \nalone--20 cents of every dollar just to pay for interest alone.\n  While we cannot today retrace the steps that we need to, to ensure \nthat all those wrongs will be righted, we can take a step to ensure \nthat we will not be back here in a few months or a year to charge \nlavishly on the Nation's credit card once again.\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\n  Senators Feingold, Cantwell, Feinstein, and myself are proposing a \nfirst step in that direction--restoring one of the most important \nconstraints that helped instill fiscal discipline in this place in the \n1990s.\n  I hope our colleagues will join us and support this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his leadership and for \nyielding time to me.\n\n                       RESTORING THE PAY-GO RULE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nFeingold amendment reinstating the Senate's pay-go rule. The premise \nunderlying this amendment is that we as a body must return to using the \nbudget enforcement measures that have helped us be fiscally responsible \nin the past.\n  We have responsibilities to live up to and commitments to fulfill, \nbut we also must have fiscal discipline as we make budget decisions. We \nmust have a framework and strict budget enforcement rules to guide \nthrough this difficult, and as we have seen this week, contentious and \npolitically charged process.\n  This amendment helps us at a time when we have seen a multitrillion-\ndollar surplus turn into a multitrillion-dollar deficit. Perhaps now \nmore than ever, it is critical that we exercise fiscal restraint. \nReinstating the pay-go rule by approving this amendment is a good first \nstep.\n  This amendment would extend the ``pay as you go'' budget rule that \nexpired on April 15. The pay-go would subject any tax cuts or new \nmandatory spending to a 60-vote point of order unless those cuts or \nspending increases are fully offset. Pay-go had been in effect from \n1990 until just a few weeks ago when our colleagues across the aisle \nallowed it to expire, choosing to replace it with a far weaker \nprovision. The pay-go provision proposed in Senator Feingold's \namendment would restore the stronger rule, which in the past decade has \nproven an important tool for the Senate to maintain fiscal discipline \nand keep Federal spending within reasonable limits.\n  The actions of the Senate today made clear the absence of fiscal \ndiscipline in our Government under this administration. I hope the \nAmerican people see this morning's tax vote and this subsequent effort \nto increase the debt limit by nearly $1 trillion--the largest increase \nin our Nation's history--for what it is: A poor decision that will \nburden taxpayers with an outrageous debt load for years to come.\n  We know the current and ever-growing deficit is a direct result of \nthe 2001 tax cut, the ongoing recession, and the tragic events of \nSeptember 11, 2001. For us to enact another poorly targeted tax cut is \na mistake. And it is outrageous that minutes after the tax cuts were \napproved, the Senate began the debate to raise the Government debt \nlimit by more than $900 billion. This is proof that fiscal discipline \nis not the guiding principle when making decisions about the country's \nfuture financial health. This is the second time in 2 years we have \nbeen faced with this issue, a clear indication that current fiscal \npolicies are not improving the economic reality.\n  One of the most important actions we can take for the Nation's future \neconomic stability is to pay down the National debt. According to the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, paying down the \nNational debt lowers interest rates and keeps the capital markets and \ninvestment going.\n  I want to make it clear that I do support efforts to provide \nhardworking Washingtonians and all Americans with tax relief such as \neliminating the marriage penalty, making college tuition tax \ndeductible, allowing States with no State income tax to deduct their \nsales taxes from their Federal income tax return, and assisting workers \nin savings for their retirement. But we must look at all budget \nissues--taxes and spending alike--from a total and comprehensive view.\n  Our total budget must be crafted within a framework that maintains \nfiscal discipline, and stimulates economic growth through continued \nFederal investment in education and job training, while also protecting \nthe environment. Furthermore, we need to invest in our Nation's \neconomic future by making a commitment to public research and \ndevelopment in science and technology--maintaining our status as a \nglobal leader.\n  It is a balance. We need to make these investments, but within a \nframework that ensures we don't spend beyond our means. If we want our \neconomy to be strong, if we want revenues, and if we want to make the \nright decisions, we need to keep paying down the debt.\n  We must have fiscal discipline in the budget and appropriations \nprocess. We cannot focus solely on the individual items and programs in \nour budget but must look at the whole picture. The budget enforcement \nprocedures such as pay-go help us do this, and help us keep our \nspending under a reasonable amount of control.\n  Budget enforcement rules like pay-go worked successfully as we \nstruggled to get out of the deficit spending in the 1990s, and it will \nwork as we struggle to get out of the recession and deficit financing \nwe face today. I urge my colleagues to support the Feingold amendment \nand reinstate the Senate's pay-go rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I inquire of my colleagues--I am going to \nmake a budget point of order shortly. You have not used all your time. \nI will not use all our time. Maybe we can move forward a little \nquicker.\n  Is there anybody else on your side who wishes to speak?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if Senator Cantwell wishes to speak, I \nwould want to reserve an opportunity for that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will proceed. She is not on the floor \nright now.\n  Mr. President, first a couple comments.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Senator Feingold in the \nBudget Committee and on several occasions on the floor, and we have \nshared an interest, at various times, being a coalition, trying to curb \nthe growth of Federal spending. I say that to my colleague. I \nappreciate his work and how sincere he is with this amendment and with \nbudget process.\n  As chairman of the Budget Committee, I will tell you, budget process \nshould come through the Budget Committee. The Senator has an amendment. \nIt is not perfect. It needs to be improved. It needs to go through the \nBudget Committee. Actually, the Budget Act says it should go through \nthe Budget Committee.\n  I would like to consult with all Members--Democrats and Republicans--\non budget reform. I think we need budget reform, both in process and in \nimplementation.\n  Now, in pay-go, a lot of people get confused, but we actually have \npay-go in Senate rules, and we used to have statutory pay-go. One is in \nthe statutes of the United States Code. One is in Senate rules. We have \npay-go in Senate rules. We had--past tense--pay-go in the statutes.\n  I am willing to reinstate pay-go and maybe change the way it is \ndrafted to some extent. The former chairman of the Budget Committee, \nSenator Domenici, is in the Chamber, and he utilized it, but the \nstatute had not been utilized very often in the past. It was very \nseldom. It actually had a sequester. It was hardly ever used. Maybe the \nthreat of it is worthwhile, but, anyway, it had not been used. We also \nhave pay-go in Senate rules. That has been used quite frequently.\n  So I just make the comment that we need some budgetary changes in \nrules. I think we certainly do. The way that the budgets are managed \nwith the vote-aramas--we ended up having 51 votes, most of which were \nstacked in the last day or so of the management of the budget--I think \nis demeaning to the Senate. The same thing in reconciliation; and that \nactually is done under the budget procedure. Again, we had a limited \nnumber of hours for consideration of the reconciliation bill and then a \nvote-arama.\n  Again, maybe it is not the best way to be considering legislation of \nsuch importance. So I am willing to work with my colleagues on both \nsides, and I appreciate the interest of the Senator from Delaware and \nthe Senator from\n\n[[Page S7104]]\n\nWisconsin in passing budget reform, and I will work with them. If we do \na bill dealing with budget reform, in my opinion, it is going to take \nbipartisan support.\n  I see the former chairman of the Budget Committee. It is going to \ntake a bipartisan effort or it will not happen. I recognize that. I \nrealize that. I happen to think there are enough of us around wrestling \nwith budgets who know that procedures need to be improved.\n  We also want them to be effective: To have a Budget Act with \nenforcement, but not have it be ineffective, i.e, you can waive it on \naccount of emergency, you can waive it on a lot of things where they \nare not effective. We do not want to do that. We want to be effective \nin exhibiting some discipline.\n  I might also mention, just for the information of our colleagues, in \nthe budget we did pass there is a direction to all the authorizing \ncommittees to report back to the Budget Committee by September 2 for \nideas on curbing wasteful spending, with at least a target of 1 \npercent.\n  I mentioned this to some of my colleagues, and I will mention it on \nthe floor, because some authorizers are going to say: Wait a minute. \nWhat are you doing telling us to come up with some savings? But a lot \nof programs have waste or fraud or accounting errors that need to be \nstopped. The House actually had a mandatory cut. We ended up saying: \nWell, we are going to request the committees to report back to us. We \nexpect and look forward to their cooperation.\n  We did not do anything in this last year's budget, frankly, on \nentitlements. We probably should. We need to look at all Federal \nspending. We need to eliminate waste. It bothers me to look at a \nprogram, such as the earned income tax credit, and have Treasury report \nback to us that 30 percent of the program is a mistake--some of it \nfraud, some of it a mistake, accounting errors, you name it. We should \nnot have programs which are that wasteful, that much of a mistake. We \nneed to improve management of our Government.\n  I told the former chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad, \nthat I hope to do a lot of oversight to make Government work better. We \nwill be doing some of that as well.\n  I say to my colleagues, I do not believe this amendment on the debt \nlimit--without going through the committee--is the proper approach.\n  So, Mr. President, I am going to make a point of order that the \namendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, contains \nmatter--\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am not going to ask for the vote now.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will withhold.\n  I was not going to push for the vote on it until you completed your \ntime. I will make the point of order. I know Senator Domenici wishes to \nspeak, as well.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, contains matter within the \njurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget, and the underlying bill \nwas not reported from the committee. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against the amendment under section 306 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974.\n  I make that point of order, and I now wish for the Senator to \ncomplete his time. I also ask that----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, is it necessary for me to move to waive \nthe point of order at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may use his time first.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I say to the Senator, you can use your time. You can \nmove to waive, and we can still debate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, even though the motion by my friend from \nOklahoma has been made too early, I ask unanimous consent that when \nSenator Feingold completes all the time he has been allotted, the \nrequest made by the Senator from Oklahoma be valid, and then Senator \nFeingold could move to waive.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask to \nmodify that request, and that the Senator from New Mexico be entitled \nto speak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is still time remaining for debate on \nthe amendment.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, those of us who came here in the early \n1990s found an incredible fiscal mess in this country. And we \nbelieved--so many of us worked on both sides of the aisle; and it was \nbipartisan--that without these kinds of budget rules, we never would \nhave been able to get the deficit eliminated and actually have a \nsurplus by the early part of this decade.\n  That is why it is so important that we restore this statutory \nlanguage and move in the direction of fiscal discipline.\n  I do appreciate the words and the actions of the chairman of the \nBudget Committee. He has shown a genuine interest in trying to get \nthese rules in place. I appreciate his commitment to work with us on a \nbipartisan basis to do it. I can tell you that this is not the first \neffort in this regard. I worked all last year with Senators from both \nsides of the aisle to try to figure this out. Senator Gregg, Senator \nPhil Gramm, and others tried every approach we could to make sure these \nrules would be in place. Unfortunately, it did not work. So there is no \nlack of willingness on this side of the aisle to work together to \nrestore these budget rules. I think a good chance to do that is right \nnow, on this amendment today, on a bipartisan basis to get some fiscal \ndiscipline to return.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware. He has been absolutely determined \nsince he came to the Senate to help us restore these kinds of rules and \nhave some kind of fiscal discipline.\n  Finally, as I yield time to the Senator from North Dakota, who in my \nview has been the leading advocate for fiscal discipline in this body \nover many years, I am grateful to his leadership and commitment to have \nthese rules in place. Even though it is possible that we won't prevail \non this amendment today, I do believe there is a bipartisan interest in \ntrying to resolve this problem.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. I \nespecially commend him for his leadership on this issue. It has been \nover an extended period of time that he has tried to remind our \ncolleagues repeatedly of the need for fiscal discipline.\n  The Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 first established what we called \npay-go. Pay-go has two separate enforcement mechanisms: a 60-vote point \nof order in the Senate, and sequestration. The majority extended the \npay-go point of order but they included a huge loophole for all of the \npolicies assumed in this year's budget resolution, including its tax \ncuts. So we have pay-go, but we are closing the barn door after the \ncows have all left. They did not extend sequestration, which expired on \nSeptember 30 of last year. Therefore, we are currently operating \nwithout the key tools that have been used to help enforce budget \ndiscipline over a dozen years.\n  Given the huge loophole that now exists in the pay-go point of order, \nwe need pay-go sequestration all the more.\n  Under sequestration, mandatory spending and tax legislation that \nreduced surpluses or increased deficits had to be fully offset with \nmandatory savings or revenue increases in order to avoid across-the-\nboard cuts in mandatory spending at the end of a fiscal year. The \nthreat of these cuts helped prevent the enactment of costly and \nfiscally irresponsible legislation that was not paid for, such as \ntoday's tax bill that just passed that is going to dramatically deepen \nthe deficit and debt of this country.\n  I support the amendment of the Senator from Wisconsin. I urge my \ncolleagues to do so as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if this amendment were adopted, it would \nmore than complicate the debt limit extension. We have already \nmentioned that. Senators are aware of that.\n  I have already said I will work with members of the committee. I will \nwork\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nwith other Members for budget process reform. I welcome ideas and \ninput. We can do a better job. Under present law, if this passed, for \nthose people who have an interest in passing a prescription drug bill, \nit won't happen. The budget resolution says we can have a prescription \ndrug bill within $400 billion reported by the Finance Committee. A \nbudget point of order would not lie against it. If this amendment \npassed, every penny of it would have to be paid for with either revenue \nincreases or cuts, presumably in Medicare or Medicaid. My guess is you \nwould not have it.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the Senator from New Mexico, who \nwas chairman or ranking member of the Budget Committee for 25 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I want to say my congratulations \nto the other side for attempting to tighten up the Budget Act, \nparticularly Senator Feingold. On the other hand, this is not the way \nto do it nor the time to do it.\n  The motion that has been made by the distinguished chairman that this \namendment must fail is not a frivolous one. To have this kind of a \nchange in the Budget Act requires hearings. That is what this is about. \nThe statute says before you change this law--and we thank the Lord all \nthe time that they put this in this law--on the floor, you have to send \nit to the committee. That is kind of new around here but it is very \ngood stuff. So that you know the ramifications before you do the \namending. The ramifications of this amendment are so farfetched that it \nis not farfetched to say you are voting against prescription drug \nreform if you vote for this amendment or to override the motion by the \nchairman who says we should not do this.\n  Secondly, I want to offer an explanation. Today there is much talk \nabout the tax bill, and people are saying that the tax bill, since many \nof the tax proposals do not go on forever, is jiggering the Tax Code. I \nshould remind everyone that the tax bill we have done is done under the \nBudget Act. In turn, it is done under a reconciliation instruction. It \nis not done under the ordinary law of the Senate. Therefore, we are \nbound by the law not to pass permanent tax law changes. So it is not \nanybody trying to play with the Tax Code. It is the law that says, if \nyou want the benefit of the Budget Act under reconciliation, which \nmeans no filibuster and minimal amendments, then you cannot make the \ntax changes permanent. In other words, it gives you a benefit, and it \nis a safeguard of permanency not being available at the same time.\n  That is the explanation for those who are writing and talking about \nthe fact that these tax provisions are not permanent.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to make a point. Of course, my \namendment does not prevent the prescription drug benefit. It just means \nthat we have to actually pay for it. It seems to me that is reasonable. \nThe amendment in no way prevents a paid-for prescription drug benefit. \nI would not support such an amendment if I were given that.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me again thank not only the current chairman but \nthe previous chairman of the Budget Committee. They have sincerely \nshown an interest--I am a member of the committee--in trying to get \nthese budget rules back in place. I understand why this motion is being \nmade. The point is, the chairman has indicated a willingness to move \nforward. I understand he will hold those hearings the Senator from New \nMexico was just referring to that are a part of the process. I want \nthem to know I sincerely would like to see us come together on this in \nthe coming months.\n  It was absolutely essential for the American people to have the \nconfidence that we cared about the deficit issue, that we finally gave \nthe American people that wonderful sense of confidence that it mattered \nto us that we were running deficits. It helped everybody's mood. It \nhelped the economy. It was a terrific thing for this country.\n  That confidence is now gone. The way you rebuild it is by getting \nthese rules in place so people can point to those rules and say: We \ncan't go beyond these limits.\n  That is what we need. I think we need it in statute as well as in the \nrules of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield back my time, Mr. President. I assume this \nwould be the appropriate time for me to move to waive the point of \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, can we make sure people know this is a 10-\nminute vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds Senators this is a 10-minute \nvote.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 52, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 200 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--52\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Kennedy\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are \n52. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. At this time, I renew the unanimous consent request on \nunemployment insurance earlier offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Earlier today, Senator Kennedy asked that the Senate \napprove the unemployment insurance legislation which was sent from the \nHouse to the Senate early this morning. I have asked to renew the \nrequest of the Senator from Massachusetts that that be adopted by the \nSenate.\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I do object simply because there may be \nsomebody on this side of the aisle who may want to make that motion. So \nif we could go ahead and process another amendment, we will have \nfurther discussions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. I certainly understand, and that would be satisfactory. We \ndo not need to make the request, but we would hope that it would be \nmade very quickly.\n  In the interim, the next amendment we would ask to be considered is \nthat of the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings. He has agreed to \n20 minutes for himself. We ask if there would be a like time agreed to \nby the majority? That would be 40 minutes equally divided, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order. There have not been any offered so \nfar. I ask that in the form of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have an amendment at the desk and ask the clerk to \nreport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 836.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. APPLICABILITY OF PUBLIC DEBT LIMIT TO SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Protection of Social Security Trust Funds.--\n       (1) Delay or failure to invest.--No officer or employee of \n     the United States shall--\n       (A) delay the deposit of any amount into (or delay the \n     credit of any amount to) any social security trust fund or \n     otherwise vary from the normal terms, procedures, or timing \n     for making such deposits or credits; or\n       (B) refrain from the investment in public debt obligations \n     of amounts in any such fund.\n       (2) Early redemption.--No officer or employee of the United \n     States shall redeem prior to maturity amounts in any social \n     security trust fund which are invested in public debt \n     obligations for any other purpose other than payment of \n     benefits or administrative expenses from such fund.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``public debt \n     obligation'' means any obligation subject to the public debt \n     limit established under section 3101 of title 31, United \n     States Code.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Subsections (j), (k), and (l) of section 8348 and \n     subsections (g) and (h) of section 8438 of title 5, United \n     States Code, are repealed.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this merely stops the Secretary of the \nTreasury from looting the Social Security trust fund in order to make \nthe national debt appear smaller than it actually is. On Sixth Avenue \nin New York, they have a debt clock showing, day to day, the increase \nof the national debt.\n  On March 5 of this year, that debt clock stopped, courtesy of the \nSecretary of the Treasury, who immediately started using trust funds, \nparticularly Social Security trust funds--Enron accounting--to make the \ndebt appear smaller.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the daily history of debt results be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n   THE DAILY HISTORY OF DEBT RESULTS--HISTORICAL RETURNS FOR 3/4/2003\n                            THROUGH

If there is no debt value\n  for the date(s) you requested, the value for the preceding business\n  day will be displayed.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles, raised this particular point back in 1995. \nHe cosponsored a bill along with Senator Santorum, Senator Shelby, and \nSenator Thomas. I refer my colleagues to page S. 18819 of the Record of \nDecember 18, 1995, at the introduction of S. 1484, a bill to enforce \nthe public debt limit and to protect the Social Security trust funds. \nIt is just the darnedest thing you have ever seen. We are using Enron \naccounting. We are looting the Social Security funds, and the debt goes \nup, up, and away.\n  The Congressional Budget Office already reports, Senator Domenici, \nwhere we had a $428 billion deficit last year. We are running $138 \nbillion ahead, so it is up to $566 billion this minute.\n  Let's understand what we are all about. This week, the Republicans \nare asking the Congress to casually vote to raise the limit on the \nnational debt by $984 billion, from $6.4 trillion to $7.384 trillion. I \nsay casually because the seriousness of this move is passed over and \nbarely discussed. It took us 200 years of our history and the cost of \nall of the wars to ever get to a trillion-dollar debt. Today, by a \nvote, we are going to add $1 trillion to the debt.\n  It was not always this way. Just over 2 years ago, in his first \nspeech to Congress, President Bush bragged he wanted to pay down $2 \ntrillion in debt. Earlier, there was a crowd standing on the Capitol \nsteps hailing their Contract with America to stop deficit spending. \nThere was the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution cry-out \nthat went so far as to forbid deficits.\n  Some Republicans may not realize the reason for this 180-degree turn, \nbut Carl Rove knows. It is about getting rid of the Democratic Party. \nRepublicans hope this increase in the debt limit is large enough so \nthat any further increase will not be needed until after the 2004 \nPresidential election. In the meantime, the Government will be able to \nborrow money for all the tax cuts the President wants to get reelected.\n  Borrow, we will. This is the first installment of the Republican-\npassed budget that increases the debt from $6 trillion to $12 trillion \nover the next 10 years. That is an average of $600 billion deficit each \nand every year for a decade. It took 38 Presidents and 192 years to \nreach $1 trillion in debt. It took Ronald Reagan 4 years, and it has \ntaken George W. Bush just halfway through his term.\n  The Bush policy takes Reaganomics to the extreme. If it means getting \nrid of the Government at the same time, so be it.\n  I hesitate to add that the President is not alone in his mission. The \nDemocratic Party is in lockstep with him. When President Bush says, we \nneed not pay for the war, the Democrats agree. This is the first time \nwe have sent GIs to fight a war and then want them to hurry back to pay \nthe bill. We in Congress are not going to pay for it. We need a tax cut \nto get elected next year.\n  When the President says, increase the debt, we Democrats say, yes, \nthat is what the country needs, just not as much as the President \nwants.\n  The President calls for fast-track trade negotiating authority to \nexport America's jobs faster and the Democratic leadership says, right \non. Both parties triangulate, so, as George Wallace used to say, there \nis not a dime's worth of difference between the two major parties. We \nare bogged down in the needs of the campaign rather than the needs of \nthe country.\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\n  The country needs fiscal discipline, and we are getting it at the \nState level. Fourteen Republican Governors are increasing taxes to \nprovide for the States' needs, but the cost of the war does not move \nWashington. We already are spending $500 billion to $600 billion more \nthan we are taking in. Alan Greenspan, Paul Volcker, and Robert Ruben \nbelieve this is enough stimulus.\n  The President's tax cut merely increases the debt which will increase \nthe interest costs, which increases waste. Before long, all the \nGovernment will be able to afford is defense, Social Security, health \ncare, and interest costs that must be paid.\n  Karl Rove knows the more we spend on interest charges, the less there \nis for programs. The Democrats thrive on programs and their \nconstituencies. Less programs equals less supporters, which equals less \nDemocratic Party.\n  Already the Democratic Party is in a fix. Labor, its main supporter, \nis being shipped overseas. And money, the main support of the \nRepublican Party, is flourishing. The only thing to save the Democratic \nParty and the country is the free press.\n  But the free press is worse than both parties. The media is charged \nwith telling the truth but they avoid it. The other day, when the \nCongressional Budget Office reported the government would hit a record \nin deficit spending for the year, the Washington Post buried the news \non the bottom of page A5; but it gave front page billing to President \nBush's tax cuts, which the President claims has no impact on those \nrecord deficits. Recently, when I offered an amendment to stop tax cuts \nand limit the explosion of the debt, nobody in the press wrote a story.\n  James Fallows in his book, Breaking the News, tells of the debate for \na democracy between Walter Lippman and the educator John Dewey. Lippman \nallowed that the way to provide for a strong democracy is to gather \naround the table the experts in defense, health, highways, foreign \npolicy, and the economy. Let them hammer out the needs of the country \nand give it to the congress for enactment. ``No'', said Dewey. Let the \nfree press report the truth to the American people and the people will \nreflect these truths and needs through their representatives in \nCongress.\n  The press avoids the truth. They are completely bemused by politics, \npromoting conflict between the candidates and the parties. The increase \nin the debt before us reflects the true national debt, but hereafter \nthe press will obscure the national debt by Ernon accounting, making \nthe debt and deficit look smaller than they are.\n  The press will report the ``on-budget deficit'', ``unified deficit'', \nand ``public debt'' as separated from the ``government debt''--numbers \nthat do not take into account what the government loots from Social \nSecurity and other trust funds, which is the true deficit and debt. The \ntaxpayers can't follow this, they can't know. Little do they realize \nthe deficit last year exceeded the sum total of 30 years of deficits \nduring the Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford years. \nWe are spending and cutting taxes like drunken sailors.\n  Europe's fiscal discipline requires a nation's debt not to exceed 60 \npercent of its gross national product before it can become a member of \nthe European Union. Our national debt exceeds 60 percent, and is \nrising. We don't even qualify to enter the European Union.\n  Today interest costs are almost $1 billion a day, and with $600 \nbillion deficits it will exceed $400 billion a year. Without this waste \nwe could double the defense budget or give everybody in America the \nbest health care. But with this waste, the dollar drops in value, \ninterest costs rise, and the Nation is impoverished.\n  For the first time in history our generation will leave a lesser \nnation for the next generation. But rather than report on the state of \nthe Union, all the free press can report is that Gary Hart is not \nrunning.\n  In the interest of time, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the budget realities demonstrating the state of the Union.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Government; Beginning in 1962, CBO's The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2004-2013.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nanother article from the Financial Times today that the U.S. \nadministration throws prudence out the window.\n\n                [From the Financial Times, May 23, 2003]\n\n                               Tax Lunacy\n\n       President George W. Bush declared victory yesterday in the \n     long-running congressional wrangle over his tax proposals. \n     ``This is a Congress which is able to identify problems \n     facing the American people and get things done,'' he said \n     after House and Senate Republicans struck a deal on a $350bn \n     tax cut over 10 years. If only that were true.\n       The long-run costs of financing huge US fiscal deficits, \n     which stretch far into the future, will weigh heavily on \n     future generations. With little of the tax cut having an \n     immediate effect, the necessary short-run economic stimulus \n     will be negligible.\n       Democrats are prone to exaggerate the culpability of the \n     current administration in the deterioration of the US public \n     finances from a surplus of 1.4 per cent of gross domestic \n     product in 2000 to a projected 4.6 per cent deficit this \n     year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that only a \n     third of this deterioration is due to legislative changes, \n     the rest being either due to the cyclical downturn or \n     excessive optimism in previous tax forecasts. The fiscal \n     loosening over the past few years has mitigated the economic \n     slowdown. But those caveats aside, on the management of \n     fiscal policy, the lunatics are in charge now of the asylum.\n       Including ``sunsetting'' provisions to cut the 10-year cost \n     of the tax measures is an insult to the intelligence of US \n     people. Anyone who genuinely believes that in 2007 Congress \n     will automatically reverse these tax cuts needs therapy. Much \n     of Mr. Bush's 2001 tax-cutting package was also deemed \n     temporary, only for the measures to be made permanent later.\n       Long-run US fiscal forecasts are still based on unrealistic \n     assumptions of spending restraint that have not been met, \n     either by this administration or by its predecessor.\n       And the latest wheeze in Republican circles is to dismiss \n     forecasts of fiscal deficits because they rely on ``static'' \n     forecasting techniques. ``Dynamic scoring'' which takes \n     account of the effect of tax cuts on economic growth would \n     transform the picture, they insist. But the evidence is not \n     so kind to these assertions. The 1990s, when taxes were \n     raised, was one of the more dynamic in US history; and fiscal \n     deficits raise the cost of capital, reducing growth.\n       Never mind these facts, more extreme Republicans often say, \n     big deficits are in our interests. Proposing to slash federal \n     spending, particularly on social programs, is a tricky \n     electoral proposition, but a fiscal crisis offers the \n     tantalizing prospect of forcing such cuts through the back \n     door.\n       For them, undermining the multilateral international order \n     is not enough, long-held views on income distribution also \n     require radical revision. In response to this onslaught, \n     there is not much the rational majority can do: reason cuts \n     no ice; economic theory is dismissed; and contrary evidence \n     is ignored. But watching the world's economic superpower \n     slowly destroy perhaps the world's most enviable fiscal \n     position is something to behold.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I draw the attention of my colleagues to \nan article in the Wall Street Journal of May 23, 2003 by J.D. McKinnon \nentitled ``Get Ready for Era of Budget Deficits.'' It says it better \nthan I can.\n  Finally, as has been related in David Hale's column in today's \nFinancial Times, what we have is those who were telling the truth like \nLawrence Lindsey and Paul O'Neill. They have gotten rid of them. For \nthose who avoid the truth or get tired of trying to avoid it, like \nMitch Daniels and Ari Fleischer, they are on the way out.\n  As the Financial Times reported here yesterday, the Secretary of the \nTreasury is merely a salesman and the true Secretary of the Treasury is \nCarl Rove. Mr. Hale writes:\n\n       ``Economic policy appears to be under the control of the \n     political advisers. The White House will not be able to \n     encourage a dollar rally until Carl Rove holds a press \n     conference on the subject.''\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Financial Times, May 20, 2003]\n\n                    Washington's Weak Dollar Policy\n\n                            (By David Hale)\n\n       The circumstances now confronting the US economy are unique \n     in the modern era. The Federal Reserve has warned about the \n     risk of deflation after a year in which the US dollar has \n     fallen by nearly 30 per cent against many leading currencies. \n     Despite the weakness of the currency, US Treasury bond yields \n     have fallen to 45-year lows and are 37 basis points under the \n     yields of German government debt.\n       The dollar's decline has been painless for US financial \n     markets because investors are complacent about inflation. The \n     failure of bond yields to rise has also produced a policy of \n     benign neglect in Washington. Federal Reserve officials say \n     the falling dollar is a European problem, not a US one. John \n     Snow, the US Treasury secretary, effectively abandoned the \n     previous administration's strong dollar policy over the \n     weekend by issuing his own definition of what constitutes a \n     strong currency. It does not include market prices.\n       The dollar began to weaken more than a year ago but its \n     decline has accelerated during recent weeks for three \n     reasons.\n       First, the markets are concerned that the Bush \n     administration's fiscal policy could boost the federal budget \n     deficit to $400bn-$500bn and create a domestic savings \n     imbalance that will expand the current account deficit to \n     $600bn.\n       Second, the markets are alarmed that the US is embarking \n     upon an imperialist foreign policy that will have unknown \n     consequences for its fiscal position, foreign trade and \n     relationship with other countries. In the heyday of empire, \n     the UK ran large current account surpluses. There is no \n     precedent for a country playing the role of global superpower \n     with a large external payments deficit. During the cold war, \n     the US was able to finance its defence spending in part \n     through offset programmes with other countries. The \n     Bundesbank, for example, stockpiled dollars as a quid pro quo \n     for US defence spending in Germany. During the 1991 Gulf war \n     the US received large subsidies from Japan, Saudi Arabia and \n     other countries. With the US pursuing a more unilateralist \n     foreign policy it will have to absorb all of the costs \n     without help from traditional allies.\n       Last, the markets perceive a vacuum at the centre of US \n     economic policymaking. In this administration power is highly \n     centralised at the White House. The only highly visible \n     cabinet ministers are at the departments of state and \n     defence. The Treasury's stature and influence declined during \n     the tenure of Paul O'Neill because of his caustic comments \n     about many issues and his poor relationship with Congress. \n     Mr. Snow has worked hard to improve ties with Congress but \n     the markets see him as a salesman, not an architect of \n     policy. Larry Lindsey and Glenn Hubbard, the people who \n     created the administration's economic policy, have resigned.\n       The other institutions of economic policy are also weak. \n     The new director of the national economic policy council is \n     focused on internal administration rather than influencing \n     markets. Mitch Daniels, director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget, is leaving to pursue a political career in \n     Indiana. The Council of Economic Adivsors is\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\n     being evicted from the White House. Economic policy appears \n     to be under the control of White House political advisers, \n     not the traditional institutions of government. In fact, the \n     White House will not be able to encourage a dollar rally \n     until Karl Rove holds a press conference on the subject.\n       As Mr. Snow's recent comments have made clear, Washington \n     will do nothing to stabilise the dollar until there is a big \n     correction in bond prices that might jeopardise the boom in \n     the US housing market. But in the absence of a threat to the \n     US housing market, the burden of adjustment will fall \n     elsewhere. Asia will resist dollar depreciation through \n     large-scale market intervention. China's foreign exchange \n     reserve will expand from $280bn to $330bn this year. Japan's \n     foreign exchance reserves will mushroom from $500bn to $600bn \n     this year and reach $1,000bn by 2008.\n       If Asia is able to stablise its exchange rates, the US will \n     have to reduce its current account deficit through larger \n     devaluations against other currencies. This pressure for \n     devaluation will set in motion a process of competitive \n     monetary reflation with the eurozone, Britain, Canada, South \n     Africa and other countries with variable exchange rates. \n     These countries will be compelled to cut interest rates to \n     prevent their currencies from appreciating against the \n     dollar.\n       The Bush administration is prepared to pursue aggressive \n     fiscal and monetary policies to ensure a healthy recovery in \n     the run-up to the 2004 presidential election. Its new weak \n     dollar policy is designed to put pressure on other countries \n     to reinforce this domestic growth agenda. During the late \n     1980s Japan created a bubble economy with rocketing prices \n     for land and equities by pursuing a monetary policy designed \n     to stabilise the dollar. The coming round of competitive \n     monetary reflation is also likely to force central banks to \n     pursue far more aggressive interest rate cuts than they \n     expect. If it does, President George W. Bush will not win re-\n     election. There could be Bush bubbles in many asset markets \n     during late 2004 and 2005.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nextending the Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation (TEUC) \nprogram. Congress created this program in March of last year to provide \nfederally funded unemployment benefits for millions of Americans who \nhave exhausted their regular State-funded benefits after falling victim \nto our weakening economy. This vital program is nearing expiration and \nnow millions of Americans need our help.\n  If Congress and the President do not act before May 31, 2003, nearly \n4 million long-term unemployed workers will lose benefits, including \nalmost 14,000 West Virginians. These unemployed workers and their \nfamilies need and deserve an extension--every one of them. Unless \nimmediate action is taken, American workers who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own will be left vulnerable to economic \nhardship, and without a safety net. How will these families pay their \nmortgages and provide for their children? During these difficult \neconomic times, how can we turn our backs on 4 million Americans?\n  Earlier this month, the Department of Labor announced that the \nNation's unemployment rate had risen to 6 percent, representing 8.79 \nmillion Americans out of work. This is the highest national \nunemployment rate we have witnessed in nearly a decade. When President \nBush released his growth and stimulus package, he maintained that \ncreating jobs was his No. 1 priority. Yet, despite rising \nunemployment--500,000 more Americans in February and March alone--and \nunprecedented fiscal crises in our States, the President's proposal \nfails to provide assistance for unemployed workers, adequate State \nfiscal relief, and neglects Americans who need help the most.\n  West Virginia families will soon be faced with some very difficult \nchoices. Choices between paying their mortgage or defaulting; between \nhaving health insurance or going without; between sending their \nchildren to college or dipping into their pensions to cover everyday \nliving expenses while ruining their retirement. These are West \nVirginians who want to work--who are trying to work--but simply cannot \nfind a job in the current economy. I urge my colleagues to act swiftly \nso that American families aren't forced to make these kinds of \ndecisions so this dire situation is not further exacerbated.\n  I feel strongly about this issue because of the very real impact \ninaction could have on my constituents. Just recently, I was contacted \nby Janice Walters from Mercer County in my home state of West Virginia. \nShe called my office searching for help. Ms. Walters truly epitomizes \nthe American worker that we must help.\n  In September of last year, Ms. Walters was laid off from a \ncommunications company. As a 49-year-old single mother of two with many \ncost-of-living expenses, she now has no income and no health insurance \ncoverage, forcing her to face some of the stark choices I discussed \nearlier. To support her family, she began collecting unemployment \ninsurance. In addition, she took a part-time job and began taking \nclasses in computer sciences at a local college to learn new skills \nthat she could apply to a new career. Unfortunately, she will not \nexhaust her State benefits until the week after the current TEUC \nprogram expires, leaving her ineligible for TEUC benefits. If the TEUC \nprogram is permitted to expire, Ms. Walters, and millions like her, \nwill be left unemployed and unassisted.\n  Fortunately, such a tragedy is preventable. If we act on an extension \ntoday, Ms. Walters will get an extension and she will receive benefits. \nThis is progress. It is good to pass an extension for 2.5 million \nworkers, including about 9,000 West Virginians. This is good news for \nfamilies in need.\n  One particular extension leaves out and leaves behind the long-term \nunemployed families. A simple extension, which is all that the majority \nwill consider, excludes 1.1 million unemployed workers, and 3,900 of \nthose people live in West Virginia. They face real hardship, and they \ntoo deserve help.\n  Throughout this debate, I have supported the efforts of Senator \nKennedy and others to provide comprehensive unemployment benefits to \nall 3.6 million unemployed workers. If we can enact a huge tax cut \ntargeted to the wealthiest Americans, shouldn't we also help every \nunemployed worker?\n  Providing unemployment benefits helps the unemployed, and it also \nhelps our economy as a stimulus. History tells us that unemployment \nbenefits are spent quickly, and every $1 of such benefits generates \n$1.73 in economic activity. This is a real and an immediate stimulus \nfor local economies. There is no certainty about how changes in \ncorporate dividends will affect the economy. This administration should \nrecognize the urgent needs of all unemployed workers.\n  I am pleased that we are taking action to help many unemployed \nworkers, like Ms. Walters. I also believe we should help the 1.1 \nmillion long-term unemployed. This is the definition of real economic \nstimulus and real compassion.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the Senate passed up yet another \nopportunity to extend and expand unemployment benefits. Instead we \npassed a necessary, but inadequate, 13-week extension of eligibility \nfor extended benefits. Unfortunately, this extension will not help the \n1.1 million long-term unemployed workers in this country who have \nalready exhausted 26 weeks of unemployment. Senator Kennedy's attempt \nto give these hard-working folks who have not been able to find a job \nfor over 6 months additional benefits has been voted down once again by \nthe other side of the aisle.\n  The Congress has been talking for weeks and months about the \nimportance of stimulating the economy and putting money into the hands \nof consumers. It is clear, however, that the Republicans are not \ninterested in giving all consumers a little extra money but only those \nwho have high paying jobs. What can be more stimulating to the economy \nthan putting money in the hands of people who need it tomorrow, instead \nof waiting months or years for tax cuts to have an impact? Why can't \nthe Congress give the same benefits to unemployed workers today that \nthey have received in the past? Benefits that these workers have paid \nfor by paying into the unemployment insurance fund? Not only have \ntoday's workers earned these additional benefits but they have paid for \nthem as well. The unemployment trust fund can afford an extension of an \nadditional 13 weeks of benefits for those who have exhausted the 26 \ncurrently provided, and Congress should do it again as we have in the \npast.\n  I do not understand the priorities of those who are willing to let \nworking families lose their benefits and go into debt while handing out \ntax cuts to people who do not need them. It is a shame to turn our \nbacks on the people who helped fuel the strong economy in the\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\n1990s. We owe them more for making this country successful and \nprosperous. We owe them a strong secure safety net when they lose their \njobs through no fault of their own. Thirteen additional weeks of \nunemployment benefits is only a small tribute to the strength and \nperseverance of the American worker, and I am disappointed that this \nCongress has once again denied them the respect they deserve.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation to \nextend Federal emergency unemployment benefits to the millions of \nAmericans who have exhausted their regular benefits.\n  I strongly believe that, given the state of the economy, Congress has \nan obligation to extend the Federal Temporary Extended Unemployment \nCompensation, TEUC, program before we leave for the Memorial Day \nrecess. This is especially urgent when considering the U.S. Department \nof Labor has estimated that by the end of 2003 more than 2.1 million \nworkers will have exhausted their State unemployment compensation \nbenefits without finding work. In my State of Maine, almost 11,000 \nunemployed Maine workers are projected to exhaust their State and \nFederal unemployment benefits in the next 6 months and more than one-\nquarter of these workers, 26 percent, will have exhausted all benefits \navailable under the extension and still be unable to find work.\n  The bill before us today is similar to Senator Murkowski's \nlegislation, S. 1079, of which I am a cosponsor, and is an extension of \nthe current Federal TEUC program due to expire at the end of May. H.R. \n2185 will extend TEUC for an additional 7 months, to December 31, 2003, \nand will provide benefits to an estimated 2.1 million Americans.\n  But we must think of these many millions of unemployed Americans as \nmore than just numbers. In Maine, they live in towns like Millinocket, \nOld Town, and Sanford, where large, established employers have either \nclosed their doors or downsized, and in the process forced longtime \nworkers onto the unemployment rolls. If the program is not extended, \naccording to the Maine Department of Labor, 6,000 Maine workers will \nexhaust their State unemployment benefits without ever receiving any \nFederal benefits. Extending temporary Federal benefits is particularly \nimportant for hard-hit mill towns like Millinocket, where every store \nand every landlord has been affected by the layoffs. The TEUC program \ncan get help to those individuals and those communities that need it \nmost.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I believe that it is critical for Congress \nto continue to provide the temporary support to families who have been \nhurt by the economic downturn, and give these families access to the \nresources they need to stay afloat until they can find new, gainful \nemployment. As such, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Senate version \nof H.R. 2185, and urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7110-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION AMENDMENTS OF 2003\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If I might, I appreciate very much the consideration of the \nSenator from South Carolina because we have not finished his amendment. \nWe failed to tell him that the Senator from Alaska was going to offer \nthis request.\n  This is, as I understand it, the House passed unemployment insurance \ncompensation action; is that true?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection.\n  We are very grateful this is completed.

DOMENICI'S TWELVE-THOUSANDTH VOTE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, may I have the attention of the Senate. On \nthe last rollcall vote, No. 201, the one we just completed, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from New Mexico, current chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, and the former long-serving \nchairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Pete V. Domenici, cast his \ntwelve-thousandth vote in this Chamber--12,000 votes.\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\n  (Applause, Senators Rising.)\n  Senator Domenici now joins a very historic and select club of \nSenators who can claim this distinction. Senators now cast more votes \nin each Congress than they did in the past. So while historical records \nare not perfect, our Senate Librarian says we are safe to conclude that \namong all Senators who have served since the beginning of the Republic, \nSenator Domenici is in a class of only ten.\n  Since the beginning of the Republic, only Nine other U.S. Senators \nhave similarly cast more than 12,000 votes in their careers in the \nSenate. Five of them are serving today. The Club of Nine now becomes \nthe Club of Ten with Senator Domenici's last vote today.\n  The Club of Nine has been: Senator Claiborne Pell; Senator William \nRoth; Senator William Proxmire; the current President pro tempore, \nSenator Ted Stevens; Senator Edward Kennedy; Senator Daniel Inouye; \nSenator Ernest Hollings, Senator Strom Thurmond; and--with over 16,685 \nvotes--the all-time record, Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  Senator Domenici, I know I speak for all of your colleagues, all of \nyour fellow Senators, when I say: Congratulations on this achievement. \nBut, more importantly, thank you for your tremendous service over the \nyears to New Mexico, to your country, and, most importantly, to the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  I thank you very much. I know people are ready to catch airplanes, \nand we are on a time schedule, and I should say only a couple of words, \nif any. So I will say that sometimes it seems as if I am just starting. \nSometimes late at night, it seems as if I have been here forever. I \ndon't know how my wife, who is watching, is taking this. It may be that \nshe might be thinking it is going to come to an end soon and perhaps we \nwill not be here any longer. I hope not.\n  But let me say to all of you: Thank you for your kind words. But, \nmost of all, thanks to the Senate. It did not take 12,000 votes to \nlearn how to be a Senator but it took some time. Once you get there, \nyou know you are. Once you are a Senator, there is just nothing like \nit. Once you know what the Senate is, you know there is nothing like \nit. I have been given enough time for both.\n  I believe I know how to be a Senator, and I believe I know what the \nSenate is. Both have been heralded and written about. Whatever it is \nthat has been said is all true. It is a rather fantastic place. You \ncannot serve with a greater group of people. There is no conceivable \nway that I, as an American, could spend time with 100 men and women of \nthe caliber that we have here, whatever that is in terms of their \nvariety of skills, measures, and attributes; and that is for sure.\n  With that, and for that, I thank all of you. In particular today, for \ndoing this, I thank our distinguished majority leader.\n  Thank you very much.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in the interest of time--I want to turn to \nthe Democratic leader for his comment--but I have asked all of our \ncolleagues to withhold further comments on this celebration, to submit \nthem for the Record or to give them after we complete the voting today. \nWe are trying to keep the bill moving.\n  Again, I want the Democratic leader to comment but then I do ask our \ncolleagues to wait to speak on this celebration. They will have an \nopportunity to do so later.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all Senators \nwishing to make statements regarding Senator Domenici be allowed to do \nso, and at such time as they are completed, that they be put in a \nproper cover and given to Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I add my heartfelt congratulations, as \nwell, as we celebrate this special moment in the distinguished career \nof our friend and colleague, Senator Domenici.\n  It was Teddy Roosevelt who once said: Life has no blessing like that \nof the ability to work hard at work worth doing. No one knows that \nbetter than Senator Domenici. He has worked hard at work worth doing \nnow for all of these years.\n  I remember I was a young staff person in 1973, and he was a newly \nelected Senator from New Mexico, formerly the mayor of Albuquerque. \nEven back then many of us recognized--because of his intelligence, his \ngood will, and the way he was able to demonstrate his ability to work \nacross the aisle--that we would have the good fortune to work with him \nfor a long, long time.\n  He has now cast more votes than 1,877 of our colleagues, including \nmost of us on the Senate floor.\n  As we mark this occasion--knowing he has many more years to go, \nknowing he has many more thresholds to break--we congratulate him, we \nwish him good fortune, and we recognize this extraordinary achievement \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor and, again, congratulate him heartily.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have three Senators who are seeking \nrecognition to offer amendments. Senator Dorgan has an amendment that \nwill take 10 minutes; Senator Harkin, 10 minutes; and Senator Durbin, 5 \nminutes. They will all ask for a voice vote on their amendments. \nFollowing that, we will be ready to go to final passage.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, could I ask unanimous consent those be the \nonly amendments in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ROBERTS). Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me also congratulate my colleague from \nNew Mexico: A hearty congratulations to you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 837\n\n  Mr. President, I know airplanes are waiting and jet engines are \nidling, and there are some Members wishing to leave this Chamber \nquickly.\n  Let me, in a matter of a couple minutes, say a word about the \nnational debt and then about the trade debt.\n  We worry a lot about the national debt, as a result of budget policy \nin the Congress. So we actually come to the Congress, and we come to \nthe floor of the Senate, and we vote on putting a limit on Federal \ndebt. We have a debt limit. However, there is another debt, and there \nis no limit on that debt. I am referring to the foreign debt--the debt \nthat results from trade deficits.\n  We have a Federal budget deficit this year that is expected to be \nsomewhere around $317 billion. That is the current estimate. But if \nlast year's figures are any guide, our trade deficit this year will be \nmuch higher than the federal budget deficit, well over $435 billion. \nAnd that trade deficit means an increase on our foreign debt.\n  There is no limit on the foreign debt. Whatever it is, it is. \nWherever it goes, it goes. That is just the way we, apparently, have \ndecided to live with it as country, for as long as we can get away with \nit.\n  Well, in my judgment, we ought to have some basic limitation with \nrespect to trade debt, or at least some mechanism that triggers actions \nif the trade debt exceeds a certain level.\n  My amendment, which I have at the desk, would say that when U.S. \nforeign debt exceeds 25 percent of GDP, or the trade deficit exceeds 5 \npercent of the GDP, it triggers the following: USTR will be required \nto, within 15 days of such a breach, convene an emergency meeting of \nthe Trade Policy Review Group, and within 45 days present to Congress, \nfrom that group, a report detailing the Trade Policy Review Group's \ntrade deficit reduction plan.\n  My feeling is we ought to have some basic limitation on what we are \ndoing with respect to international trade. I do not suggest we put \nborders around this country or we, in any way, inhibit trade. But trade \nneeds to be fair trade--and it is not.\n  As shown on this chart, this is what has been happening to our trade \ndeficit. The ink is all red and it is escalating at a very serious \nrate.\n  Let me use one example to show the absurdity of what is happening in \ninternational trade. It involves the country of South Korea.\n  I just picked this but I could pick China, Europe, Japan, Canada, \nMexico. I just happen to pick South Korea.\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\n  In 2001, Korea shipped 618,000 vehicles into our country--Hyundais, \nDaewoos, etc.--all around our country. Do you know how many cars we \nwere able to ship to South Korea? We shipped 2,800 American cars to \nSouth Korea.\n  Why is that the case? South Korea does not want our cars sold in that \ncountry. They put up every kind of imaginative trade barrier you can \nthink of.\n  We just had an example in the first part of this year with the Dodge \nDakota pickup. Daimler-Chrysler started to sell the Dodge Dakota pickup \nin Korea. They were actually fairly successful. They had 60 orders in \nFebruary and they had 60 orders in March. They don't make a pickup that \nis equivalent to the Dodge Dakota in South Korea. So at an annualized \nrate, that would have been almost a 50-percent increase in U.S. car \nimports alone in that country just with the Dodge Dakota pickup.\n  Guess what happened.\n  In March, an official from the Ministry of Construction and \nTransportation decided: Enough of those Dodge Dakotas. He said people \nwere going to put optional cargo covers on them and that might make \nthem dangerous if passengers rode in the back. He announced that cargo \ncovers on pickups and Dodge Dakotas are illegal. South Korean \nnewspapers had big headlines: ``Government Ministry Finds Dodge Dakota \nCovers Illegal.''\n  Guess what happened. Immediately, Korean customers cancelled their \norders for Dodge Dakotas. And all of a sudden, we were not selling \nDodge Dakota pickup trucks in Korea anymore. So here we are, 618,000 \ncars headed to the United States, and we only get to sell 2,800 in \nKorea.\n  I could talk about China and wheat, Europe and beef, Canada and \ndurum. I could talk about Mexico. I don't have the time today because \nseveral of you want to leave. I respect that. But I do want to at least \noffer this amendment. I will accept a voice vote.\n  I will come back with this amendment because this country ought to \nhave the spine to stand up for fairness in trade. One of the reasons we \nare hemorrhaging in red ink is that trade circumstances with our major \ntrading partners are simply not fair to American producers and to \nAmerican workers. We need to change this.\n  We can attempt to ignore this forever, but we do it at our peril. You \ncan make a case that budget deficits we owe to ourselves, and we will \nrepay ourselves. You cannot make a similar case with the trade deficit. \nWe inevitably will repay a trade deficit with a lower standard of \nliving in the United States. This country should be about the business \nof having fair trade, requiring fair trade, and requiring enforcement \nof existing trade agreements.\n  I have a lot more to say. I will say it at some future time.\n  I ask that the amendment be called up. It is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 837.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To impose limits on United States foreign debt)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. FOREIGN DEBT CEILING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has become the world's largest net \n     debtor Nation, having run up massive trade deficits in the \n     1990s.\n       (2) At the end of 2001, the net United States foreign debt \n     stood at over $2,300,000,000,000.\n       (3) The United States foreign debt position worsened in \n     2002, when the United States had a record trade deficit of \n     over $436,000,000,000, equivalent to 4.1 percent of the \n     United States GDP that year.\n       (4) The large and growing United States foreign debt \n     represents claims on United States assets by foreign \n     nationals, which will eventually have to be repaid. If \n     unchecked, the foreign debt could seriously undermine our \n     children's future standard of living.\n       (5) Moreover, the growing accumulation of foreign claims on \n     United States assets, including nearly $1,200,000,000,000 in \n     United States Treasury securities, makes the United States \n     economy vulnerable to the whims of foreign investors.\n       (6) Congress presently places a ceiling on United States \n     public debt, but does not place a ceiling on United States \n     foreign debt.\n       (7) Just as Congress recognized the importance of placing a \n     ceiling on the United States public debt, it is appropriate \n     that Congress place a limit on the United States foreign \n     debt.\n       (b) Actions Triggered by United States Foreign Debt.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than the 15th day of the second \n     month after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 3 \n     months thereafter, the United States Trade Representative \n     shall determine if--\n       (A) the net United States foreign debt for the preceding \n     12-month period is more than 25 percent of United States GDP \n     for the same period; or\n       (B) the United States trade deficit for the preceding 12-\n     month period is more than 5 percent of United States GDP for \n     the same period.\n       (2) Action by ustr.--Whenever an affirmative determination \n     is made under paragraph (1) (A) or (B), the United States \n     Trade Representative shall--\n       (A) within 15 days of the determination, convene an \n     emergency meeting of the Trade Policy Review Group to develop \n     a plan of action to reduce the United States trade deficit; \n     and\n       (B) within 45 days of the determination, present to \n     Congress a report detailing the Trade Policy Review Group's \n     trade deficit reduction plan.\n       (c) Measurement of Foreign Debt.--\n       (1) Statistical sources.--For purposes of the calculations \n     described in subsection (b)(1), the United States Trade \n     Representative shall rely on the most recent period for which \n     the following data, published by the Department of Commerce, \n     is available:\n       (A) In the case of United States foreign debt, the United \n     States Trade Representative shall use the net international \n     investment position of the United States, with direct \n     investment positions determined at market value, as compiled \n     by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n       (B) In the case of the United States trade deficit, the \n     United States Trade Representative shall use the goods and \n     services trade deficit data compiled by the United States \n     Census Bureau.\n       (C) In the case of the United States GDP, the United States \n     Trade Representative shall use the nominal gross domestic \n     product data compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n       (2) Adjustment.--The United States Trade Representative may \n     adjust the data described in paragraph (1) to ensure that the \n     determination is made for comparable time periods.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any Senator wish to speak to the \namendment? The distinguished Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak in opposition to the \namendment. I think the information the Senator from North Dakota wants, \nand wants in one document or one report, is a very legitimate bit of \ninformation, not just a small bit but a legitimate amount of \ninformation that he wants, and it is a reasonable request. I think a \nlot of it exists in the Department of Commerce and maybe it is just a \ncase of bringing it all together. But that can't be the issue today. \nThe issue today is, if we amend this bill, it goes back to the House, \nand then we are in a situation where we are not able to operate \nGovernment. We can't wait until the month of June to get a conference \nwith the House on this issue. The Secretary of Treasury has made it \nvery clear that he has taken all prudent and legal steps available to \nhim to avoid reaching the statutory debt limit.\n  I urge everybody to vote against the amendment regardless of the \nmerits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will take a voice vote and say, this \namendment will be visiting the floor of the Senate again soon on \nanother matter. I appreciate the comments from the Senator from Iowa. I \nbelieve this is an important issue. I hope my colleagues will support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n837.\n  The amendment (No. 837) was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 838\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the debt resolution that we have before us \nraises the debt limit by $984 billion--a record, the biggest ever in \nthe history of the United States. What does that mean for the average \nAmerican family? It means we are adding the equivalent of $3,500 to the \ncredit card of every man, woman, and child in America. For a family of \nfour, you just got $14,000 added to your family's debt. These are\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\nnew charges. That is just what we are about to vote on here. This is \nthe new debt on top of the old debt. Now that is the debt.\n  How about the interest charges? Under the President's budget, we will \nsee interest on the debt rise from an estimated $240 billion this year \nto $514 billion in 10 years under the assumptions of the budget pushed \nthrough by the majority that closely followed the President's plan in \nmany respects. That is $1,800 a year for every person in the country. \nThat is just on the interest, $7,200 a year for a family of four in \n2013 and higher sums thereafter. The ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from Montana, said it right: We are imposing, \nNo. 1, a debt tax on our children and grandchildren. But we are also \nimposing an interest debt tax on our families.\n  We just went through this whole thing about this tax bill that skews \neverything to the wealthy. We all know that. Yet what about our \nfamilies? I am sure they will say: We got some good things for \nfamilies. We got a little marriage penalty thing there; we have a child \ncredit, all that. But in 10 years, the interest just on the debt we are \nvoting on today will be $7,200 a year for a family of four, right out \nof their taxes, $7,200 a year. Tell me about how much we have helped \nour families with this crazy tax bill we just passed this morning?\n  And right now, I think the vote we are about to take on this debt \nbill says it all. Tax cuts for those at the top, a few little things \nfor working families, but we are going to gouge the working families of \nthis country by making them pay the interest on the national debt--\n$7,200 a year for a family of four, just on the interest.\n  More and more every year we go down the pike, more and more of the \ntaxes that our hard-working Americans pay will go for what? To pay the \ninterest on the national debt. Will we get any more education? No. Will \nwe pay our teachers better? No. Will we invest more in medical \nresearch? No. Will we have better prescription drugs for the elderly? \nNo. We won't do all those things because it is going to go to pay the \ninterest on the national debt. That is what we are about to vote on \nright here.\n  Just the other day I went over to the Cannon House Office Building. \nThey had a big demonstration there of fuel cells, renewable energy. \nThat is what we ought to be investing in. That is what the Government \nshould be investing in to make us energy independent. Guess what. We \nwon't put the resources into that important need like we should. We \nwill dribble a little bit here and there, but we won't do it right. \nWhy? Because we are paying interest on the national debt. And why are \nwe raising the debt? Because we have this big tax cut. Why do we have \nthis big tax cut? It does please the wealthy contributors of the \nRepublican Party. That is a part of it.\n  Now we are going to vote to increase the national debt, put it on the \nbacks of every man, woman, and child in the Nation.\n\n  Well, there is one other thing. Because of this exploding debt and \nthe interest on the debt that we will have to pay, it is a threat to \nthe solvency of Social Security and Medicare. The President's tax plan \nis larger, if made permanent, then the entire 75 year estimated \nshortfall in both Social Security and Medicare. Later this year, the \nPresident says he wants us to work a prescription drug benefit for the \nelderly for $400 billion. He is going to squeeze everybody into HMOs \ntype organizations. Why? Because we don't have enough money to pay for \na good plan because it is going to pay the interest on the national \ndebt so we can cover outrageous giveaways to the very wealthy.\n  I might talk about Medicare fairness. We voted this week on an \namendment offered by my colleague from Iowa to take care of some \nMedicare fairness. Eighty-six Senators voted for it. It was not in the \nPresident's plan. The President said, no, we can't do that now. It is \nsqueezing everything out.\n  I want to talk about the specifics of my amendment, to provide for a \ntrue cost of tax bills requirement. The official score or estimate of \nwhat the tax bill is supposed to cost is $350 billion. But, that is not \nwhat really occurred. Don't take my word for it, take the word of the \nSpeaker of the House. This was in Congress Daily today:\n\n       Although the $350 billion tax cut bill moving toward \n     President Bush's desk is half of the original request, House \n     Speaker Hastert told Congress Daily Thursday that the final \n     package incorporates key features of the House plan. ``The \n     350 billion number takes us through the next 2 years \n     basically,'' Hastert said. ``But also it could end up being a \n     trillion-dollar bill because this stuff is extendable. That \n     is a fight we are going to have to have, and it is not a bad \n     fight to have.''\n\n  There you go. It is not $350 billion. It is closer to $1 trillion. \nThe editorial in the Washington Post this morning said the same thing.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, if we keep \nthese tax breaks going, the total cost will be a minimum of $815 \nbillion. And now, after all of that, what are we asked to do? Go to the \nwell and vote for the largest increase in the national debt ever held \npaying for this tax break for the wealthy.\n  My amendment is very simple. I call it the ``telling the true cost of \nthe tax bill'' requirement. The premise is that Congress and the \nAmerican people should know the real cost of major tax provisions--not \nthe Enron kind of budgeting we have had for this tax bill.\n  My amendment would require the Joint Tax Committee to reveal the true \n10-year cost of provisions in the tax bill that cost over $1 billion a \nyear when fully in effect. In other words, to show the full cost, the \nJoint Tax Committee would provide true costs regardless of the variety \nof gimmicks we have seen used in the 2001 tax bill, as well as the tax \nbill being passed this morning.\n  If a provision sunsets early, the cost will be provided as if it is \nin place for the full 10-year period. That is what this amendment does. \nI have the amendment here. I will send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 838.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Requiring estimates of certain decreases in Federal revenues \n               for periods after the decrease is sunset)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. ____. TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT THE LONG-TERM COST OF TAX \n                   CHANGES.\n\n       (a) In General.--If the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     prepares an estimate of any applicable proposed change in \n     Federal revenue law, the committee shall include with such \n     estimate an estimate of the decrease in Federal revenues \n     which--\n       (1) in the case of an applicable proposed change described \n     in subsection (b)(1), would have occurred without regard to \n     the reduction or termination described in such subsection \n     during the portion of the period covered by the estimate \n     after the reduction or termination, and\n       (2) in the case of an applicable proposed change described \n     in subsection (b)(2), will occur during the 10-fiscal year \n     period beginning with the fiscal year following the first \n     fiscal year in which the proposed change becomes fully \n     effective.\n       (b) Applicable Proposed Change.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``applicable proposed change'' means any of \n     the following proposed changes in Federal revenue law:\n       (1) Sunset or reduced changes.--Any proposed change which--\n       (A) when fully effective will have an estimated decrease in \n     Federal revenues of more than $1,000,000,000 in each fiscal \n     year, and\n       (B) provides for the termination of such change, or a \n     reduction in such revenue decrease, on or before the close of \n     the period covered by the estimate which the Joint Committee \n     on Taxation is otherwise preparing for such proposed change.\n       (2) Delay in full effect.--Any proposed change which--\n       (A) becomes fully effective at any time during the last 4 \n     years of the period covered by the estimate which the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation is otherwise preparing for such \n     proposed change, and\n       (B) when fully effective will have an estimated decrease in \n     Federal revenues of more than $1,000,000,000 in each fiscal \n     year.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as well intentioned as the amendment is \nto bring information to the Congress from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, to bring a greater degree of transparency to where we are on \ncertain tax legislation, I have to ask my colleagues to vote against \nthis amendment because if it were adopted, it would force the bill back \nto the House\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\nand we would not be able to fund Government. We would also have a \nsituation of having to have a conference. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any other Senator wish to speak on the \namendment?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, look, one more time. The reason we cannot \nhave amendments to this bill is because the House has gone home? We are \ngoing to have the biggest increase in the national debt this country \nhas ever seen and the House went home? That is why we cannot amend it?\n  Please explain that to my constituents in Iowa, or anywhere in the \ncountry, that somehow it makes sense that we cannot amend it because \nthe House went home and we are going to have the biggest increase in \ndebt in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 838) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 839\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 839.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a CBO report on any new debt created by a budget \n        resolution upon the reporting of that budget resolution)\n\n       At the end of the resolution, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. CBO REPORT ON DEBT IMPACT OF BUDGET RESOLUTION.\n\n       Section 301 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 \n     U.S.C. 632) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) CBO Debt Impact Report.--Each budget resolution \n     reported out by the Committee on the Budget of the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate shall be accompanied by a \n     report from CBO containing CBO's best estimate of the \n     following:\n       ``(1) The amount of new debt subject to limit, in aggregate \n     and divided by the most recent estimate of the United States \n     population, according to the Bureau of the Census, that would \n     be created if the budget resolution is adhered to, assuming \n     reserve funds are spent and reconciliation instructions are \n     fully complied with.\n       ``(2) The amount of new debt subject to limit, if any, in \n     aggregate and divided by the most recent estimate of the \n     United States population, according to the Bureau of the \n     Census, that would have been created if the budget resolution \n     simply reflected the CBO baseline without policy changes.\n       ``(3) The difference between paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       ``(4) Of the amount determined in paragraph (3)--\n       ``(A) the amount of new debt subject to limit, in aggregate \n     and divided by the most recent estimate of the United States \n     population, according to the Bureau of the Census, that is \n     attributable to tax changes; and\n       ``(B) the amount of new debt subject to limit, in aggregate \n     and divided by the most recent estimate of the United States \n     population, according to the Bureau of the Census, that is \n     attributable to policy changes other than tax changes.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, the once proud Senate is no longer \na voice, it is an echo--an echo of a bygone era when giants in the \nSenate strode the halls of this great institution. But not today. On \namendment after amendment after amendment, we are told that the Senate \nis voiceless, the Senate is powerless, the House has left and there is \nnothing we can do. We have turned into a unicameral legislature before \nyour eyes.\n  Now a majority of the Senators parade in the halls of this great \ninstitution with signs that read ``me, too,'' signs that read ``the \nHouse of Representatives knows best,'' signs that read ``the Senate no \nlonger has time to think or to act. We just do what the House tells us \nto do.''\n  No matter how good the suggestion or amendment on the floor of the \nSenate today, it has been summarily rejected by the majority. Efforts \nto protect Social Security, rejected; efforts for accountability in \nbudgeting, rejected; efforts for accountability of this White House and \nfuture Presidents, rejected. Why? Because the House told us to take it \nor leave it.\n  Well, I have hope for the Senate and the Members. I give you an \namendment now that you can embrace to show you still believe in the \nSenate as it once reigned on Capitol Hill, embrace because you \nunderstand that on its face it is so logical, straightforward, so easy \nthat you can embrace this amendment with the full knowledge that when \nyou vote on final passage and go home, at least once today you stood up \nfor the dignity of this great institution; at least once today, you \nthought for yourself; at least once today, common sense prevailed.\n  What does this amendment do? It simply calls for accountability. Once \neach year, the CBO will tell us what our actions have done to add to \nthe national debt. It will tell us whether tax increases are going to \ncreate more debt for our children. It will publish that number and put \nit into terms so every single American will know whether we have \nincreased the mortgage on America for our children and grandchildren to \ncarry. That is it. It is so simple, straightforward.\n  My friend from Iowa, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nfrom that commonsense bastion in the Midwest, that great State of Iowa, \nI know he believes in accountability, he believes in standing up for a \nreport card on Congress, and that he will stand with me shoulder to \nshoulder, bipartisan, proud to tell the American people what we have \ndone, proud to admit to the American people if we have added to their \ndebt. I know he will be with me on this and he will break the shackles \nof the House of Representatives, and we will finally come together in a \nbipartisan fashion for the future of the Senate. I will applaud him for \nstanding in support of the amendment.\n  I am only going to ask for a voice vote because I know it is going to \nbe unanimous.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any other Senator wish to speak to the \nSenator's embracing amendment?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak the common sense of Iowa \nto the Senator from the political machine of Chicago and to express a \nsimple statement of fact: If, in fact, we had adopted the minority's \nbudget, the Democrat budget, earlier this year, we would be facing the \nexact same increase in the debt ceiling now and by almost the same \nexact amount of money throughout the rest of the year. So it doesn't \nmatter whether you are in the majority or we are, we would be doing \nabout the same thing right now. So don't try to fool the people of \nAmerica. You cannot do it even if you are from Chicago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Any other Senators wishing to be heard? The \nSenator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Chicago can handle itself, whether we are \nplaying Iowa in sports or in politics, but I ask my friend from Iowa, \nif you believe the deficits don't count, stand tall, stand proud, and \nadmit that to the American people. Just go ahead and tell them once a \nyear whether you have added to the national debt by the actions in \nCongress. It is that simple. It is a report card on what we do. I am \nsure the Senator from Iowa is in favor and doesn't want to leave any \ntaxpayer behind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 839) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further amendments to be \noffered, the question is on the third reading and passage of the joint \nresolution.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 51) was ordered to a third reading \nand was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, once again, I thank the chairman of the \nFinance Committee for his hard work yesterday and today. In addition, I \nthank all Members for their patience and cooperation throughout this \nlegislative period, a very productive few weeks of session. We have had \nbusy days and long nights. It was worth the effort.\n  The next vote will be the last vote prior to the Memorial Day recess. \nThe Senate will reconvene on Monday, June 2. However, no rollcall votes \nwill occur that day. Members can expect the next\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\nrollcall vote on Tuesday at approximately 12 noon. That vote most \nlikely will be in relation to an amendment to the energy bill.\n  I wish everyone a safe recess, and I look forward to working with \neverybody following this recess.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without Social Security, \n     forty-eight percent of beneficiaries would be in poverty \n     today.\n       (2) In order to protect benefit levels against inflation, \n     Social Security beneficiaries receive an annual cost-of-\n     living adjustment (COLA) based on Consumer Price Index for \n     Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).\n       (3) The January 2003 COLA provided only a 1.4 percent \n     increase in Social Security benefits, increasing the average \n     monthly benefit for all retired workers by only $13 (from \n     $882 to 895).\n       (4) Annual growth in Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket \n     health care costs for retired individuals on fixed incomes \n     far exceeded the small COLA increases provided to Social \n     Security beneficiaries.\n       (5) Reducing COLAs will disproportionately harm low-income \n     Social Security beneficiaries and push millions of seniors \n     into poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Social Security cost-of-living adjustments should not be \n     reduced.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I rise to ask my colleagues to join \nme in supporting the Medicare Vision Rehabilitation Services Act of \n2003. This is legislation I introduced in the Senate this past week to \ndeal with vision impairment, one of the most common disabilities \naffecting seniors today.\n  Millions of Americans currently have impaired vision. The number of \npeople in the United States with vision impairments continues to \nincrease. The vision impairment is a loss of vision that is not \ncorrectable by standard glasses, contact lenses, medicine or surgery. \nOne of the leading causes of vision impairment and blindness in the \nUnited States is age-related disease and that is why it is important we \nbegin to deal with this serious illness under our Medicare system.\n  Vision rehabilitation assists individuals with this serious vision \nloss so they can safely navigate in their own homes and within their \nlocal environments. Vision rehabilitation services help people avoid \nmedication errors, help them cook and use kitchen utensils safely, and \nhelp avoid burns and falls; in short, help them to be more independent \nin their own community and enable them to enjoy a better quality of \nlife.\n  Importantly, vision rehabilitation services promote safety and that \nall-important independence for our elderly. This legislation would \nensure that Medicare coverage for vision rehab\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\nservices would be made available to all of our elderly citizens in the \nUnited States.\n  It would make the coverage available nationwide. It would establish \nstrict qualifications in the Medicare Program for specially trained \nvision rehabilitation professionals who operate under physician \nsupervision and allow them to provide the highest possible quality \nservices in the home when deemed medically necessary.\n  One in five older Americans, over 7 million people, report some \ndegree of serious vision impairment. More than 700,000 older Americans \nare legally blind. According to the CDC, falls among older people cost \nthe Government more than $20 billion a year, and vision problems were \nspecifically cited as one of the leading causes of these falls. If only \none in five of the hip fractures due to vision impairment were \nprevented, each year the annual cost savings would be hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  Nearly anyone suffering from vision loss can benefit from vision \nrehabilitation services that can help patients make the most of \nwhatever vision they do have remaining.\n  Specifically, this bill takes a number of important actions. It \nestablishes national coverage under Medicare for the provision of \nrehabilitation services. It defines rehabilitation services as services \nprovided to a person with a vision impairment under a plan of care \ndeveloped by a physician, allowing these services to be furnished both \nin-office and in a patient's home. It defines a vision rehabilitation \nprofessional as well as setting out the educational criteria these \nproviders must have.\n  This legislation ensures payment under the existing physician fee \nschedule. That is important. There was an awful lot of work put into \ndeveloping this legislation, so we did not have to create a new or \nseparate physician fee schedule. The legislation also requires the \npatient care plan be developed by a physician in order to receive \nreimbursement under Medicare. That plan has to attest that vision \nrehabilitation services are medically necessary, and is a plan that \nperiodically is reviewed by a physician.\n  It is a strong, focused program that provides coverage for these very \nimportant services under Medicare. In over a 5-year period, the \nindependently estimated cost is less than $10 million--less than $10 \nmillion, to begin to address one of the leading causes of accidents \nthat disable our elderly citizens in their homes. It is less than $10 \nmillion over a 5-year period to increase independence, to increase \nquality of life, and to provide a better quality of care in a home \nsetting.\n  I think this is an important piece of legislation that can make an \nenormous difference for millions of older Americans under Medicare.\n  I do thank the cosponsors who have already agreed to support this \nlegislation--Senator Stevens, Senator McCain, Senator Collins, Senator \nBunning, Senator Specter, Senator Burns, Senator Allen, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Miller, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Cantwell, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Landrieu.\n  It is a strong, bipartisan coalition that will work throughout this \nyear to see that this legislation is signed into law, making a \ndifference by adding vision rehabilitation services to Medicare and \nmaking that difference in the lives of millions of elderly Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this coming Monday is the last Monday in \nMay. Since the adoption of the National Holiday Act, Public Law 90-363, \nthe last Monday in May has been celebrated as Memorial Day. The origins \nof Memorial Day extend far earlier than 1971, stretching back to the \nCivil War, when the practice of decorating the graves of fallen \nsoldiers became widely practiced in the United States. And in the \nearlier years, the people, particularly the people of the southern \nstates, celebrated this as Decoration Day.\n  Honoring the fallen in battle is an ancient custom, extending at \nleast to the ancient Greeks. Thucydides provides us with one example. \nIt was the custom in Athens to conduct an elaborate funeral for all \nthose killed in battle. A sacrifice would be made, the fallen laid to \nrest with ceremony, and then a funeral oration would be given. After \nthe first battles of the Peloponnesian War, the brilliant politician \nand general, Pericles, was the orator. He used his speech to honor the \ndead but also to pay homage to the state for which they had fought. His \nlove and admiration for Athens reflects the feelings of patriotism, \npride, and love for the United States that have swelled in our breasts \nsince the terrible events of September 11, 2001, and since the brave \nperformance put on by U.S. forces in Iraq this spring.\n  Pericles said, in part:\n\n     . . . fix your eyes upon the greatness of Athens, until you \n     become filled with the love of her; and when you are \n     impressed by the spectacle of her glory, reflect that this \n     empire has been acquired by men who knew their duty and had \n     the courage to do it, who in the hour of conflict had the \n     fear of dishonor always present in them, and who, if ever \n     they failed in an enterprise, would not allow their virtues \n     to be lost to their country, but freely gave their lives as \n     the fairest offering which they could present at her feast. \n     The sacrifice which they collectively made was individually \n     repaid to them; for they received again each one for himself \n     praise which grows not old, and the noblest of all tombs, I \n     speak not of that in which their remains are laid, but that \n     in which their glory survives, and is proclaimed always and \n     on every fitting occasion both in word and in deed. For the \n     whole earth is the tomb of famous men; not only are they \n     commemorated by columns and inscriptions in their own \n     country, but in foreign lands there dwells also an unwritten \n     memorial of them, graven not on stones but in the hearts of \n     men.\n\n  So in the hearts of every family reunited, every child now free to \nattend school, everyone of every faith now allowed to worship freely, \ndwell the unwritten memorials to American fighting men and women. In \nFrance, in Flanders field, in Belgium, in Austria, Sweden, all across \nEurope, in the Philippines and across Southeast Asia, still beat hearts \nthat remember the faces of American G.I.s who liberated them.\n  At home, as well, the fallen live on. In the hearts of their \nfamilies, in the caring hands that place poppies on graves in military \ncemeteries, in the flags snapping proudly in the breeze at doorsteps \naround the Nation, the Nation's fallen heroes are remembered. Without \nthem, our Nation and our history would be forever altered. Without the \nheroes of Bunker Hill and Lexington and Yorktown, we might still be a \nBritish colony. Without the heroes of Gettysburg and Appomattox, we \nmight not be a United States but two separate nations. Without the \nheroes of the Ardennes and Ypres, of Normandy and Tarawa, the globe \nwould be redrawn in very different shapes. Without the heroes at the \nYalu River and at Da Nang, the Iron Curtain might have encircled the \nglobe.\n\n  To each generation of heroes, we offer our silent thanks. And to the \nCreator, we must offer our prayers that the succeeding generations will \nbe equally brave and equally patriotic, as ready to meet the rigors and \nchallenges to come as are our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines \ntoday. We must hope that we bequeath to our future generations a nation \nworthy of such sacrifice, a nation, as Pericles proclaimed of Athens \n``. . . for whose sake these men nobly fought and died; they could not \nbear the thought that she might be taken from them; and every one of us \nwho survive should gladly toil on her behalf.''\n  The United States' guiding philosophy, our signal principles of \nfreedom, liberty, opportunity, of government by the people--these are \nthe enduring monuments of America's greatness. They are our greatest \ntreasure, to be guarded most jealously and defended most zealously. For \nthem have the fallen filled our military cemeteries. Even as we \ncontinue the so-called ``war on terror,'' we must guard against \nundermining our principles for the sake of some gossamer illusion of \nsecurity.\n  Our government must operate openly, before the view of the people. \nThe people's branch--here it is. The people's branch, the Congress, \nmust defend its prerogatives lest the Executive assume the powers of a \ntyrant. We must deal freely and fairly and honestly on the world stage, \nusing our strength for the common good and maintaining the friendship \nbuilt upon freely spilled blood and shared sacrifice. And we must treat \nour people as citizens, not\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\npotential terrorists, to be profiled and bugged and tapped and taped \nand held indefinitely without the full protections of the law. All the \nlaw enforcement techniques and technologies in the world will not \neliminate all risk. If we are to honor the greatness of our Nation and \nthe sacrifice of all those who have laid down their lives in her \ndefense, we must be careful not to frighten ourselves into some kind of \nquasi police state.\n  This Memorial Day, we honor the fallen from our wars by marking their \ngraves with flowers and flags. In life, they were just like us. They \ncame from all walks of life, from every State and territory, from farms \nand city streets. They were young, and funny, and brave. They were our \nchildren, our brothers and sisters, our fathers and mothers. They were \nmembers of many families and members of the American family. In death, \nthey are a silent reminder of the high price some must pay so that the \nrest of us might enjoy the benefits of living in this great Nation. Put \na flag or a flower down this weekend, but for the rest of the year, \nguard dearly the principles of the Nation they fought and died for. The \ngreatest and most lasting memorial to our Nation's dead is to cherish \nand pass what is best about our Nation.\n  I close with the words of Van Dyer in his poem ``America For Me.''\n  As schoolchildren, we all memorized this poem and others like it:\n\n     'Tis fine to see the Old World, and travel up and down\n     Among the famous palaces and cities of renown,\n     To admire the crumbly castles and the statues of the kings,--\n     But now I think I've had enough of antiquated things.\n\n     So it's home again, and home again, America for me!\n     My heart is turning home again, and there I long to be\n     In the land of youth and freedom beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n     Oh, London is a man's town, there's power in the air;\n     And Paris is a woman's town, with flowers in her hair;\n     And it's sweet to dream in Venice, and it's great to study \n           Rome,\n     But when it comes to living, there is no place like home.\n\n     I like the German fir-woods, in green battalions drilled;\n     I like the gardens of Versailles with flashing fountains \n           filled;\n     But, oh, to take your hand, my dear, and ramble for a day\n     In the friendly western woodland where Nature has her way!\n\n     I know that Europe's wonderful, yet something seems to lack!\n     The Past is too much with her, and the people looking back.\n     But the glory of the Present is to make the Future free,--\n     We love our land for what she is and what she is to be.\n\n     Oh, it's home again, home again, America for me!\n     I want a ship that's westward bound to plough the rolling \n           sea,\n     To the blessed Land of Room Enough beyond the ocean bars,\n     Where the air is full of sunlight and the flag is full of \n           stars.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

RES. 154\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 154 regarding the \nEuropean Union action against agricultural biotechnology, a resolution \nsubmitted earlier today by me and Senators Talent, Lincoln, Lugar, and \nBaucus. I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I object to \nthe request made by my good friend from Missouri, that land from which \nOld Crumb, that great hunting dog, came. I believe it is Warrensburg, \nMO, where that statue stands today, the statute of Old Crumb, that \ngreat hunting dog.\n  But I must on this occasion object. I do it at the behest of another \nSenator. I assure the distinguished Senator that I bear no ill will \ntoward him, certainly. But, on this occasion, I have promised that I \nwould object, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand how this place works. We knew \nthere was to be an objection. But we have submitted a resolution which \nwill be referred to committee because it is a matter of great \nimportance. While apparently 99 Senators did not have an objection, we \nwill have an opportunity when this matter is reported out of the \nappropriate committee to deal with what I think is a very serious \nissue.\n  This resolution before us today expresses strong support for \nPresident Bush's decision to stand up for our trade rights before the \nWorld Trade Organization. The action taken by our President is right on \nprinciple, right on law, right on science, and it is morally right.\n  Two years ago, the European Environment Commissioner, Margot \nWallstrom, told a news conference the following:\n\n       We have already waited too long to act. The moratorium is \n     illegal and not justified. The value of biotechnology is \n     poorly appreciated in Europe and there's a risk the \n     biotechnology industry will not develop.\n\n  In short, we could not have said it better. We appreciate the \nCommissioner's courage to be so candid.\n  Since reason has not prevailed in Europe, it is time for our \novertaxed patience to give way to the need to exercise our rights \nbefore the World Trade Organization. If the Europeans had been \nsatisfied to exist as a ``plant technology free zone'' without \naggressively attempting to influence other nations, this action would \nnot have become as imperative as it is.\n  Mr. President, this European ban on plant biotechnology is a lesson \nabout the serious harm that can come in the form of unintended \nconsequences. Too-clever politicians in Europe, coupled with the \nhysterical anticommercial activists, decided they could whip their \npublic into a frenzy and shield the European Union producers from U.S. \ncompetition by suggesting that the new technology is not safe.\n  Even perhaps more venal--if that is possible--certain leftwing \norganizations decided they could raise fears and cause unfounded scares \nin the public and raise money through solicitations to fund their own \nsalaries by spreading lies about the food that we in the United States \neat every day.\n  But now that the European Union politicians are listening to their \nscientists and realize that the technology is safe, they say they \ncannot accept it because their public is against it. In other words, \nthey now claim to be hostage to the misinformation they created and, \nindeed, fostered.\n  Consequently, we now have a major trade infraction. Our farmers have \nlost $300 million a year in corn exports. The European public doubts \nthe credibility of their science community. European investment in new \nplant science is in sharp decline. Their farmers do not have access to \nnew technology. Most importantly, world-renowned scientists are leaving \nthe European Union.\n  They are coming to Missouri, where our leading scientists, such as \nDr. Roger Beachy and Dr. Peter Raven, are hiring them and providing \nthem a refuge where they can practice their science free from the \nLuddite hysteria or ``Eurosclerosis'' from which they came.\n  But most tragically--most tragically--the countries in the developing \nworld have been frightened into refusing to feed their starving people \nthe food we have sent them--which is food we eat--because they fear the \nhysterical European rejection is more serious than death by starvation. \nWe have sent food, humanitarian efforts, to aid and keep these people \nalive. Unfortunately, their leaders have been frightened by Europeans \nwho say they will never import from them again.\n  Regrettably, I would say that Europe's fastest-growing exports are \nhysteria and underappreciated plant scientists. We would like Europe to \njoin us in our efforts to help feed the hungry in the world, not scare \nthe world into needless, wanton starvation.\n  I do not believe this is where the Europeans wanted to be when they \nstarted this nonsense but this is where it has predictably taken them.\n  This technology was developed, studied, tested, reviewed, approved, \nplanted on several hundred million acres over 7 years, rereviewed and \nreapproved,\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\nusing a strict and science-based system. We are basing our review on \nscience and on experience--lots of experience.\n  All of us in America today are eating the food that has been improved \nby genetic modification. We recognize that no technology will ever be \n100-percent safe. We must regulate this and other technologies \naggressively and thoroughly and scientifically. But this has been the \nmost scrutinized new food technology of our age--or any age--and it has \nbeen planted on several hundred million acres around the world for many \nyears. The naysayers still have not identified a single stomachache \ncoming from biotechnology, despite their desperate search.\n\n  Our findings are not unique in the world. The case we have taken \nagainst the EU is joined by the Governments of Argentina, Canada, \nEgypt, Australia, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico, New \nZealand, Peru, and Uruguay.\n  The U.S. National Academy of Sciences completed a report that \n``emphasized it was not aware of any evidence suggesting foods on the \nmarket today are unsafe to eat as a result of genetic modification.''\n  I can list those which agree with us: the World Health Organization, \nFrance's Academy of Sciences, the American Medical Association, the \nFrench Academy of Medicine, the Royal Society of London, the Brazilian \nAcademy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Indian \nNational Science Academy, the Mexican Academy of Sciences, and many \nothers.\n  Twenty Nobel laureates, including Dr. Norman Borlaug, known as ``the \nfather of the Green revolution,'' with whom I spoke earlier this week \non this subject, has come out in strong support. All of the major U.S. \nscientific societies are behind this technology. Dr. Patrick Moore, \nfounding member of Greenpeace and a trained biologist, said directly:\n\n       I believe we are entering an era now where pagan beliefs \n     and junk science are influencing public policy. GM foods and \n     forestry are both good examples where policy is being \n     influenced by arguments that have no basis in factor logic.\n\n  The scientific consensus on this matter is overwhelming. In this \ncountry, farmers, scientists, regulators, courts, shareholders, elected \nofficials, editorial boards, and consumers have all ratified the \nproduct and process and future of biotechnology in their own ways. For \nall practical purposes, it is a settled issue, and remains so.\n  In my office last week I had a South African cotton farmer who said \nthat new technology in a seed has changed his life. He now has a \nharvest. He produces profitably. He has a savings account. And now all \nhis neighbors are using that technology.\n  U.S. agriculture continues to be on the forefront of the application \nof modern science. In 1940, it took one farmer to feed 19 people. Now \none farmer feeds 129 people. But tragically, 800 million children in \nthe world remain hungry. New applications of biotechnology in the U.S. \nhave increased crop yields by 4 billion pounds, saved growers $1.2 \nbillion, and reduced pesticide use by 46 million pounds in the year \n2001 alone.\n  If wealthy citizens in Europe want to shop at trendy expensive food \nboutiques, that is their right, but their government should not be \npreventing the public from choosing their diet, and it most certainly \nshould not be discouraging the developing world from trying to eat well \nto grow and live a better life.\n  I am very proud of the work President Bush and Ambassador Zoellick, \nAdministrator Natsios, Under Secretary Larson, Ambassador Hall, and \nmany others have done to preserve the viability of this new technology. \nThe EU has made agreements with us to abide by rules they are now \nflagrantly ignoring. These promises should be kept.\n  I appreciate the cosponsors of this resolution, the support of farm \ngroups, including the National Corn Growers, Missouri Farm Bureau, and \nMissouri Soybean Association.\n  The best arguments on behalf of this are contained in Wednesday's \narticle in the Wall Street Journal by U.S. trade ambassador, Robert \nZoellick. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 21, 2003]\n\n                    United States v. European Union\n\n                        (By Robert B. Zoellick)\n\n       The U.S.--joined by Argentina, Canada and Egypt, and \n     supported by nine other countries--last week asked the \n     European Union to lift its moratorium on approving \n     agricultural biotech products, in accordance with the rules \n     of the World Trade Organization.\n       The world stands on the threshold of an agricultural \n     revolution. The science of biotechnology can make crops more \n     resistant to disease, pests and drought. By boosting yields, \n     biotechnology can increase farmers productivity and lower the \n     cost of food for consumers. It can help the environment by \n     reducing pesticide use and preventing soil erosion. And new \n     crops offer the promise of something greater still: foods \n     fortified with nutrients that could help stem disease--\n     including saving the eyesight of over 500,000 children who go \n     blind each year because they lack Vitamin A. Where food is \n     scarce, or climates harsh, increased agricultural \n     productivity could spell the difference between life and \n     death, between health and disease for millions. Biotech rice, \n     for example, is twice as resistant to drought and saltwater, \n     while withstanding temperatures about 10 degrees lower than \n     other varieties.\n       For almost five years, the EU has violated its own rules \n     and procedures--and disregarded the advice of its scientific \n     committees and commissioners--by arresting action on \n     applications for biotech food products. This moratorium \n     violates the EU's basic WTO obligations to maintain a food \n     approval process that is based on ``sufficient scientific \n     evidence'' and that acts without ``undue delay.''\n       Some Europeans have asked why the U.S. and its 12 partners \n     would not wait longer. Yet the European commissioners working \n     to lift the moratorium are the hostages of their member \n     states. As Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstrom \n     concluded last October: ``I have stopped guessing when the \n     moratorium would be lifted--[S]ome member states are \n     opposed--and will have to move the goal posts.'' We stopped \n     guessing, too.\n       As we have waited patiently for European leaders to step \n     forward and to deploy reason and science, the EU moratorium \n     has sent a devastating signal to developing countries that \n     stand to benefit most from innovative agricultural \n     technologies. This dangerous effect of the EU's moratorium \n     became evident last fall, when some famine-stricken African \n     countries refused U.S. food aid because of fabricated fears--\n     stoked by irresponsible rhetoric--about food safety.\n       As a major importer of food, Europe's decisions ripple far \n     beyond its borders. Uganda refused to plant a disease-\n     resistant type of banana because of fears it would jeopardize \n     exports to Europe. Namibia will not buy South Africa's \n     biotech corn for cattle feed to avoid hurting its beef \n     exports to Europe. India, China and other countries in South \n     America and Africa have expressed the same trepidation. \n     ``Thirty-four percent of the children [in Africa] are \n     malnourished,'' says Dr. Diran Makinde of the University of \n     Venda in South Africa. Yet Africans are told of biotech \n     crops: ``Don't touch them.''\n       For five years, the world has waited patiently, assured by \n     European officials that a change in policy is ``just around \n     the corner.'' But around every corner we have found a new \n     roadblock. First, we were asked to wait until new biotech \n     approval regulations were drafted. Then it was to wait for a \n     labeling scheme, then for rules on legal liability, and then \n     for new regulations on where biotech crops can and cannot be \n     planted.\n       While Europe has added barrier after barrier to fight \n     fictions, biotechnology has demonstrated benefit after \n     benefit based on facts. ``No till'' biotech farming has \n     reduced soil erosion by one billion tons a year. Over the \n     past eight years, biotech cotton and corn have reduced \n     pesticide use by 46 million pounds of active ingredients. The \n     Chinese Academy of Science estimates biotech could reduce \n     China's pesticide use by 80%.\n       Overwhelming scientific research shows that biotech foods \n     are safe and healthy--a conclusion that the EU's own \n     Directorate-General for Research reached two years ago. The \n     National Academies of Science and Medicine in France concur. \n     So do the scientific Academies of Brazil, China, India, \n     Mexico, the U.K. and the U.S. Dr. C.S. Prakash of Tuskegee \n     University presented me with a statement signed by more than \n     3,200 scientists world-wide, including 20 Nobel laureates, \n     supporting agricultural biotechnology.\n       Some claim that we are ``forcing'' biotech foods on \n     European consumers. Yet all we ask is for consumers to have \n     the right to make their own decisions, a right they are now \n     denied because the EU is blocking access to foods that EU \n     regulators and scientific associations acknowledge are safe. \n     The legal case for biotechnology is clear, the science \n     overwhelming, and the humanitarian call to action compelling. \n     We hope this debate will lead the EU to finally lift its \n     moratorium without imposing new barriers.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I join with many of my colleagues in commending the \nPresident and his team as they go to Europe aggressively to press their \ncase before the G-8 meeting in France next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\nBunning be added as a cosponsor of this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I spoke on this last night, and my friend \nand colleague from Missouri has covered the ground well, but I wish to \nsay a couple things that I think are important to emphasize.\n  The first is, it is becoming increasingly obvious to everyone around \nthe world that there is no reason, other than market protection, not to \npermit a biotech product into Europe. It is not bad for the \nenvironment. It is good for the environment.\n  In 2001 alone, biotechnology reduced the application of pesticides by \n46 million pounds in addition to reducing soil erosion and creating an \nenvironment more hospitable to wildlife.\n  It would be good for the environment of Europe and the world to allow \na biotech product there. It would be good for them, frankly, to start \nusing it in raising their own product.\n  It is also increasingly obvious that there is no safety hazard. \nPractically everybody in America has eaten biotech corn or product made \nfrom biotech soybeans. There has not been a single case or suspicion of \nanybody being hurt by it. And, of course, there would not be because \nproducers have been adjusting plant genetics for decades and decades \nand decades. This is just a new way of doing a very old and a time-\nhonored thing that is very important to the production of the \nagriculture and to the advancement of human welfare.\n  I congratulate the administration on filing this WTO action. It is, \nif anything, overdue. I congratulate my friend and colleague for his \ncomments. I hope the Senate can get behind the resolution just as \nquickly as possible and support the administration in this effort.\n  I know the support for biotech is bipartisan in this Chamber. I \nbelieve very strongly that it is overwhelming. I know we have tried to \ndo this quickly this week, and maybe too quickly. Maybe we will not get \nit done today but I hope we can get it done soon and the Senate can go \non record.\n  I close by saying, it is not just a question anymore of fairness and \nfair trade and the truth prevailing--as important as all those issues \nare. It is a question of hunger in the world. To me, the turning point \nwas when the European Union countries not only refused to take the \nbiotech product themselves, which I don't even think is defensible, but \nthen they began trying to convince African countries that are in danger \nof famine to turn down shipments of safe, nutritious U.S. humanitarian \nbiotech food aid.\n  This is now a question of trying to get food to people who are \nstarving. That is too much, even for the European Union. I think it is \ntime we said it. That is the point of this WTO action. That is the \npoint of our resolution. That is the reason my colleague from Missouri \nhas spoken on this important issue late at the end of this week. That \nis the reason I wanted to come down to the floor and join him in his \ncomments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before I begin, I should note my good \nfriend, the senior Senator from Missouri, is on the floor. He had to \nput a unanimous consent request earlier, knowing that under the \nprocedures we follow, it would be objected to by the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  I will tell my friend from Missouri that in my 29 years here, I have \nnever heard an objection so eloquently stated as was stated by the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia. I think of the number of times we \nall make these requests, and most of the time unanimous consent \nrequests are granted, as the Senator knows. For example, he recently \nmade one allowing the junior Senator to speak and for me to follow. I \ncan't help but think it would be nice if sometimes it wouldn't get so \nrancorous around here, if we could hear more of the words of Senator \nByrd in this regard. He included a history, geography and literature \nlesson, all in a simple ``I object.'' It makes life better.\n  I wish my friend from Missouri a good break, as I do my friend, the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer. He will soon, I am sure, be heading to \nNew Hampshire, as I will to Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7119-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7119-S7121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GLOBAL HEALTH AND THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on a far more serious \nmatter. I listened to the speech the President gave at the Coast Guard \nAcademy a few days ago. I must say that this Democrat agrees with so \nmany of the things the President said. I was especially pleased to hear \nhim speak about the importance of foreign aid to America's security. \nBut I became concerned after I looked behind the rhetoric of the \nPresident's speech. I wanted to see if the President's own budget \nrequest reflected his words. It does not.\n  At the Coast Guard Academy, the President spent a good deal of time \ntalking about the global AIDS crisis, the worst public health threat in \nhuman history. I commend President Bush for that. He has shown great \nleadership on AIDS, although a bipartisan group in Congress has been \npushing for action on AIDS for years.\n  The bill we passed last week, an authorization bill, authorized $15 \nbillion over 5 years to combat AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria. It is \nan important step forward. It showed that we are beginning to take the \nAIDS pandemic seriously. But before we all applaud ourselves and pat \nourselves on the back, let's have a dose of reality. This was an \nauthorization bill. It does not appropriate any money.\n  For all intents and purposes, it is like writing a check without \nenough money in the bank. I can recall a meeting on a different subject \nwhere someone was offering a pledge of close to $1 billion to fund an \ninitiative. Kidding around, I said: I will double that. I will give you \nmy check for $2 billion. In fact, I had $138 in a checking account.\n  That is what we have done here. By passing the AIDS authorization \nbill, we have promised to write a check without enough money in the \nbank.\n\n  Let me explain. The President's budget request contains only about \nhalf of the $3 billion authorized for AIDS for fiscal year 2004. It \nremains to be seen whether the promise of that bill--a promise with \nwhich I agree--will be fulfilled. To do that, the President is going to \nhave to submit a budget amendment for the balance of these funds.\n  It also remains to be seen whether the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee will get the allocation that supports that amount.\n  The bill we passed also authorized $1 billion for the global fund to \nfight AIDS and TB and malaria. Again, another promise. For fiscal year \n2004, the President has only budgeted $200 million for the Global Fund, \nthat is one-fifth of the amount we authorized. In addition, it is a cut \nof $150 million from what was appropriated last year.\n  There is another problem. While the President's fiscal year 2004 \nbudget for foreign operations does include approximately $1.2 billion \nto combat HIV/AIDS, it robs Peter to pay Paul to pay for increases in \nHIV/AIDS programs, as the President's budget cuts other essential \ninternational health programs anywhere from 5 to 63 percent.\n  Let's take a look at the chart. The information on this chart, \nincidentally, is from the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment.\n  Child survival and maternal health programs are cut by 12 percent. \nThese are the programs that provide lifesaving child immunizations. \nThey also help to reduce needless pregnancy-related deaths each year. \nPeople will be astounded when they hear how many of these types of \ndeaths occur each year. Six hundred thousand deaths. Many of these \ndeaths could be easily prevented if we just put more resources into \nthese programs. Instead, the President's budget cuts these programs by \n12 percent.\n  It would cut programs for vulnerable children by 63 percent.\n  It would cut programs to combat other infectious diseases such as \nmeasles.\n  Measles kill 1 million children--not 100,000 or 200,000--but 1 \nmillion children a year. Again, this is something which is easily \npreventable. Every one of us can just go to the doctor's office and get \nour children and grandchildren immunized against measles. In many poor \nnations, parents and grandparents do not have that luxury. They need \nour help.\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\n  Does the President's budget show leadership on this issue? No. It \ncuts the programs which help combat measles, as well as polio, SARS, \nand other deadly diseases by 32 percent.\n  These are not my numbers, these are the administration's numbers. \nThese numbers are in the President's budget.\n  Are we in favor of stopping children in poor countries from dying of \nmeasles? Of course we are. Are we in favor of fighting SARS? Of course \nwe are. Are we in favor of fighting polio? Of course we are. Who is \ngoing to say they are against it? No one.\n  But, when you look at this budget, there are cuts to these and other \ncritical international health programs. These cuts also include \nprograms for disease surveillance. In the past, these funds for disease \nsurveillance have been used to strengthen the World Health \nOrganization's ability to respond quickly to outbreaks like SARS.\n  Everybody in this Chamber knows we will have another outbreak of \neither SARS or, perhaps, something far worse. There is no question that \nwe need disease surveillance programs, because every one of these \ndiseases is just one airplane trip away from the United States. Why \nwould we want to cut funds for these programs?\n  The President's budget would also cut funds for drug resistance, \nwhich is a looming public health crisis. Many lifesaving antibiotics \nare already virtually useless because of resistance caused by the \nmisuse of these drugs. The President's budget cuts funds to combat drug \nresistance.\n  While the President's budget would increase funding to combat AIDS--\nalthough nowhere near the amount promised in the bill we passed last \nweek--it does so by cutting the budget for other global health \nprograms.\n  These cuts will hurt children the most in countries where vaccines \ncosting a few pennies make the difference between life and death. That \nis not acceptable.\n  If somebody said to us, look at those five children, you can save \ntheir lives by spending a dollar, would we do it? Of course, we would \ndo it. Why then does the President's budget do the opposite by cutting \nthese programs? I find this deeply troubling.\n  These are not Democratic or Republican programs. I have been joined \ntime and again by colleagues on the other side of the aisle who support \nthese initiatives in both the Senate and the House.\n  Mr. President, anyone who knows anything about public health knows \nthat building the health infrastructure in developing countries is \nessential if you are going to effectively combat AIDS. It is the same \nthing with child nutrition. It is the same thing with maternal and \nreproductive health. You don't fight AIDS in a vacuum. It isn't an \neither/or proposition. People who are malnourished, who are in poor \nhealth, who have weak immune systems, who are at risk of other \ninfections, are far more vulnerable to AIDS. It is common sense.\n  In addition to helping to combat AIDS, these international health \nprograms are vitally important for their own sake. They save millions \nof lives for very little money. They fight diseases that we eradicated \nin the U.S. years ago. When I was growing up, the municipal pool would \nclose in the summer because of polio. You never hear of such things \nanymore. We should be doing the same thing overseas with these types of \ndiseases--making them a thing of the past.\n\n  Over the past 5 years, we have built up these global health programs, \nand each year they yield more and more results. It would be \nunconscionable to cut these programs. But that is exactly what the \nPresident is asking Congress to do--cut these programs.\n  Last week, Republicans opposed our amendments to correct some serious \nproblems in the AIDS bill--problems they acknowledged. They said we \ncould not take time to get the bill right, because we needed to act \nquickly so the President could point to this bill as a sign of U.S. \nleadership at the Group of Eight meeting in France next month.\n  Let's be serious. If the White House had wanted, they easily could \nhave supported those amendments and made this a better bill. We also \ncould have made sure that this bill got to the President's desk in \nplenty of time. It is clear to me that the other side's opposition had \na lot more to do with political ideology than the President's travel \nschedule. And, that is simply not enough to justify the provisions in \nthe bill that are going to make it more difficult to prevent the spread \nof AIDS. As a result, the President will go to France with an AIDS bill \nthat is only half funded.\n  In addition, he is going to use that bill to urge other nations to do \nmore to fight AIDS. Now, I agree that other nations should do more. \nThis is not something the U.S. could or should do alone. But the world \nshould ask the President, the leader of the wealthiest nation on earth, \nwhether he is going to back up his own words with deeds.\n  When he asks others to do more, as he should, his own budget should \nnot slash funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS and for other \ninternational health programs. The world should also ask why the United \nStates is spending less than 1 percent on programs to combat poverty, \nincluding global health. After all, we are the wealthiest Nation on \nEarth. It is not only in our security interests, but also our moral \nresponsibility, to do more.\n  Mr. President, at the Coast Guard Academy, President Bush spoke about \nother important foreign aid programs, such as the Peace Corps, Famine \nFund, and the Millennium Challenge initiative. Not surprisingly, these \nare some of the programs his foreign aid budget favors.\n  But he did not mention that his budget not only slashes funding for \nglobal health but also for development assistance, which pays for \neverything from children's education, to agriculture research, to \ndemocracy building. His budget cuts food aid and assistance to \nrefugees--the world's most vulnerable people. And, we have all seen the \nimages of refugee camps around the world. People pushed from their \nhomes because of famine or war or natural disasters often end up living \nin horrendous conditions.\n  This is not compassionate conservatism. It may conserve money, but it \nis not compassionate. It is shameful.\n  More to the point, the President's national security strategy \nrecognizes the essential role of foreign aid. While we read about the \nimportance of foreign aid in his national security strategy, we don't \nsee it in his budget request.\n  Look at this chart. Food aid is cut by 17 percent. International \ndisaster assistance for floods and earthquakes and wars is cut by 18 \npercent.\n  We hear a lot of speeches on the floor talking about our moral \nresponsibility to the rest of the world.\n  While we may feel good about giving these speeches, I do not feel \ngood about the lofty rhetoric that bears little resemblance to reality. \nAnd, unfortunately, we have another great example of this in the \nPresident's budget request. Great speeches, bad reality.\n  The President should do what he says. He should do what he is asking \nothers to do. He should submit a budget amendment for the $3 billion \nauthorized to fight AIDS. He also should request the funds to prevent \nthe cuts to other vital global health programs.\n  Most importantly, he should start treating foreign aid for what it \nis: a critical investment in America's security. Less than 1 percent of \nthe Federal budget is used to combat the conditions that cause poverty \nand conflict around the world. This is woefully inadequate. It \nshortchanges America's future. It invites insecurity.\n  One would have thought that if September 11 taught us anything, it \nwas that business as usual is no longer tolerable. As I have said \nbefore, the President deserves credit for his Millennium Challenge \ninitiative. It provides some additional foreign aid funds.\n  But, I ask Senators to look behind the curtain to see how it is \nfunded. Some is new money. Sadly, the rest is from cuts to other \nessential programs.\n  And let's keep things in perspective. Before we congratulate \nourselves too much, let's remind everyone that the Millennium \nChallenge, on an annual basis, amounts to less than what my own little \nState of Vermont of 600,000 people spends on public education. That is \nnot a serious response to the challenges we face.\n  I also credit the President for his famine fund initiative, but I \nquestion what the real point is. He already has the authority he needs \nto respond to famines. The problem is that his fiscal year 2004 budget \nwould cut title II food aid by more than the amount the famine fund \nwould add. Again, robbing\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\nPeter to pay Paul. Unfortunately, both Peter and Paul are starving.\n  If we are going to lead, and especially if we are going to ask others \nto do more, we are going to have to stop playing shell games with the \nforeign aid budget. Leadership is good policy. Leadership means \nresources. Leadership means ideas. Leadership is not a press release.\n  Senator Feinstein, Senator Hagel, Senator Smith, and so many others, \nDemocrats and Republicans, have spoken out about the need for \nsubstantially more resources to protect America's interests abroad. \nWhen are we going to stop talking and start acting?\n  As I have told the President before, I would strongly support him on \nthese issues. But, I am not going to support empty rhetoric. I want to \nsee the money. It is one thing to go on foreign trips and talk to \nleaders and say: Look at this AIDS authorization bill I have. But, it \ndoes not make much sense if the money is not there. And, in this \nbudget, the money is not there.\n  I call on the President: Let's forget the politics. Let's come up \nwith the right ideas on AIDS. Let's come up with the right ideas on the \nMillennium Challenge Account. But, once we have the right policies, \nlet's put real resources behind these policies. And, to pay for these \nincreases, we should not cut programs for global health, disaster \nassistance, refugees, food aid, development assistance, and \nimmunizations.\n  Let's get rid of the rhetoric. Let's put some reality in there. If we \ndo that, then the United States can show the promise and the moral \nleadership a great Nation should show.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, last Wednesday marked an important day in \nthe progress of medicine and national policy. I am pleased to note that \non that day the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee voted \nunanimously to report out S. 1053, the Genetic Information \nNondiscrimination Act of 2003.\n  For more than 6 years, I have had the opportunity to work with \nSenators Snowe, Jeffords, Enzi, Gregg, Hagel, Collins, and DeWine on \nthis important legislation. I believe with the invaluable contributions \nof Senators Daschle and Kennedy that we brought to the forefront of the \ncongressional agenda solid legislation that will provide patients with \nreal protection against genetic discrimination in health insurance.\n  I will first express how much I appreciate the work of my colleague \non this issue, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Judd Gregg, who is \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. It is \nhis commitment and dedication to this issue that is primarily \nresponsible for getting us to this point of reporting out this Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination Act.\n  At this juncture, I also commend President Bush for his commitment to \nensuring strong protections against genetic discrimination and for \ncalling attention to this critical matter.\n  We began work on this issue many years ago. It was interesting when \nwe started this work----well, not many years, about 5 years ago. But \nwhen we started this work, it was way off in the future that we \nanticipated decoding of the human genome would actually occur, but we \nwere able to identify the problem, recognizing that the advances in \ntechnology, this unraveling of the genetic code, which was so \nrevolutionary in thought at the time, would indeed introduce new \nchallenges to the way we handled health information.\n  So we jump a few years later and now we can look back, and over the \nlast few weeks the complete decoding of the human genome has been \nannounced. That is about three billion bits of information that we did \nnot know about a year ago. Now we know.\n  Just last month, America celebrated two wonderful milestones in \nmedical science. Scientists working in collaboration with the National \nHuman Genome Research Institute at the NIH, National Institutes of \nHealth, published a final draft documenting that entire sequence of the \nhuman genetic code. The publication occurred more than 2 years ahead of \nschedule. I should also add, it came under budget. There are very few \nthings we do in Washington that are completed ahead of schedule and \nunder budget. This tremendous discovery, this unraveling of the genetic \ncode of the human genome, is one of them.\n  The publication of this occurred more than 2 years ahead of schedule, \nas I mentioned, but also almost 50 years to the day from the historic \npublication by two icons in terms of science, Dr. James Watson and Dr. \nFrancis Crick. The helix, called the DNA, which is a double helix----\nall of us have seen pictures of almost a figure 8, a three dimensional \nhelix which was described now a little over 50 years ago. The dazzling \naccomplishment of this decoding of the human genome has ushered in a \nnew era which we will see unfold over the next few years, next 5, 10 \nyears, which will enable us to better understand diseases, how the \nhuman body functions but, importantly, how diseases affect that \nfunctioning of the human body.\n  This decoding has also begun to expand our understanding of human \ndevelopment throughout life, health, and disease processes. \nSpecifically, the discovery of disease genes----that is, variations in \nthe genetic code that can be associated with the manifestation of \nsymptoms and what becomes disease----brings promises for hope for \nultimately not just prevention of those diseases but also treatment and \ncure. Scientists very likely will be able to design drugs to treat \nspecific genes or the manifestation of these genes. In my own field of \nheart and lung transplantation and other types of transplantation of \ntissues, organs may be specifically engineered for use in the field of \ntransplantation. Even preventive care, where we are woefully inadequate \nin terms of knowledge but also in application of that knowledge today, \nmay potentially be based in large part to genetic testing.\n\n  This potential explosion of knowledge, which is exciting to me as a \nscientist and as a physician, is also associated with risk. When I \nfirst joined my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, in \nthis effort several years ago, almost one-third of women who were \noffered a test for breast cancer risk--and this is a genetic test--at \nthe National Institutes of Health declined. They said, no. They say: I \nunderstand that test may be able to tell whether I will get breast \ncancer but I decline.\n  You ask why. They say: The only reason, and the reason I say no, is \nthe risk that information will be used by a health insurance company or \nan employer against me. What if that information got out?\n  I strongly believe then, as I do now, that we have an obligation, a \nresponsibility, to protect people from the threat that their genetic \ninformation can be used against them in any way. I would say that from \na medical standpoint, and from a societal standpoint, this is a moral \nresponsibility. It is a practical responsibility. If unchecked, the \nfear of genetic discrimination will prevent individuals from \nparticipating, whether it is in research studies, or in the gathering \nof information that can be used and applied more broadly to people, \neither in this country or indeed across the globe. It will prevent \npeople from taking advantage of the new technologies which can be and, \nin fact, almost certainly will be lifesaving. It will keep people from \ngetting tests, even from discovering that they are not at risk for \ngenetically related diseases. Also, the fear of genetic discrimination \nhas the potential to prevent citizens from making informed health \ndecisions.\n  If one does not have that information, they simply are not going to \nbe able to make informed health care decisions, whether it is in \nlifestyle or to determine whether or not they need an annual cardiac or \nheart catheterization once a year, or if they have the gene for breast \ncancer so that they would go and get mammographies more often. If they \nrefused to get the test because of\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\nthe fear of the discrimination, clearly they are not able to make \ninformed health decisions for themselves.\n  In the past, Congress has taken on the battle against broad \ndiscrimination in all sorts of legislation. We think back to the 1964 \nCivil Rights Act; to 1990, the American with Disabilities Act; more \nrecently to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n  Today, we extend those protections to citizens with genetic markers, \na move that has the power, I would argue, to save lives.\n  As I have implied, this whole field of genetic research and testing \nwill undoubtedly unleash thrilling advances and better health care. It \nwill lead almost certainly to cures for diseases that we cannot even \nimagine can be cured today. The potential medical advances that emerge \nfrom our knowledge and our understanding and that definition of the \nhuman genome that was spelled out just a couple of months ago, I know \nwill be more dramatic than the changes I have seen in over 20 years \npracticing medicine, that I witnessed in my own medical career. \nClearly, there will be much more advancing and pioneering than my dad \nsaw after 55 years practicing medicine from about the 1930s to the \n1980s.\n\n  As we greet the future, the excitement, the thrill of discovering \nwhat emerges from this new body of information, this definition of the \nhuman genetic code, we have a responsibility in this body to protect \nour body politic. I am pleased by the progress we have made thus far.\n  I come to the floor to speak today because I have watched this \ndebate, I have watched this discussion, and I have seen in a bipartisan \nway in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee tremendous \nprogress being made this past week, and hopefully it can be made in the \nSenate as we look at discrimination in genetic testing.\n  I congratulate my colleagues on their persistence and dedication to \nthe issue. It gives us an opportunity, in advance of there being a \nproblem, in advance of the new genetic tests, to address that potential \nfor discrimination which, in turn, if it occurred--and I believe there \nis a high likelihood unless we act--would be a disservice to mankind.\n  This legislation stands squarely on our time-tested civil rights laws \nestablishing comprehensive, consistent, practical, reasonable, and fair \nprotections. I strongly support this compromise bill. I am speaking \ntoday primarily because it is a compromise bill taking the very best \nout of the pieces of legislation that have been proposed in the past. I \nstrongly support this compromise bill. I look forward to its swift \npassage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7122-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EQUALITY IN HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I speak for a moment on the issue of \nequality in health care and what I have personally been able to \nobserve, which we as a body have tried to address--in fact, have taken \nsome major steps forward--but which stands as a major challenge which I \nbelieve we can address in this body. That is the subject of health care \ndisparities.\n  In the 21st century, Americans are among the healthiest, the longest \nliving, and robust citizens in the history of the world. We have \nconquered diseases that were once untreatable. Our remarkable \nscientists continue to develop new drugs, therapies, treatments, and \nprocedures that every day are bringing new hope and, indeed, saving the \nlives of millions around the country and millions around the world. We \nhave much of which to be proud.\n  At the same time, there is something we should be ashamed of because \ndespite the dazzling medical and social progress of the last century, \nthere remains wide health disparities and inequalities between minority \nand nonminority citizens. I will cite a few examples. Infant mortality \nrates are twice as high among African Americans versus Whites. The \nprevalence of HIV/AIDS in Latino populations is four times higher. And \nthe prevalence of AIDS among African Americans is nine times higher \nthan among Whites. African-American children are twice as likely to \nhave asthma. They are six times more likely to die from asthma than \nothers. And mortality rates related to diabetes are more than twice as \nhigh among African Americans and Native Americans.\n  The question is, why? We have made progress in understanding why, but \nwe cannot answer that question, Why? Even when we control our access to \nmedical services and we control for other socioeconomic factors, \nAmericans from minority backgrounds still receive unequal care. They \nsuffer lower quality care and, consequently, worse health outcomes. \nThat is the challenge. The response to that challenge is we can \neliminate that. We can reverse these health care disparities.\n\n  Progress has been made in recent years to close the health gap \nbetween minority and White patients. We are boosting Federal research \ninto the cause of health disparities. We are identifying barriers to \ncare in our communities. We are expanding the number of health \nprofessionals who have a strong commitment to the needs of minority and \nunderserved patients. Much more, however, needs to be done.\n  That is why I am proposing the Health Care Gap Act of 2003. This \nlegislation, which I plan to introduce later this year, builds on \nsuccessful prior legislation to ultimately eliminate such disparities \nin health care. This legislation will address key areas necessary to \nclose the health care gap in America. These include expanding access to \nquality health care, improving national leadership and coordination, \nincreasing the diversity of health professionals, promoting more \naggressive professional education, promoting research to identify \nsources of racial and ethnic disparities, identifying promising \ninterventions, and improving and expanding programs to prevent, too \nmanage, and to treat diseases and conditions that disproportionately \nimpact minority and underserved populations. As I mentioned in the data \nI quoted, these include asthma, they include HIV/AIDS, prostate cancer, \nand other types of cancer.\n  Last weekend, I have the privilege, as so many Members--in fact, many \nMembers departed an hour or so ago to deliver commencement speeches at \nhigh schools, elementary schools, secondary schools, colleges, and \ngraduate schools all over the country.\n  I had the privilege last week of speaking at two commencement \nceremonies. One was for the School of Medicine at Morehouse College in \nAtlanta, and also the George Washington School of Medicine here in the \nWashington area. In my address, I challenged these hard-working and \nyoung people--our future doctors, our future health professionals, our \nscientists--to become active, to actively shape and mold our \nprofession. I told them that in this day and time in the field of \nmedicine, we simply can no longer, as health professionals, solely \npractice medicine. They must lead in medicine. The same is true of us.\n  This bill on health care disparities, this legislation which will be \nintroduced later this year, will do just that. In the Senate, we must \nhelp to create a medical system that treats all patients equitably. Our \nnational creed, that all are created equal, dictates that we must.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7122-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7122-S7123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING BOB HOPE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I take a moment to honor a great American \nwho is celebrating his 100th birthday. Bob Hope was born one of six \nboys in a London suburb on May 29, 1903. His family made their way to \nAmerica when he was 3, and they settled in Cleveland, OH. We can only \nbe grateful to the Hope family for making that journey.\n  Growing up, Bob Hope was a shoeshine boy, butcher's mate, stock boy, \nnewspaper boy, golf caddie, shoe salesman, and even a prizefighter--all \nof these things before he became one of America's most beloved and \nsuccessful entertainers.\n  As a performer, Bob Hope had the rare and miraculous gift of being \nable to touch our common humanity. His famous road pictures with Big \nCrosby and Dorothy Lamour were the quintessential expressions of the \nadventure of being an American.\n  But he is most loved, of course, for the thousands of hours and \nmillions, literally millions of miles he spent in selfless devotion to \nour troops. World War II, South Korea, Vietnam, from the Far East to \nNorthern Africa, the Indonesian peninsula to the heart of\n\n[[Page S7123]]\n\nEurope, in refugee camps, on Air Force bases, Navy ships, jungles, \nforward bases, demilitarized zones, Bob Hope went wherever we needed \nhim, and he conveyed to our troops the commitment and love of the \nAmerican people.\n  The front rows would be filled with soldiers injured in battle, limbs \ndestroyed, bodies wrapped in bandages. And he would manage to make them \nlaugh. He was able, for those moments while he was on stage, giving his \nbest to our best, to lift those young men and women out of their war-\ntorn bodies and help them forget the fatigue, the fear, and the \nloneliness of battle.\n  Bob Hope is a giant. Bob Hope is a national treasure. We will never, \never forget his service to the United States of America.\n  Happy birthday, Mr. Hope.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, one of the many interesting challenges this \nCongress will face is that of fundamental Medicaid reform. The \nPresident unveiled an innovative and exciting proposal earlier this \nyear, and the budget that we adopted in April anticipates Congressional \naction by creating a reserve fund of resources for modernizing \nMedicaid.\n  Of course, the jobs and growth package presently before us contains a \ntemporary state aid program of $20 billion. Under this interim plan, up \nto $10 billion will flow through the Medicaid program over the next 18 \nmonths. This time-limited spending, proposed in the Senate by Senators \nCollins and Nelson, as well as Senator Rockefeller, is provisional, \nlasting only until September 30, 2004. Further, Mr. President, my three \ncolleagues entered a colloquy in the Record on May 14, 2003, to that \neffect. The language that passed the Senate, and the language contained \nin the conference report, clearly states that the program itself is \nrepealed in 2004. The Senate sponsors of this provision have \nacknowledged that the program is not to be permanent, and both the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, Senator Nickles, agree that this program is to \nlast no longer than September 30, 2004. As the program unfolds, based \non the commitment of its sponsors and the chairmen, I will be \nmonitoring to ensure that the program is indeed transient, and will \nwork with colleagues to keep it temporary.\n  Further, in no way does this provision in the state aid package \nobstruct the opportunity provided in the budget resolution for the \nSenate Committee on Finance and the House Energy and Commerce Committee \nto move ahead on Medicaid modernization. Since the administration \ndetailed its plan, various committees in the House and Senate have \nexplored its features, and Medicaid modernization that enhances \nflexibility and responsiveness is a goal many share as we move into the \n21st century. I look forward to the creativity and ingenuity of the \nchairmen of the relevant committees, Senator Grassley and Mr. Tauzin, \nas they move forward in the coming weeks and months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7123-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ALEUTIAN ISLAND VETERANS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as Memorial Day approaches, our Nation \nreflects upon the courage and heroism of our Armed Forces. During this \ntime of reflection, I hope the Congress and the Nation remember those \nwho defended Alaska during World War II.\n  The Aleutian Islands were a key part of our victory in World War II. \nThe battle fought at Dutch Harbor contributed indirectly to our success \nat Midway, and the fight to reclaim Attu and Kiska deprived the \nJapanese of a base from which to raid Alaska and limit North Pacific \noperations. The geography, weather, and location of the islands made \nthese missions particularly dangerous and difficult, and the members of \nthe military who served there deserve special recognition.\n  The Voice of Anchorage Times recently reported that these veterans \nwill be traveling back to Alaska this month. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Voice of the Times, May 4, 2003]\n\n                Those Aleutian Island Veterans Are Back\n\n                         (By William J. Tobin)\n\n       Once again, as regular as the return of the long days of \n     summer, a six-man contingent of veterans of the Thousand Mile \n     War are back in town, preparing to leave tomorrow afternoon \n     for Kodiak, the first stop on a journey to revisit the \n     battlegrounds of Attu, where U.S. forces fought Japanese \n     invaders in 1943. The 60th anniversary reunion is being led \n     by Al King of Sunrise, Fla., who keeps Aleutian Island vets \n     in touch with each other through his Willawaw Letter--a \n     periodic newsletter packed with names and addresses of those \n     who served here back in those days. Each issue also is filled \n     with personal stories and photos provided by Willawaw \n     warriors sharing their war stories with their fellow vets. \n     Part of the reunion ritual again will be breakfast tomorrow \n     morning at Gwennies Old Alaska Restaurant on Spenard Road, \n     close by their Anchorage headquarters, the Puffin Inn.\n       Veterans who fought with the 11th Air Force during the \n     Aleutian campaign and members of ``Americans Home from \n     Siberia'' will hold their annual reunion later this year in a \n     spot a bit more tourist friendly than Attu. They're going to \n     get together at the Riviera Resort and Racquet Club at Palm \n     Spring, Calif., for a four-day Halloween weekend beginning \n     Oct. 30, The ``Home from Siberia'' fliers include members of \n     the Doolittle Raiders, the 20th Air Force and Fleet Air Wing \n     4, all of whom shared in the aerial battles of World War II. \n     Herman Thompson of Talkeetna, secretary of the national 11th \n     Air Force Association, is the reunion treasurer.

Mr. President, our Nation's Air Force will soon lose one \nof its exceptional leaders, MG Leroy Barnidge, Jr., who is retiring in \nthe next few weeks after 32 years of outstanding service to this \ncountry.\n  Many in Congress have become acquainted with General Barnidge due to \nhis service since 2001 as director of the Air Force Office of \nLegislative Liaison. I have had the great pleasure of meeting and \nworking with Leroy much longer, due to his two tours of duty at \nEllsworth Air Force Base, the last as base commander from August 1995 \nto February 1997.\n  There is no finer gentleman, nor one with a better sense of humor or \nmore likable personality than Leroy Barnidge. As commander of the \nlargest military installation in South Dakota, Leroy impressed me with \nhis candor, his integrity, and his competence. Knowing and working with \nhim has always been a joy, and Leroy will be missed not only in the Air \nForce but also by many of us in the Congress.\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\n  General Barnidge began his Air Force service as I did, through the \nReserve Officer Training Corps, and was commissioned as an officer in \n1971. Since then, he has held a variety of operations and maintenance \nassignments, including major command and joint staff billets. He is \nexperienced in aircrew operations, flight line maintenance and combat \nsupport activities. The general has also performed major command staff \nand executive support functions, as well as duties as a force planner \nand division chief in the joint staff. He has commanded a combat crew \ntraining squadron, a logistics group, an operations group, a B-1B bomb \nwing at Ellsworth, and the B-2 wing at Whiteman Air Force Base, \nMissouri.\n  General Barnidge also completed the program for senior officials in \nnational security at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Harvard \nUniversity, and Seminar XXI, Foreign Political and International \nRelations, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He received \nspecial recognition in 1999 as the winner of the Air Combat Command \nMoller Trophy, recognizing him as the best among all 28 wing \ncommanders. General Barnidge has amassed over 2,900 hours in the T-37, \nT-38, OV-10, B-52G, B-1B, and B-2 aircraft.\n  In his years of working with the Congress, General Barnidge provided \na clear and credible voice for the Air Force, consistently providing \naccurate, concise and timely information. HIs integrity, \nprofessionalism, and expertise enabled him to develop and maintain an \nexceptional rapport between the Air Force and the Congress.\n  On behalf of the Congress and the country, I thank General Barnidge, \nhis wife Sandy, and his entire family for their commitment and many \nsacrifices. Sandy always went out of her way to make my staff and me \nfeel welcome, and I know she, too, has done much for the Air Force and \nher country during the past 32 years. Thanks to both of you for a job \nwell done. On behalf of a grateful nation, we wish you all the best \nduring your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7124-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AFRICAN AMERICAN MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND CULTURE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Brownback \nand Dodd to introduce legislation authorizing the establishment of the \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture within the \nSmithsonian Institution.\n  The effort to construct a museum dedicated to African American \nhistory and culture began in the early 1900's by an association working \nto commemorate the valor and deed of Negro soldiers and sailors who \nfought in American wars and contributions of African Americans in \nscience, art, literature, business and other endeavors.\n  I have conferred with African American constituents in Alaska \nregarding the significance of this bill--the late JP Jones, Bill Sykes, \nand James Hayes to name a few.\n  Today, we are taking an important step toward bringing this overdue \neffort closer to a reality.\n  The provisions of the bill direct the Smithsonian Institution Board \nof Regents to consult with the Commission on Fine Arts, the National \nCapitol Planning Commission, and three members of President Bush's \nCommission on the National Museum of African American History and \nCulture when selecting the museum site. The legislation directs the \nBoard of Regents to complete this work within 18 months.\n  The legislation authorizes $17 million in federal funds for the \nmuseum in fiscal year 2004. The funding for the museum will be fifty \npercent federal funding and the remaining fifty percent will come from \nnon-federal sources.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as this bill moves \nthrough the legislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7124-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PRESIDENTIAL SUPPORT OF REAUTHORIZATION OF ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in 1994 President Clinton signed into law a \nban on the production of certain semiautomatic assault weapons and \nhigh-capacity ammunition magazines. The 1994 law banned a list of 19 \nspecific weapons as well as a number of other weapons incorporating \ncertain design characteristics, such as bayonets and pistol grips. This \nlaw is scheduled to sunset on September 13, 2004. If the law is not \nreauthorized, the production of military-style semiautomatic weapons \ncan legally resume.\n  In March of this year, in testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Attorney General John Ashcroft indicated the Bush \nadministration's support for the current ban on assault weapons but \nwould not indicate support for reauthorization of the ban. Recently, \nthe White House indicated the President does support reauthorizing the \nban. However, a senior White House adviser reportedly said that this \nbill would never make it to the President's desk. And a spokesperson \nfor House Majority Leader Tom Delay recently said ``we have no \nintentions of bringing it up.''\n  Failure to reauthorize the legislation would be irresponsible because \nthe assault weapon ban works. According to National Institute of \nJustice statistics reported by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \nViolence, gun trace requests for assault weapons declined 20 percent in \nthe first calendar year after the ban took effect, dropping from 4,077 \nin 1994 to 3,268 in 1995. Over the same time period, gun murders \ndeclined only 10 percent and trace requests for all types of guns \ndeclined 11 percent.\n  Given the firepower of these firearms, it is not surprising that so \nmany law enforcement organizations supported the Federal assault \nweapons ban and worked for its passage. Among the many that supported \nthe ban were the Law Enforcement Steering Committee, the Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Major City Chiefs Association, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, the National Association \nof Police Organizations, the Hispanic American Police Command Officers \nAssociation, the National Black Police Association, the National \nOrganization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, and the Police Foundation.\n  It is critical that we reauthorize the assault weapons ban. Absent \nsuch action, AK47s, UZIs, and other semi-automatic weapons will again \nbecome easily obtainable weapons of choice for gang members, drug \ndealers, and other dangerous criminals. I urge the President to show \nhis support for this bill by asking the House Republican Leadership to \npass this bill in the House and the Senate Leadership to pass it in the \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7124-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7124-S7125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY 2003\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on this Memorial Day, I encourage New \nMexicans to take a few moments to remember those Americans who have \ngiven their lives in the name of freedom. It is upon the sacrifice of \nthese Americans--from all generations--that the freedom we enjoy today \nis built.\n  From the Bataan Peninsula to Normandy, from the Ia Drang Valley to \nInchon, from Afghanistan to Iraq, and many other conflicts, American \nmen and women have fought and died because they believed in their \ncountry and believed in preserving its many blessings.\n  As we enjoy this holiday weekend with our families and friends, let \nus take a few minutes to recognize the courage with which so many of \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have fought when called upon \nby their country. Let us also remember all those who never made it back \nto the country they loved because they gave their lives for it in a far \naway land.\n  At this moment in America's history, I could not be more proud of our \nmen and women in uniform. I think it is important to note that in the \nwake of successful combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the same \ncourage and commitment shown by Americans of generations past lives on \ntoday in the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to observe the \nsignificance of Memorial Day--and to pay tribute to the Americans we \nhonor on this day. Three days from now, we will, as a nation, remember \nthose who lost their lives in service to our country. They secured our \nfreedom with the most precious gifts they could offer--their love for \nthis country and their lives.\n  America has honored its fallen soldiers with a Memorial Day, \nsometimes called Decoration Day, since the Civil\n\n[[Page S7125]]\n\nWar. Though we are grateful to these heroes every day of the year, we \nrecognized that we ought to set aside one day in particular, the last \nMonday in May, to be especially mindful of the brave men and women who \npaid the ultimate price for our freedom.\n  At a time when our Nation mourns more sons and daughters than it did \njust a year ago, many of whom came from my State of Florida, this \nMemorial Day takes on additional poignancy. My heart is full of solemn \ngratitude to each new generation willing to risk their lives for the \nsecurity of strangers.\n  We cannot merely make promises on this earnest occasion. We must \nreaffirm our commitment to the veteran soldiers still with us. We must \nprovide full funding for veterans health care. At this moment in our \nNation's history, how can we possibly justify anything but a \nsignificant increase in VA's health care budget? Not only have we been \nengaged in a war overseas, but, just this year, VA cut off enrollment \nto an entire category of veterans.\n  During a time when 240,000 veterans nationwide--44,000 in my home \nState of Florida alone--are being told they have to wait 6 months or \nlonger just to see a doctor, how can we possibly turn our backs on \nthese men and women? These veterans have come to VA seeking care--care \nwe promised them they would get--and we owe it to them to fulfill that \npromise.\n  Memorial Day has a duality--at once provoking feelings of both somber \nmeditation for those we have lost in battle and the joyous anticipation \nof celebrating with family and friends during a holiday weekend. Both \nreactions are fitting to the memories of those who are no longer with \nus--we remember and revere their service, and we honor what their \nsacrifice has brought us--the freedom to be with the people we love and \nhold dear.\n  As we and other citizens of this country prepare to enjoy the long \nweekend, let us take a moment to thank those who gave us a future, at \nthe expense of their own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7125-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed 127 judges \nnominated by President Bush, including 100 in the 17 months in which \nDemocrats comprised the Senate majority. Twenty-seven have now been \nconfirmed in the other 12 months in which Republicans have controlled \nthe confirmation process under President Bush. This total of 127 judges \nconfirmed for President Bush is more confirmations than the Republicans \nallowed President Clinton in all of 1995, 1996 and 1997--the 3 full \nyears of his last term. In those 3 years, the Republican leadership in \nthe Senate allowed only 111 judicial nominees to be confirmed, which \nincluded only 18 circuit court judges. We have already exceeded that \ntotal by 14 percent and the circuit court total by 33 percent before \nMemorial Day and with 7 months remaining this year.\n  The fact is that when Democrats became the Senate majority in the \nsummer of 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies. Over the next 17 \nmonths, despite constant criticism from the administration, the Senate \nproceeded to confirm 100 of President Bush's nominees, including \nseveral who were divisive and controversial, several who had mixed peer \nreview ratings from the ABA and at least one who had been rated not \nqualified. Despite the additional 40 vacancies that arose, we reduced \njudicial vacancies to 60, a level below that termed ``full employment'' \nby Senator Hatch. Since the beginning of this year, in spite of the \nRepublicans' fixation on the President's most controversial \nnominations, we have worked hard to reduce judicial vacancies even \nfurther. As of today, the number of judicial vacancies has been reduced \nto 44 and is the lowest it has been in 13 years. That is lower than at \nany time during the entire 8 years of the Clinton administration. We \nhave already reduced judicial vacancies from 110 to 44, in 2 years. We \nhave reduced the vacancy rate from 12.8 percent to 5.1 percent, the \nlowest it has been in the last two decades. With some cooperation from \nthe administration think of the additional progress we could be making.\n  If the Senate did not confirm another judicial nominee all year and \nsimply adjourned today, we would have treated President Bush more \nfairly and would have acted on more of his judicial nominees than \nRepublicans did for President Clinton in 1995 to 1997. In addition, the \n44 vacancies on the Federal courts around the country are significantly \nlower than the 80 vacancies Republicans left at the end of 1997. Of \ncourse, the Senate is not adjourning for the year and Chairman Hatch \ncontinues to hold hearings for Bush judicial nominees at a rate of \nbetween two and four times as many as he did for President Clinton's.\n  Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees raise \nserious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties \non all issues. Those types of nominees should not be rushed through the \nprocess. I invite the President to work with us and to nominate more \nmainstream individuals with proven records and bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7125-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on February \n22, 2003. An Arab-American teenager in Yorba Linda, CA, was badly \nbeaten by a group of teenagers with bats and golf clubs who were \nyelling racial slurs. He suffered head injuries, a broken jaw, and stab \nwounds. Metal plates had to be inserted into his face during \nreconstructive surgery, and his jaw was wired shut for nearly two \nmonths.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend it citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7125-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7125-S7126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SENIOR HEALTH AND FITNESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging to discuss senior health and fitness. May is Older \nAmericans Month and I feel that it is especially appropriate to mention \ntwo events occurring this month that help highlight healthy aging.\n  First, for the past 10 years, the last Wednesday in May has been \ndesignated as National Senior Health and Fitness Day. This year is no \ndifferent and on Wednesday, May 28, 1,500 local organizations in every \nState of the Union, will again celebrate National Senior Health and \nFitness Day, the Nation's largest annual health promotion event for \nolder adults. Local organizations will host a variety of activities \ntailored to the needs and interests of their communities. Last year \nthese activities included health walks, health screening, and a wide \nvariety of other events. National Senior Health and Fitness Day is an \nexcellent opportunity for seniors of all fitness levels to take part in \nlocally organized health and fitness events. In my home State of Idaho, \nthe Southwest Idaho Area Agency on Aging, the local YMCA, and a host of \nother organizations have teamed up to hold a walk in Boise. Idaho \nseniors will walk anywhere from 2 years, to 2 miles, depending on the \nparticipant's ability, a reminder that walking and being active are far \nmore important than how far or how fast we travel.\n  Second, the 2003 Summer National Senior Games, the Senior Olympics, \nopens Monday, May 26, in Hampton Roads, VA. An estimated 10,000 senior \nathletes will come together to compete in a wide variety of sporting \nevents ranging from horseshoes and shuffleboard to track and field and \nthe triathlon. It is one of the largest mutlisport athletic \ncompetitions in the world. I especially salute the 15 Idahoans who will \nbe competing. The Senior Olympians are examples to all of us.\n  The goals for Senior Day are to make exercise fun, to increase \nawareness of the benefits of a regular exercise program for older \nadults, and to encourage all older adults to take advantage of the many \nhealth and fitness programs\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\noffered in their communities. As chairman of the Senate Special \nCommittee on Aging, I share these goals. It is important to highlight \nfitness and nutrition for seniors as a way of life. This is a concept \nthat is very important to our ever-growing aging population.\n  I salute all athletes participating in the National Senior Games and \nall those involved in the National Senior Health and Fitness program in \ntheir communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7126-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SUNSHINE IN IRAQI RECONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with the adoption of my amendment as part \nof the Defense authorization bill, the Senate is shining much needed \nsunshine on the process of awarding contracts for the reconstruction of \nIraq. This amendment will ensure that Congress and the public will not \nbe kept in the dark about the billions of dollars of contracts for \nreconstruction of Iraq that have already been awarded or will be \nawarded under the auspices of the Department of Defense.\n  This amendment is also critical for ensuring the taxpayers get the \nbest value for their money. An article in yesterday's Wall Street \nJournal confirms that the Senate has done the right thing. The Journal \nreports that in ``selecting subcontractors to help with hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in repairs and rebuilding, the work is gearing up \nunder a cloud of politics and distrust.'' The article goes on to say, \n``Officially, the U.S. government is saying the subcontractor awarding \nprocess is going to be fair and open and that nobody will be \ndiscriminated against because of politics. But in unofficial \nconversations, U.S. officials display quite a different attitude.''\n  This latest report raises troubling questions about how U.S. agencies \nand their contractors are playing favorites when it comes to awarding \ncontracts and subcontracts for Iraq reconstruction.\n  There are two primary reasons American taxpayers deserve additional \ndetails about what has been up until now a closed bid process. First, \nthere is a lot of money on the line--a projected $100 billion in \ntaxpayer funds for rebuilding. Second, the U.S. General Accounting \nOffice, GAO, has reported that sole-source or limited-source contracts \nusually aren't the best buy. In my view, the need for explanation \nincreases one hundred-fold if Federal agencies are going to employ a \nprocess that may expose taxpayers to additional cost.\n  Yet sole-source and limited-source contracts seem to be the rule, not \nthe exception, for rebuilding Iraq. On March 24, the Army Corps of \nEngineers announced a sole-source contract to control Iraqi oil fires. \nIt was later reported that the amount of that contract was up to $7 \nbillion. The details of that contract have yet to be made public.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, has also \nannounced that it would limit competition to companies with \ndemonstrated technical ability, proven accounting mechanisms, ability \nto field a qualified technical team on short notice, and authority to \nhandle classified national security material. But when it came time to \nactually award these contracts, USAID ignored or circumvented the \nAgency's own publicly stated criteria for limiting the pool of \napplicants.\n  Under the new structure for rebuilding Iraq, these contracts will be \noverseen by the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance in \nthe Department of Defense. In addition, the Defense Department has \nawarded and will continue to award its own contracts for Iraq \nrebuilding.\n\n  So more than ever, I believe that if the Federal Government chooses \nnot to use free market competition to get the most reasonable price \nfrom the most qualified contractor, then, at a minimum, they should \nhave to tell the American people why. Sunlight is the best \ndisinfectant--and the recent news reports have shown the need for a \nclearing of the air.\n  I do understand the argument that these contracts need to be awarded \nquickly. I do understand that in many cases the companies receiving \nthem have a long history of international work with USAID and other \nFederal agencies. I simply believe that if the need for speed can \nadequately justify these closed-bid processes that may expose American \ntaxpayers to additional expenditures, then that justification should be \nmade public. That is why our legislation says that any Federal entity \nbypassing competitive bidding for Iraqi reconstruction projects has to \nreveal the justifying documents they have prepared.\n  As it turns out, when it comes to their contracts USAID even seems to \nthink that sunlight is a pretty good policy. One of the requirements \nfor the $680 million contract with the main U.S. contractor for Iraq \nreconstruction Bechtel, requires that it justify to USAID any \nsubcontract awarded without open bids. If USAID can ask that of its \nmain contractor, surely the American people can make the same demand of \nFederal agencies awarding these contracts.\n  According to news reports, in 1999, USAID's own inspector general \nreported that at that time USAID's evaluation program didn't provide \nsufficient assurance that they were picking the best contractors. \nAlthough a follow-up report indicated some improvement, I think that is \nan argument in and of itself to insist on disclosure of the facts.\n  Here is my bottom line: There are too many questions and the stakes \nare too high for Congress not to demand public disclosure of this \ninformation. The American people are footing the bill for repairs in \nIraq that they often can't get in their own cities and towns on U.S. \nsoil. The least Federal agencies can do is be a little clearer about \nwho is getting the money and why.\n  I am pleased to be joined by a distinguished and bipartisan group of \ncolleagues in this effort. I particularly thank the chair of the \nGovernment Affairs Committee, Senator Collins of Maine. As chair of the \ncommittee that oversees contracting legislation, she is an expert in \nprocurement law, a real authority on the very issue addressed by this \nbill. Her qualities of leadership on the committee and incredible \nproficiency on this topic give me great confidence that this bill is \nthe right move for our constituents, the right move for the Senate, and \nthe right move for America. I thank her for her support and \nparticipation in this effort.\n  I am also indebted to the other cosponsors of this legislation--\nSenator Clinton, Senator Byrd, Senator Lieberman, Senator Lautenberg, \nand Senator Harkin. In particular, Senator Clinton has been a strong \nand steadfast voice on this issue. I appreciate her support and the \nsupport of all the cosponsors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7126-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7126-S7127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION OF THE WOMEN'S SMALL BUSINESS PROGRAMS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF \n                                  2003\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, women business owners do not get the \nrecognition they deserve for their contribution to our economy: 18 \nmillion Americans would be without jobs today if it weren't for these \nentrepreneurs who had the courage and the vision to strike out on their \nown. For 18 years, as a member of the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship, I have worked to increase the \nopportunities for these enterprising women in a variety of ways, \nleading to greater earning power, financial independence and asset \naccumulation. These are more than words. For these women, it means \nhaving a bank account, buying a home, sending their children to \ncollege, calling the shots.\n  As the ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I rise today to say a few words about a bill that my \ncolleague on the committee, our chair, Senator Snowe, intends to \nintroduce today, the Women's Small Business Programs Improvement Act.\n  First, however, I commend Senator Snowe for taking this first step in \ncrafting legislation that addresses many of the problems faced by women \nentrepreneurs in receiving assistance through the SBA's programs \ndesigned to assist them. I applaud Senator Snowe for working diligently \non these issues and for giving women business owners such attention in \nthis SBA Reauthorization process.\n  Second, I express my sincere and steadfast support for the growing \ncommunity of women entrepreneurs across the Nation and for the \ninvaluable programs at the SBA that provide women with the tools they \nneed to succeed in\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\nbusiness. As a longtime advocate for women entrepreneurs and SBA's \nprograms, my record in support of the SBA's women's programs and for \nwomen business owners speaks for itself. I have continually fought for \nincreased funding of the women's programs at the SBA, for sustaining \nand expanding the women's business centers, for adequately staffing and \nimproving the National Women's Business Council, and for giving women \nentrepreneurs their deserved representation within the Federal \nprocurement process, to name a few. With respect to laws assisting \nwomen-owned businesses, I have been proud to either introduce the \nunderlying legislation or advocate strongly to ensure their passage and \nadequate funding.\n  Today, it is my sincere regret that I cannot sponsor this bill. \nSenator Snowe and I both support these programs, agree on many of the \nchanges needed to strengthen these programs, and we have worked \ntogether on these issues for many years. However, having only received \na copy of the bill this morning, I have not had adequate time to review \nthe proposal and to vet it with the women's business experts that \nrepresent the women and the businesses that will be affected by these \nproposed changes.\n  One example of a troublesome provision in the proposal is its \ntreatment of existing women's business centers. When our committee was \nconsidering my 1999 legislation on this subject, the Women's Business \nCenters Sustainability Act, I fought to secure a nationwide \ninfrastructure of Women's Business Centers that was in jeopardy because \ntheir matching grants from the SBA for the most experienced centers \nwere going to expire. The sustainability legislation allowed 29 Women's \nBusiness Centers to continue to operate, serving together with new \ncenters 85,000 women-owned business just in 2002. In this new bill, \nSenator Snowe proposes to build on the success of that law by making \nthe existing centers permanent, and I fully support this. If we had \nwritten the bill jointly, I would have done exactly the same.\n  While I praise Senator Snowe for recognizing the success of centers \noperating with sustainability grants and the need to make them \npermanent, I understand her legislation will also establish a process \nthat may create additional and unnecessary administration burdens and \ncosts--thus hindering the centers' ability to deliver critical services \nto eager entrepreneurs. In some cases, this may cause existing Women's \nbusiness Centers to close their doors, eliminating access to women \nbusiness owners in those locales to critical services. This and other \nkey issues need to be carefully addressed, and I look forward to \nworking with Senator Snowe and other members of our Committee to do so.\n  I am not alone in my reservations. Just yesterday, both the \nAssociation of Women's Business Centers and the National Women's \nBusiness Council, while still endorsing many of the bill's concepts, \nexpressed concerns about its details and their desire to work together \nto craft a bill that addresses those concerns and accomplishes our \nmutual goal for these important women's initiatives.\n  Once we have had an opportunity to thoroughly examine today's bill, I \nam confident that all the Democratic members of our Committee stand \nready to do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7127-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7127-S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      GRANTS TO HIRE FIREFIGHTERS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues, \nespecially Chairman Warner and Senator Levin, for their support in \napproving amendment No. 785 that I offered to help America's \nfirefighters and ensure that our Nation will be prepared to respond to \nfuture acts of terrorism, should they occur. The amendment, which was \napproved by the Senate yesterday as part of the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Act, will authorize the creation of a grant initiative to \nhelp local governments hire the firefighters they need to address the \nthreat of terrorism and the dangers posed by more ordinary crises.\n  This amendment, Senate Amendment No. 785, is nearly identical to the \nStaffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, SAFER, Act, which I \nam pleased to have co-authored with the distinguished Senator and \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee--Mr. Warner. I am happy \nto say that this amendment has enjoyed strong support on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  The amendment I offered will help ensure that America's local fire \nagencies have the human resources they need to meet the challenge of an \nextended war against terrorism. The amendment authorizes the President \nto provide up to $3 billion in firefighter staffing grants to State and \nlocal governments over the next 3 years. These grants will provide a \nportion of the salary for new firefighters hired by State and local \nagencies.\n  Many of us in Congress have long understood that America's \nfirefighters make extraordinary contributions to their communities \nevery day. But on September 11, 2001, we got a glimpse of the larger \nrole that the men and women of the fire service play. The National role \nof our firefighters has become apparent and our firefighters have made \nthe Nation proud.\n  After September 11, we know that America needs its firefighters to be \nbetter prepared to respond to deliberate acts of mass destruction. The \nfire service needs to be better prepared to deal with acts of \nbioterrorism and it needs to be prepared to help save people who have \nbeen attacked with toxic chemical weapons. In short, America's fire \ndepartments need to be prepared for what once seemed unthinkable.\n  Despite the increasingly important role firefighters play as part of \nour National homeland defense system, communities over the years have \nnot been able to maintain the level of staffing necessary to ensure the \nsafety of the public of our firefighters themselves. Since 1970, the \nnumber of firefighters as a percentage of the U.S. workforce has \nsteadily declined and the budget crises that our State and local \ngovernments are now enduring have only made matters worse. Across the \ncountry today, firefighter staffing is being cut and fire stations are \neven being closed because of State and local budget shortfalls.\n  That is not to say that we haven't made progress--we have. In recent \nyears, the Federal Government has recognized that it can and should be \na better partner with local firefighters. In 2000, my colleagues \nSenator DeWine, Senator Levin, Senator Warner, and I worked \nsuccessfully on this floor to help create the FIRE Act. The FIRE Act \nwas the first Federal grant program explicitly designed to help fire \ndepartments throughout America obtain better equipment, improved \ntraining, and much needed personnel. Since September 11, 2001, Congress \nand the administration have provided billions of dollars to help local \nfirefighters purchase equipment and training to respond to acts of \nterrorism, accidental fires, chemical spills, and natural disasters. \nOver the last 2 years, the Federal FIRE Act grant initiative has \nprovided nearly $\\1/2\\ billion in direct assistance to local fire \ndepartments across the country and will provide another $750 million \nthis year. We are beginning to significantly improve the quality of the \nequipment available to firefighters in every State and in communities \nlarge and small.\n\n  Today, with passage of the SAFER provision, we have taken a giant \nstep forward toward improving staffing conditions for America's fire \nservice. The need for this legislation is abundantly clear. Currently \ntwo-thirds of all fire departments operate with inadequate staffing. \nExperts believe that previous hiring limitations and the increased \ndemands for first responder services have resulted in a shortage of \n85,000 firefighters.\n  According to a ``Needs Assessment Study'' recently released by the \nU.S. Fire Administration, USFA, and the National Fire Protection \nAssociation, NFPA, understaffing contributes to enormous problems. For \nexample, USFA and NFPA have found that only 11 percent of our Nation's \nfire departments have the personnel and equipment they need to respond \nto a building collapse involving 50 or more occupants. I am delighted \nthat the Senate has taken steps to address these problems and, again, I \nthank my colleagues for joining me in this important effort.\n  In closing, let me say that this legislation honors America's \nfirefighters. It acknowledges the men and women who charge up the \nstairs while everybody else is running down. But it does more\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\nthan that. This legislation is an investment in America's security, an \ninvestment to ensure the safety of our firefighters, our families, our \nhomes, and our businesses.\n  Both the International Association of Firefighters and the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs have expressed their strong \nsupport for this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7128-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MCI/WORLDCOM\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to express my grave concerns \nabout the actions of MCI/Worldcom. MCI committed fraud on a scale that \nis offensive.

The SEC took a step in \nthe right direction by punishing this company with the largest fine in \ncorporate history.\n  But I fear the rest of the Federal Government may not be following \nthe lead of the SEC. For example, I understand that MCI has been given \na contract, valued between $23 to $35 million, to build advanced \nwireless networks in Iraq. The Federal Government should not be \nrewarding bad actors with precious government contracts.\n  Other press reports indicate MCI is also using the Tax Code to reap \nbenefits that should not be available to companies that have committed \nsuch egregious fraud. I urge the Senate Finance Committee to \ninvestigate these allegations as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7128-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CONSTITUTION DAY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, each and every Member of the Senate has \ntaken an oath to uphold and protect the sacred document that has guided \nOur nation well over 200 years: the Constitution. Indeed, we all hold \nthe Constitution near and dear to our hearts here in the Senate, and \nyet I rise today to let my colleagues know that the students of \nLynchburg-Clay High School in Highland County, OH, have done us one \nbetter.\n  You see, I received several letters late last year from students at \nLynchburg-Clay High School asking me a simple question: ``Why don't we \nhave a holiday to pay tribute to the Constitution?'' We have \ncommemorative days to celebrate a great many things in this country, \nbut amazingly enough, we don't have one to honor what is one of our \nNation's greatest contributions to democracy. The students at \nLynchburg-Clay High School set out to change that, and I was honored to \nrecently introduce a resolution, cosponsored by my friend and colleague \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, to give life to the idea these student wrote \nto me about not long ago. I am very pleased that yesterday my Senate \ncolleagues agreed to pass this very important resolution.\n  Our resolution is simple: It recognizes the special place the \nConstitution has in our National history, as well as the extremely \nvital role it continues to play today. Also, it formally designates \nSeptember 17, 2003, as ``Constitution Day.'' September 17th, of course, \nmarks the anniversary of the day in 1787 when 39 brave men signed the \nfinal draft of the Constitution at the final meeting of the convention.\n  An appropriate tribute to the Constitution requires more than simply \nattaching a name to a day on the calendar, however. The students from \nLynchburg-clay High School wrote to me, one of the two Senators \nrepresenting them in the Senate and one of 20 Ohioans fortunate enough \nto serve on their behalf in Congress, about their respect for the \nConstitution. In doing so, the students embraced exactly the kind of \ndemocratic values and citizen involvement that the Constitution stands \nfor, and I congratulate them for their effort.\n  It is my intention that by passing this resolution, many more \nAmericans might come to learn about the Constitution, and that as a \nresult, their love and respect for the Constitution might come to match \nthat held by the fine students and fellow Ohioans at Lynchburg-Clay \nHigh School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7128-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7128]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATOR AND MRS. ROBERT C. BYRD'S SIXTY-SIXTH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I would like to congratulate \nSenator and Mrs. Robert C. Byrd on their 66th anniversary, which they \nwill celebrate on May 29. What a wonderful occasion this is--a truly \njoyous celebration.\n  Senator and Mrs. Byrd's devotion to one another is truly powerful. In \na world that is far from old-fashioned, they have shown that old-\nfashioned dedication and commitment can go a long way. The Byrds have \nrisen from humble beginnings, and proven to our State and country that \nhonesty and devotion comes first. Senator Byrd said earlier this year \non the Senate floor, ``There are only two duties that will exceed my \nduties in the Senate. One is my duty to God and the second is duty to \nmy family. I think my duty is to my wife.'' Many of us heard this \nspeech and were struck by that line. We know that with Erma's recent \nillness, Senator Byrd on occasion had to request an absence from the \nSenate to be by the side of his lifelong sweetheart. The devotion he \nhas shown to Erma is plain, and these last few weeks have simply been \nan extension of 60-plus years of love between these two people. This \ncouple is a real gift to the State of West Virginia. We are more than \nlucky to have them as leaders of our State.\n  I have had the honor of serving in the Senate with Senator Byrd for \nthe last 18 years, and in that time I have had the pleasure of getting \nto know Erma as well. Erma is a positively delightful woman. Senator \nand Mrs. Byrd's dedication to one another is genuine and should be \ninspiring to us all. They have been devoted to one another from an \nearly age. In recalling his high school days when he got a candy from a \nclassmate to give to his sweetheart Erma, Senator Byrd said, ``I never \nchewed the gum; I never ate the candy. But when the classes changed, I \nfound Erma in the hall and gave her that candy and chewing gum. I never \ntold her someone had given it to me, but that's the way you court a \ngirl--with another boy's bubble gum.'' Erma and their family has been \nthe top priority in the Senator's life from the start.\n  When the valedictorian of Mark Train High School married his \nsweetheart, Erma Ora James, in May of 1937, no one knew that the coal \nminer's daughter and adopted young boy would together become one of the \nmost influential couples in the history of West Virginia. Even though \nSenator Byrd could not afford to go to college, he persisted as a young \nWest Virginian working for his family--pumping gas, working as a \nproduce salesman, and serving his country as a shipbuilder and welder. \nMrs. Byrd became the head of the family's finances, and the glue that \nheld their household together as she remains today. Starting as a \nfamily of two, the couple worked together to succeed.\n  While Senator Byrd was spending endless hours at the Capitol building \nserving his State and country, Mrs. Byrd raised their two lovely \ndaughters, Mona and Marjorie. To this day, Mrs. Byrd continues to \nremain the stronghold in her family, proudly helping to raise their six \ngrandchildren, and three great-granddaughters. Mrs. Byrd quietly stays \nout of the spotlight , and instead focuses on her responsibilities as a \nwife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. Senator Byrd once \nsaid, ``She [Erma] has been my anchor all of these years. I don't know \nwhat I would have amounted to if it wasn't for her steadfastness, her \nintegrity, her strength,'' It is evident that the Senator and Mrs. Byrd \nhave so much respect for one another, and enjoy their lives together \nevery day. Senator and Mrs. Byrd have devoted their lives to better \ntheir family and fellow West Virginians. They have proven that working \ntogether as a team, husband and wife, can accomplish so much.\n  It is positively refreshing to see such an amazing couple recognized \nfor their leadership and because of their caring. They truly exemplify \na loving and happy marriage. The Byrds are both leaders, grandparents, \nand great-grandparents, and compassionate and honorable West \nVirginians. Senator and Mrs. Byrd have set a great standard. Please \njoin me in congratulating this wonderful couple on their 66th year \ntogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7128-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7128-S7129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SALUTE TO LIBERTY: MANY JOURNEYS, ONE DREAM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto highlight the achievements and experiences of Asian Pacific \nAmericans in\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\nour country. Asian Pacific American Heritage month, observed during the \nmonth of May, celebrates the diverse cultures represented by the over \n13 million Americans of Asian and Pacific Island heritage in our \ncountry. The theme for this year's APA month, ``Salute to Liberty: Many \nJourneys, One Dream'' represents Asian Pacific Americans' diverse paths \nto achieving their goals. In New Jersey, where Asians are the fastest \ngrowing racial group, this month is particularly significant. Asian \nPacific Americans in my State play important roles such as educating \nour students, owning small businesses, working on new technologies, and \nholding public office.\n  The difficult journeys of Asian Pacific Americans include the Chinese \nlaborers who built our Nation's railroads, Japanese Americans who were \nsent to internment camps during WWII, refugees from Vietnam and other \nSoutheast Asian nations, immigrants from the Indian subcontinent, and \nFilipino farm workers. Despite the great obstacles faced on these \njourneys, Asian Pacific Americans have accomplished a great deal and \nhave made major contributions to our country.\n  First and foremost, I would like to recognize the service of Asian \nPacific Americans in our Armed Forces, especially as we celebrate \nMemorial Day. The history of Asian Pacific Americans in military \nservice stretches from William Ah Hang, who enlisted in the U.S. Navy \nduring the Civil War, to the more than 25,000 Japanese Americans who \nserved during World War II, to the young APA men and women fighting \nterrorism today. In particular, I would like for us to remember Lance \nCorporate Alan Dinh Lam, a 19 year old Vietnamese-American from North \nCarolina and Corporal Kempahoom A. Chanawongse, a 22 year old Thai-\nAmerican who moved from Thailand to Connecticut at age 9. These two \nyoung men recently gave their lives for our country during the war with \nIraq.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the \ncontributions of Asian Pacific Americans in space exploration. Kalpana \nChawla was the first Indian-American woman to go into space. Although \nshe lost her life during the recent space shuttle Columbia disaster, \nMs. Chawla will be remembered for her work in the field of aerospace \nengineering. Currently, another Asian Pacific American, Eric Lu, is \nworking on the International Space Station. His work is certain to \ninspire many young men and women interested in space.\n  The brave men and woman I mentioned today are only a small example of \nthe difficult endeavors undertaken by Asian Pacific Americans. It is my \nhope that recognizing the heritage and accomplishments of Asian Pacific \nAmericans will inspire the next generation to embark upon challenging \njourneys and reach their dreams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7129-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7129-S7130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BETTY BROWN CASEY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Washington is, without a doubt, one of the \nmost beautiful cities in our country. It is also a city rich in history \nand cultural advantages.\n  Many people have, over the years, added to Washington's achievements \nand glories. One very special person who has done that is Betty Brown \nCasey. I have had the opportunity to meet Mrs. Casey because my wife, \nMarcelle, serves on the Board of the Washington Opera. Mrs. Casey has \nbeen one of the greatest supporters the Washington Opera has ever known\n  On Sunday, April 13, Mrs. Casey threw a party for the Washington \nOpera. This will go down as one of the greatest and most memorable \nparties thrown in this city. Marcelle and I were fortunate to attend, \nand when we left Washington before dawn the next morning, we had the \njoy of reading Roxanne Roberts' article about Mrs. Casey, titled \n``Phenom of the Opera.''\n  I hope my fellow Senators will enjoy this as much as I did, and I ask \nunanimous consent that this article about this extraordinarily generous \nwoman be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 14, 2003]\n\n      Phenom of the Opera; Patron Betty Brown Casey Gives a Party\n\n                          (By Roxanne Roberts)\n\n       As fairy godmothers go, Betty Brown Casey is pretty nice to \n     have on your team.\n       The low-key philanthropist has a passion for the Washington \n     Opera, a passion that has translated into millions in \n     donations and support for the organization. Last night Casey \n     threw a gala concert for 2,500 fellow lovers of the opera--\n     and picked up the entire tab herself.\n       ``We're here to say thank you to all of you for all the \n     years in the Washington Opera family,'' she told the \n     audience. Casey ticked off a list of the thankees: \n     Volunteers, staff, board members, subscribers and ``those of \n     you who sat--year after year--quietly, patiently and \n     resignedly, in seats next to those who loved opera--and you \n     didn't. ``Long-suffering husbands in tuxedos broke into huge \n     grins as knowing laughter rippled through DAR Constitution \n     Hall.\n       The program included mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, soprano \n     Veronica Villarroel, bass Rene Pape, conductor Valery Gergiev \n     and the Three Mo' Tenors. (Artistic Director Placido Domingo \n     was scheduled to conduct and sing at the gala, but was \n     sidelined by stomach flu.)\n       ``Tonight is wonderful,'' said Betty Vertiz, a Washington \n     Opera subscriber since the 1960s. ``We even like our seats!''\n       Three generations of her family attended the gala: husband \n     Oscar Vertiz, his daughter Virginia Cameron and granddaughter \n     Carrie Gouskos. ``It's nice for people who are faithful to \n     the opera to feel they're appreciated,'' she said.\n       All because Casey wanted to do ``something nice'' after the \n     risky move to Constitution Hall, the Washington Opera's \n     temporary home this year while the Kennedy Center Opera House \n     undergoes renovations. The cost of last night's soiree? \n     ``It's a private party,'' she demurred, but a savvy eye would \n     chalk up seven figures.\n       ``She's been the absolute soul of the company,'' Domingo \n     said last week. ``She always wants to do more and thank \n     anybody who's been involved with the company in any \n     capacity.''\n       Casey, sitting nearby, flushed with embarrassment. The \n     philanthropist shrinks from anything that smacks of self-\n     promotion, and agreed to speak to a reporter only to \n     highlight the contributions of everybody else.\n       ``It's just that this company went through some hard times \n     and there were many, many people who worked very hard to not \n     only keep us going and to make us better and better over the \n     years. I just felt it was a good time to say thank you to \n     Placido--who has been the real spark plug for everything that \n     has happened to us--and to everybody. We really feel like a \n     family, so I felt we should have a family reunion.''\n       Casey, 75, has had a soft spot for opera since she was a \n     teenager. ``I just love the music,'' she said with a smile. \n     ``I get into the music and I'm just there. Terrible as it may \n     seem, Placido, there are times when I don't care who's \n     singing. I just love the music.''\n       Luckily for the opera, Casey is in a position to nurture \n     that love. After 31 years of marriage to legendary Maryland \n     developer Eugene Bernard Casey, she inherited an estate of \n     more than $200 million when he died in 1986. She has led a \n     very private life since then, quietly doling out donations to \n     her pet projects.\n       ``I just think that everybody in life does what they can \n     do,'' she said. ``I'm naturally shy, and I'm just more \n     comfortable when people don't think I do anything--because I \n     don't feel like I do. I only do things that I really believe \n     in, I only do things that I can afford, and I don't do things \n     I ask other people to give to. I don't start something and \n     then ask other people to give me money to do that project. So \n     I don't try to bother anybody, so to speak.''\n       ``Betty knows, and some of us, we know it,'' said Domingo. \n     ``And that's enough.''\n       Her support is funneled through the Eugene B. Casey \n     Foundation to the Salvation Army, Suburban Hospital, George \n     Washington University and Georgetown University and its \n     hospital. She generated more than a few headlines when she \n     offered to build an official residence for the District's \n     mayor on a 17-acre estate in Northwest Washington, and \n     created a $50 million endowment to plant and tend the city's \n     trees.\n       Casey has a special affection for the Washington Opera. She \n     joined the board in 1974 and has been a member ever since; \n     she now holds the title of life chairman. In 1996, she spent \n     $18 million to buy the Woodward & Lothrop building with the \n     idea of converting it into a state-of-the-art opera house in \n     the heart of downtown Washington. When the opera decided to \n     remain at the Kennedy Center instead, the company was allowed \n     to sell the building and keep the profits.\n       ``She's terrific,'' said Opera President Michael \n     Sonnenreich. ``She's stepped up and exhibited a leadership \n     role for the opera beyond financial. She's setting examples \n     for others to follow.''\n       Last night's gala comes after the company's successful move \n     to Constitution Hall--an artistic experiment that, so far, \n     has generated praise from critics and subscribers alike.\n       The evening began with a standing ovation for Casey, who \n     thanked everyone who had contributed to the success of the \n     47-year-old company. She asked for whistles, bravos and \n     bravas for two individuals who had carried the opera during \n     the tough times: former general director Martin Feinstein and \n     longtime board member Christine Hunter.\n       The program was full of familiar material--and a few \n     surprises. The strongest applause came for Pape, who sang two \n     arias for\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\n     his Washington debut: ``Le veau d'or'' from Gounod's \n     ``Faust,'' and ``Ella giammai m'amo'' from Verdi's ``Don \n     Carlo.'' Tenor John Matz had his role unexpectedly expanded \n     when he filled in for Domingo in ``Granada.'' Washington \n     native Graves had the widest repertoire, with a French aria \n     and an American spiritual, and the Three Mo' Tenors were also \n     all over the map with the classic ``La donna e mobile'' \n     followed by ``Let the Good Times Roll.''\n       The good times kept rolling after the concert, when 300 \n     guests joined Casey for dinner and dancing at the \n     Organization of American States across the street. The grand \n     ballroom was lavishly decorated with spring bouquets, Peter \n     Duchin kept the dance floor hopping, and the speeches were \n     short but sincere. ``I am so impressed by Betty,'' said \n     Washington Opera Chairman Jim Kimsey. ``Without her the opera \n     would not be what it is today.''\n       The hostess was characteristically low-key about the \n     evening. ``I thought it was wonderful, really great,'' she \n     said, ``Perfect, really, except for Placido'' not being here.\n       Washington Post music critic emeritus Joseph McLellan \n     contributed to this report.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7130-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  RECOGNITION OF OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAmerica's senior citizens. In 1963, President John F. Kennedy \ndesignated May ``Older Americans Month'' to acknowledge the \naccomplishments of our Nation's elder generations. I welcome this \nopportunity to pause and reflect on the contributions of those \nindividuals who have played such a major role in shaping our great \nNation. For those of us in the Senate who have worked to ensure that \nthe members of America's ``greatest generation'' will be able to enjoy \ntheir later years with dignity and independence, this is a chance to \nhonor them for their hard work and the countless sacrifices they have \nmade during their lifetimes, and to look forward to their continued \ncontributions to the welfare of our country.\n  Today's senior citizens have witnessed more technological advances \nthan any other generation in our Nation's history. Seniors today have \nlived through times of extreme economic depression and prosperity, \ntimes of war and peace, and have seen incredible advancements in the \nfields of science, medicine, transportation and communications. They \nhave embraced these new technologies and used them to further develop \ntheir vital roles in America's communities. Older Americans are working \nand volunteering far beyond the traditional retirement age to give \nyounger generations the benefit of their wisdom and experience. \nMoreover, they are in much better health than their counterparts in \nprevious generations and far less likely to be impoverished, disabled, \nor confined to nursing homes.\n  Recent census figures reveal that the number of older Americans \ncontinues to grow. The population of those 85 and older grew 37 percent \nduring the 1990s, while the Nation's overall population increased only \n13 percent. Approximately 35 million people 65 and older were counted \nin the 2000 census as well as 50,500 Americans who were 100 or older. \nBaby boomers, who represented one-third of all Americans in 1994, will \nenter the 65-years-and-older category over the next 13 to 34 years, \nsubstantially increasing this segment of our population.\n  These figures reinforce the need to demonstrate our commitment to \nprograms such as Medicare and Social Security, and to stimulate \ninvestment in biomedical research and treatments that are improving the \nlives of older Americans. One of our national goals must be to ensure \nall older Americans benefit from these improvements. In Congress, we \nmust ensure our legislative priorities reflect our dedication to the \nsupport that older Americans deserve. This includes expanding and \nstrengthening those programs that effectively aid older Americans, and \naddressing those that fall short of assisting this valuable and \nconstantly expanding segment of our society. I have worked with my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in her efforts to provide a \n$5,000 tax credit for individuals with chronic care needs. I regret \nthis credit was not included in this year's budget resolution but I \nwill continue to support her efforts to see that Congress passes the \nFamily Caregivers Tax Credit Act.\n  By 2020, Medicare will be responsible for covering nearly 20 percent \nof the population. Though Medicare meets the health care needs of \nmillions of Americans, it was created in a different time before the \nbenefits of prescription medicines had become such an integral part of \nhealth care. Sixty percent of Medicare beneficiaries lack affordable, \nprescription drug coverage. Although people 65 and older are 12.5 \npercent of the population, they fill 34 percent of all prescriptions. \nToday it is impossible to imagine quality health care coverage that \ndoes not include affordable medicines to treat and prevent illness.\n  I have and will continue to fight for Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage for all seniors. Earlier this year, I again cosponsored \nlegislation to provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under \nthe Medicare program and to provide greater access to affordable \nmedications. I recognize the predicament of many older Americans as \nthey struggle to live independently on a fixed income and at the same \ntime spend money on costly prescription drugs. The tremendous advances \nin biomedical research that have led to life-saving drugs and \ntreatments are of little use if the population that stands to benefit \nthe most cannot afford them. It is imperative that we address the needs \nof the Americans who have sacrificed so much for the benefit of our \nsociety. Like all Americans, they deserve access to comprehensive \nhealth care.\n  One of the strengths that I admire most about older generations is \ntheir devotion and concern for younger Americans. As we face the \ndilemma of funding Social Security and some of my colleagues make \nproposals to privatize the program, older Americans have been the most \noutspoken advocates of ensuring its existence for future generations. \nTheir determination to preserve this important social insurance program \nis not weakened by questionable reports that privatization proposals \nwould not alter or reduce their benefits. Instead, they fight on, \ntrying to ensure the benefits of Social Security will be there for \nothers for years to come. I support their efforts and strongly oppose \naltering the fundamental social insurance nature of the current system, \nthe strength of which is the guaranteed benefit concept. It is our \nresponsibility as legislators to make certain that this Nation's fiscal \npriorities reflect our enormous appreciation for America's senior \ncitizens.\n  I continue to be impressed with the degree to which our elders \ncontribute to American society. Our Nation's older generations are an \never-growing resource that deserve our attention, our gratitude, and \nour heartfelt respect. In accordance with President Kennedy's vision of \nOlder Americans Month as a time to honor our older generations, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to implement public \npolicies that recognize their contributions to our society. We have the \nopportunity to ensure the well-being of this Nation's most respected \ncitizens, and it is my sincere hope that we pursue it with the same \nvigor that America's seniors have demonstrated throughout their many \nyears of service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7130-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7130-S7131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEDEX CORPORATION AND HYBRID VEHICLES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to bring to my colleague's \nattention to great step forward for the environment that the FedEx \nCorporation is undertaking. The company recently bought 20 hybrid \ntrucks and has announced that it is planning to replace 30,000 of its \ndelivery trucks with hybrid vehicles over the next 10 years.\n  This means that the FedEx Corporation is one of the first big \ncommercial fleets to move toward using environmentally friendly hybrid \nvehicles.\n  The 20 hybrid trucks that have already been purchased are the \ndelivery trucks that we see in cities across the Nation every day. \nThese low-emission, hybrid electric-powered delivery vehicles will \ndecrease particulate emissions by 90 percent, reduce smog-causing \nemissions by 75 percent and increase fuel efficiency by 50 percent.\n  FedEx Express, a subsidiary of FedEx Corporation, has been working on \nthis project for 3 years with Environmental Defense. The company and \nthe environmental organization worked together as partners to develop \nthe concept for manufacturers to create an ``environmentally \nprogressive commercial delivery vehicle.''\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\n  I own two hybird cars. They are amazing because as the driver I do \nnot have to change anything. I still fill up the car--although less \noften--at any gas station. I don't need to change how I drive my car.\n  Similarly, these new hybrid delivery trucks will have no impact how \nFedEx does its day-to-day business. But it will improve the environment \nand ultimately save the company money in fuel costs. It is a win-win \nsituation and shows yet again that what is good for the environment can \nalso be good for the economy and business.\n  I congratulate FedEx Corporation for this action, and I urge other \ncompanies with large fleets to follow FedEx's lead in transforming \ntheir fleets to protect our environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7131-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF CHARLES E. ``BUCK'' CONRAD\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a member of \n``the greatest generation,'' a World War II veteran who passed away on \nJanuary 11, 2003. Buck Conrad was born in my hometown of Baltimore in \n1921 and was raised just blocks from my childhood home. He is survived \nby a former neighbor of mine, Evelyn Dasch Conrad, his loving wife of \n61 years, who now resides in Alexandria, VA. He was the proud father of \ntwo daughters, Karlene Conrad and Cindy Schafer, and Cindy's husband \nGeorge Schafer, formerly of Catonsville, MD, as well as three \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren. He is also survived by numerous \nrelatives in the Baltimore area, including his brother and sister-in-\nlaw, Tom and Joyce Ronci of Glen Burnie.\n  Buck graduated from Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and received his \nundergraduate degree from the University of Maryland. He was an avid \nTerrapins fan who would not let his illness stop him from cheering the \nTerps on to their victory last year in the Peach Bowl.\n  Buck entered the Army in 1944 and retired as a regular Army colonel \nin 1974. He was involved in personnel and logistics for most of his \ncareer, which included tours of duty in the Office of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff and as Chief of the Ordnance Branch. Overseas and wartime \nassignments included the Philippines, Germany, France, Korea, and \nVietnam. His military decorations include the Legion of Merit with oak \nleaf cluster, the Bronze Star with oak-leaf cluster, the Joint Service \nCommendation, and the Army Commendation with oak-leaf cluster. He was a \nmember of the Infantry OCS Hall of Fame and was designated a Department \nof the Army Logistician in 1970.\n  COL Conrad was well educated by the Army. He was a graduate of the \nArtillery School, the Chemical School, the Infantry School, the Command \nand General Staff College, and the Naval War College. He received a \nmaster's degree in business management from Babson College and received \na second master's degree in international relations from George \nWashington University.\n  After retiring from the Army, Buck moved on to a successful career in \nthe private sector and later served as a faculty member of the \nUniversity of Maryland, University College.\n  Funeral Services were held at the Fort Myer Chapel on Wednesday, \nFebruary 5, 2003 and COL Conrad was buried at Arlington National \ncemetery with full military honors.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to men such as Buck Conrad who quietly \nserved their country when our freedom was in peril. His son-in-law \ninformed me that up to his dying day, COL Conrad expressed concern \nabout the United States becoming embroiled in a war in the Middle East \nthat could take the lives of thousands of our soldiers. Having \nwitnessed personally the impact that war has on our young people and, \njust as importantly, their families, COL Conrad was hopeful that a \npeaceful resolution to this conflict could be achieved before any lives \nare lost, both our own troops and innocents in Iraq and throughout that \nregion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7131-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JAMES C.

Mr. \nMcAllister has been a leader in pharmaceutical management for decades. \nJune 3, 2003, he will receive the American Society of Health-System \nPharmacists' 2003 Harvey A.K. Whitney Lecture Award.\n  As director of pharmacy at the University of North Carolina, Mr. \nMcAllister established a Pre-residency program for pharmacy students to \nwork at local hospitals. This provides students with hands-on \nexperience and gives hospitals extra resources to better assist \npatients. Prior to his successes at the University of North Carolina, \nMr. McAllister worked at Duke University, where he served as associate \nchief operating officer overseeing the pharmacy.\n  Mr. McAllister is well known for his expertise dealing with many \npharmaceutical issues, particularly pharmacy practice and medication \nsafety. He is also widely respected for his knowledge of pharmaceutical \nefficiencies such as automation and information technology, which save \nmoney and save lives by reducing medical errors. Mr. McAllister is the \nfirst American pharmacist to implement an operating room pharmacy and a \nmedication dispensing robot.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the \ncontributions of James C.

Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to congratulate the South Canyon Elementary School in Rapid City, \nSD, which celebrates its fiftieth anniversary of service on Friday May \n16, 2003.\n  Plans for South Canyon Elementary began in June 1949, when the \ncurrent school area was a quiet alfalfa field. An area rancher, Ernest \nSchleuning, herded his livestock down Nordbye Lane, where the school is \nnow. Due to overcrowding at Upper Rapid School, previously on West Main \nStreet, South Canyon Elementary School was built in 1952 and opened for \nthe 1952-1953 school year, with 25 to 30 students in each class. Fifty \nyears later, the school continues to serve Rapid City and the needs of \nits citizens.\n  South Canyon Elementary School commemorated its fiftieth anniversary \nof service in the Rapid City school district with an all-school \nassembly, potluck picnic, and evening program. During the evening \nactivities, the school was also open for tours, inviting all current \nand former teachers, staff members, students, parents, and alumni to \nattend. Attendees and guest speakers included South Canyon Elementary \nstudent council members, State Representative Ed McLaughlin, and Police \nChief Craig Tieszen.\n  Over the last half century, the South Canyon Elementary School has \nprovided quality educational services to the children of Rapid City. \nTheir vision, ``expecting excellence to happen, we affirm that all \nchildren can learn,'' has been carried out in all the children who have \ngraduated and gone on to excel in their school careers. Not only has \nthis school encouraged learning, but South Canyon Elementary School \nalso strives to bring the community together in the education of its \nchildren. Their mission states just this in that, ``In partnership with \nstaff, parents, and neighborhood, we provide each child an opportunity \nto reach his/her potential and become a contributing member of the \ncommunity.''\n  I am pleased to announce that the South Canyon Elementary School is \nplanning to commemorate this occasion by burying a time capsule. The \ncapsule includes a current photo album of the school and items chosen \nby the students. Students from each class collected items from their \nclassroom, such as popular books and baseball cards, and one second-\ngrade class added a collection of popular snack wrappers to the \ncapsule. Graduation speeches written by each fifth-grade student \ndescribing what school is presently like at South Canyon Elementary \nSchool were also added.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor Principal Charles McLain \nand the South Canyon Elementary School for its 50 years of outstanding \nservice. It is an honor for me to share with my colleagues the \nexemplary leadership and strong commitment to education South Canyon \nElementary School has provided. I strongly commend their years of hard \nwork and dedication, and I am very pleased that their substantial \nefforts are being publicly honored and celebrated.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7132-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n             THE 250TH ANNIVERSARY OF KEENE, NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a truly great \nAmerican community, the city of Keene, NH, which will celebrate its \n250th Anniversary during a week of festivities beginning Tuesday, May \n27 and culminating on Saturday, May 31, 2003.\n  On September 18, 1734, a group of eight individuals eager to expand \nthe growing colonies settled on the outer edge of New Hampshire in an \narea that was then called Upper Ashuelot. In 1753, when the colony of \nNew Hampshire granted a new township in the southwest section of the \nprovince, the Royal Governor, Benning Wentworth, named the town \n``Keene'' out of gratitude and respect for his friend and business \nassociate, Sir Benjamin Keene, a career diplomat and one time British \nAmbassador to the court of Spain.\n  Although agriculture was an important part of the region's early \neconomy, Keene gained a reputation as an important glass producing \ncenter. In 1814, the New Hampshire Glass Factory was founded, producing \nmostly window glass for the New England region for nearly 40 years. \nOther glass manufacturers soon opened, making bottles and flasks that \nare now known as ``Keene Glass,'' and which remains highly valued \ntoday.\n  With the arrival of the railroad in 1848, Keene's stature as an \neconomic center grew. Rail lines between Boston and New York allowed \nKeene to thrive and by the end of the 1850s, Keene had seen the \naddition of some 100 buildings. During the 19th century, such \nindustrial commodities as flannel, pottery, and furniture were being \nproduced in Keene, and at the beginning of the 20th century, Keene even \nmade automobiles.\n  As Keene's economic growth expanded, so to, did its population. At \nthe beginning of the century, the population was about 1,650 people. by \n1850, there were nearly 3,400 people in Keene and by 1870, that number \nexpanded to almost 6,000. In 1874, the citizens of Keene passed a \nmeasure which established the city of Keene--9 years after the New \nHampshire State legislature voted to allow Keene to become a city and \nafter the citizens had twice voted down the idea.\n  Today, more than 125 years later, Keene is still a vibrant city, home \nto many diverse industries, well renowned institutions of higher \nlearning, and an acclaimed performing arts community.\n  Each year, students from across the State and the Nation flock to \nsouthwest New Hampshire in order to expand their horizons at Keene \nState College, founded in 1909, and Antioch New England Graduate \nSchool. These and other quality institutions of higher learning \nthroughout the region educate some of America's premier students.\n  Culturally, Keene thrives, boasting the Redfern Arts Center on \nBrickyard Pond at Keene State College as well as the non-profit \nColonial Theater on Main Street and numerous singers and musicians who \nperform at a number of other locations in Keene. The region's largest \nnewspaper, the Keene Sentinel, is also the Nation's fifth oldest. \nHaving been in publication since 1799, it continues to serve as a vital \nsource of news and information for the people of Keene.\n  Surrounded by mountains, lakes, and forest, in terms of quality of \nlife, Keene is a community that has it all. In fact, the National Trust \nfor Historic Preservation recently named Keene one of America's Dozen \nDistinctive Destinations, which is no surprise since the Elm City is \noften times described as the ``suburb without the big city next door.'' \nWith its commitment to historic preservation, attractive architecture, \nand diversity of businesses, Keene epitomizes the quaint New England \nmunicipality it has grown to be.\n  I congratulate Keene, New Hampshire on its 250th anniversary, and I \nextend my best wishes to its more than 22,000 citizens in celebration \nof this splendid milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7132-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7132-S7133]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE NEW HAMPSHIRE EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION AWARDS\n\n Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate this \nyear's winners of the New Hampshire Excellence in Education Awards. The \n``ED''ies are awarded to those individuals, schools and educational \nprograms that have made significant contributions to public education \nand have met the highest standards of excellence. Educators and schools \nare measured on criteria, including curriculum and instruction, \nteaching and learning process, student achievement, leadership and \ndecision-making, community and parental involvement, and school \nclimate. On June 7, 2003, 35 individuals and 5 schools will be \nrecognized for their leadership and outstanding achievements in \npreparing New Hampshire students for success in the 21st century, and I \nbelieve I represent my State well in conveying our appreciation and \nrespect for the professionals they are and the sacrifices and \ncontributions they make every day in classrooms throughout the Grantie \nState.\n  The ``ED''ies are presented in various categories of excellence, such \nas art education, world languages, school nursing, counseling and \ntechnology. The specific criteria for the ``ED''ies, which is developed \nby the board of directors for the New Hampshire Excellence in Education \nAwards, has been applied to elementary, middle, and secondary schools, \nalong with teachers, administrators, and other education professionals \nperforming at each of these levels, as well as higher education. \nSelection committees are charged with the responsibility of applying \nthese standards and evaluating nominees, and consist of some of New \nHampshire's finest educators and community leaders. The committees \ncarefully review nominees, study school applications and conduct \nassessments through on-site visitations.\n  I have very fond memories of so many teachers that had a profound \nimpact on my life. Their work that created a positive learning \nenvironment and provided me with the direction necessary to succeed, \nmade an enormous difference in my growth as a person and as a public \nservant. They allowed me to appreciate the importance of a sound public \neducation, as well as the need for individuals to make a contribution \nto their community. In my most important job--that of being a parent--I \nrealize how delicate the task of educating can be, and understand more \nnow than ever the vital resource our schools and teachers provide to \nthe parents in the towns and cities of New Hampshire.\n  Similar to the classroom heroes I knew growing up in Salem, the group \nof educators chosen this year for the ``ED''ies have demonstrated \nsuperior dedication and service to their students, schools and \ncommunities, and deserve this prestigious honor for the important roles \nthey play in helping our children reach their goals and succeed in \nschool. The teachers, principals, counselors, librarians, and other \nschool leaders being commended this year have provided students with \nthe tools they need to become productive and engaged citizens, and have \nbeen some of our State's most treasured role models--setting positive \nexamples for the children that surround them, teaching personal \nresponsibility and hard work, and shaping the character of young minds. \nFor these achievements, our State and our country owe them a great deal \nof gratitude.\n  I am proud of the strides that the President and Congress have made \nin working to reform our Nation's public education system. Since first \nelected to Congress in 1996, I have made improving education a \nlegislative priority of mine. However, I am cognizant of the fact that \nthe men and women on the front lines of our classrooms tackle the \ntoughest of challenges and enable our country to realize the promise of \nleaving no child behind. The State of New Hampshire's education system \nis a true model to be highlighted, and I am confident that the success \nwe enjoy in our State is due in large measure to the contributions and \nleadership of the many educators and schools being recognized here \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of the 2003 New \nHampshire Excellence in Education Award winners be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       NH Art Educators Association--Award: Art Educator of the \n     Year--Luci Prawdzik, Peter Woodbury School.\n       NH Association for Gifted Education--Award: Educator of the \n     Gifted Award--Barbara DeVore, Reeds Ferry Elementary School, \n     Merrimack.\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n       NH Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development--\n     Award: Supervision & Curriculum Development Award--Marianne \n     MacCarthy True, Plymouth State College.\n       NH Association of Family & Consumer Services--Award: Family \n     & Consumer Services--Katherine Shoubash, Bow High School.\n       NH Association of School Principals--Award: Assistant \n     Principal--Francis McNally, Dover High School.\n       NH Association of School Principals--Award: Secondary \n     Principal--Deborah Brooks, Newmarket High School.\n       NH Association of School Principals--Award: Middle School \n     Principal--Dr. John O'Connor, Dover Middle School.\n       NH Association of School Principals--Award: Elementary \n     Principal--Kevin Johnson, Kearsarge Regional Elementary \n     School.\n       NH Association of School Psychologists--Award: NH School \n     Psychologist of the Year--Kristen Thibodeau, Derry School \n     District.\n       NH Association of Special Education Administrators--Award: \n     Special Education Administrator of the Year--Frances \n     Gonsalves, SAU #48--Plymouth.\n       NH Association of World Languages--Award: NH Association of \n     World Languages Teacher of Excellence Award--Connie Evans, \n     Bow High School.\n       NH Business Education Association--Award: NH Business \n     Education Association Achievement Award--Beverly S.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Mr. Thomas \n``Buddy'' Morgan, the general manager of the Montgomery Water Works and \nSanitary Sewer Board in Montgomery, AL. Mr. Morgan serves as their \nrepresentative to the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies, \nAMSA. On May 19, 2030, the members of AMSA elected Mr. Morgan to be the \nfirst president of the association from Alabama. Mr. Morgan was \nselected for his exemplary commitment and dedication to a clean-water \ncommunity.\n  AMSA's mission is to effectively maintain a strong leadership role in \nthe development and implementation of scientifically sound, cost-\neffective, and environmentally friendly policies for the protection of \nthe health of the public and the environment. In May of 2003, AMSA will \ncelebrate 33 years of service to the clean-water community and the \nNation.\n  Mr. Morgan has worked on many projects on behalf of the city of \nMontgomery. His distinguished background includes his service on the \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Urban Wet Weather Flows Federal \nAdvisory Committee and the Sanitary Sewer Overflow Federal Advisory \nCommittee. He also served as chair of the Catoma Creek Watershed \nCommittee and as a board member of the Alabama Clean Water Partnership. \nAs a result of his involvement, Montgomery and surrounding areas of the \nGreat State of Alabama are directly represented in national policy \ndiscussions.\n  Mr. Morgan was instrumental in creating the Montgomery County Water \nFestival, which is now in its third year. As a result of his efforts, \nthe water festival brings together local students for a day of \nactivities and entertainment that instills in them a sense of \nenvironmental stewardship and awareness.\n  Alabama is honored to be the home to Mr. Morgan. It is no secret that \nhe is a man who, day in and day out, goes above and beyond the call of \nduty. He is to be commended for his extraordinary efforts on behalf of \nthe Montgomery Water Works and Sanitary Sewer Board and his election to \nlead the Association of Metropolitan Sewerage Agencies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7133-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7133-S7134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 8:30 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2) \nto provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 201 of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004.\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

A Senate concurrent resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Louisiana relative to the food \n     imports that contain the use of banned antibiotics, \n     especially in foreign imported shrimp; to the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 18\n\n       Whereas, it is the concern of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     that the presence of chloramphenicol and other banned \n     veterinary drugs in imported shrimp and the legislature calls \n     on the federal government to take immediate and focused \n     efforts to improve enforcement of food import restrictions of \n     seafood imports in order to protect American consumers and \n     ensure safety of the food supply; and\n       Whereas, chloramphenicol, a potent antibiotic, can cause \n     severe toxic effects in humans, including hypoplastic and \n     aplastic anemia, which is usually irreversible and fatal; and\n       Whereas, because of these human health impacts, \n     chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, and similar veterinary drugs \n     are not approved for use in food-producing animals in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, and China \n     have been found to use these drugs in the aquaculture of \n     shrimp and other seafood; and\n       Whereas, the United States imports over four hundred \n     thousand metric tons of shrimp annually, and Thailand and \n     Vietnam are the top two exporters of shrimp to the United \n     States, and China is the fifth largest exporter of shrimp to \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, upon detection of chloramphenicol using testing \n     protocols that detect such substances as low as zero point \n     three-tenths (0.3) parts per billion in certain shipments of \n     seafood from China and other nations, in 2002 the European \n     Union and Canada severely restricted imports of shrimp and \n     other food from these nations; and\n       Whereas, the United States Food and Drug Administration \n     inspects only two percent of all seafood imports into the \n     country and utilizes a testing procedure that cannot detect \n     the presence of chloramphenicol below one part per billion; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Food and Drug Administration import testing \n     did not detect chloramphenicol in shrimp imported from these \n     nations in 2002; and\n       Whereas, independent testing performed by the states of \n     Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas detected \n     the presence of chloramphenicol in samples of imported shrimp \n     from China, as well as from other countries, that were at \n     levels considered harmful to human beings; and\n       Whereas, imports of seafood from nations that utilize \n     substances banned in the United States such as \n     chloramphenicol, nitrofuran, and other veterinary drugs pose \n     potential threats to American consumers; and\n       Whereas, denial of entry to contaminated shrimp and other \n     seafood products to the European Union and Canada will likely \n     redirect imports to the United States of contaminated \n     products turned away from these countries; and\n       Whereas, United States based companies involved in the \n     importation and processing of shrimp are opposed to the use \n     of chloramphenicol and are working with the domestic shrimp \n     industry and the Food and Drug Administration to develop \n     effective protocols, including in-country testing, \n     certification of foreign testing facilities and other means \n     to detect banned antibiotics and to exclude all tainted \n     products from the United States marked; Therefore be it\n       Resolved That the Legislature of Louisiana expresses its \n     concern about the presence of chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, \n     and other veterinary drugs in seafood products especially \n     imported shrimp and its potential impact on the safety of the \n     food, and calls for immediate and focused efforts by the \n     government of the United States to improve enforcement of \n     food import restrictions of seafood imports containing \n     chloramphenicol, nitrofurans, and other banned veterinary \n     drugs in order to protect American consumers and ensure the \n     safety of the food supply and further urges the Food and Drug \n     Administration to continue to work with importers and \n     domestic stakeholders to develop effective methods of \n     excluding such banned antibiotics.\n       Be it further resolved That a copy of this Resolution shall \n     be transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate \n     and the clerk of the United States House of Representatives \n     and to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7134-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. GRASSLEY, from the Committee on Finance, without \n     amendment:\n       S. 1149.

A bill to provide disadvantaged children with access to \ndental services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Cochran, Lincoln, Collins, Daschle, Jeffords, Clinton, \nCantwell, and Johnson is entitled the Children's Dental Health \nImprovement Act of 2003. This legislation is designed to improve the \naccess and delivery of dental health services to our Nation's children \nthrough Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \n(SCHIP), the Indian Health Services, IHS, and our Nation's safety net \nof community health centers.\n  The oral health problems facing children are highlighted in a \nlandmark report issued by the Surgeon General and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS, in 2000 entitled ``Oral Health in \nAmerica: A report of the Surgeon General'' in which he observed that \nour Nation is facing what amounts to ``a `silent epidemic' of dental \nand oral diseases.''\n  In fact, dental caries, which refers to both decayed teeth or filled \ncavities, is the most common childhood disease. According to the \nSurgeon General,``Among 5- to 17-years olds, dental caries is more than \n5 times as common as a reported history of asthma and 7 times as common \nas hay fever.'' In short, dental care is, as the Surgeon General \nadds,``the most prevalent unmet health need among American children.''\n  I was pleased to chair a hearing in the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee on June 25, 2002, entitled ``The Crisis in \nChildren's Dental Health: A Silent Epidemic'' in which the Surgeon \nGeneral, Dr. David Satcher, testified. Dr. Satcher's testimony was \nstrong and compelling.\n  In his words, ``Over 108 million children and adults lack dental \ninsurance, which is over 2.5 times the number who lack medical \ninsurance.'' Dr. Satcher also highlight the following information \nspecific to the oral health problems in children:\n  There are striking disparities in dental disease by income. Poor \nchildren suffer twice as much dental cries as their more affluent \npeers, and their disease is more likely to be untreated. These poor-\nnonpoor differences continue into adolescence. One out of four children \nin America is born into poverty, and children living below the poverty \nline--annual income of $17,000 for a family of four--have more severe \nand untreated decay.\n  Other birth defects such as hereditary ectodermal dysplasias, where \nall or most teeth are missing or misshapen, cause lifetime problems \nthat can be devastating to children and adults.\n  Unintentional injuries, many of which include head, mouth, and neck \ninjuries, are common in children.\n  Intentional injuries commonly affect the craniofacial tissues.\n  Tobacco-related oral lesions are prevalent in adolescents who \ncurrently use smokeless--spit tobacco.\n  Professional care is necessary for maintaining oral health, yet 25 \npercent of poor children have not seen a dentist before entering \nkindergarten.\n  Medical insurance is a strong predictor of access to dental care. \nUninsured children are 2.5 times less likely than insured children to \nreceive dental care. Children from families without dental insurance \nare three times more likely to have dental needs than children with \neither public or private insurance. For each child without medical \ninsurance, there are at least 2.6 children without dental insurance.\n  Medicaid has not been able to fill the gap in providing dental care \nto poor children. Fewer than one in five Medicaid-covered children \nreceived a single dental visit in a recent year-long study period. \nWhile recent CMS data indicate progress in this area with 1 million \nmore Medicaid-eligible children now receiving annual dental care than \nwas the case in 1996, there is still a long way to go to ensuring \ngreater access. Although new programs such as the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, SCHIP, may increase the number of insured \nchildren, many will still be left without effective dental coverage.\n  The social impact of oral diseases in children is substantial. More \nthan 51 million school hours are lost each year to dental-related \nillness. Poor children suffer nearly 12 times more restricted-activity \ndays than children from higher income families. Pain and suffering due \nto untreated diseases can lead to problems in eating, speaking, and \nattending to learning.\n  Over 50 percent of 5- to 9-year-old children have at least one cavity \nor filling, and that proportion increases to 78 percent among 17-year-\nolds. Nevertheless, these figures represent improvements in the oral \nhealth of children compared to a generation ago.\n  The Senate also heard the testimony of Dr. Burton Edelstein, founding \ndirector of the Children's Dental Health Project; Dr. Gregory Chadwick, \npresident of the American Dental Association; Dr. Lynn Douglass \nMoundon, director of oral health in the Arkansas Department of Health; \nEd Martinez, chief executive officer at San Ysidro Health Center in \nCalifornia; and, Dr. Timothy Shriver, president and chief executive \nofficer of Special Olympics, Inc.\n  Dr. Edelstein underscored the need for more attention to this issue. \nAs he said, ``The too-widespread belief that childhood dental disease \nhas been vanquished states in contrast to the thousands upon thousands \nof toothaches and acute abscesses experienced daily by America's \nchildren--many as young as 2 years of age.''\n  In endorsing this legislation, Dr. Chadwick added, ``. . . we cannot \nforget the fact that millions of people in this country--particularly \nchildren--aren't getting even basic preventive and restorative dental \ncare. These children are out there suffering.''\n\n  The Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2003 seeks to end \nthat suffering. One important provision in the bill would grant States \nflexibility\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\nto provide dental coverage to low-income children through the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, just as States currently \nare able to do through Medicaid.\n  Unfortunately, SCHIP law prohibits coverage of children for services \nunless they are completely uninsured. As authors Ruth Almeida, Ian \nHill, and Genevieve Kenney of an Urban Institute report entitled ``Does \nSCHIP Spell Better Dental Care for Children? An Early Look at New \nInitiatives write'', ``. . . many low-income children are covered by \nemployer-based or other private health insurance for their medical \ncare, but do not have a comprehensive dental benefit. Because these \nchildren are privately insured, they are not eligible for SCHIP and \ncannot avail themselves of dental coverage under SCHIP. Expanding SCHIP \nto furnish dental services on a wraparound basis to private covered \nlow-income children without dental coverage could help achieve broader \nimprovements in children's oral health.''\n  For low-income children with medical coverage but no dental insurance \nthrough the private sector, their only option would be to completely \ndump their private coverage for their children in order to access SCHIP \ncoverage.\n  Instead, the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2003 creates \nan option for States to provide low-income families with the ability to \nreceive wraparound dental coverage through SCHIP without having to \ncompletely drop their private insurance. This reduces the crowd-out of \nprivate insurance, which was a priority of the Congress during passage \nof SCHIP, and it provides low-income children with dental services that \nother children in the same economic circumstance are already receiving \nthrough SCHIP.\n  In implementing such a change, I want to make it clear that I am in \nstrong support of providing additional funding to SCHIP to ensure that \nthese services are provided without reducing current levels of SCHIP \nfunding. With those additional funds, I strongly believe that SCHIP, \njust as Medicaid, should provide services to low-income children who \nare both uninsured and underinsured. Children need a comprehensive set \nof child health services, including dental services, to ensure their \nappropriate health and development.\n  However, coverage for these services is often not enough. Even when \nchildren do have dental coverage, the access to care is often sorely \nlacking. Medicaid is the largest insurer of dental coverage to \nchildren. Yet despite the design of the Medicaid Program to ensure \naccess to comprehensive services for children, including dental care, \nthe inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services \nreported in 1996 that only 18 percent of children eligible for Medicaid \nreceived even a single preventive dental service. The same report shows \nthat no State provides preventive services to more than 50 percent of \neligible children. The factors are complex but the primary one is due \nto limited dental participation in Medicaid.\n  According to GAO, in its September 2000 report entitled ``Oral \nHealth: Factors Contributing to Low Use of Dental Services by Low-\nIncome Populations.'' ``Of 39 states that provided information about \ndentists' participation in Medicaid, 23 reported that fewer than half \nof the states' dentists saw at least one Medicaid patient during \n1999.'' Even worse, a 1998 survey by the National Conference of State \nLegislatures indicates that fewer than 20 percent of dentists \nparticipate in the Medicaid Program nationwide.\n  The GAO concludes poor participation rates by dentists is due in \nlarge part to poor reimbursement rates in Medicaid. As the GAO points \nout, ``Our analysis showed that Medicaid payment rates are often well \nbelow dentists' normal fees. Only 13 states had Medicaid rates that \nexceeded two-thirds of the average regional fees dentists charged. . . \n.''\n  Clearly, Medicaid is chronically underfunded with respect to dental \ncare. The Surgeon General's report notes, ``On average, state Medicaid \nagencies contribute only 2.3 percent of their child health expenditures \nto dental care, whereas nationally, the percentage of all child health \nexpenditures dedicated to dental care is more than 10 times that rate, \nalmost 30 percent.''\n  The good news is that many States, including New Mexico, have taken \nrecent actions to improve the participation of dentists in the Medicaid \nProgram by raising low payment rates and reducing administrative \nrequirements. These efforts were highlighted by the GAO in its \nSeptember 2000 report. To further encourage such efforts, the \n``Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2003'' provides $50 \nmillion annually as financial incentives and planning grants to States \nto undertake additional improvements in their Medicaid Programs \ndelivery of dental health services to children.\n  In addition to Medicaid and SCHIP, the Federal Government administers \nother health care programs providing dental services or providers for \nlow-income children and their families, including services administered \nby community health centers and the Indian Health Service, or IHS. \nUnfortunately, both of these programs are underfunded and, as the GAO \nfound, ``report difficulty in meeting the dental needs of their target \npopulations.''\n  For example, the GAO found that ``HHS and health center officials \nreport that the demand for dental services significantly exceeds the \n[urban and rural health] centers' capacity to deliver it. In 1998 . . \n., a little more than half of the nearly 700 health center grantees \nfunded under this program had active dental programs.'' This is also \ntrue for public health departments across the country.\n  To assist the health centers and public health departments with this \nneed, the Children's Dental Health Improvement Act of 2003 provides $40 \nmillion to community health centers and public health departments to \nexpand dental health services through the hiring of additional dental \nhealth professionals to serve low-income populations.\n  This is particularly a problem that needs to be addressed in areas \nwith severe dental health professional shortages, such as New Mexico. \nFor example, New Mexico ranked next to last in the Nation with just \n32.1 dentists per 100,000 population in 1998, according to HHS. \nThis compares to the national average of 48.4 per 100,000. Moreover, \nthe number of dentists in New Mexico declined by 7 percent between 1991 \nand 1998 while the State's population grew 12 percent. The result was a \n17 percent decline in dentists per capita during the period.\n\n  With regard to American Indian and Alaska Native populations, the \nneed is so great and the funding so little that a comprehensive \nsolution is requiring throughout the IHS system. With respect to the \nunmet need, the GAO notes that ``American Indian and Alaska Native \nchildren aged 2 to 4 years old have five times the rate of decay that \nall children have.''\n  Unfortunately, the GAO adds, ``. . . about one-fourth of IHS' dentist \npositions at 269 IHS and tribal facilities were vacant in April 2000. \nVacancies have been chronic at IHS facilities--in the past 5 years, at \nleast 67 facilities have had one or more dentist positions vacant for \nat least a year. According to IHS officials, the primary reason for \nthese vacancies is that IHS is unable to provide a competitive salary \nfor new dentists . . .''\n  The GAO continues, ``The IHS' dental personnel shortages translate \ninto a large unmet need for dental services among American Indians and \nAlaska Natives. IHS reports that only 24 percent of the eligible \npopulation had a dental visit in 1998. The personnel shortages have \nalso reduced the scope of services that facilities are able to provide. \nAccording to IHS officials, available services have concentrated more \non acute and emergency care, while routine and restorative care have \ndropped as a percentage of workload. Emergency services increased from \none-fifth of the workload in 1990 to more than one-third of the \nworkload in 1999.''\n  To help alleviate this workforce shortage, the Children's Dental \nHealth Improvement Act of 2003 provides IHS with the authority to offer \nmultiyear retention bonuses to dental providers offering services \nthrough the IHS and tribal programs.\n  The bill also provides for some technical amendments to ensure that \ntribal organizations and community health centers are allowed to apply \nfor school-based dental sealant funding from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, or CDC.\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\n  The legislation also has a new provision that addresses a technical \nand unintended problem with the implementation of provisions changing \nthe way Medicare graduate medical education, or GME, is funded. As \nbackground in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, or BBA, Congress \nrecognized the unfairness of subjecting dentistry to GME policies based \non the oversupply of physician specialists by exempting dental \nresidency positions from caps placed on the number of residents \nsupported by Medicare GME.\n  However, the two provisions in that law--both enacted primarily to \nalleviate the impact on hospitals that decrease physician slots--have \nhad the opposite impact on hospitals that increase their dental \nresidency positions. While successful in achieving the purpose of \nreducing the number of physicians being trained, these provisions have \nhurt dentistry and access to oral health care in the United States and \nare contrary to the congressional goal in 1997 to increase the number \nof postgraduate dental residency slots. As a result, the legislation \nwould exempt dental residency training positions from the 3-year \nrolling average provision used to calculate the number of residents for \nMedicare GME payments.\n\n  The bipartisan legislation I am introducing today would improve the \naccess and delivery of dental health services to our Nation's children \nthrough Medicaid, SCHIP, IHS, and our Nation's safety net of community \nhealth centers. These problems are well documented and call out for \ncongressional action as soon as possible.\n  I would like to thank the American Dental Association, the American \nDental Education Association, the American Academy of Pediatric \nDentistry, the National Association of Community Health Centers, Inc., \nthe National Association of Children's Hospitals, the American Dental \nHygienists' Association, and the Children's Dental Health Project for \ntheir outstanding support and/or their technical advice on this \nlegislation. This bill is a result of their outstanding work.\n  In particular, I want to thank Dr. Burt Edelstein, Libby Mullin, and \nAnn De Biasi of the Children's Dental Health Project for their vast \nknowledge and technical assistance on this issue. I want to thank Judy \nSherman of the American Dental Association, Myla Moss and Jack Bresch \nof the American Dental Education Association, Dr. Herber Simmons and \nScott Litch of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry, Karen \nSealander of the American Dental Hygienists' Association, Dr. Jim \nRicheson and Judy Kloss Bynum of the Academy of General Dentistry, Dr. \nStephen Corbin of Special Olympics, Inc., and Dan Hawkins, Chris \nKoppen, and Roger Schwartz of the National Association of Community \nHealth Centers, Inc., for their valuable insight, technical advice, and \ncontinued support for this legislation. I look forward to working with \nthem all to ensure that we achieve increased access to oral health care \nfor our children.\n  In addition to those organizations, I would like to thank the \nfollowing groups for their support of the bill, whether in the past \nsession of Congress or this year.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hepatitis C Epidemic Control \n     and Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 3,000,000 individuals in the United States are \n     chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (referred to \n     in this section as ``HCV''), making it the Nation's most \n     common blood borne virus infection.\n       (2) Nearly 2 percent of the population of the United States \n     have been infected with HCV.\n       (3) Conservative estimates indicate that approximately \n     35,000 Americans are newly infected with HCV each year.\n       (4) HCV infection can cause life-threatening liver disease.\n       (5) Individuals infected with HCV serve as a source of \n     transmission to others and, since few individuals are aware \n     they are infected, are unlikely to take precautions to \n     prevent the spread or exacerbation of their infection.\n       (6) There is no vaccine available to prevent HCV infection.\n       (7) Treatments are available to slow the progression of \n     chronic hepatitis C.\n       (8) An estimated 2,400,000 to 2,700,000 people who are \n     chronically infected with hepatitis C are receiving no \n     treatment.\n       (9) Conservative estimates place the costs of lost \n     productivity and medical care arising from chronic hepatitis \n     C in the United States at more than $600,000,000 annually and \n     such costs will undoubtedly increase in the absence of \n     expanded prevention and treatment efforts.\n       (10) To combat the HCV epidemic in the United States, the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed \n     Recommendations for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis C \n     Virus (HCV) Infection and HCV-Related Chronic Disease in 1998 \n     and the National Hepatitis C Prevention Strategy in 2001, and \n     the National Institutes of Health convened Consensus \n     Development Conferences on the Management of Hepatitis C in \n     1997 and 2002. These recommendations and guidelines provide a \n     framework for hepatitis C prevention, control, research, and \n     medical management referral programs.\n       (11) Federal support is necessary to increase knowledge and \n     awareness of hepatitis C and to assist State and local \n     prevention and control efforts.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF \n                   HEPATITIS C.\n\n       Title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 241 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n  ``PART R--PREVENTION, CONTROL, AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF HEPATITIS C\n\n     ``SEC. 399AA.

Mr. President, It's a privilege to join my colleague, \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison, in introducing this legislation to \naddress the growing problem of Hepatitis C. Senator Hutchison's \nleadership has been essential in preparing this proposal to help \nestablish nationwide programs for Hepatitis C that have been so \neffective in Texas. We are also indebted to the leadership of Senator \nSmith, Senator Campbell, Senator Daschle, and many other colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle for taking action to reduce the serious toll of \nHepatitis C on so many of our fellow citizens.\n  Hepatitis C is a rapidly growing health care crisis. More than 3.9 \nmillion Americans are infected with the virus, making it the nation's \nmost common blood-borne viral illness, and the numbers continue to \nrise. 10,000 Americans die each year of chronic complications related \nto the virus. Hepatitis C virus infection is a major cause of death in \nAIDS patients, and nearly 40 percent of all HIV-positive people are \nalso infected with Hepatitis C virus.\n  Hepatitis C leads to life-threatening conditions, including cirrhosis \nand liver cancer, which cost our country more than $600 million every \nyear. This bill supports liver disease research to encourage the \ndevelopment of an effective vaccine against the virus.\n  Unlike Hepatitis A and B, there is currently no vaccine available to \nprevent this epidemic. It is critical that infected individuals are \nidentified early, so that they can obtain treatment and take other \nsteps to reduce the likelihood that the disease will lead to permanent \nliver damage or spread of the virus to others.\n  The bill we are introducing today takes a new approach to fighting \nthis virus by establishing a nationwide plan to provide the most \neffective ways of prevention, control and medical management of \nHepatitis C. The bill also seeks to increase knowledge and awareness of \nthe infection by patients, health care professionals, and the public.\n  This strategy was successfully implemented in Texas. Public health \ncounseling and testing sites were established to reach people at high \nrisk for Hepatitis C, and to make referrals to health and social \nservices. In the first year, more than 13,000 clients received \ncounseling services, one-third of whom tested positive for Hepatitis C. \nIn addition, media campaigns were conducted to alert the public to the \ndangers of Hepatitis C. The savings for Texas were estimated to be \nalmost $500,000 a year.\n  Using this model, the Department of Health and Human Service will \ndevelop a plan to combat the Hepatitis C epidemic, with advice from the \npublic including physicians, researchers, patients, and advocates. \nConfidential counseling and voluntary testing programs will be offered, \nas well as immunization against Hepatitis A and B. Individuals at high \nrisk will be referred for further evaluation and management, including \ntreatment with anti-viral therapy.\n  Our bill calls for Hepatitis C coordinators, to be assigned by CDC, \nat state, local, and tribal levels to carry out education and \nsupervision of local health care workers. The Liver Disease Research \nAdvisory Board will be established to assist and advise CDC on liver \ndisease research. A confidential database will be created to enhance \nstudies the epidemiology of the illness.\n  The fight against Hepatitis C must begin with the underserved \npopulations who are disproportionately affected by the virus, \nespecially minority populations, the uninsured, and veterans. We must \nalso do all we can to protect hemophiliacs, renal dialysis patients, \nand AIDS patients.\n  Hepatitis C is a devastating disease, and this bill can be a major \nstep in fighting it. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact this bill into law.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators \nKennedy, Clinton, Daschle, Breaux, Jeffords, Biden, Dodd, Bingaman, \nHutchison, Campbell, Schumer, and Smith to introduce the Hepatitis C \nEpidemic Control and Prevention Act of 2003. I thank my colleagues for \njoining me in introducing this legislation that will improve the \nprevention, control, and medical management of hepatitis C.\n  Hepatitis C is the most common chronic bloodborne viral infection in \nthe United States, and it is the seventh leading cause of death in our \ncountry. Almost 4 million U.S. citizens are infected with hepatitis C, \nand of those 2.7 million are chronically infected and at least 2.5 \nmillion do not receive any treatment, which results in the continued \nspread of this devastating, yet preventable illness. The estimated \ndirect and indirect costs of hepatitis C infection are at least $600 \nmillion annually.\n  Symptoms of hepatitis C can include jaundice, fatigue, loss of \nappetite, and abdominal pain. While this disease may be asymptomatic in \nmost patients initially, between 50 and 80 percent will develop a \nchronic infection, and of these half will eventually develop cirrhosis \nor cancer of the liver. While diagnostic tests are available to \nidentify the disease, there is no vaccine to prevent hepatitis C, which \nmakes prevention and control measures crucial to reducing its incidence \nand prevalence.\n  The importance of improving hepatitis C prevention and control \nactivities was brought to my attention this past year by the family of \nChristen Graeber Winter. Christen was from Aberdeen, SD, and passed \naway 5 years ago at the age of 42. She had been very ill two decades \nearlier and required a blood transfusion. Christen became very sick a \nlittle over 5 years ago and was diagnosed with hepatitis C, a disease \nthat she had contracted from that blood transfusion that she had so \nmany years earlier. Christen died in 1998, and during the last months \nof her life she remained as active as possible and was committed to \nfinishing up her bachelor's degree at Presentation College, even though \nshe was very ill.\n  Everyone who knew Christen said she was a warm and caring person, and \neven towards the end of her life, she remained strong and was \ndetermined not to burden others with her deteriorating health. After \nher death, Christen's sister Carey started conducting research to learn \nabout hepatitis C. She knew nothing of the disease and was surprised to \nlearn how many people suffered from it. She learned that physicians are \nlargely unaware of hepatitis C and therefore cases often go undetected. \nCarey is now a strong advocate of promoting increased funding for \neducation, treatment, and prevention of this disease and has helped me \nunderstand how important it is that we in Congress establish the \nprograms and appropriate the funds necessary to prevent needless deaths \nlike the death of Christen.\n  The hepatitis C Epidemic Prevention and Control Act will help reduce \nthe number of people affected by this horrible illness and prevent \nstories like Carey's sister from continuing. The bill requires that the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services develop and implement an \nintegrated plan to combat\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nhepatitis C. While we know how to prevent the spread of this disease, \nthere have been limited programs to educate health professionals, at-\nrisk populations, and the general public on how to do so. This bill \nwill focus on increasing knowledge and awareness of such infections \namong providers and patients.\n  In addition to education, surveillance, early detection, and \ncounseling are important tools that must be used in order to control \nthis disease. Less than 50 percent of local health departments \nproviding counseling and only 23 percent provide testing for hepatitis \nC. This bill will require that CDC promote confidential testing \nprograms by working with State and local governments in order to catch \nhepatitis C cases early. It will also provide access to important \ncounseling activities in a variety of private and public health care \nsettings to help patients reduce the risk of harm to themselves and \nothers.\n  This important legislation is supported by a tripartisan coalition of \nmy colleagues. We have recognized that hepatitis C is a preventable \ndisease that can be halted with a strong emphasis on prevention and \ncontrol. I do not want to see more cases like that of Carey's sister. \nWe have an opportunity to make a real difference here, and I urge the \nSenate to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1146. A bill to implement the recommendations of the Garrison Unit \nTribal Advisory Committee by providing authorization for the \nconstruction of a rural health care facility on the Fort Berthold \nIndian Reservation, North Dakota; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague \nSenator Dorgan, to introduce the Three Affiliated Tribes Health \nFacility Compensation Act. This legislation fulfills a longstanding \nFederal commitment to the Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold in \nmy State of North Dakota.\n  In 1949, the Three Affiliated Tribes lost 156,000 acres of land, one-\nquarter of its land base, for the construction of the Garrison Dam \nalong the Missouri River. Three hundred twenty five families--eighty \npercent of the tribal membership--were forcibly relocated. Ninety-four \npercent of the agricultural lands of these farmers and ranchers was \ndestroyed. The Indian Health Service's hospital at the community of \nElbowoods was completely flooded. At the time, the Federal Government \ncommitted to replacing the hospital.\n  On May 10, 1985, then Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel signed a \ncharter creating the Garrison Unit Joint Tribal Advisory Committee, \nwhich was charged with examining the effects of the construction of the \nGarrison Dam and Reservoir on the tribe and making recommendations on \ncompensation. In its final report released on May 23, 1986, the \ncommittee found that the Three Affiliated Tribes were entitled to \nfinancial compensation as well as the replacement of lost \ninfrastructure including its health facility. The committee \nspecifically noted that the replacement of the health facility was an \n``emergency need.''\n  In 1992, Congress acted on some of the committee's recommendations by \npassing the Three Affiliated Tribes and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe \nEquitable Compensation Act. However, at the time, due to budget \nlimitations, Congress was not able to fulfill the commitments on \ninfrastructure replacement. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs in \nits report on the Act specifically noted that ``every effort should be \nmade by the Administration and Congress to provide additional federal \nfunding for these infrastructure priorities.'' More than 10 years \nlater, many of the infrastructure priorities still have not been met.\n  The legislative history on this matter is clear, a commitment was \nmade to the tribe that must be kept. The bill I am introducing will \nauthorize $20 million to construct for a health facility on the Fort \nBerthold Indian Reservation to fulfill this longstanding promise to the \nThree Affiliated Tribes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to increase \nsecurity and prevent terrorist attacks at our Nation's ports.\n  Ports are extremely important to our nation's economy, especially to \nmy State of California. The ports of LA, Long Beach, and Oakland handle \n40 percent of our Nation's cargo and generate billions of dollars in \neconomic activity each year in California alone.\n  The tragic events of September 11 demonstrated that we needed to make \nimprovements in our nation's security. Our ports are no exception.\n  We have begun to make improvements. As a member of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, I served as a conferee on the port security bill \nthat became law last November. This legislation mandated the creation \nof national and regional port security plans and better coordination of \nFederal, State, local, and private enforcement agencies. It also \nestablished a grant program for port authorities, waterfront operators, \nand state and local agencies to provide security infrastructure \nimprovements such as video cameras and more secure fencing. In \naddition, it calls for the development of regulations to determine \nsecure areas in ports and to limit access through background checks and \na transportation security identification card.\n  This legislation was a good first step. But, we need to do more. And \nI believe we should harness the best of our high-tech capabilities to \nimprove port security. That is why today I am introducing the High-Tech \nPort Security Act.\n  This legislation has three high tech improvements for our nation's \nports.\n  First, the bill would require that all containers used in our \nNation's ports be blast resistant. The U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity would develop a standard for such containers and would work \nwith shipping companies to ensure that all new containers are blast \nresistant.\n  Second, the bill would require that all containers be inspected with \nadvanced technology before leaving our ports and entering our roads, \nhighways, and communities. The Department of Homeland Security would \nestablish a standard for cargo screening technology and ensure that \nthis technology is installed at all ports, so every incoming container \nis screened before it leaves the port. This is extremely important \nbecause currently only two to three percent of all containers are \ninspected.\n  Third, this bill will focus protection on the Nation's largest ports \nby establishing high tech command and control centers to coordinate and \nmonitor security at the 20 busiest ports in the United States.\n  The technologies needed to secure our Nation's vital ports are \navailable today, and they should start being used now. There is no time \nto lose. The vulnerability of our seaports is no secret; it is a well \nknown gap in our homeland defense. This legislation will help close \nthat gap.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1150. A bill to establish the Bob Hope American Patriot Award; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bob Hope \nAmerican Patriot Award Act of 2003. This legislation would create a \npresidential commemorative award for an individual or organization that \ndemonstrates ``extraordinary love of this Nation and devotion to its \ncitizens in the form of true patriotism.''\n  In addition, this legislation would honor one of the most respected \nfigures in America, who for seven decades has served our Nation with \nhis talents in entertainment. As many are familiar, I am speaking today \nof Bob Hope.\n  To celebrate Bob Hope's 100th birthday on May 29, 2003, this \nlegislation would give the President the opportunity to annually \nrecognize the wonderful trait of ``patriotism,'' so well exemplified by \nHope throughout his lifetime. Mr. Hope has long demonstrated that \nentertainment can positively influence ``love of country and dedication \nto the spiritual well-being of America's troops.''\n  A master of the skills of acting and singing, Bob Hope may be the \nmost talented and prolific entertainer of our time. Many of us will \nrecall his work in the series of ``Road'' films with Bing Crosby and \nDorothy Lamour. His expansive career has involved stage musical comedy, \nmotion pictures, and live appearances at the USO shows.\n  On May 6, 1941, Bob Hope began a 50-year service with the United \nStates Armed Forces, in which he did approximately 60 USO tours. He has \ntoured\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\nU.S. military stations all over the world, including Germany, the South \nPacific, and Vietnam. Veterans and U.S. soldiers alike will always \nremember his variety shows, which included skits, dancers, specialty \nacts, and comedic monologues. These monologues were particularly \ntouching as they commiserated with the daily travails of a soldier's \nlife.\n  Over the years, Bob Hope has received well-deserved recognition for \nhis dedication to our Nation. He has been honored with numerous awards, \nincluding the Congressional Gold Medal, the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, and the Distinguished Service Medal from each of the branches \nof the military. Several years ago, I co-sponsored legislation naming \nhim an Honorary Veteran for his humanitarian services to the U.S. Armed \nForces.\n  Bob Hope epitomizes true patriotism and service to our country, and I \ncannot think of anybody better to name this new award after.\n  This legislation is important because it would not only carry on the \nname of such an honorable figure, but would recognize future \nindividuals or organizations who have dedicated themselves to promoting \nthe values of freedom, democracy, and goodwill. This award would be the \nfirst of its kind--honoring American civilians specifically for \npatriotism.\n  This legislation would give the President the authority to annually \nselect either one individual or one organization to receive this \ncommemorative award at a White House ceremony. The President would also \nbe given the power to interpret the selection criteria and determine \nthe form that the award would take, such as a plaque, medal or flag.\n  I believe this legislation is timely and befitting of both Mr. Hope \nand the great citizens of our Nation. In these challenging times, it is \nimportant to encourage and recognize Americans who have given so much \nto the cause of patriotism, asking for nothing in return.\n  My hope is that this award, established through this legislation, \nwill both carry on the wonderful legacy of Bob Hope and bring awareness \nto the magnanimous spirit of our fellow citizens. I call on this body \nto enact this legislation promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 1151. A bill to rescind the Department of Veterans Affairs \nmemorandum of July 18, 2002, in which Directors of health service \nnetworks in the Department of Veterans Affairs are directed to ensure \nthat no marketing activities to enroll new veterans occur within their \nnetworks; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould restore a valuable--and statutorily mandate--service to our \nNation's veterans and their families.\n  In July 2002, Department of Veterans Affairs Deputy Under Secretary \nfor Health for Operations and Management Laura Miller sent a memo to \nVeterans Integrated Service Network Directors ordering them to ``ensure \nthat no marketing activities to enroll new veterans occur within \n[their] networks.''\n  This memo cited an increased demand for VA health care services as \nthe reason for this change in policy. While it is clear that more \nfunding should be provided for VA health care and other programs, it is \ninappropriate for the VA to institute a policy to stop making veterans \naware of the health care services for which they may be eligible.\n  I joined with a number of our colleagues last year in sending a \nletter to the President asking that this policy be immediately \nreversed. I regret that the VA's reply indicated that the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs stands by this policy, which remains in effect.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, Veterans Outreach Protection \nAct, would rescind the policy issued in this memorandum and prohibit \nthe VA from using Federal funding to enforce this policy. This bill is \na companion to legislation introduced in the House by Congressman Paul \nKanjorski earlier this year.\n  I have long been concerned that tens of thousands of our veterans are \nunaware of federal health care and other benefits for which they may be \neligible. We can and should do more to educate our veterans and their \nfamilies about these benefits, and to provide adequate funding to \nensure that all veterans who wish to take advantage of their benefits \nare able to do so. Halting health care marketing activities is not the \nanswer. Our brave veterans have earned these benefits. The Federal \ndepartment that is charged with advocating for and providing benefits \nto our veterans should not be allowed to continue to restrict health \ncare outreach activities.\n  In addition to this bill, I am currently working to draft legislation \nto improve VA-wide outreach efforts. Our veterans and their families \nhave made great personal sacrifices to protect our freedoms. We owe \nthem a great debt of gratitude. Making sure that our veterans know \nabout the benefits that they have earned is an important first step in \nstarting to reply this debt.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Outreach Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RESCISSION OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS \n                   MEMORANDUM.\n\n       (a) Rescission of Memorandum.--The memorandum of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs dated July 18, 2002, from the \n     Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and \n     Management with the subject ``Status of VHA Enrollment and \n     Associated Issues'' is hereby rescinded. Marketing activities \n     of Directors of health service networks (known as ``Veterans \n     Integrated Service Networks'') of the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to enroll new veterans within their respective \n     networks shall be carried out without regard to such \n     memorandum.\n       (b) Funding Limitation.--No funds available to the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs may be used to carry out the \n     memorandum referred to in subsection (a) or otherwise to \n     implement the policy contained in that memorandum.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1152. A bill to reauthorize the United States Fire Administration, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined this morning by \nSenators Hollings in introducing legislation to reauthorize the United \nStates Fire Administration, USFA, for fiscal year 2004 through fiscal \nyear 2006. This legislation would also re-establish the position of the \nU.S. Fire Administrator, which would serve in the new Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  USFA's mission is to reduce the loss of life and property because of \nfire and related emergencies. Each year, fire injures and kills more \nAmericans than all other natural disasters combined. Death rates by \nfire in the Unites States are among the highest in the industrialized \nworld.\n  The U.S. Fire Administration utilizes a number of tools to fulfill \nits mission. USFA's National Fire Data Center administers a national \nsystem for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating data and \ninformation on fire and other emergency incidents to state and local \ngovernments and the fire community. The National Fire Academy, NFA, is \nthe premiere training academy for fire services. It is estimated that \nsince 1975, over 1.4 million firefighters and other first-responders \nhave benefitted from NFA training classes in emergency management, fire \nprevention, and anti-terrorism. USFA also engages in research, testing, \nand evaluation activities with public and private entities to promote \nand improve fire and life safety. Finally, USFA administers the popular \nAssistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which provides competitive \ngrants to local fire departments for training, wellness and fitness \nprograms, vehicles, firefighting equipment, and fire prevention.\n  The U.S. Fire Administrator plays an important role in our nation's \nfire control policy and homeland security initiatives by serving as the \npoint-of-contact for the fire services. This position was eliminated in \nlast year's legislation that established the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. On April 30, 2003, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation heard testimony from many of the major fire service \norganizations regarding the importance of the U.S. Fire\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nAdministrator position, and the need for the Administrator to serve as \na representative of the fire services within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This legislation would re-establish this position.\n  Firefighting remains one of the most dangerous professions in the \nUnites States. We rely on firefighters to aid us in fires, accidents, \nand natural disasters. However, we have also witnessed the role that \nfirefighters play as the first responders on the scene of any possible \nterrorist attack. It is important that we pass this legislation to \nensure that the Federal government continues its appropriate role in \nhelping our fire services adapt to this new challenge.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and look forward to \nworking with them to ensure timely passage of this legislation. I also \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States Fire \n     Administration Reauthorization Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RE-ESTABLISHMENT OF POSITION OF UNITED STATES FIRE \n                   ADMINISTRATOR.\n\n       Section 1513 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 does not \n     apply to the position or office of Administrator of the \n     United States Fire Administration, who shall continue to be \n     appointed and compensated as provided by section 5(b) of the \n     Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. \n     2204(b)) after the functions vested by law in the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency have been transferred to the \n     Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and Response in \n     accordance with section 503 of the Homeland Security Act of \n     2002.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       Section 17(g)(1) of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control \n     Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. 2216(g)(1)) is amended to read as \n     follows: ``(1) Except as otherwise specifically provided with \n     respect to the payment of claims under section 11 of this \n     Act, there are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the \n     purposes of this Act--\n       ``(A) $52,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       ``(B) $53,560,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       ``(C) $55,166,800 for fiscal year 2006.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. BOND):\n  S. 1153. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit \nmedicare-eligible veterans to receive an out-patient medication \nbenefit, to provide that certain veterans who receive such benefit are \nnot otherwise eligible for medical care and services from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain the \nprovisions of the ``Veterans Prescription Drugs Assistance Act of \n2003,'' a bill that I have introduced today to assist Medicare-eligible \nveterans struggling with the costs of prescription medications.\n  I fully understand that Congress, and the President, are working very \nhard on legislation to take on the larger issue of providing a \nprescription drug benefit for all American seniors. I applaud that \neffort, and I will continue to work with my colleagues to see that \nCongress enacts legislation to help all seniors who struggle with the \never-increasing costs of necessary medications. But in the meantime, as \nChairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, I offer legislation to \nallow Medicare-eligible veterans to obtain prescription drugs from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, at the significantly discounted \ncosts that VA, as a high-volume purchaser of prescriptions medications, \nis able to secure in the marketplace.\n  Earlier this year, VA Secretary Anthony J. Principi was forced to \nlimit access to VA care by suspending new enrollments of non-service-\ndisabled middle and higher income veterans who were not enrolled for \ncare as of January 17, 2003. The Secretary was forced to so act because \nthe number of patients provided care by VA has more than doubled in \njust five years. And as a result, VA's medical care system has been \noverwhelmed and, as a consequence, VA has been unable to provide timely \naccess to healthcare for all veterans who have sought it and \nappointment waiting times have grown to alarming levels. But in almost \nevery news story that followed the Secretary's difficult decision, it \nwas noted that many of the new enrollees who had overwhelmed VA's \ncapacity to provide care were Medicare-eligible veterans who were able \nto get Medicare-financed care elsewhere--but who were seeking access to \nthe relatively generous prescription drug program provided to veterans \nunder VA care.\n  Currently, VA provides enrolled patients with prescription \nmedications for $7.00 for each 30-day supply. But to get such \nprescriptions, the veteran must obtain the full range of medical care \nfrom VA. This fact, coupled with the Secretary's decision to close \nenrollment, means that veterans who are now--or who will be--eligible \nfor Medicare who had not enrolled for VA care prior to January 17, \n2003, will be unable to access VA's generous prescription drug \nbenefits. This legislation would provide some relief for those \nveterans. In addition, I anticipate that it may induce some VA-enrolled \nMedicare-eligible veterans--those who were happy with their Medicare-\nfinanced care but who enrolled for VA care to gain access to VA-\nsupplied drugs--to return to non-VA care with knowledge that they will \nbe able to get their non-VA prescriptions filled through VA. Enactment \nof this provision, then, would reduce--not exacerbate--VA patient \nbacklog numbers.\n  The premise of this legislation is straightforward: VA fills and \ndistributes more than 100 million prescriptions each year for its 4.5 \nmillion veteran-patients. As a result, it has significant purchasing \npower--power which, coupled with VA's formulary program, allows it to \nnegotiate very favorable prices for prescription drugs. According to \nthe National Association of Chain Drug Stores, the average ``cash \ncost'' of a prescription in 2001 was $40.22. The average VA per-\nprescription cost in 2001 was $22.87--almost 50 percent less. The \naverage per-prescription price paid by VA this year is up to just under \n$25--a slower growth rate than the 6.7 percent annual growth \nexperienced in the population at large since 2001.\n  My purpose is to afford Medicare-eligible veterans access to such \ndiscounts. I do not propose that VA be directed to supply drugs to all \nMedicare-eligible veterans at VA expense, or even with a partial VA \nsubsidy. VA has stated that such a mandate would divert VA funding--\nwhich, clearly, is already stretched to the limit--away from VA \npriority patients: the service-connected, the poor, and those with \nspecial needs. I accept VA's statement of concern; I accept and I \ninsist--that scarce funding be directed, first, to meet the needs of \npriority patients. This legislation, therefore, requires that VA \nrecover the costs of drugs it supplies under this program from veterans \nwho bring their prescriptions from outside doctors to VA.\n  I do not propose to tell VA in this bill how to recover these costs. \nVA is better positioned than I to make such judgments. Thus, my \nlegislation provides flexibility to VA to design and test payment \nmechanisms to best accomplish cost recovery while still easing \nveterans' access to the drugs they need. It might be that enrollment \nfees, a copayment structure, or a simple ``cost-plus''--for \nadministrative expenses pricing format--or some combination of those \nmechanisms--works best. And it might be that different approaches work \nbest in different regions of the country. I intend for the VA to \nexperiment with different pricing structures to determine what works \nbest. But I also intend that veterans get a break on prescription drug \npricing.\n  Those who would benefit from this program are World War II and Korean \nWar veterans who answered their country's call over 50 years ago. As \nthey age, many desperately need relief from high drug prices. My \npurpose is not to disparage the drug companies; their discoveries have \ntruly been marvels. But that is precious little comfort to a Medicare \nparticipant who, whatever the drug's overall utility might be, cannot \nafford both the drug and food or shelter or heat. Many such persons \nreside in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania where, just last month, a \ngenuine titan in the industrial history of the United States, Bethlehem \nSteel, ceased to exist. Many retired steelworkers who are also \nveterans--and who never needed VA because of company-paid\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\nbenefits--have lost their health insurance coverage and, with it, \nprescription drug benefits. These people need a break. This bill could \nprovide it.\n  The premise of this legislation is simple: veteran access to VA \nmarket-driven discounts. Yet, the assistance it could provide might be \nprofound. I do hope that Congress will find a way to provide \nprescription drug benefits to all seniors. But for now, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill so that the problem might be solved--or \nat least reduced--for seniors who served. They deserve it, and we \nshould do it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRcord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1153\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Veterans Prescription Drugs Assistance Act of 2003. As an \noriginal co-sponsor, I am pleased to join my colleague, the Chairman of \nthe Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Specter in introducing this \nimportant legislation that addresses the medical care needs of \nMedicare-eligible veterans. I applaud Senator Specter for his \nleadership on this important issue.\n  For several years, many veterans have not been able to receive timely \nhealth care from the Department of Veterans Affairs due to the long \nwaiting lines created by the huge demand for prescription drugs. Under \ncurrent policy, veterans are required to see a VA doctor before \nreceiving their medication even when they have already\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\nhad a prescription written by a privately licensed physician. This \npolicy has not only contributed to the long waiting lines, but it has \ndenied care to service-connected and lower income veterans. It is a \nmoral imperative that we correct this problem and I believe that this \nlegislation is a step in the right direction.\n  As Chair of the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, my top priority is ensuring that the VA has adequate \nfunding to provide accessible and quality care for our Nation's \nveterans. Unfortunately, despite record funding increases over the past \nfew years, veterans must still wait for several months to see a VA \ndoctor.\n  This past January, VA Secretary Principi had to take the unfortunate \nbut necessary step of closing new enrollments to middle and higher \nincome veterans who do not have service-connected disabilities. Many of \nthese so-called Priority 8 veterans have Medicare insurance but do not \nhave a prescription drug benefit. I recognize that the Congress and the \nPresident are trying to address the prescription drug issue for all \nAmerican seniors and I will continue to fight to ensure that a Medicare \nprescription drug bill is enacted. Nevertheless, I believe that we need \nto raise awareness of the tragedy that many veterans suffer today to \nensure that no matter what occurs during this session of Congress, they \nare not left behind.\n  This bill contains a number of important provisions but I highlight \none particular measure. As I mentioned earlier, current policy requires \nveterans to see a VA doctor before having their prescription filled, \neven if they have had already seen a private doctor. This legislation \nallows eligible veterans to fill their prescriptions at the VA without \nhaving to see a VA doctor. This not only greatly streamlines the \nprocess and time for veterans to receive much-needed medications, but \nit also provides relief to the waiting lines so that our higher \npriority veterans can receive timely care. In other words, this \nlegislation is a win-win for all veterans.\n  This legislation may not be perfect but it is important to begin a \ndialogue on the prescription drug needs of our nation's veterans. I \nwelcome my colleagues' comments and comments from the Administration. I \nbelieve that we can resolve this matter this year. I thank my \ncolleagues for their attention to this matter and I look forward to \nworking with all of you over the next several weeks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1154.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Women's Small \nBusiness Programs Improvement Act of 2003'' in recognition of the \ncritical potential that women entrepreneurs hold for the Nation's \neconomic welfare. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Bond and Burns \nin offering this important legislation.\n  Today, women own nearly a third of the Nation's small businesses--\ntotaling nearly 7 million women-owned enterprises that contribute \napproximately $1.2 trillion to be economy annually. That number, \nhowever, does not include jointly owned businesses in which women play \na major role but hold less than fifty percent of the ownership rights. \nSo, the actual number of women with significant roles in business goes \nwell beyond 7 million--and they are growing rapidly.\n  These figures reflect the successes that women entrepreneurs are \nhaving despite facing the same challenges for the past twenty years--\naccess to business assistance, access to capital, and access to Federal \nGovernment contract opportunities. The ``glass ceiling'' in corporate \nAmerica that led many women to start a small business has been \ntransformed into a another obstacle--``a glass doorway''--between women \nwho want to start and grow businesses and the lending and Federal \ncontract markets these women entrepreneurs seek to enter. Overcoming \nthese obstacles requires that women are provided the business \nassistance tools they need, which we can ensure through the programs \nand services established within the Small Business Administration, SBA, \nspecifically for women.\n  As the new Chair of the Committee on Small Business, I have been \ncarefully examining the SBA's programs with a particular focus on the \nagency's initiatives that are intended to foster women-owned \nbusinesses. During the past year, witnesses and participants of the \nCommittee's hearings and roundtables clearly identified the concerns of \nwomen business owners: the lack of business assistance programs \nfor existing small businesses; scarcity of financial resources for \nstart-up or expansion; limited opportunities for Federal Government \ncontracts; and the need for specific research on women's business \nownership.\n\n  In addition, we heard concerns from the Women's Business Centers and \ntheir advocates about the Women's Business Centers Sustainability \nGrants Program, which sunsets in 2003. These centers have been \nextraordinarily successful in providing assistance to women in all \nwalks of life--those who once received public assistance but now \noperate businesses and create jobs; women transitioning from employee \nto small business employer; and establish women-business owners who \ncreate and manufacture products for sale at home and abroad. The \nCenters nurture women entrepreneurs through business and financial \nplanning and help with critical issues like securing funding for \nstartup and expansion. Despite these successes, however, funding \nquestions have long plagued the program.\n  Adding to the information gained from its official activities, the \nCommittee staff also conducted a review of all SBA funded and sponsored \nactivities for women entrepreneurs, held discussions with women \nbusiness leaders, and obtained information in the process of preparing \nfor the reauthorization of SBA Non-Credit Programs.\n  Our findings support specific changes to ensure that the SBA will be \nmore accountable in its delivery of programs and services through the \nOffice of Women's Business Ownership. Specifically, based on the need \nand the impressive record of the Women's Business Centers, there is \nstrong support for making the program permanent, provided that the SBA \nstreamlines the grants administration processes. Improvements in the \nfocus and operations for the National Women's Business Council and the \nWomen's Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise would also \nenhance their missions and ability to serve women entrepreneurs.\n  The bill I introduce today is designed to address these issues and \nimprove the programs and services that the SBA delivers across the \nnation for women business owners through the Office of Women's Business \nOwnership, the Women's Business Centers Program, the National Women's \nBusiness Council, and the Interagency Committee on Women's Business \nEnterprise. The key elements of the bill's improvements will provide \ndirection, consolidation and integration of existing programs that have \nbeen previously created to offer opportunities for women through their \nentrepreneurial endeavors.\n  The ``Women's Small Business Programs Improvement Act of 2003'' would \nimprove the entrepreneurial environment for women seeking assistance \nand opportunity through Federal Government sponsored programs. A key to \nthe success of this bill is the integration of all internal and \nexternal SBA programs and partnerships. The provisions in this bill are \ntimely and in response to the many concerns of women business owners \nthat I have received from my constituents in Maine and from across the \ncountry through the Small Business Committee.\n  Additionally, the bill makes the Women's Business Center a permanent \nprogram for existing eligible Centers so that women can depend on the \nexperienced services of small business long-term counseling and small \nbusiness education and training. The Centers have proven to be a great \nvalue the communities they serve so we must ensure that their programs \nand services continue to be available.\n  The ``Women's Small Business Programs Improvement Act of 2003'' \nensure that women entrepreneurs at all stages of business ownership get \nthe assistance they need so that success\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\nthrough business growth is more easily obtained. And it achieves that \ngoal, not by establish costly new initiatives, but by building on \nsuccessful establish programs within the SBA and improving their \ndelivery for the benefit of current and future women entrepreneurs.\n  As the Small Business Committee continues its work on legislation to \nreauthorize the SBA, we will be addressing all of the agency's \nprograms. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to \nensure that the provisions of this bill are included so the growth of \nwomen owned business in America can reach its full potential.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis be printed into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1154\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The SBA Office of Women's Business Ownership is \n     in a position to take the ``real world problems'' faced by \n     women on a day-to-day basis and work with all of its partners \n     and public and private resources to expand its menu of \n     programs and services.\n       The bill will direct the SBA Office of Women's Business \n     Ownership to develop and make available new programs and \n     services for established women owned businesses--adding to \n     the SBA menu of small business start-up programs.\n       The new programs and services for women would assist women-\n     owned small business solve problems concerning business \n     operations, manufacturing, technology, finance, Federal \n     government contracting and international trade and other \n     disciplines required for starting, operating, and growing \n     small\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\n     business in changing economies. New programs would be based \n     on recommendations by the National Women's Business Council, \n     the Women's Business Centers, and the Interagency Committee \n     on Women's Business Enterprise, these programs and services \n     would be developed by the SBA in partnership with its funded \n     resource partners and private sector cosponsors.\n       The bill will direct the SBA to provide training for \n     District Office Women Business Ownership Representatives \n     (existing staff who carry out marketing and outreach \n     activities) and District Office of Technical Representatives \n     (existing staff who carry out grant programmatic and \n     financial oversight) and to provide resources for the \n     District Offices to carry out their responsibilities in \n     support of women's business ownership programs.\n       The bill will direct the SBA to submit a report on data \n     collections on women's programs and services to the Congress \n     no later than November 1st of each year.\n       The bill will direct the SBA to work with the Association \n     of Women's Business Centers, the National Women's Business \n     Council and the Interagency Committee on Women Business \n     Enterprise to develop marketing and outreach programs, as \n     well as procurement training programs, on Federal government \n     contracting and business development opportunities.\n\n\n                  ii. women's business center program\n\n       The Women's Business Center Program, established in 1988, \n     provides long-term training and counseling to encourage small \n     business ownership through nonprofit organizations. The \n     competitive grant award programs is administered through the \n     SBA Headquarters Office of Women's Business Ownership (OWBO) \n     Grants Management Division, with oversight designated to the \n     SBA District Office Technical Representative. The Women's \n     Business Center program has been well received by the \n     recipient users and the program has been a tremendous \n     marketing and outreach tool for the SBA in recent years. The \n     SBA estimated in Fiscal Year 2002, the Women's Business \n     Center program had an approximate return of $161 for every $1 \n     invested in the program.\n       The bill makes the Women's Business Centers a permanent \n     grant program with renewal options, replacing the Pilot \n     Sustainability Grants Program. The Pilot program sunsets in \n     2003.\n       Existing Women's Business Centers will be eligible to \n     submit proposals every 3 years. The program improvements are \n     modeled after the SBDC grant program and several provisions \n     contained in the Sustainability Grant Program. Eligibility \n     and evaluation criteria will be establish that encourages \n     existing productive Centers to continue to participate in the \n     program.\n       The bill recognizes the Association of Women's Business \n     Centers (AWBCs) and directs the SBA Office of Women's \n     Business Ownership to partner with the Association in \n     developing and administering the programs delivered through \n     the Centers (modeled after the SBA's current partnership with \n     the Association of Small Business Development Centers with \n     regard to the Small Business Development Center program).\n       The bill directs the SBA to streamline the reporting \n     requirements of the Centers recognizing the limited grant \n     award and limited human resources within the Centers.\n\n\n       iii. interagency committee on women's business enterprise\n\n       The Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise \n     was created in 1977, as an interagency task force. By \n     Executive Order 112138, in May 1979, the name was changed to \n     the Interagency Council. In 1988, the Women's Business \n     Ownership Act (Public Law 100-533) replaced the Interagency \n     Council with a joint public-private sector National Women's \n     Business Council. The SBA Reauthorization and Amendment Act \n     of 1997 (Public Law 103-403) revised the Council's structure, \n     returning to all public-sector participants to comprise an \n     expanded Interagency Committee on Women's Business \n     Enterprise.\n       Under current law, there is no authorization for \n     appropriations to support the activities on the Interagency \n     Committee. Nor are there clear directives on the operations \n     and interaction of the Federal agency and department \n     representatives. The Federal agencies and departments \n     represented on the Interagency Committee allocate existing \n     personnel and resources to support participation on the \n     Interagency Committee. The Interagency Committee is required \n     to submit, through SBA, an annual report to the President and \n     Congress, but there is no record of such annual reports being \n     prepared or delivered for the past three years.\n       In addition, the President has not appointed a Chairperson \n     to carry out the mission of the Interagency Committee, and \n     therefore, it is inactive.\n       The bill will direct that the SBA Deputy Administrator \n     temporarily fulfill the needs of the Interagency Committee \n     Chair if vacant until the President makes an appointment. \n     When the Interagency Committee is active and a Chair is in \n     place, the SBA Office of Women's Business Ownership serves as \n     Co-Chair. This action will provide for the continuity of \n     activities and avoid the periods of time of inactivity.\n       The bill will direct the Interagency Committee to conduct \n     three official meetings each year:\n       In October to plan upcoming fiscal year activities;\n       In February to track year-to-date agency contracting goals; \n     and\n       In August to evaluate fiscal year progress and begin the \n     report process.\n       The bill creates a Policy Advisory Group consisting of \n     representatives from the SBA, the Department of Commerce, the \n     Department of Labor, the Department of Defense, Association \n     of Women's Business Centers, and two individuals and two \n     organizations that are members of the National Women's \n     Business Council. Creating the Policy Advisory Group will \n     return the Interagency to a mix of public/private members to \n     provide the energy and direction so badly needed to revive \n     the intent of the Interagency Committee.\n       The bill will create three subcommittees:\n       Subcommittee on Manufacturing, technology and Professional \n     Services;\n       Subcommittee on Travel and International Trade; and\n       Subcommittee on Procurement and Federal Contracting.\n       These subcommittees will create the opportunity for smaller \n     groups to work on specific issues. Each subcommittee will \n     meet once a quarter and report their minutes to the National \n     Women's Business Council, the SBA Office of Women's Business \n     Ownership, and the SBA Contract Assistance for Women Business \n     Ownership Office. In addition to the Policy Advisory Group \n     members, all Federal departments and agencies may participate \n     at will.\n\n\n                 iv. national women's business council\n\n       The National Women's Business Council was created by the \n     Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988 to serve as an \n     advisory body because the Interagency Committee had been \n     criticized for inactivity. By separating the Council from the \n     Interagency Committee (1994 Act), the Council was able to \n     focus on its mission. The 1997 Reauthorization Act provided \n     for improved reporting duties and Council appointments.\n       The 1988 Act required the Council to conduct studies on \n     issues relating to women-owned businesses, including the \n     award of Federal prime contracts to women-owned businesses \n     and access to credit and investment capital by women \n     entrepreneurs. In general, the National Women's Business \n     Council's statutory mandate is broad and lacks an integration \n     with other women's business ownership programs.\n       Although the Council has not received its authorized level \n     of $1 million in funding, it has been required to designate \n     $550,000 of its appropriated funding to research studies. The \n     level of funding for Fiscal Year 2003 was $750,000. The \n     Administration has proposed a change in the amount that can \n     be spent on research studies--from a set amount of dollars \n     allocated to a 55 percentage of appropriated funds.\n       The bill supports full funding for the National Women's \n     Business Council and full authority for the Chairperson to \n     conduct the Council's activities. In addition, the bill \n     establishes an allocation of appropriated funds for research.\n       The change will provide the opportunity for the Council to \n     engage in activities, conferences and the development of \n     programs and services, at the direction of the Chairperson, \n     and be more pro-active in the years 2004 through 2006.\n       The bill creates three Sub-committees on the Council (which \n     parallel the new subcommittees that the bill establishes for \n     the Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise):\n       Subcommittee on Manufacturing, Technology and Professional \n     Services;\n       Subcommittee on Travel and International Trade; and\n       Subcommittee on Procurement and Federal Contracting.\n       These subcommittees will create the opportunity for smaller \n     groups to work on specific issues and interact with the \n     Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise and the \n     SBA Office of Women's Business Ownership. Recognizing that \n     the membership of the Council includes very active business \n     owners and leaders, rather than establish official meetings \n     for the Committees, the participants may participate via \n     conference calls or video conferencing.\n       The bill will provide the Council with cosponsorship \n     authority. The SBA advised the Council in 2003 that the \n     Council did not have sufficient authority to engage in \n     cosponsored activities (such conferences, training \n     activities, and materials). The inability to engage in \n     cosponsored activities would seriously impede the works of \n     the Council in the future. It is through cosponsored \n     activities, partially funded by the private-sector or other \n     government agencies, that the Council is able to conduct \n     research as well as produce activities for women-owned small \n     businesses.\n       The bill will clarify the membership representation. At \n     present, there is a problem with the interpretation of \n     Council membership as applied to an organization, business or \n     individual. Clarification language is needed to allow an \n     organization or business to change the names of individuals \n     representing the organization or business on the Council \n     without interruption.\n       The bill directs the Council to establish a repository, at \n     the direction of the Chairperson, of information and research \n     on women's entrepreneurship.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1155. A bill to repeal section 801 of the Revenue Act of 1916; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to bring \nthe United States into compliance with its obligations under the World \nTrade Organization.\n  The basic thrust of the bill is simple--it repeals section 801 of the \nRevenue Act of 1916 which the WTO Appellate Body found to be \ninconsistent with our responsibilities under Article VI of the GATT \n1994 and the WTO Antidumping Agreement. Repealing section 801 will \ntherefore bring the United States into conformity with its WTO \nobligations.\n  Section 801, which has been referred to as the Antidumping Act of \n1916, allows private parties to sue importers of dumped imports in U.S. \ndistrict courts, and also establishes criminal liability for importing \ndumped goods. While the provision is seldom used, there are several \nrecent court cases pending in the United States where litigants have \nsued under the Antidumping Act of 1916.\n  I am introducing this legislation because I believe it is important \nthat the United States comply with its WTO obligations. While we may \nnot agree with each and every decision that comes out of the WTO, we \nshould not pick and choose which decisions we will comply with. The \nbottom line is that the United States benefits greatly from a rules-\nbased world trading system. We have had considerable success in \nbringing down foreign import barriers, and this has resulted in \nincreased trade, economic growth, and more jobs right here in the \nUnited States. When we comply with adverse decisions we only strengthen \nour position in other cases where we challenge the impermissible import \nrestraints of our trading partners, such as the de facto biotechnology \nmoratorium adopted by the European Union, which continues to hurt \nfarmers in Iowa and is now under challenge before the WTO. I want other \ncountries to comply when we win, so I think it is important to comply \nwhen we lose.\n  I would also like to point out an important aspect of the bill I am \nintroducing. The bill brings us into compliance with our WTO \nobligations, but it does not apply retroactively. I think retroactive \napplication of repeal would be wrong in this case for a number of \nreasons.\n  First, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that under the constitutional \ndue process standard, retroactive application of economic legislation \nis acceptable only where it is justified by a rational legislative \npurpose. To my knowledge, no one has yet articulated any reason, let \nalone a rational legislative purpose, for depriving litigants in U.S. \ncourts of the opportunity for final adjudication of their disputes in \nthis case. In fact, the Appellate Body Ruling itself does not call for \na retroactive repeal of section 801 in order for the United States to \nconform to its WTO obligations. It seems to me that no rational \nlegislative purpose is served by retroactive repeal of section 801 when \nthe Appellate Body Report does not ask for retroactive repeal and the \nAdministration has not explained why retroactive repeal is necessary.\n  The Supreme Court has also held that the justification for \nprospective application of legislation may not suffice for retroactive \napplication of the same legislation. The justification for repeal of \nsection 801 is to conform to our WTO obligations; again, if WTO \ncompliance does not call for retroactive repeal, then the justification \nfor repealing section 801 should not extend to a retroactive repeal of \nthis provision.\n  Second, the administration and Congress have consistently taken the \nposition that retroactive repeal is not necessary to ensure compliance \nwith our WTO obligations in all cases, particularly in cases dealing \nwith U.S. trade remedy laws. The Joint Report of the Committee of \nFinance, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, Committee \non Government Affairs of the U.S. Senate which accompanied the \nlegislation implementing the Uruguay Round Agreements Act explicitly \nnoted that compliance with WTO panels in trade remedy cases applied \nprospectively only. The Joint Report continued that prospective \napplication ``is consistent with the general principle in the GATT, and \nin the future WTO, that panel decisions do not have retroactive \neffect.''\n  This principle is fully consistent with the text of the WTO agreement \nitself. Article 19.1 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding states \nonly that ``{w here a panel or the Appellate Body concludes that a \nmeasure is inconsistent with a covered agreement, it shall recommend \nthat the Member concerned bring the measure into conformity with that \nAgreement. In addition to its recommendations, the panel or Appellate \nBody may suggest ways in which the Member concerned could implement the \nrecommendations.'' Thus, the text of the WTO calls only for ``bringing \nthe measure into conformity'' and not retroactive application of an \nAppellate Body decision.\n  To my knowledge, this is the position which has consistently been \ntaken by the U.S. Government and the WTO Appellate Body. In fact, with \nthe exception of one aberrant decision by a panel in the case of \nAustralian Automotive Leather, WTO panels and the Appellate Body have \ncontinued to adhere to the general principle that retroactive \ncompliance measures are inappropriate.\n  The panel ruling in Australian Automotive Leather is instructive. The \nWTO Dispute Settlement Body adopted a panel report that recommended the \nAustralian recipient of a subsidy pay back the entire amount of the $30 \nmillion Australian dollar subsidy it had received. This recommendation \nwent far beyond what the United States asked for. The United States \nsought only the return of the prospective value of the subsidy that the \nAustralian automotive leather company had received. The United States \nargued that repayment of the entire subsidy was inappropriate and \nultimately settled the dispute with Australia in a deal that required \nthe automotive leather company to pay back $7.2 million Australian \ndollars to the Government of Australia, which reflected the prospective \nvalue of the subsidy. Thus, both U.S. law and U.S. trade policy conform \nto the general principle that compliance measures should be prospective \nin nature.\n  Finally, I believe that as a general matter, attempts at retroactive \ncompliance with WTO rulings can make for bad trade policy. The intent \nof the rules-based trading system established under the WTO is to bring \nMembers into compliance so that going forward international trade can \nbe conducted on a level playing field. There is just no telling where \nefforts at retroactive compliance may lead. While in this instance the \nretroactive repeal of section 801 may seem clear-cut to some, it could \nset a dangerous precedent for future cases. Imagine if the WTO \nAppellate Body required or the U.S. Government advocated for \nretroactive application of a measure repealing the Extraterritorial \nIncome Act/Foreign Sales Corporation tax regime. The result would be \nludicrous.\n  Rather than foster the establishment of a level playing field, \nefforts at retroactive compliance may well distort markets to an extent \neven greater than the underlying measure that was found to be WTO \ninconsistent. We need to carefully consider whether retroactive repeal \nof a statutory provision is appropriate. I believe that considerations \nof judicial precedent, legislative intent, established practice under \nthe GATT and the WTO, as well as good trade policy, all mitigate \nagainst the retroactive repeal of section 801.\n  I call upon my colleagues to support this bill repealing section 801. \nPassing the bill will bring us into compliance with our WTO \nobligations, demonstrate our continued commitment to the rules-based \ntrading system, and strengthen our position in future cases where we \nprove successful in challenging impermissible import restraints erected \nby our trading partners.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF ANTIDUMPING PROVISION OF REVENUE ACT OF \n                   1916.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--Section 801 of the Act entitled ``An Act to \n     increase the revenue, and for other purposes'', approved \n     September 8, 1916 (15 U.S.C. 72), is repealed.\n       (b) Effect of Repeal.--The repeal made by subsection (a) \n     shall not affect any action under section 801 of the Act \n     referred to in\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\n     subsection (a) that was commenced before the date of the \n     enactment of this Act and is pending on such date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1156. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve and \nenhance the provision of long-term health care for veterans by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, to enhance and improve authorities \nrelating to the administration of personnel of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain \nbriefly the provisions of the ``Department of Veterans Affairs Long-\nTerm Care and Personnel Authorities Enhancement Act of 2003,'' a bill \nthat I have introduced today.\n  Title I of the bill would extend through calendar year 2008 \nauthorities that now specify that the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nVA, will provide to veterans enrolled for VA medical care outpatient-\nbased long-term care services, such as Adult Day Health Care, Home \nHealth Aide assistance, Non-Institutional Respite Care, and Home-based \nPrimary Care. These services provide alternatives to institutional care \nand, in many cases, they obviate the need for institutional care by \nallowing veterans to remain in their own homes with care-giving \nassistance provided by VA.\n  In addition, this bill would lower, from 70 percent to 50 percent, \nthe threshold level of service-connected disability that would qualify \na veteran for highest-priority for institutional care should he or she \nneed it. VA currently provides highest-priority access to hospital and \noutpatient clinic-based care to veterans who have suffered a service-\nconnected disability rated by VA as 50 percent disabling or higher. \nHighest-priority access to inpatient-based long-term care services, \nhowever, is only granted by law to veterans who are 70 percent or more \ndisabled, unless such care is needed specifically to treat a less-\ndisabling service-connected disability. When this provision of law was \nenacted in 1999, Congress set the threshold for priority access to \nnursing home care at 70 percent, rather than at 50 percent, due \nprimarily to concerns that a lower threshold--which was actively \nconsidered--might cause VA to be faced with an unforeseen level of \ndemand that could not be met. Since then, however, VA has reported that \n``there was only a small increase in the numbers of veterans 70 percent \nservice-connected or greater who were estimated to need nursing home \ncare but who actually received that care from VA.'' In light of that, I \nsee no compelling reason to continue distinguishing between nursing \nhome care and all other types of care that are made available to 50 \npercent or higher service-connected veterans on a highest-priority \nbasis. This bill would provide, in effect, that hospital care, \noutpatient clinic-based care, and nursing home care will equally be \nmade available to all such enrolled veterans.\n  Title I of the bill would also make technical changes to VA authority \nto contract for nursing home and adult day health care services by \nallowing VA to enter into agreements with providers under standards \nsimilar to those allowed by Medicare. According to VA, these changes \nwill allow a greater number of smaller community-based providers to \ncontract with VA by reducing the regulatory burdens placed upon them as \na condition to contracting eligibility.\n  Title II of the bill authorizes major construction for long-term care \nfacilities in Beckley, WV and Lebanon, PA. Each of these states has a \nsubstantial elderly population and each is need of expansion to their \nVA long-term care programs.\n  Title III of the bill would change current law to allow VA to more \neasily hire and retain certain clinical staff members. Under current \nlaw, VA hires many clinical professionals, such as physicians and \nnurses, under streamlined authorities set forth in title 38 of U.S. \nCode. But other key clinical professionals, such as clinical social \nworkers, psychologists, and pharmacists, may only be hired through the \nstandard ``civil service'' authorities specified in Title 5, U.S. Code. \nFurther, members of such professions may only be paid and promoted in \naccordance with the standard civil service General Schedule, GS, pay \nscale. The process of hiring staff under these procedures is arduous \nand lengthy, consuming three months or more and placing VA at great \ncompetitive disadvantage in securing the services of best qualified \ncandidates. This bill would convert many of these positions into \n``hybrid Title 38'' status and permit VA greatly increased hiring and \npromotion flexibility, and compensation at special, locally-based, pay \nscales. Such clinicians, however, would retain their standard civil \nservice grievance, vacation, and discipline protections.\n  Title III of the bill also contains provisions to correct a long-\nstanding inequity relating to retirement benefits for certain part-time \nVA nurses; to expand a successful pilot program allowing for contract-\nphysician disability compensation medical examinations; and to afford \ncertain wage-grade canteen workers an opportunity to compete favorably \nfor VA employment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish within the Smithsonian Institution the \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, over 200 years ago, there was a dream \nthat was America for a group of individuals who were brought to our \nshores in shackles. A dream so powerful that compelled a race of people \nto fight for the liberty of others when they were in bondage \nthemselves. A dream that not only served as a catalyst for physical \nliberation in the African-American community but removed societal \nshackles from our culture and enabled us to realize the ideals set \nbefore us in the constitution--that all men are created equal under \nGod.\n  Today, we celebrate this magnificent history. A history of people's \nquest for freedom that shaped this Nation into a symbol of freedom and \ndemocracy around the world. I am proud to stand here today with my \ncolleagues and introduce once again to this body a bill that will \ncreate the National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n  I would specifically like to thank Senator Dodd, who is committed to \nhonoring this history and has worked hard to get us to this point \ntoday. I look forward to working with him on this bill.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Ted Stevens for his leadership and \ncommitment to this project as well. It means a great deal to have his \nsupport and I am grateful.\n  Senator Santorum has always been a supporter of this legislation and \nhas given unwavering enthusiasm to this project since the 107th \nCongress. I look forward to working with him as well to finally \ncomplete this museum.\n  And I am grateful to all of the original cosponsors of this bill--\nthis is fantastic.\n  Mr. President, the national Museum of African American History and \nCulture Presidential Commission--signed into law by President Bush, \nstated that the time is now. Indeed the time is now to honor this \nincredible history that has shaped this great Nation.\n  I thank the Presidential Commission for their hard work and effort in \nrecommending to Congress that we should build this museum and that \nthere is sufficient interest in the philanthropic community to \nfinancially support this museum and that there are sufficient artifacts \nto fill this museum.\n  So many Americans will be able to share in the celebration of this \nmuseum--a uniquely American museum one that we can celebrate. I \nremember when I met with the dean of the Afro-\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\nAmerican studies at Howard University.\n  He told me of a story about his grandfather who finished a bowl the \nday the Emancipation Proclamation was authorized.\n  His grandfather decided to keep the bowl because it no longer was the \nproperty of a slave master but the man who made it--his grandfather.\n  Mr. President, the dean has this bowl in his home--an incredible \npiece of history and I am sure there are many more pieces out there \nwaiting for a home--a national home.\n  Today, we are not just introducing a bill, we are completing a piece \nof American history by introducing the National Museum of African \nAmerican History and Culture, which will create a museum to honor \nAfrican-American contributions to this Nation--which is an \nextraordinary story of sacrifice and triumph.\n  This bill will create this museum within the Smithsonian \nInstitution--America's premier museum complex. We have worked very had \nwith the Smithsonian Institution to craft a bill that will compliment \ntheir programs--and indeed we have done just that.\n  This bill is very similar to the American Indian Museum, slated to \nopen next year. And I know that the Smithsonian Institution will create \nanother national treasure one that tells the story of African-Americans \nin this country--a proud history, a rich history.\n  This bill charges the board of regents of the Smithsonian Institution \nalong with the Council of the National Museum to plan, build and \nconstruct a museum dedicated to celebrating nationally African-American \nhistory--which is American history.\n\n  In addition, this bill charges the Board of Regents with choosing a \nsite on or adjacent to the national mall for the location of the \nmuseum.\n  Additionally, the bill establishes an education and program liaison \nsection designed to work with educational institutions and museums \nacross the country in order to promote African-American history.\n  Finally, the bill sets forth a Federal-private partnership for \nfunding the museum and authorizes $17 million for the first year in \norder to begin implementation of the museum council, which will be \ncomprised from a mixture of leading African-Americans from the museum, \nhistorical, and business communities.\n  Mr. President, it has been well over 70 years since the first \ncommission was formed to seek ways to honor nationally the \ncontributions of African-Americans.\n  It has always been my hope that this museum will not only showcase \nnationally the accomplishments of African-Americans--which are great--\nbut will also serve as a catalyst for racial reconciliation for our \nNation. Indeed we have triumphed over our difficulties in this area, \nbut we must continue to do more.\n  I do not pretend that this museum is a panacea for racial \nreconciliation. It is, however, a productive step in recognizing the \nimportant contributions and the debt all Americans owe to African-\nAmericans.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once expressed his desire for this \nNation, ``that the dark clouds of [misconceptions] will soon pass away \nand the deep fog of misunderstanding will be lifted from our fear-\ndrenched communities and in some not too distant tomorrow the radiant \nstars of love and brotherhood will shine over our great nation with all \ntheir scintillating beauty.'' We are one step closer today--God bless.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record after my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1156\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Museum of African \n     American History and Culture Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) since its founding, the United States has grown into a \n     symbol of democracy and freedom around the world, and the \n     legacy of African Americans is rooted in the very fabric of \n     the democracy and freedom of the United States;\n       (2) there exists no national museum within the Smithsonian \n     Institution located on the National Mall that--\n       (A) is devoted to the documentation of African American \n     life, art, history, and culture; and\n       (B) encompasses, on a national level--\n       (i) the period of slavery;\n       (ii) the era of reconstruction;\n       (iii) the Harlem renaissance;\n       (iv) the civil rights movement; and\n       (v) other periods associated with African American life, \n     art, history, and culture; and\n       (3) a National Museum of African American History and \n     Culture would be dedicated to the collection, preservation, \n     research, and exhibition of African American historical and \n     cultural material reflecting the breadth and depth of the \n     experiences of individuals of African descent living in the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague, Senator \nBrownback, in introducing legislation to create a National Museum of \nAfrican American History and Culture within the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  This legislation will help ensure that the compelling stories and \ninvaluable contributions of African-Americans to our national fabric \nwill no longer be ignored, but shared with all Americans, indeed, all \npeoples of the world.\n  Senator Brownback introduced similar legislation in the last \nCongress, and I was pleased to be an original cosponsor of that bill. \nDuring my tenure as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, I was \npleased to work with my colleagues to pass legislation to establish the \nPresidential Commission on the National Museum of African American \nHistory and Culture Action Plan.\n  That Presidential Commission spent a year traveling across the \nnation, and at more than 50 meetings, heard the voices of African-\nAmericans calling for a national place to tell their individual and \ncollective stories. This long overdue legislation will provide such a \nplace.\n  In their report issued last month, the Presidential Commission \nidentified a mission statement for the proposed museum that states, in \npart:\n\n       The museum will give voice to the centrality of the African \n     American experience and will make it possible for all people \n     to understand the depth, complexity, and promise of the \n     American experience.\n\n  It is that very goal of completing the American story of our quest \nfor freedom and truth by publicly incorporating the experience and \ncontributions of African Americans--that is the essence of this \nlegislation. This museum offers the promise and hope that all Americans \ncan come to understand the full story of how this nation was formed.\n  Since 1929, efforts have been made to recognize the contributions and \nunique history of Americans of African descent. This museum offers an \nhistoric opportunity to document, preserve, and educate this history \nfor generations to come. It is past time that we publicly acknowledge \nand incorporate the African American experience into our collective \nidentity and this museum will provide the appropriate means for \naccomplishing that goal.\n  In brief, within 18 months of enactment, the Smithsonian Board of \nRegents will choose a site for this museum from among four sites listed \nin the bill. The bill directs that, prior to the selection, the Board \nof Regents will consult with the National Capital Planning Commission, \nthe chairman of the Presidential Commission, Congressional oversight \ncommittees, and others.\n  In the meantime, the Smithsonian Board of Regents will appoint a 19 \nmember council, comprised of leaders within the African-American \ncommunity and others, to advise the regents on the development, design \nand construction of the museum. The museum will include exhibits and \nprograms relating to all aspects of African American life, art, \nhistory, and culture from the time of slavery through present day.\n  The museum will also provide leadership to other museums and will \ncollaborate with historically black colleges and universities and \neducational organizations to ensure the integrity of the exhibits and \nprogramming and to broaden the reach of its story and mission.\n  I am honored to be the lead Democratic sponsor of this legislation, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Rules Committee \nto seeing this bill enacted this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. \n        Lincoln):\n  S. 1159. A bill to provide for programs and activities to improve the \nhealth of Hispanic individuals, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill with \nSenators Daschle, Boxer, and Lincoln that will be jointly introduced by \nRepresentatives Ciro Rodriguez, Hilda Solis, and others in the House of \nRepresentatives entitled the ``Hispanic Health Improvement Act of \n2003.'' This bill addresses the tremendous health disparities that \nconfront the Hispanic community in our Nation.\n  Even if you know the statistics, they remain shocking. Over one-\nthird, a 35 percent of Hispanic adults lack health insurance. Despite \nthat passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program, 27 percent of \nLatino children remain uninsured, which is sharp comparison to 9 \npercent of white, 18 percent of black and 17 percent of Asian/Pacific \nIslander children.\n  In testimony before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee on September 23, 2002, on Hispanic health issues, Dr. Glenn \nFlores, chair of the Latin Consortium of the American Academy of \nPediatrics Center for Child Health Research, added: ``Among uninsured \npoor children in the U.S., Latinos outnumber all other racial/ethnic \ngroups, including whites: there are 1 million poor, uninsured Latino \nchildren, compared with 766,000 white, and 533,000 African-American \npoor, uninsured children. Although 1999 marked the first time in many \nyears that the proportion of uninsured Latino children actually \ndecreased (from 30 percent to 27 percent), recent national data suggest \nthat outreach efforts to enroll Latino children have largely been \nunsuccessful. A Kaiser Commission report found that only 26 percent of \nparents of eligible uninsured children said that they had ever talked \nto someone or received information about Medicaid enrollment, and 46 \npercent of Spanish-speaking parents were unsuccessful at enrolling \ntheir uninsured children in Medicaid because materials were unavailable \nin Spanish.''\n  In order to address the lack of health care coverage, the legislation \nwould expand CHIP to cover pregnant women and parents of children \nenrolled in CHIP. The legislation provides $50 million in grants to \ncommunity-based groups to improve outreach and enrollment of children \nin Medicaid and CHIP with the grants targeted to Hispanic communities.\n  In addition, the bill eliminates a number of enrollment barriers \nwithin Medicaid.\n  And finally, it provides States the option to enroll legal immigrant \npregnant women and children in Medicaid or CHIP. This comes from \nlegislation introduced by Senator Graham earlier in this Congress.\n  In addition to poor coverage rates, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, or CDC, the Hispanic population has \nmorbidity and mortality rates that more often than not exceed that of \nany other ethnic groups. For example, age-adjusted mortality rates for \ndiabetes are over 50 percent higher among Hispanic persons than non-\nHispanic whites. HIV infection rates are over 3 times those of non-\nHispanic whites. Tuberculosis rates among Latino children are 13 times \nthat of whites.\n  The legislation addresses these problems in a number of ways. In the \narea\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\nof access and affordability, our bill requires an annual report to \nCongress on how federal programs are responding to improve the health \nstatus of Hispanic individuals with respect to diabetes, cancer, \nasthma, HIV infection, AIDS, substance abuse, and mental health. The \nbill provides $100 million for targeted diabetes prevention, education, \nschool-based programs, and screening activities in the Hispanic \ncommunity.\n  In addition, the legislation specifically addresses the problems \nfacing communities along the U.S.-Mexico border, a 2,000-mile stretch \nof land that contains 11 million people, 5 of the 7 poorest \nmetropolitan statistical areas in the country, and disease rates in \nsome areas that are extraordinary. If the region were a state, the \nborder would rank 1st in the number of uninsured, last in terms of per \ncapita income, and 1st in a number of diseases.\n  As Dr. Francisco Cigarroa, president of the University of Texas \nHealth Sciences Center at San Antonio, noted in testimony at the \nhearing last year on Hispanic health, ``Germs respect no INS \nregulations. We truly must work with our neighbors to the South if we \nare to avoid a major influx of new conditions and diseases. It can be \nseen so clearly on a map. Just as there are `rivers of commerce' there \nare `rivers of infectious disease' and though they may start at the \nBorder, they are eventually seen all the way to the northern Border \nthat we share with Canada.''\n  In response, the bill provides $200 million to border communities to \nimprove health services and infrastructure along the U.S.-Mexico \nborder.\n  The numbers I have cited thus far indicate what we do know. Almost as \nmuch of a concern is what we do not know with respect to the status of \nHispanic health in this Nation. According to one study, only 22 percent \nof all articles published in major medical journals included non-\nEnglish-speaking patients.\n  The bill provides funding to do additional research and work on \nreducing health disparities in this Nation. The various provisions \ninclude efforts to improve the recruitment and retention of Hispanic \nhealth professionals and programs that support training health \nprofessionals who can provide culturally competent and linguistically \nappropriate care. With respect to training more minority health \nprofessionals, Dr. Cigarroa said at last year's hearing, ``We should do \nthis because it is the smart thing to do. If we fail to take steps to \naddress the gap between the health of the majority population and the \nhealth of the Nation's rapidly growing minority populations, we are on \na court leading to a collision.

and\n       Whereas the 5-year moratorium on the approval of new \n     agricultural biotechnology products entering the European \n     market is not science based, effectively prohibits most \n     United States corn exports to Europe, violates European Union \n     law, and clearly breaches the rules of the World Trade \n     Organization: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports and applauds the efforts \n     of the Administration on behalf of the Nation's farmers \n     challenging the long-standing, unwarranted moratorium imposed \n     by the European Union on the approval of agricultural \n     biotechnology products and encourages the President to \n     continue to press this issue at the G-8 Summit in Evian, \n     France, on June 1 through 3, 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7159-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7159-S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 155--PROTECTING SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFICIARIES FROM \n                               COLA CUTS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Allen, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, \nMr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Carper, Mr. \nChafee, Mr. Chambliss, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Coleman, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Craig, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nDayton, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Dole, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \nDurbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Frist, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Graham \nof South Carolina, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nHatch, Mr. Hollings, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Kyl, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. \nLincoln, Mr. Lott, Mr. Lugar, Mr. McCain, Mr. McConnell, Ms. Mikulski, \nMr. Miller, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nNelson of Nebraska, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Pryor, Mr. Reed, Mr. Reid, Mr. \nRoberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nSessions, Mr.\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\nShelby, Mr. Smith, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Sununu, \nMr. Talent, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) \nsubmitted the following resolution;

Con. Res. 47\n\n       Whereas, at the beginning of World War II, residents of \n     North Platte, Nebraska, received information that members of \n     the Nebraska National Guard from the North Platte area would \n     be traveling through the community of North Platte on a troop \n     train en route to the west coast;\n       Whereas residents of the North Platte community met the \n     troop train with food and other gifts for the troops when the \n     train arrived at the Union Pacific train station on December \n     17, 1941;\n       Whereas, although the troop train carried young men from \n     Kansas instead of members of the Nebraska National Guard, the \n     residents of North Platte presented the young men from Kansas \n     with the food and other items that were donated;\n       Whereas Rae Wilson, of North Platte, proposed to her \n     community the idea of establishing the North Platte Canteen \n     so that residents could greet every troop train that traveled \n     through North Platte and provide the military troops en route \n     to serving their country in World War II with comforts from \n     home;\n       Whereas, on December 25, 1941, the North Platte Canteen \n     began serving food and other items to the United States \n     military troops traveling across the United States to either \n     the east or west coast before being shipped overseas;\n       Whereas, during World War II, the North Platte Canteen \n     greeted and served food to approximately 6,000,000 men and \n     women from every State in the Union;\n       Whereas individuals from 125 communities in Nebraska, \n     Colorado, and Kansas donated food and volunteered at the \n     North Platte Canteen during the approximately 5-year period \n     in which it operated;\n       Whereas the North Platte Canteen operated strictly with \n     volunteers from local communities, organizations, churches, \n     schools, and other groups, and without any Federal \n     assistance;\n       Whereas the North Platte Canteen received $137,000 in cash \n     contributions from benefit dances, scrap-metal drives, school \n     victory clubs, donation cans in local businesses, and \n     relatives of servicemembers who traveled through the Canteen \n     to help maintain the Canteen's operations for about 5 years;\n       Whereas the North Platte Canteen served each month about \n     40,000 homemade cookies, 30,000 hard-boiled eggs, 6,500 \n     doughnuts, 4,000 loaves of bread, 3,000 pounds of meat, 450 \n     pounds of cheese, 60 quarts of peanut butter, 1,350 pounds of \n     coffee, 1,200 quarts of cream, 750 dozen rolls, and 600 \n     birthday cakes; and\n       Whereas the North Platte Canteen was honored by the United \n     States Army with the presentation of the Meritorious Wartime \n     Service Award by the Secretary of War: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the outstanding efforts of the individuals \n     and communities involved with the North Platte Canteen to \n     dispense food and good cheer to the approximately 6,000,000 \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who traveled on \n     troop trains through North Platte, Nebraska, from December \n     25, 1941, through April 1, 1946, during World War II; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     recognizing the heroic efforts of those patriotic Americans \n     who made enormous sacrifices to make the North Platte Canteen \n     a successful expression of the warmth and caring of home for \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines of our Nation making \n     their way to war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7160-4", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 832.

Without Social Security, \n     forty eight percent of beneficiaries would be in poverty \n     today.\n       (2) In order to protect benefit levels against inflation, \n     Social Security beneficiaries receive an annual cost-of-\n     living adjustment (COLA) based on Consumer Price Index for \n     Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).\n       (3) The January 2003 COLA provided only a 1.4 percent \n     increase in Social Security benefits, increasing the average \n     monthly benefit for all retired workers by only $13 (from \n     $882 to 895).\n       (4) Annual growth in Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket \n     health care costs for retired individuals on fixed incomes \n     far exceeded the small COLA increases provided to Social \n     Security beneficiaries.\n       (5) Reducing COLAs will disproportionately harm low-income \n     Social Security beneficiaries and push millions of seniors \n     into poverty.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Social Security cost-of-living adjustments should not be \n     reduced.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 835.

FOREIGN DEBT CEILING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has become the world's largest net \n     debtor Nation, having run up massive trade deficits in the \n     1990s.\n       (2) At the end of 2001, the net United States foreign debt \n     stood at over $2,300,000,000,000.\n       (3) The United States foreign debt position worsened in \n     2002, when the United States had a record trade deficit of \n     over $436,000,000,000, equivalent to 4.1 percent of the \n     United States GDP that year.\n       (4) The large and growing United States foreign debt \n     represents claims on United States assets by foreign \n     nationals, which will eventually have to be repaid. If \n     unchecked, the foreign debt could seriously undermine our \n     children's future standard of living.\n       (5) Moreover, the growing accumulation of foreign claims on \n     United States assets, including nearly $1,200,000,000,000 in \n     United States Treasury securities, makes the United States \n     economy vulnerable to the whims of foreign investors.\n       (6) Congress presently places a ceiling on United States \n     public debt, but does not place a ceiling on United States \n     foreign debt.\n       (7) Just as Congress recognized the importance of placing a \n     ceiling on the United States public debt, it is appropriate \n     that Congress place a limit on the United States foreign \n     debt.\n       (b) Actions Triggered by United States Foreign Debt.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than the 15th day of the second \n     month after the date of enactment of this Act, and every 3 \n     months thereafter, the United States Trade Representative \n     shall determine if--\n       (A) the net United States foreign debt for the preceding \n     12-month period is more than 25 percent of United States GDP \n     for the same period; or\n       (B) the United States trade deficit for the preceding 12-\n     month period is more than 5 percent of United States GDP for \n     the same period.\n       (2) Action by ustr.--Whenever an affirmative determination \n     is made under paragraph (1) (A) or (B), the United States \n     Trade Representative shall--\n       (A) within 15 days of the determination, convene an \n     emergency meeting of the Trade Policy Review Group to develop \n     a plan of action to reduce the United States trade deficit; \n     and\n       (B) within 45 days of the determination, present to \n     Congress a report detailing the Trade Policy Review Group's \n     trade deficit reduction plan.\n       (c) Measurement of Foreign Debt.--\n       (1) Statistical sources.--For purposes of the calculations \n     described in subsection (b)(1), the United States Trade \n     Representative shall rely on the most recent period for which \n     the following data, published by the Department of Commerce, \n     is available:\n       (A) In the case of United States foreign debt, the United \n     States Trade Representative shall use the net international \n     investment position of the United States, with direct \n     investment positions determined at market value, as compiled \n     by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n       (B) In the case of the United States trade deficit, the \n     United States Trade Representative shall use the goods and \n     services trade deficit data compiled by the United States \n     Census Bureau.\n       (C) In the case of the United States GDP, the United States \n     Trade Representative shall use the nominal gross domestic \n     product data compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n       (2) Adjustment.--The United States Trade Representative may \n     adjust the data described in paragraph (1) to ensure that the \n     determination is made for comparable time periods.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 838.

Mr. President, as we go into the Memorial Day recess, \nI thought it might be appropriate to take a few moments and look back \nat the accomplishments of the Congress in which we currently find \nourselves. We know that last year the Senate did not pass 11 of the 13 \nappropriation bills, and never passed a budget. It was, in fact, the \nfirst time the budget did not pass since the Budget Act passed back in \n1974.\n  We have now completed 5 months of the 108th Congress, a Senate \nnarrowly controlled, 51-49, by the Republican Party--certainly not a \nhuge margin from which to function. But, nevertheless, it has been an \nextraordinarily productive 5 months.\n  Just to run down the list: Extension of unemployment benefits to \nthose who need them, not once but twice, the second time being today. \nWe did, back in January, pass 11 appropriation bills that were never \npassed for the previous year--in fact, the year in which we are \ncurrently operating. We funded Operation Iraqi Freedom, which allowed \nour military to have the resources to win, as the President put it, the \nbattle for Iraq, the battle in the larger war on terrorism. We \npreserved our military strength by passing a Department of Defense \nauthorization bill just this week in the Senate. We initiated the \nprotection of our homeland by confirming the nomination of the first \nSecretary of the new Department of Homeland Security.\n  As I made reference a few moments ago, we passed a budget which \ndistinguishes this Senate from the previous one. We have enacted the \nPresident's plan to create jobs and stimulate the economy. We just \npassed that today and it is on the way to the President for signature. \nI think the Washington Post depicted it as the third largest tax relief \npackage in history. If that is accurate, that sounds perfectly good to \nme.\n  We have also, in the first 5 months this year, banned the horrific \npractice of partial-birth abortion. It passed the Senate by a very \nlarge margin.\n  We passed the President's faith-based initiative. We funded the \neffort to eradicate the scourge of global AIDS, which gives the \nPresident the opportunity to go to the G-8 meeting next week and \nchallenge our European allies to do likewise so that we all work \ncollectively to deal with this plague which has affected all of the \nworld, but in particular the continent of Africa.\n  To guard our children against abduction and exploitation, we passed \nthe PROTECT Act in the first 5 months of this year. We have improved \nsafeguards from foreign terrorists by enacting the FISA bill. We \nengaged in our second historic NATO expansion to include the remaining \nmembers of the Warsaw Pact which were not in the first tranche that \ncame in--Poland, Hungry, and the Czech Republic, six more countries on \ntop of the original three to further expand NATO to complete virtually \nthe entire area that used to make up the Warsaw Pact.\n  We passed the significant arms reduction treaty with our former enemy \nturned ally, the Russians.\n  We are bridging the digital divide by providing needed funds to \nhistorically black colleges.\n  We affirmed the constitutionality of the use of the term ``under \nGod'' in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  We awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to Prime Minister Tony Blair, \nwho richly deserved it.\n  And we provided tax equity to the men and women in our Nation's Armed \nForces.\n  This has been an extraordinarily productive first five months of the \n108th Congress.\n  Particularly to be commended is our leader Bill Frist, who stepped \ninto a new job at the beginning of this Congress, and has done an \nextraordinary job of holding us together and advancing the ball. Those \nare the two principal responsibilities of the majority leader--holding \ntogether at least his own side, if he can, and advancing the ball.\n  We have been able to reach out to the other side and have critical \nDemocratic support when that was necessary in order to achieve success.\n  So as we go into the Memorial Day recess, I think we can all feel \nproud that we have accomplished a great deal for our constituents and \nmade this a better country in many clearly discernible ways.\n  Having recounted those accomplishments of the 108th Congress, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a few moments we will be completing our \nwork for today--indeed for the week--after what has been a productive \nprocess in completing a lot of legislation today with a number of \nvotes, but following really about 2 or 3 months of very consistent, \nsteady progress, as was just outlined by the assistant majority leader \na few moments ago.\n\n  It caused me, as I listened to my distinguished colleague from \nKentucky, to think back to 5 months ago, when we began the 108th \nCongress, and what we were thinking then as we projected forward what \nwe hoped to accomplish.\n  I recall at that time, on the floor, committing this body, working \ntogether in a bipartisan way, to achieve results for the American \npeople--the type of results that would push America forward, focusing \non action, on getting things done. We said that this Congress would be \na Congress defined by action, defined by accomplishment, and I believe \nthat indeed we have kept that pledge.\n  Whether working to create jobs, increasing our Nation's economic \ngrowth, fighting global terror, protecting our homeland and making our \nhomeland more secure, or helping to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS, this \nCongress has been quietly, steadily, and consistently getting the job \ndone for the American people.\n  As my colleagues leave today to return to their homes across the \ncountry and spend this Memorial Day holiday with their friends and \nfamilies, I do want to take this opportunity, in these final moments, \nto thank them for their patience and their hard work. They have been \nextremely productive. They have been prolific.\n  First and foremost, we have enacted measures to stoke America's great \neconomic engine and to create new jobs for our workers. The 11 \nappropriations bills left over from last year we passed in 1 omnibus \nappropriations bill, finishing the work left unfinished from the last \nCongress.\n  We passed the budget for the upcoming fiscal year. And we passed that \nbudget in near record time. Indeed, it was only the fourth time in the \nhistory of our budgeting process that we actually met the statutory \ndeadline.\n  Also, today we approved President Bush's jobs and growth plan, a plan \nwhich will put more money in the pockets of everybody listening right \nnow, and more money in the pockets of all American families, thereby \ncreating thousands and thousands of new jobs.\n  It is progress. It shows action. It shows we are delivering to the \nAmerican people. The package we passed just a few hours ago includes \nthe third-largest tax cut in our Nation's history. I believe it will \nhelp turbocharge the economy because 60 percent of the $350 billion \nstimulus package will hit home this year and next year, in this \ntimeframe, over the next 18 months.\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\n  Working with President Bush, we have strived to make our homeland \nmore secure and fight the global war against terror. In addition to the \nfunds approved in the budget, the $80 billion supplemental \nappropriations bill, passed in April, not only helped pay for the cost \nof the Iraq campaign, but it provided funds to protect our own borders \nas well.\n  In what may someday, I believe, be considered our most far-reaching \ninitiative, Congress has approved--and the President, next Tuesday, \nwill sign--a 5-year, $15 billion commitment to combat the global spread \nof that deadly HIV/AIDS virus--a virus we knew nothing about 25 years \nago, a virus that represents, in the pandemic that has ensued, the \ngreatest public health challenge of our time, killing more than 23 \nmillion people, infecting more than 40 million people alive today, \nultimately killing, in all likelihood--even if we discovered a vaccine \ntoday--another 60 million people over the next 20 to 30 years.\n\n  But now, because of the action of this body, following the leadership \nof the President of the United States, working hand in hand with the \nHouse of Representatives, America is now--and proudly so--the global \nleader in HIV/AIDS funding and has brought the lamp of hope to millions \nof people threatened by this devastating disease.\n  I have been privileged, as a physician, to be able to perform medical \nmission work in various places around the world, but specifically in \nAfrica, and I can tell you how desperately--how desperately--needed is \nthis leadership, is this funding. This legislation is a manifestation \nof the caring spirit--that spirit of compassion--that spirit of caring \nand compassion on behalf of the United States of America. It shows our \ncommitment to the less fortunate in the world and that we are, indeed, \na nation of moral courage.\n  In foreign policy, we supported the Moscow Treaty, which calls for \nthe most dramatic reduction of nuclear weapons between Russia and \nAmerica in history. Under the terms of this treaty, the number of \nnuclear weapons will be lower than at any point since 1954.\n  Also in foreign policy, we supported the expansion of NATO, bringing \nseven new democracies into the alliance: Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n  At home, we have not only acted to spur the economy to create jobs \nbut we have looked after those who do not have a job but who are \nlooking for a job. Today, again, just a few hours ago, we once again \nextended the unemployment insurance to ensure that families will have \nthe economic support they need while they continue to look for a job.\n  On issues here at home, we voted to end that abhorrent practice of \npartial-birth abortion. We approved the CARE Act to encourage \ncharitable giving to charitable and nonprofit organizations. These are \njust a few of the many accomplishments of this Congress. I could go on: \nAMBER Alert, air cargo security, a national ``Do Not Call'' list to \nstymie unwanted phone solicitors, military tax relief--and the list \ncontinues.\n  I mention all this because as we focus on our day-to-day activities, \nit is rare that we look at that large picture from 30,000 feet as to \nwhat we have accomplished. And, indeed, we have done much. It has been \na productive 5 months. It has not always been a smooth road, but in a \nclosely divided Senate few paths are easy. It takes working in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Before I close, I do want to say, as part of a new leadership team on \nthe Republican side of the aisle, it has been extremely important for \nme to have developed a positive working relationship with the other \nside of the aisle, both in terms of leadership and really throughout \nthe Senate. I do want to thank the corresponding leaders on the other \nside of the aisle for working with me in a bipartisan way as we have \nset out this agenda and as, indeed, we have completed the agenda that \nhas been set out.\n  I do hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle enjoy the break \nand come back from their time refreshed because we have a lot of work \nto do. On the top of that list will be to bring our Medicare Program up \nto date so we can include prescription drugs as part of the \narmamentarium for health care delivery and health care security for our \nseniors. That is going to require bipartisan cooperation if we are \ntruly to accomplish what I know we will accomplish, what we can \naccomplish, and what our seniors deserve; that is, a strengthening and \nimprovement of our Medicare Program.\n\n  We will do that the month we come back. It will be hard work, but in \nthe end I know we can approve a plan to improve the current system, to \nstrengthen it, to guarantee all seniors access to prescription drugs in \na plan that can best meet their health care needs.\n  I do want to thank my own Republican leadership team. We heard a few \nmoments ago from my colleague, the assistant majority leader, our whip, \nSenator McConnell. Our working relationship has been such that it \nexcites me, as we look to the future, again, having worked hand in hand \nto address these many issues in the past.\n  As our colleagues go home, I know they will all be paying tribute to \nthe men and women who have returned to their own communities after \nrepresenting the best that we have in the United States of America, as \nthey have fought for freedom and democracy--those freedoms that we are \nable to enjoy each and every day.\n  We have done much, but we have much to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7164-1", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7164-S7165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 136\n\n       Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers was founded \n     on May 8, 1863, as a secret, fraternal labor organization and \n     its first meetings were held clandestinely for fear of \n     reprisals from railroad management;\n       Whereas the climate toward labor organizations at that time \n     was extraordinarily hostile, and many of the other newly \n     founded labor organizations failed to withstand the negative \n     pressures placed upon them and disbanded in their infancies;\n       Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers began to \n     thrive despite the climate into which it was born;\n       Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers has grown \n     from its original 13 members, all from the Michigan Central \n     Railroad, to 59,000 active and retired members employed \n     throughout the United States and Canada;\n       Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers is North \n     America's oldest rail labor union;\n       Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers' members \n     have contributed, both directly through their railroad \n     activity and in private capacities, to the war effort in all \n     of the battles of the United States dating back to the Civil \n     War;\n       Whereas their efforts to improve rail safety for both their \n     members and the public have resulted in a dramatic decrease \n     in the number of railroad accidents in the years since their \n     inception;\n       Whereas, in 1964, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers \n     launched an apprentice engineer program to assure the Nation \n     of a stable supply of well-trained locomotive engineers, and \n     to assure stable employment and earnings to apprentices;\n       Whereas, after accepting only promoted locomotive engineers \n     in its early years, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers \n     enlarged its membership goals to include other rail \n     employees;\n       Whereas, in 1993, the 2,500 member American Train \n     Dispatchers Association officially affiliated with the \n     Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers in order to unite the two \n     key railway professions that facilitate the efficient and \n     safe movement of passengers and freight;\n       Whereas, in 1995, the Rail Canada Traffic Controllers union \n     also chose to merge into the Brotherhood of Locomotive \n     Engineers, adding another 700 members;\n       Whereas, in addition to providing representation for its \n     members, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers aggressively \n     participates in the labor movement with other unions and \n     organizations in promoting the interests of working men and \n     women and their families;\n       Whereas the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers is an \n     extraordinary union whose leadership still works hard every \n     day--just as it did in 1863--to protect members' health and \n     safety, to guard their financial interests, to give them an \n     effective voice on the job, and to ensure dignity, respect, \n     and security for railway workers in the workplace; and\n       Whereas the efforts of the Brotherhood of Locomotive \n     Engineers are deserving of our attention and admiration: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the union which has made a tremendous \n     contribution to the structural development and building of \n     the United States, and to the well-being of tens of thousands \n     of workers;\n       (2) congratulates the union for its many achievements and \n     the strength of its members; and\n       (3) expects that the union will continue its dedicated work \n     and will have an even greater impact in the 21st century and \n     beyond, and will enhance the standard of living and working \n     environment for rail workers and other laborers in \n     generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7171-3", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7171-S7172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           AUTHORIZING REPRESENTATION OF SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 43\n\n       Whereas the United States promotes and encourages the \n     creation and revitalization of sustainable and strong \n     neighborhoods in partnership with States, cities, and local \n     communities;\n       Whereas the United States promotes and encourages the \n     creation and revitalization of sustainable and strong \n     neighborhoods in partnership with States, cities, and local \n     communities and in conjunction with the independent and \n     collective actions of private citizens and organizations;\n       Whereas establishing a housing infrastructure strengthens \n     neighborhoods and local economies and nurtures the families \n     who reside in them;\n       Whereas an integral element of a strong community is a \n     sufficient supply of affordable housing;\n       Whereas affordable housing may be provided in traditional \n     and nontraditional forms, including apartment buildings, \n     transitional and temporary homes, condominiums, cooperatives, \n     and single family homes;\n       Whereas for many families a home is not merely shelter, but \n     also provides an opportunity for growth, prosperity, and \n     security;\n       Whereas homeownership is a cornerstone of the national \n     economy because it spurs the production and sale of goods and \n     services, generates new jobs, encourages savings and \n     investment, promotes economic and civic responsibility, and \n     enhances the financial security of all people in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas although the United States is the first nation in \n     the world to make owning a home a reality for a vast majority \n     of its families, \\1/3\\ of the families in the United States \n     are not homeowners;\n       Whereas a disproportionate percentage of families in the \n     United States that are not homeowners are low-income \n     families;\n       Whereas 74.2 percent of Caucasian Americans own their own \n     homes, only 47.1 percent of African Americans, 47.2 percent \n     of Hispanic Americans, and 55.8 percent of Asian Americans \n     and other races are homeowners;\n       Whereas the community building activities of neighborhood-\n     based nonprofit organizations empower individuals to improve \n     their lives and make communities safer and healthier for \n     families;\n       Whereas one of the best known nonprofit housing \n     organizations is Habitat for Humanity, which builds simple \n     but adequate housing for less fortunate families and \n     symbolizes the self-help approach to homeownership;\n       Whereas Habitat for Humanity is organized in all 50 States \n     with 1,655 local affiliates and its own section 501(c)(3) \n     Federal tax-exempt status and locally elected completely \n     voluntary board of directors;\n       Whereas Habitat for Humanity has built nearly 150,000 \n     houses worldwide and endeavors to complete another 50,000 \n     homes by the year 2005;\n       Whereas Habitat for Humanity provides opportunities for \n     people from every segment of society to volunteer to help \n     make the American dream a reality for families who otherwise \n     would not own a home; and\n       Whereas the month of June has been designated as ``National \n     Homeownership Month'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) everyone in the United States should have a decent home \n     in which to live;\n       (2) Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     should demonstrate the importance of volunteerism;\n       (3) during the years of the 108th and 109th sessions of \n     Congress, Members of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, Habitat for Humanity, and contributing \n     organizations, should sponsor and construct 2 homes in the \n     Washington, D.C., metro area each as part of the ``Congress \n     Building America'' program;\n       (4) each Congress Building America house should be \n     constructed primarily by Members of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives, their families and staffs, and the staffs \n     of sponsoring organizations working with local volunteers \n     involving and symbolizing the partnership of the public, \n     private, and nonprofit sectors of society;\n       (5) each Congress Building America house should be \n     constructed with the participation of the family that will \n     own the home;\n       (6) in the future, Members of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives, their families, and their staff should \n     participate in similar house building activities in their own \n     States as part of National Homeownership Month; and\n       (7) these occasions should be used to emphasize and focus \n     on the importance of providing decent homes for all of the \n     people in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/05/23/senate-section/article/S7172-2", "month": "05", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7172-S7173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nENDING UNWARRANTED EUROPEAN UNION MORATORIUM AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY \n                                PRODUCTS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
