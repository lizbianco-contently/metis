Mr. President, today the Senate returns to regular \nbusiness. Last week the Nation and the world bid a final farewell to \nPresident Ronald Wilson Reagan. The services and ceremony were fitting \ntributes to our 40th President. I remind my colleagues that we will be \nprinting a memorial book that will include all of the floor tributes \nand services related to the passing of our former President. For those \nMembers who were unable to speak on the floor, we will allow Senators \nto submit statements on Ronald Reagan until June 25 in order to have \nthose tributes printed in the memorial book.\n\n\n           Rotunda Tributes to Former President Ronald Reagan\n\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the tributes during the \nRotunda services by our distinguished President pro tempore, currently \nin the Chair, Speaker of the House, and our Vice President be printed \nin today's Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Speaker's Remarks at the State Funeral of the Late President Ronald \n                             Wilson Reagan\n\n       (Washington DC).--The Speaker of the House, J. Dennis \n     Hastert (R-IL) made the following remarks at the State \n     Funeral of the late President Ronald Wilson Reagan tonight in \n     the Capitol Rotunda:\n       Mrs. Reagan, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, \n     Distinguished Guests: Ronald Reagan's long journey has \n     finally drawn to a close.\n       It is altogether fitting and proper that he has returned to \n     this Capitol Rotunda, like another great son of Illinois, \n     Abraham Lincoln, so the nation can say, good-bye. This \n     Capitol Building is, for many, the greatest symbol of \n     democracy and freedom in the world. It brings to mind the \n     ``shining city on a hill'' of which President Reagan so often \n     spoke. It is the right place to honor a man who so faithfully \n     defended our freedom, and so successfully helped extend the \n     blessings of liberty to millions around the world.\n       Mrs. Reagan, thank you for sharing your husband with us--\n     for your steadfast love and for your great faith. We pray for \n     you and for your family in this time of great mourning.\n       But as we mourn, we must also celebrate the life and the \n     vision of one of America's greatest Presidents. His story and \n     values are quintessentially American. Born in Tampico, IL, \n     and then raised in Dixon, IL, he moved west to follow his \n     dreams. He brought with him a Midwestern optimism, and he \n     blended it with a western ``can do'' spirit.\n       In 1980, the year of the ``Reagan Revolution,'' his vision \n     of hope, growth, and opportunity was exactly what the \n     American people needed and wanted. His message touched a \n     fundamental chord that is deeply embedded in the American \n     experience.\n       President Reagan dared to dream that America had a special \n     mission. He believed in the essential goodness of the \n     American people and that we had a special duty to promote \n     peace and freedom for the rest of the world.\n       Against the advice of the timid, he sent a chilling message \n     to authoritarian governments everywhere, that the civilized \n     world would not rest--until freedom reigned--in every corner \n     of the globe.\n       While others worried, President Reagan persevered. When \n     others weakened, President Reagan stood tall. When others \n     stepped back, President Reagan stepped forward. And he did it \n     all with great humility, with great charm, and with great \n     humor.\n       Tonight, we will open these doors and let the men and women \n     who Ronald Reagan served so faithfully, file past and say \n     good-bye to a man who meant so much to so many. It is their \n     being here that I think would mean more to him than any words \n     we say, because it was from America's great and good people \n     that Ronald Reagan drew his strength.\n       We will tell our grandchildren about this night when we \n     gathered to honor the man from Illinois who became the son of \n     California and then the son of all America. And our \n     grandchildren will tell their grandchildren--and President \n     Reagan's spirit and eternal faith in America will carry on.\n       Ronald Reagan helped make our country and this world a \n     better place to live. But he always believed that our best \n     days were ahead of us, not behind us. I can still hear him \n     say, with that twinkle in his eye, ``You ain't seen nothing \n     yet!''\n       President Reagan once said, ``We make a living by what we \n     get; we make a life by what we give.'' Twenty years ago, \n     President Reagan stood on the beaches of Normandy, to honor \n     those who made a life, by what they gave. Recalling the men \n     who scaled the cliffs and crossed the beaches in a merciless \n     hail of bullets, he asked, who were these men--these\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\n     ordinary men doing extraordinary things? His answer was \n     simple and direct: They were Americans.\n       So I can think of no higher tribute or honor or title to \n     confer upon Ronald Reagan than to simply say: He was an \n     American. Godspeed, Mr. President, God bless you, and God \n     bless the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Remarks by the Vice President at the State Funeral of Ronald W. Reagan\n\n       Mrs. Reagan, members of the President's family, colleagues, \n     distinguished guests, members of the diplomatic corps, fellow \n     citizens: Knowing that this moment would come has not made it \n     any easier to see the honor guard, and the flag draped before \n     us, and to begin America's farewell to President Ronald \n     Reagan. He said goodbye to us in a letter that showed his \n     great courage and love for America. Yet for his friends and \n     for his country, the parting comes only now. And in this \n     national vigil of mourning, we show how much America loved \n     this good man, and how greatly we will miss him.\n       A harsh winter morning in 1985 brought the inaugural \n     ceremony inside to this Rotunda. And standing in this place \n     for the 50th presidential inauguration, Ronald Reagan spoke \n     of a Nation that was ``hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic, \n     daring, decent, and fair.'' That was how he saw America, and \n     that is how America came to know him. There was a kindness, \n     simplicity, and goodness of character that marked all the \n     years of his life.\n       When you mourn a man of 93, no one is left who remembers \n     him as a child in his mother's arms. Ronald Wilson Reagan's \n     life began in a time and place so different from our own, in \n     a quiet town on the prairie, on the 6th of February, 1911. \n     Nelle and Jack Reagan would live long enough to see the kind \n     of man they had raised, but they could never know all that \n     destiny had in store for the boy they called Dutch. And if \n     they could witness this scene in 2004, their son taken to his \n     rest with the full honors of the United States, they would be \n     so proud of all he had done with the life they gave him, and \n     the things they taught him.\n       President Reagan once said, ``I learned from my father the \n     value of hard work and ambition, and maybe a little something \n     about telling a story.'' That was the Ronald Reagan who \n     confidently set out on his own from Dixon, IL during the \n     Great Depression, the man who would one day speak before \n     cameras and crowds with such ease and self-command. ``From my \n     mother,'' said President Reagan, ``I learned the value of \n     prayer. My mother told me that everything in life happened \n     for a purpose. She said all things were part of God's plan, \n     even the most disheartening setbacks, and in the end, \n     everything worked out for the best.'' This was the Ronald \n     Reagan who had faith, not just in his own gifts and his own \n     future, but in the possibilities of every life. The cheerful \n     spirit that carried him forward was more than a disposition; \n     it was the optimism of a faithful soul, who trusted in God's \n     purposes, and knew those purposes to be right and true.\n       He once said, ``There's no question I am an idealist, which \n     is another way of saying I am an American.'' We usually \n     associate that quality with youth, and yet one of the most \n     idealistic men ever to become president was also the oldest. \n     He excelled in professions that have left many others jaded \n     and self-satisfied, and yet somehow remained untouched by the \n     worst influences of fame or power. If Ronald Reagan ever \n     uttered a cynical, or cruel, or selfish word, the moment went \n     unrecorded. Those who knew him in his youth, and those who \n     knew him a lifetime later, all remember his largeness of \n     spirit, his gentle instincts, and a quiet rectitude that drew \n     others to him.\n       See now, at a distance, his strengths as a man and as a \n     leader are only more impressive. It's the nature of the city \n     of Washington that men and women arrive, leave their mark, \n     and go their way. Some figures who seemed quite large and \n     important in their day are sometimes forgotten, or remembered \n     with ambivalence. Yet nearly a generation after the often \n     impassioned debates of the Reagan years, what lingers from \n     that time is almost all good. And this is because of the calm \n     and kind man who stood at the center of events.\n       We think back with appreciation for the decency of our 40th \n     president, and respect for all that he achieved. After so \n     much turmoil in the 60s and 70s, our Nation had begun to lose \n     confidence, and some were heard to say that the presidency \n     might even be too big for one man. That phrase did not \n     survive the 1980s. For decades, America had waged a Cold War, \n     and few believed it could possibly end in our own lifetimes. \n     The President was one of those few. And it was the vision and \n     will of Ronald Reagan that gave hope to the oppressed, shamed \n     the oppressors, and ended an evil empire. More than any other \n     influence, the Cold War was ended by the perseverance and \n     courage of one man who answered falsehood with truth, and \n     overcame evil with good.\n       Ronald Reagan was more than an historic figure. He was a \n     providential man, who came along just when our Nation and the \n     world most needed him. And believing as he did that there is \n     a plan at work in each life, he accepted not only the great \n     duties that came to him, but also the great trials that came \n     near the end. When he learned of his illness, his first \n     thoughts were of Nancy. And who else but Ronald Reagan could \n     face his own decline and death with a final message of hope \n     to his country, telling us that for America there is always a \n     bright dawn ahead. Fellow Americans, here lies a graceful and \n     a gallant man.\n       Nancy, none of us can take away the sadness you are \n     feeling. I hope it is a comfort to know how much he means to \n     us, and how much you mean to us as well. We honor your grace, \n     your own courage, and above all, the great love that you gave \n     to your husband. When these days of ceremony are completed, \n     the Nation returns him to you for the final journey to the \n     West. And when he is laid to rest under the Pacific sky, we \n     will be thinking of you, as we commend to Almighty the soul \n     of His faithful servant, Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Eulogy for President Ronald Reagan\n\n                        (By Senator Ted Stevens)\n\n       Mrs. Reagan, Patti, Ron, Michael, distinguished guests, \n     members of the Reagan family, and friends of Ronald Reagan in \n     America and throughout the world:\n       Tonight, President Ronald Reagan has returned to the \n     people's house to be honored by millions of Americans who \n     loved him.\n       Since 1824, under this Rotunda, our Nation has paid final \n     tribute to many dedicated public servants. President Abraham \n     Lincoln was the first president to lie in state under this \n     Capitol dome. In the coming days, thousands will come to \n     these hallowed halls to say good-bye to another son of \n     Illinois who, like Lincoln, appealed to our best hopes, not \n     our worst fears.\n       In the life of any Nation, few men forever alter the course \n     of history. Ronald Reagan was one of those men. He rose from \n     a young boy who didn't have much to a man who had it all, \n     including the love of a faithful partner and friend he found \n     in his wife Nancy.\n       The true measure of any man is what he does with the \n     opportunities life offers. By that standard, Ronald Reagan \n     was one of America's greatest. He first proved that as \n     governor of California and later as the President of the \n     United States.\n       When Ronald Reagan was sworn in as our 40th President, this \n     Nation was gripped by a powerful malaise, inflation and \n     unemployment were soaring, and the Soviet Union was winning \n     the Cold War.\n       By the time President Reagan left office, he had reversed \n     the trend of ever-increasing government control over our \n     lives, restored our defense capabilities, guided us through \n     the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, and \n     set in motion policies which ultimately led to the collapse \n     of the ``Evil Empire.''\n       His integrity, vision and commitment were respected by all. \n     But history's final judgment, I believe, will remember most \n     his ability to inspire us.\n       President Reagan put it best when he said: ``The greatest \n     leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest \n     things. He is the one that gets [the] people to do the \n     greatest things.''\n       This President inspired Americans by reaching out far \n     beyond what he could attain. Like a good coach, he understood \n     the value of a goal isn't always in achieving it; sometimes \n     it is enough to simply look out into the future and remind \n     people what is possible. And, often he achieved the \n     impossible.\n       He reminded us that ``government is not the solution.'' The \n     solution lies in each of us. True American heroes are \n     ordinary people who live their lives with extraordinary \n     character and strength.\n       President Reagan showed us freedom was not just a slogan; \n     he actually brought freedom to hundreds of thousands of \n     people around this globe by opposing oppressive regimes. \n     Those of us from the World War II generation looked up to him \n     for his moral courage; in him we saw the leadership of great \n     men like Eisenhower who led the way and moved us to follow.\n       On a winter day in 1981, Ronald Reagan stood on the steps \n     that lie just beyond these doors to deliver his first \n     inaugural address. He spoke of a journal written by a young \n     American who went to France in 1917 and died for the cause of \n     freedom. From that journal he read these words: ``I will \n     work, I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will \n     fight cheerfully and do my utmost, as if the issue of the \n     whole struggle depended on me alone.''\n       Throughout his life, Ronald Reagan bore our burdens as if \n     the outcome did depend on him alone. We will all remember him \n     as an unparalleled leader and an exceptional man who lifted \n     our Nation and set the world on a new path.\n       President Reagan achieved greatness in his life; some might \n     even argue he transcended it. He could not have accomplished \n     this without Nancy. Nancy is one of the finest First Ladies \n     these United States have ever known. And the love Ronald and \n     Nancy Reagan shared touched the hearts of people everywhere.\n       In 1989, President Reagan delivered his farewell address \n     from the Oval Office. In that speech, the President spoke of \n     ``the shining city upon a hill'' that, ``after 200 years, two \n     centuries . . . still stands strong and true on the granite \n     ridge.'' Now, it is our turn to thank Ronald Reagan for \n     making us believe in that shining city. As we say farewell, \n     his last words as President echo across this great Nation. If \n     we listen, we will hear him whisper the humble words he used \n     to sum up his revolution: ``All in all, not bad, not bad at \n     all.''\n\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today following the 60-minute period for \nmorning business, we will resume consideration of S. 2400, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. That will begin our third \nweek of consideration on the Defense authorization bill. It is \nimportant that we finish this critical piece of legislation this week. \nI hope Senators will cooperate to that end. The amendments have been \nreviewed, and Chairman Warner and Senator Levin will be looking to \nschedule floor consideration of those amendments.\n  Last week, I announced we will vote on Defense-related amendments \nthis evening beginning at 5:30 p.m.. Although we have not locked in any \nvotes at this time, it is my hope that this afternoon Members will come \nto the floor with their amendments so we can begin voting promptly at \n5:30. We will alert all Senators when we reach consent concerning these \nvotes.\n  In addition, this week we will need to consider a number of judicial \nnominations which were delayed from last week. Members should be \nprepared for consecutive votes on these nominations. We will be \nscheduling those votes throughout each day.\n  On this side of the aisle, we are not going to need rollcall votes on \neach of these nominations. I will be talking to the Democratic \nleadership to see if the Senate can act at least on some of these \nnoncontroversial judges without a rollcall vote in the interest of \nschedule and time.\n  Finally, we face a number of scheduling challenges this week with \nother events that are going on. So it is important we use each \nSenator's time efficiently. We will be trying to accommodate as many of \nthose events as possible. But we absolutely must have the cooperation \nof all Senators in order to get our work done this week.\n  I will turn to the assistant Democratic leader for his comments, and \nthen I have a statement to make in morning business.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will be very happy to be on the Defense \nbill. We on this side have a number of amendments that will be offered \nimmediately. I think they will be substantive amendments and they \nshould not be controversial, at least as far as I know.\n  I ask the distinguished majority leader if President Karzai is going \nto speak here tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my understanding he will be speaking \ntomorrow. The details of that will be announced later today. But it is \nmy understanding it will be early in the morning to a joint session of \nCongress.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we look forward to working on this \nlegislation. As the leader knows, we have a lot of amendments. I am \nglad we are able to focus on these today. I am sure we can dispose of a \nlot of these with the two managers. We have done that in the past. We \nstill have to have several votes, and we will work to do our best over \non this side to get votes and move forward.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is the leader using leadership time?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will use leader time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6687-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6687-S6689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VISIT TO IRAQ\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, 10 days ago I had the opportunity to travel \nto Iraq to visit our troops on the front line and the troups serving in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom. On that same trip to Baghdad, I had \nthe opportunity to spend time with Ambassador Jerry Bremer as well as \nthe new Prime Minister of the Iraqi interim government. He was \nappointed Prime Minister 3 or 4 days before our arrival. His name is \nDr. Ayad Allawi. He happens to be a neurologist who spent part of his \ntime and his training in England several years after I had the \nopportunity to do some of my training in England.\n  Also during this trip, we had the opportunity to discuss with, listen \nto, and receive briefings from our Nation's senior military officers \nwho are currently leading our efforts in Iraq. I was joined by my \ncolleagues Senator Bob Bennett and Senator John Ensign. \n  I will take a few moments to share with my Senate colleagues some of \nwhat we saw and learned on this trip. We didn't say very much about it \nbecause of the tributes last week. But about 8 days ago we were in \nBaghdad in Iraq. Some of what I will say you have heard before, but a \nlot of it you have not heard in large part because the media--both the \nmedia in Iraq and here in the United States--tends to cover the \nterrorist events, and it is very appropriate, but tends not to see what \nis going on on the ground in terms of what our soldiers see and what \nthe Iraqi people are seeing. Given what we read and what we see in the \nmedia every day, we had the same experience today of waking up and \nopening the newspaper with yet another terrorist act. We expected to \nsee things getting worse and worse on a daily basis. We expected to \nfind a mission that was struggling, demoralized troops, collapsed \ninfrastructure, and distressed Iraqi people. However, we found the \nopposite. We found hope. We found optimism. We found progress. Yes, we \nwere there when terrorist activities were occurring, but in balance to \nthat, and juxtaposed, we saw tremendous success. We went, in part, to \nencourage others. We actually came back very encouraged and inspired.\n\n  The transfer to sovereignty, I am absolutely convinced, having just \nbeen there, will be successful. The transfer of responsibility is well \nunderway. Again, I did not realize fully until going over there 9 days \nago that most of the responsibility has already been transferred to the \ninterim Iraqi government. The 33 new ministers have all been appointed. \nMost, or a majority of them, are already running their cabinet position \nor their department. The new Iraqi government, the interim government, \nwhich will serve until the elections, appears to be very strong. People \nhave tremendous respect for these leaders.\n  We began our trip in Kuwait. On the outskirts of Kuwait City, we \nvisited Camp Wolverine. We were briefed there by the Deputy Commander \nof U.S. Central Command, LTG Lance Smith. We learned how the command is \nfighting throughout the very large theater that begins in East Africa, \nthe border being the Sudan area and extending across the globe to the \n``Stans.'' That entire theater is aggressively and with a great deal of \nsuccess carrying out its responsibility, including fighting this war on \nterror. The 25 or 26 countries are all involved, both as a region and \nalso as individual countries, in fighting this war on this global \nnetwork of terror.\n  In countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan, we are actively engaged in \ncombat operations. They were described in great detail to us. Alongside \nour coalition partners and others, we are fighting a preventive war \nwith diplomacy and economic and other nonmilitary means. It is a global \neffort. It is a comprehensive war on terror that is being fought. Like \nweeds in a garden, our commanders realize if you do not take action \npromptly, aggressively, and broadly, terrorism will take root, it will \ngrow deep, and it will spread uncontrollably.\n  After our briefings, Senators Bennett and Ensign and I met with the \nservice men and women, the soldiers who are out there literally on the \nfront line day in and day out. In Kuwait City there is an entryway \nwhere everybody coming to that part of the world is channeled--our \nsoldiers--as well as when they exit to go home on leave for a few \nweeks. It is remarkable how our soldiers are briefed and debriefed and \nthat transition is made.\n  Later that day we had the opportunity to dine with soldiers from our \nrespective States. I had the pleasure of sharing a meal with many \nsoldiers from Tennessee, including Tech SGT Kenneth Clark from \nMillington, MAJ Jon Hays from Chattanooga, MSG John Russell from Bluff \nCity, and SGT Otis Fox from Memphis. I understate when I say that being \nable to have a meal with them, with the Tennessee flag up next to us, \nmade me and Tennessee quite proud.\n  The next day we spent in Iraq where, as I mentioned, we met with \nAmbassador Bremer and his staff. This is a view from the ground from \nwhere we were 8 to 9 days ago. He made very clear he is encouraged by \nthe caliber of the new Iraqi interim government. It was in that meeting \nthat I realized much of the responsibility for sovereignty has already \ntaken place. The new ministers are actually up and running right now.\n\n  We also had an update on the Iraqi economy and reconstruction \nefforts, which, again, are doing much better\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\nthan what our media or a sampling of our media in the United States \nwould ever imply. The statistics speak for themselves: Unemployment is \nnearly half of what it was before the war; inflation has been cut in \nhalf; oil production is nearly nine times higher than it was a year ago \nat this time; bank deposits are up; microcredit loans are flowing.\n  From a medical standpoint, 85 percent of the Iraqi children have been \nimmunized, and 240 hospitals--all of the hospitals--have been opened. \nAs we walked through hospitals, they are open and serving people. There \nis actually some very good equipment there that Saddam had purchased, \nbut it was sitting in containers for years and years after he purchased \nit and left in the hallways. That equipment is now being brought \nonline.\n  Over 1,200 preventive medical clinics are operating. The CPA and the \ncoalition forces have completed over 18,000 individual reconstruction \nprojects. About $7 billion to $8 billion of the reconstruction money \nhas been committed as of June 5.\n  We also learned that the reconstruction money which is so important \nin terms of giving hope to the Iraqi people but also in rebuilding the \ninfrastructure has begun to flow much more freely now that a lot of the \ncontracting issues have been worked out on the ground. These projects \nare going a long way in terms of reinvigorating the Iraqi economy, \ngetting the country back on its feet, and giving hope to that \nindividual Iraqi person or that individual Iraqi family after decades \nof neglect of this infrastructure, with no hope for decades because of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Reducing unemployment is a critical need. That is why the \nreconstruction money, in part, is so important. Unemployment must be \nimproved before we will have a truly secure situation on the ground. It \nis critical to move toward a full-blown democracy in Iraq.\n  I mentioned I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Allawi, who I was \nvery impressed with. He is a British trained neurologist, a \nlongstanding opponent of Saddam Hussein's regime. He is the new Prime \nMinister. He will serve for the next 6 months. He is a man of great \ncharacter. He shares our strategic goals and approach. He had talked to \nhis country the day before and was covered extensively by the media in \nthat part of the world. He talked about the sacrifice the United States \nhas made, the fact that, yes, the security and elections are first and \nforemost, but it will be important to have the coalition forces and the \nUnited States present as we turn over to sovereignty but also help them \nrebuild their police forces and rebuild their military. We were the \nfirst delegation to have the opportunity to meet with Dr. Allawi, and, \nagain, we were very impressed. I will say more about that meeting \ntomorrow.\n  Regarding the cabinet itself and the 33 ministers, I asked the people \non the ground about the 33 ministers who have been appointed. They are \na broad, very educated group, very diverse group, geographically \nrepresentative. There are six women. Two out of three have Ph.D.s. It \nseems to be both from a civilian--the Iraqi people--and a military \nviewpoint there is a tremendous amount of respect for the quality and \nthe caliber of this cabinet.\n  A highlight for me personally, which occurred later in the day, was \nto visit the U.S. military hospital in Baghdad. Again, as a physician, \nit was invigorating to be able to meet our doctors and our nurses, our \nthoracic surgeons, our vascular surgeons who are treating anywhere from \n70 to 100 patients in that facility every day.\n  We were able to meet a number of our service members who were being \ntreated in the hospital who had been injured in the last several days. \nAgain, to see their real patriotism, their pride, their optimism, even \nthough they had just been injured the day before, was really \ngratifying.\n  I met with Greg Kidwell, a soldier from Clarksville, TN, who is \nserving in the military and serving his country by caring for patients \nin the hospital. It is a very impressive hospital facility. As a \nphysician, as someone who spent 20 years in hospitals, this is top-\nnotch, high-quality care from some of the most competent and dedicated \nprofessionals our country can muster.\n  Following the visit to the hospital, we visited with the 1st Armored \nDivision near Baghdad. We had lunch with soldiers from the 1st Armored \nDivision. Again, a number of Tennesseans who worked with the 1st \nArmored Division, such as SP Tim Griswold of Fayetteville, MSG Ron \nMiller of Clarksville, CAPT Mike Loveall of Gallatin, and SP Michael \nJohnson of Chattanooga were there. We were joined by several other \nsoldiers from the 168th Military Police Battalion from Tennessee as \nwell.\n  Afterwards, we were briefed by senior officers from the division. \nThey gave us an overview of the situation, which was interesting \nbecause it was their responsibility to address the soldier militias. We \nhad the opportunity to talk to them. This was several days after they \nhad a huge amount of success in terms of addressing and defeating many \nof Muqtada al Sadr's militias in a number of cities throughout the \nsouth, having been moved from Baghdad down south. It is clear to them, \nand everybody we talked to, that Sadr is not supported by most Iraqis, \nbut only by the disenfranchised and a fringe element.\n  Quite clearly, we owe the success of the 1st Armored Division to the \ncompetency, training, and motivation of our soldiers, and the overall \nsuccess in all these activities to the success of our soldiers and our \nmarines who risk their lives on a daily basis to bring freedom and \ndemocracy to Iraq.\n  Later that afternoon, we journeyed to the headquarters of the \nMultinational Forces Iraq, which was formerly the CJTF-7. Again, we had \na comprehensive overview of the situation in Iraq. We left there \nimpressed with our troops, with their character, with their courage, \nand with their determination to so selflessly accomplish their assigned \nmission. They are answering the call to duty to bring freedom and \nsecurity so others may live free of tyranny.\n  I say all this saddened and well aware of the news that was presented \nlast Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; and that is, this increased level of \nterrorism and violence in Iraq, including the murder of the Deputy \nForeign Minister, Bassam Salih Kubba, which is a terrible loss. But we \nmust be aware of and I think it is important for the American people to \nunderstand both what we were told and what we saw. We were told by our \nmilitary commanders, we were told by the Prime Minister, and we were \ntold by the President of Iraq, who was here this past week, that there \nis going to be an increased level of terrorist activity. The terrorists \nwant to defeat--they say the United States and they say the coalition, \nbut they want to defeat any government, any governing authority. So \nthat level of terrorism is likely. We should not be surprised if it \nincreases between now and June 30, and indeed after sovereignty is \npassed off to the Iraqis in the weeks after the new government takes \nhold.\n\n  After June 30, the relationship between the United States and Iraq is \ngoing to be one of a strategic partnership, as we move from an \noccupying force to that of a mission and a very large embassy there. \nOur focus is going to be twofold. No. 1 is going to be security and No. \n2 is to make sure, in terms of a strategic partnership, that these \nelections occur and that they occur in a free and fair way. So it is \nsecurity and elections. That is what the focus will be over the next 6 \nmonths.\n  We, of course, will continue with the reconstruction progress that \nhas been made, improving the Iraqi economy. At the same time, we will \ncontinue to fight terrorism now in partnership with the interim Iraqi \ngovernment. The terrorists want, and the terrorists have as their \nobjective, to derail the sovereignty to the Iraqi people. They are \ntargeting the growing middle class in Iraq. They want to keep Iraqis \nout of voting booths. They want to keep them out of hospitals. They \nwant to keep them out of schools. They want to keep them out of \nmarkets. And they want to accomplish that through fear.\n  But it is clear, in talking to the Iraqi people and the civilians and \nour military, that they simply are not going to succeed. That is what \nwe left with: They simply are not going to succeed. Most Iraqis do not \nsupport these groups. They understand the terrorists are attacking the \npeople of Iraq. It is going to be very helpful that when the Prime \nMinister, who had not met anybody from our legislative branch--the \nfirst words he said to me and to the Iraqi people were, using the Iraqi \nvoice:\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nThe terrorists are not after you, the United States, and not even after \nthe coalition. The terrorists are after the Iraqi people. Every \naction--blowing up an oil line, blowing up a water line--hurts the \nIraqi people, not the United States and not the coalition itself. That \nvoice coming from the Iraqi leadership I think will be hugely helpful.\n  Iraqis do not like the U.S. occupation in and of itself. They are a \nproud people and they want that sovereignty. Yes, we are going from \noccupation to mission. Iraqis do want freedom. They do want democracy. \nBut the President this week, with whom many of us had the opportunity \nto meet, and the Prime Minister said the goal is democracy.\n  Last week--and I will close shortly--the U.N. Security Council \nunanimously approved a new U.S. resolution. The resolution outlines \nthat transfer of sovereignty to the new interim Iraqi government and \nthe role of the coalition forces after June 30. The world community is \nnow united behind the Iraqi people, and with every passing day the \nIraqi people, with the coalition's help, are building the capacity to \ngovern themselves.\n  As in the past, we must stay the course. We will stay the course. We \nwill keep true to the principles. We will have continued faith in our \nsuperb Armed Forces. We know that history in the end will be on our \nside.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6689-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we are faced now with a relatively short \nperiod of time to finish our work for this year. We are down to a \ncertain number of weeks--not very many--to do many things. We have a \nshort time to finish the jobs that need to be finished. So I wish to \ncomment a little on some of the things I have been thinking about in \nterms of the broader aspect of what our responsibilities are in the \nSenate.\n  In the Senate, we are faced, of course, with many and varied issues. \nWe have to deal with all kinds of things that happen and all kinds of \nissues that are brought up which are very legitimate. I guess this is \nmy point: Our job is also to define the kinds of issues that are \nappropriate to be handled in the Senate, to be handled in the Congress, \nto be a part of the Federal activity.\n  Sometimes I think we find ourselves having all kinds of issues come \nup in this Chamber which one could question as to whether this is the \nrole of the Federal Government. Of course, our basic decisionmaking \ncomes from the Constitution. But the Constitution is obviously fairly \nbroad in its terms, so there is always a different kind of feeling, a \ndifferent definition for what are the appropriate roles, the \nappropriate issues in which the Federal Government should be involved.\n  I guess I am sometimes reminded that the Federal Government is only \none of the functions that we have in this country to carry out the \nleadership and the activities for our country.\n  It is the United States of America, so that the Federal Government's \nrole is to bring together those things that affect a number of States, \nand the States to do those things that are involved in their State. \nThey are closer to the people in the State.\n  We also, of course, have county governments. We have State \ngovernments, and we have city governments. We have nongovernmental \nunits. We have voluntarism. We have all kinds of things that are there.\n  One of the elements of our work is to decide what should be treated \nas legitimate Federal issues and the kind with which we should be \nconcerned here. I think we are challenged every day with that kind of \ndefinition. I am not going to try to cite all the different ones that \ncome up, but I can tell you there are things that come up that you \nwould have a hard time saying: Hey, that is the role of the Federal \nGovernment to decide.\n  It is particularly appropriate to bring this up, after having spent \nthe weekend celebrating Ronald Reagan's work as President and the job \nhe did in leadership. His basic thought, you remember, all through his \nwhole involvement was less government rather than more and wanting it \nto be more efficient rather than less efficient. So it does seem \nappropriate that we talk about those kinds of things as we go about our \nstruggle.\n  We are involved now, for instance, with the establishment of a \nbudget. Frankly, a lot of people say: What do you want a budget for; \nyou don't pay any attention to it anyway.\n  That isn't true. The budget is kind of that definition of where we \nare going, and the Federal Government has some control in that if you \ngo beyond the budget in the appropriations process, which often \nhappens, then there is the defense mechanism that you can raise a point \nof order where it takes 60 votes to get it passed. So it is interesting \nto me that now we are having time for the budget. In fact, time for the \nbudget has actually passed. Remember, this is the fiscal year that ends \nat the end of September, and we are supposed to have all of our \nappropriations finished by that time. To do that, you really should \nhave a budget. And we are here on the cusp of having a budget, yet with \nsome fairly insignificant differences why we are held up and don't have \none.\n  I was struck the other day by reading a little quote from James \nMadison. He said:\n\n       In framing a government which is to be administered by men \n     over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first \n     enable the government to control the governed; and in the \n     next place, oblige it to control itself.\n\n  That is difficult, a large event like we have in the Federal \nGovernment, to control the size and the activities of the Federal \nGovernment. So I think in many ways it has grown beyond what most \npeople would have envisioned in years past. Whenever there seems to be \na problem here, now we have continued to create the notion that you \nneed some money for this, you need some money for that on the local \nlevel. Let's get the Federal Government to pay it. Then, on the other \nhand, we say: taxes are too high. Why should we be paying this much?\n  So there is this built-in contradiction that is always there. But we \nneed to take a look at the dollars spent. We need to take a look at the \nsize of the Federal Government, the number of employees in the Federal \nGovernment, the number of agencies we have, and more difficult than \nanything else is to kind of keep track of the number of programs that \nare funded by the Federal Government. It is difficult sometimes.\n\n  One of the difficulties is programs become established, and they \ncontinue. Times change. What was appropriate to do 10, 15 years ago may \nnot be appropriate now, but it seems to be very difficult to ever do \nanything about the programs that exist, that sort of perpetuate \nthemselves.\n  So I think it really is interesting to deal with this issue and, \nagain, to think about the role of the Federal Government.\n  We are doing something in the committee that I chair, the Parks \nSubcommittee, where we have more and more heritage areas. We find \nourselves having heritage areas most everywhere, and you get a little \nadvantage locally. I understand that. But we are trying now to put down \nthe definition of what a national heritage area ought to be. There are \nState heritage areas; there are local heritage areas; and then there \nare national ones, each of which has different characteristics. So \nthese\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nare the kinds of things at which I believe we have to continue to look.\n  As we have grown, I wanted to bring a little exhibit. I asked the \ngeneral services office to make for me a list of all the programs that \nare federally funded. This is the book of federally funded programs. I \nam not saying they are not all excellent, but I am saying this thing \ncontinues to get bigger, continues to get larger, continues to have \nmore and more programs and not much of an effort to go back and \nevaluate them to see if they are still appropriate, to see if they need \nto be changed, to see, indeed, if they need to be there. We don't \nreally evaluate as closely as we might the new programs that are thrown \nout there, whatever they may be, to see, is this an appropriate thing \nfor us to do at the Federal level or, indeed, should it be done \nsomewhere else.\n  So I have been feeling fairly strongly about this point. I am not \nsure we all recognize the size of the things that we do have. For \nexample, how many employees do you suppose there are in the Federal \nGovernment? Quite a few? Yes, about 1.9 million. It has gone up the \nfirst part of this administration, and now it went down by about \n29,000. Now it is 1.861 million employees. And they are good employees, \nI understand that. I am not critical of the employees. But I am saying \nthis is the size of the Government. We try to do some things to hold \ndown the size, to hold down the spending. Maybe even more importantly \nis to keep Government as close as can be to the governed. I think we \nsee this regionally quite a bit.\n  I happen to be from a State in the West, a small population State. \nThe kinds of programs, the kinds of administration, the kinds of \ngovernmental activities you need in our State are quite different from \nwhat they are in New York City or in Philadelphia. So having it closer \nto the people allows for the kinds of changes that need to be there. We \nare concerned about spending. Indeed, we should be. We spent, last \nyear, about $826 billion on discretionary programs, not defense and \nthose others. As a matter of fact, nonmilitary spending last year was \nup 8.7 percent over the last 2 years. So that is an awful lot of dough.\n  At any rate, I just couldn't resist the idea of saying, let's take a \nlittle look at each of these programs, and let's see if they are still \ncurrent, if they are still doing the job they were designed to do, if \nthey are appropriate to be done on the Federal level as opposed to some \nother level of government, and what can we do to make them even more \nefficient.\n  I was very impressed over the weekend with all of our recognition of \nPresident Reagan, his efforts to sort of do some of these things, keep \nthem as small as possible, keep them as appropriate as possible. I \nthink it is a job that we have as well, and one that I hope we will \ntake up with more vigor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6690-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6690-S6691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENDING THE COLD WAR\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I, too, would like to comment on one of the \nlegacies of our late President Ronald Reagan, the legacy of ensuring \nthat the free world would prevail over the Soviet Union in the cold \nwar.\n  I thought it was interesting that in one of the comments about Reagan \nvery recently made on National Public Radio, June 8 of this year, Mr. \nGennady Gerasimov, spokesman for Mikhail Gorbachev, said this:\n\n       I see President Reagan as a grave digger of the Soviet \n     Union and the spade that he used to prepare this grave was \n     SDI, a Strategic Defense Initiative, so-called ``Star Wars.'' \n     The trick was that the Soviet leadership believed that this \n     SDI defense is possible and then--because it's possible, we \n     must catch up with the Americans. And this was an invitation \n     to the arms race, and the Soviet economy could not really \n     afford it and this way Reagan really contributed to the \n     demise of the Soviet Union.\n\n  Who better to know that than the spokesmen for Mikhail Gorbachev who \nhave said similar things? Twenty-one years ago, President Reagan posed \na very important question to the American people. He asked us to \nconsider whether the free people of the world should continue to have \nto rely upon the threat of a massive retaliation of nuclear weapons to \nprevent an attack by the opposition. He asked: What would it take to \nfree the world from this threat? He answered as follows:\n\n       I know this is a formidable, technical task, one that may \n     not be accomplished before the end of this century. Yet, \n     current technology has attained a level of sophistication \n     where it's reasonable for us to begin this effort. It will \n     take years, probably decades of effort on many fronts. There \n     will be failures and setbacks, just as there will be \n     successes and breakthroughs. . . . But isn't it worth every \n     investment necessary to free the world from the threat of \n     nuclear war? We know it is.\n\n  We began making that investment. It was one of the reasons we had a \ndeficit during the Reagan years. It was part of the so-called defense \nbuildup, to invest billions of dollars in the research--yes, there were \nfailures, but there were many successes--to develop a Strategic Defense \nInitiative, an ability to defend ourselves against a ballistic missile \nattack from an enemy. A lot of Americans probably think we developed \nthat strategic defense, that we have that capability today. They might \nremember that during the first Persian Gulf war Patriot missiles shot \ndown some of the Scuds that were fired by Saddam Hussein.\n  But the grim reality is strategic defense is still not a reality. We \nstill don't have the ability to defend against a missile attack. What \nhappened during the Persian Gulf war? We used an air defense system to \nshoot down airplanes, and in the field, literally, as we shipped it \nfrom the United States to Israel and to Saudi Arabia and to Kuwait, \nmade modifications in it so that we hoped it might work to shoot down \nsome of the missiles that Saddam Hussein shot toward Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait. In fact, some of those missiles--roughly a third of them--were \nintercepted by the Patriot. It was a crude weapon that was modified in \nthe field. It had never been tested against other missiles. Yet we used \nwhat we had at the time because of the threat that existed.\n  Throughout the Clinton years and the first Bush administration, \nresearch continued. Every time we got close to, as they say, bending \nmetal, actually building a missile, somebody would object and say we \nare not quite there yet. We haven't proven it can work. It is going to \ncost a lot of money, or the Russians--then the Soviets--might be \nunhappy with it.\n  After the demise of the Soviet Union, we agreed to scrap the ABM \nTreaty, and both President Putin and President Bush agreed that there \nwas no need for a treaty that would define how many missiles each \ncountry could have and how many nuclear warheads because, frankly, we \ndidn't have the need for them anymore and they were costly to maintain. \nWe would destroy as many of ours as we wanted to destroy, and they \ncould destroy all of theirs that they wanted to destroy. It was too \nexpensive to keep around. There are still some. There are still some in \nRussia, I might add, where some believe it still might be worth trying \nto develop this offensive capability because the U.S. has never \ndeployed a ballistic missile defense. There are those in China who \nbelieve the same thing, and also in North Korea, who I suspect believe \nwe are bluffing.\n\n  Let me quote something from a high-ranking official in Iran, from \nIran's clerical hierarchy, delivered at Tehran's Al-Hussein University \nvery recently, and reported in the May 28 edition of a newspaper in \nLondon:\n\n       We have a strategy drawn up for the destruction of Anglo-\n     Saxon civilization and for the uprooting of the Americans and \n     the English. The global infidel front is a front against \n     Allah and the Muslims, and we must make use of everything we \n     have at hand to strike at this front, by means of our suicide \n     operations or by means of our missiles. There are 29 \n     sensitive sites in the U.S. and in the West. We have already \n     spied on these sites and we know how we are going to attack \n     them.\n\n  There is more that we could bring to the information from the \nintelligence community, that is open material that we are all aware \ninvolve plans by leaders in North Korea, Iran, and other places to try \nto develop missile technology and nuclear technology to attack places \nsuch as the United States. The North Koreans already have the capacity \nto attack Hawaii and Alaska, and we don't yet have a missile defense \nsystem in place to stop it.\n  Thanks to President Bush and the efforts of the Congress and the \nmissile act that we passed, we have put into place a program to \nactually develop and deploy a missile defense system. It\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\nis not the be-all and end-all. It would not destroy everything the \nSoviet Union used to be able to use against us, but it would stop the \nkinds of missiles that North Korea, Iran, and perhaps others might want \nto send our way.\n  Yet today we are at a crossroads. We begin debating today the Defense \nAuthorization Act and expect amendments to be offered once again to cut \nthe heart out of the missile defense program, prevent it from being \ndeployed to actually be able to shoot down the missiles of an attacking \ncountry. It is interesting what is at work here. I say cut the heart \nout. They want to cut out over half a billion dollars--$515.5 million--\nfrom the missile defense program. Why? They claim it hasn't yet been \noperationally tested. What does operational testing mean? It means you \ntake it out of the laboratory kind of testing and put it into the \nground; put the missile into the silo, and you run against it a real \ntest with an offensive missile like the one you want to be able to \ndefend against and see if you can knock it down. That is real \noperational testing, battlefield conditions.\n  Sometimes you cannot afford to do that kind of testing, and you have \nto go with what you have just as we did in the first Persian Gulf war. \nThere are other examples. The JSTAR is a program that had never been \noperationally tested, but we found that we needed it and, as a result--\nit is the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System, which is \nan aircraft that played an important role in the 1991 Persian Gulf war \nby providing warning to forces on the ground when the Iraqi military \nwas on the move. This had never been tested. JSTAR was in \npreproduction; it was a preproduction aircraft. They literally had to \noutfit it on the way to the theater. We used it and it worked.\n  The Predator is another example, and the Global Hawk. Unmanned aerial \nvehicles have been valuable assets on the war on terrorism. They were \nnot operationally tested. They were hardly ready for use, but we needed \nsomething that could do what they did. That is the way it is with \nmissile defense today. We need to have the ability to shoot down a \nmissile aimed at us by, for example, Iran or North Korea or some other \nenemy that might think we are bluffing.\n\n  What about this claim that it hasn't been operationally tested? Mr. \nPresident, this is how we operationally test it. We put it into the \nsilo, erect the radars, send a target missile against it, and see if it \nwill work. We have had many tests--something like 18 tests, and all of \nthe most recent tests have been successful. We are quite confident it \nwill work. It needs to be tested in battlefield conditions, and this is \nthe way to get it done. But the cuts that are being proposed would \nprevent us from buying the number of missiles we need in order to \nconduct this testing and still have enough left in the ground to \nprevent an attack should there be one launched against us.\n  There is a basic catch-22 being imposed against us. That catch-22 is \nthat you cannot deploy it until you can operationally test it, and you \ncannot test it until you deploy it.\n  It would be folly for us to support an amendment that would prevent \nus from fielding these missiles. Eventually, we are only talking about \n20 interceptors based at Fort Greeley in Alaska and Vandenberg Air \nForce Base. The money that has been set aside for the first tranche of \nthese missiles is already now producing the missiles to put in the \nfirst set of silos. We are now talking about the downpayment on the \nadditional interceptors, No. 21 through No. 30. We have already cut the \nlong lead procurement funding for interceptors No. 31 through 40. So we \nhave already delayed that, which will make it much more costly.\n  The bottom line is, as we have been told by General Kadish--the \ngeneral who runs this program--it will be much more time-consuming and \nexpensive if we cut the money out of the budget this year to prevent \nthe production of these missiles that are going to be needed both for \noperational testing, as well as to be prepared to defend against an \nenemy attack should it come.\n  The point I want to make today is this: The Soviet Union was brought \nto its knees because it believed President Reagan when he said we are \ngoing to develop a means of countering your most effective weapon, so \nyou might as well not even try to spend the money and the effort and \nthe time to create this program because we will be able to defeat you; \nwe are not kidding.\n  It has been over 20 years since President Reagan made that \nannouncement, and we still do not have the missiles in the ground. I am \nafraid some of our potential enemies are going to conclude that we were \nbluffing all along, that we do not have the will to spend the money and \nto put the program in place to provide this kind of defense.\n  The point of this defense is not just to be able to operationally \ntest it and have it in the ground to stop a missile should one be \nlaunched against us, but to deter nations that might believe we are \nbluffing, to deter nations from spending the money to build these \noffensive weapons in the first place, to deter these leaders, these \npeople in places such as North Korea and Iran, from concluding that if \nthey will simply spend the money it will take to build the nuclear \nweaponry and the missiles to fire them, that we will somehow forget \nabout developing missile defenses or conclude that it is too expensive, \nand the richest Nation on Earth, the Nation that has the financial \ncapability of providing this kind of defense, will decide not to do it.\n  The point of our exercise today is to move forward with the bill that \nthe committee has put before us. It is a good bill. The bill has an \nauthorization for enough money to buy the next group of missiles we \nneed to put in the silos for testing purposes, for the purpose of \nshooting down a missile should one be launched against us--we do not \nhave that ability today--and third, to deter countries that might be \nthinking they can go ahead with the development of this kind of a \nsystem because the United States will never get around to deploying an \neffective missile defense system.\n  Now is the time for us to act. It is not the time for us to blink in \nthe face of these dictatorial countries. Should we support the \namendment that would cut the heart out of missile defense funding for \nthis year, it would send a signal to these countries that the United \nStates has been bluffing all along. We were not bluffing when Ronald \nReagan made that important announcement. The Soviet Union understood \nthat. Can we do any less today than to make it crystal clear to our \nwould-be enemies that we are not bluffing, that we mean what we say, \nthat we intend to protect America, that we intend to protect others who \nare our allies, and that we will not permit an offensive ballistic \nmissile to strike our land and kill our people? To do anything else \nwould be morally irresponsible.\n  As President Reagan said, if we have the capability of defending \nourselves and preventing this kind of conflagration, should we not take \nadvantage of that wonderful capability? I am optimistic about our \nability, and I am confident about the American people, and I am sure \nthey want us to confirm to the world that we mean what we say, just as \nRonald Reagan meant what he said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a \ncourageous Oklahoman who died saving the lives of his men. Staff \nSergeant Erickson H. Petty grew up in Fort Gibson, where he graduated \nfrom high school in 1993. Eric, as he was known, aspired to military \nservice early, enlisting in the Oklahoma Army National Guard when he \nwas 17. Upon graduation, he joined the active duty Army, where he \nserved for nearly 10 years.\n  Eric has an extremely successful career in the Army, serving as a \nrecruiter for a time and as a scout in the 1st Armored Division. On May \n3, Staff Sergeant Petty and his men were guarding a weapons cache in \nSalman Al Habb when they came under small arms fire. Petty ordered his \nsoldiers into the protection of their Humvees, taking cover\n\n[[Page S6692]]\n\nlast to ensure the safety of his men. That decision, which so clearly \ndemonstrated his sacrificial leadership, cost him his life.\n  Staff Sergeant Petty had two passions: his family and his country. \nThose who speak of him constantly refer to his devotion to his wife \nKimberly, and especially to Colton, his 9-year-old son. In the words of \na longtime friend, his relationship with his son was ``his center.'' \nStill, the call of duty was strong. Staff Sergeant Petty had the option \nto stay a recruiter, to stay with his family. He chose to serve, and \nfor our sakes gave up safety, family, and finally his life.\n  America needs more committed servants like Staff Sergeant Petty. His \nlife and death stand as a clear example of what it means to be a \npatriot, even at great cost. Eric Petty heeded his country's call, and \nfor that we are all grateful. We would do well to remember his \nsacrifice as we celebrate his commitment to family, friends, and \nnation. He was Oklahoma's son and America's hero--Staff Sergeant Eric \nPetty.\n\n\n                      specialist james e. marshall\n\n  Mr. President, I also pay homage to Army Specialist James E. \nMarshall, who last month made the ultimate sacrifice for his country--\nhis life. Although he was only 19 years old, Specialist Marshall was a \ndedicated defender of America and knew the value of freedom and the \nsacrifices freedom sometimes demands. For his service and his \nsacrifice, I am proud to honor him on the Senate floor today.\n  Specialist Marshall was a member of the First Battalion, 21st Field \nArtillery Regiment, of the First Cavalry Division based at Fort Hood, \nTX. A native Oklahoma from my hometown of Tulsa, Marshall was raised by \nhis mother, Pamela. Specialist Marshall and his mother were very close; \nindeed, he pursued military service both to protect his country and to \nhelp provide for her, as she had done for him for so many years. We \nhold her in our prayers.\n  During his senior year, when classmates were pursuing scholarships \nand jobs, James Marshall was planning a different route. He had been \nconsidering military service for some time, and he saw it as an \nopportunity for personal development and a chance to prove himself.\n  Specialist Marshall died tragically on May 5 when the vehicle he and \na fellow soldier were riding in was struck by an improvised explosive \ndevice in Baghdad, Iraq. On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I ask that we \nnow pay tribute to James Marshall, who knew the true meaning of service \nand sacrifice. I am proud of him, and proud of his demonstrated \ncommitment to winning the freedom of those he did not know. We will not \nforget this Oklahoma hero, this American patriot--Specialist James \nMarshall.\n\n\n                     corporal scott michael vincent\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a remarkable man. \nCorporal Scott Michael Vincent was a classic Oklahoman: a hard worker \nand a leader who was dedicated to his family, his faith, and his \ncountry.\n  Corporal Vincent hailed from one of Oklahoma's great small \ncommunities, Bokoshe, where he graduated from Bokoshe High in 2000. He \nhad longtime aspirations to join the Marine Corps. When choosing a \nquote for his high school yearbook, he selected ``semper fidelis,'' the \nMarine Corps slogan he exemplified through his life--and his death. He \nachieved his goal of serving with the Corps when he joined last year, \ncompleting a tour in Afghanistan before volunteering for an extra tour \nin Iraq.\n  On Friday, April 30, Corporal Vincent was serving as a scout near \nFallujah, in Iraq's Al Anbar province. While his unit was halted, a \nsuicide bomber approached his vehicle from the rear and detonated his \nexplosive device. Corporal Vincent and one other marine were killed, \nand six of their comrades were wounded.\n  Scott Vincent's remarkable life was confirmed by the way people in \nhis hometown reacted to his death. Over 400 people in a town of 405 \ncame to funeral services on May 6. Our small towns are like families, \nand they are the fertile ground from which outstanding, selfless \nleaders like Corporal Vincent emerge to take on the mantle of service \nto their nation.\n  In this time of trouble, we remember Corporal Vincent. We remember \nhis family, and we grieve with them for their fallen son. In his life \nand his death, he set a high standard for all of us to follow. We will \nnever forget him--Corporal Scott Michael Vincent.\n\n\n              chief warrant officer two lawrence s. colton\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a courageous \nOklahoman who gave his life in defense of his Nation and his fellow \nsoldiers. Chief Warrant Officer Two Lawrence Shane Colton hailed from \nGuthrie, OK. Shane was serving as an attack helicopter pilot in Iraq \nwith the 1st Armored Cavalry division's Company C, 1st Battalion, 227th \nAviation Regiment.\n  Shane joined the military as a clerk in 1992, eventually working his \nway up to Staff Sergeant and then through Warrant Officer Candidate \nSchool. He was highly decorated and regarded as a skilled and capable \npilot by his fellow soldiers. On Easter Sunday, April 11, CW2 Colton \nand CW3 Chuck Fortenberry answered a call for help: a Coalition convoy \nhad been ambushed after being halted by an improvised explosive device. \nThe soldiers were pinned down under heavy fire and significantly \noutnumbered, and in desperation they called for relief. Shane and Chuck \nheaded right for the scene of the battle and opened fire on the \ninsurgent positions with 30-millimeter chain guns, killing many of the \nterrorists and destroying a building they were using. The convoy was \nable to escape, but the Apache was shot down by a small surface-to-air \nmissile, and their rescuers were lost with it.\n  Shane was a man beloved by his friends and fellow soldiers because of \nhis selflessness and optimism. To quote one of his comrades,\n\n       Shane would help you whenever you needed it too. If you had \n     a problem with your car all you had to do was call him up and \n     he would be there. He was also a whiz on computers and \n     electronics. If it was broke he could fix it. The best thing \n     about Shane was his attitude. No matter how crappy things \n     were he always had a smile on his face and would say \n     something to make you feel better.\n\n  Chief Warrant Officer 2 Colton was 32 years old when he lost his \nlife. He left a young family to defend his country, knowing full well \nthe risk he was taking. Ultimately, his commitment to his fellow \nAmericans in Baghdad and at home would require his life. I know his \nfriends and family realize that he died a true hero, worthy of the \nrespect and gratitude of every American. They will miss him dearly, and \nour thoughts and prayers are with them today, particularly with his \nwife Inge and their children Jennifer and Lance, and with his parents \nLoren and Kathy Colton. And though we are all grieved by the loss of \nthis man, we shall never cease to be proud of him--Oklahoma's son and \nAmerica's hero--Chief Warrant Officer 2 Lawrence ``Shane'' Colton.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I request 10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndistinguished American. Lieutenant General Ronald T. Kadish, United \nStates Air Force, will soon be retiring from the U.S. military after 34 \nyears of exceptional service to our Nation.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to know and respect General Kadish. \nOver the past 5 years, he has served as the Pentagon's Director of the \nMissile Defense Agency and the Program Manager for the Ballistic \nMissile Defense System. General Kadish's performance as Director has \nbeen nothing short of superb.\n  Throughout his unprecedented 5-year tour of duty, General Kadish \napplied his unparalleled experience and knowledge of public and private \nindustry in the pursuit of effective defenses against enemy ballistic \nmissiles.\n  He succeeded in motivating and aligning our political, scientific, \nand engineering communities to tackle the challenges of evolving a \nlayered, mulitnational missile defense capability. And, he succeeded in \ntransforming and focusing a large defense bureaucracy into a true joint \nplanning, joint operating system acquisition and business activity.\n  Today, because of his singular and tireless efforts, we stand on the \nthreshold of eliminating our Nation's long-standing vulnerability to \nthe very real threat of ballistic missile attack.\n  General Kadish was commissioned into the Air Force in 1970 after \ncompleting the Reserve Officers Training\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\nCorps program at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, PA. He went \non to earn his master's of business administration at the University of \nUtah, and continued his professional military education at the Air \nUniversity, the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, and the Defense \nSystems Management College.\n  In the early 1970s and 1980s, he was a pilot and instructor for the \nC-130 aircraft and served in tactical airlift squadrons in the United \nStates and Germany. Over his career, he flew more than 2,500 hours in \naircraft that form the airlift and fighter backbone of our Air Force--\nthe C-130s and C-17s, and the F-15s and F-16s, respectively.\n  As a young acquisition professional, he participated in the \nEducation-with-Industry program in Dallas with the Vought Corporation, \nand then got 3 years of hands-on management experience in the F-16 \ndevelopment program. A few years later, he was appointed the director \nof manufacturing and quality assurance for the B-1B bomber, one of the \nmost technologically complex production efforts ever undertaken by our \nNation up to that time.\n  The Air Force later called upon his managerial talents to serve in \nthree successive high visibility, high pressure, and high impact \npositions as program director for the F-15 fighter, the F-16 fighter, \nand the C-17 military transport acquisition programs.\n  Some of my colleagues will remember the developmental difficulties \nthe C-17 program faced. It was General Kadish's expertise that \nstraightened out this troubled program. Our troops in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and indeed in all points of the globe, remain the \nbeneficiaries of his managerial accomplishment.\n  As the current Bush administration came into office, Secretary \nRumsfeld looked to General Kadish to lead a major transformation of the \nBallistic Missile Defense program. The daunting task of realigning a \nmulti-billion-dollar, cutting-edge defense technology program into a \nstreamlined, capability-focused effort did not deter General Kadish. \nHis charge was to produce reliable defenses that will protect our \ncitizens and friends across the globe from the growing threat posed by \nballistic missiles. We are on the threshold of providing that \ncapability as I speak.\n  Armed with his 20-plus years of military acquisition experience, it \nwas clear to General Kadish that enhanced authorities and improved \ntechniques were needed to accomplish the mission. General Kadish was \nnever satisfied with business as usual when a better way could be \nfound. Bureaucratic change is tough enough to execute under any \ncircumstance. It is doubly so in a culture reinforced by longstanding \nlegal requirements and administrative procedures. Add to that a measure \nof healthy and vocal skepticism from critics, and his missile defense \ntransformation achievements stand out in stark relief.\n  Defense acquisition has historically been an activity carried out by \nthe individual military services. General Kadish has broadened that \nvision by pioneering a joint acquisition strategy for the Department of \nDefense. This approach has been more responsive to the needs of our \ntroops, more effective for the funds under his charge, and more attuned \nto the complexities of missile defense, than traditionally could have \nbeen possible. He leaves an important legacy of example and \naccomplishment for those who follow, inspiring a new generation of \nprogram managers for the joint arena.\n  In so doing, General Kadish earned the trust and respect of his \nassociates in the Pentagon and my colleagues here in the Senate. We \ncould always count on him to be clear in his goals, demanding in his \nstandards, and forthright in acknowledging issues. He never promised \nmore than he could deliver.\n  Indeed, one of my distinguished colleagues in this body, a declared \nskeptic of the missile defense program, has called him ``a class act.'' \nI, personally, am privileged to be able to call him a friend, and to \nhave him as a thoughtful and experienced advisor.\n  We will miss his leadership and his counsel as he moves on to a most \nwell-earned retirement from the Air Force. We owe him a profound debt \nof gratitude and deep thanks for his extraordinary contributions to our \nNation and our Nation's security over a lifetime of selfless service. I \nam sure I speak for all of us in this body in saying we wish him and \nhis family health and happiness in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) Department of State Procedures for Expedited Review of \n     Licenses for the Transfer of Defense Items Related to Missile \n     Defense.--\n       (1) Expedited procedures.--The Secretary of State shall, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, establish \n     procedures for considering technical assistance agreements \n     and related amendments and munitions license applications for \n     the export of defense items related to missile defense not \n     later than 30 days after receiving such agreements, \n     amendments, and munitions license applications, except in \n     cases in which the Secretary of State determines that \n     additional time is required to complete a review\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\n     of a technical assistance agreement or related amendment or a \n     munitions license application for foreign policy or national \n     security reasons, including concerns regarding the \n     proliferation of ballistic missile technology.\n       (2) Study on comprehensive authorizations for missile \n     defense.--The Secretary of State shall, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of Defense, examine the feasibility of \n     providing major project authorizations for programs related \n     to missile defense similar to the comprehensive export \n     authorization specified in section 126.14 of the \n     International Traffic in Arms Regulations (section 126.14 of \n     title 22, Code of Federal Regulations).\n       (3) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n     Representatives a report on--\n       (A) the implementation of the expedited procedures required \n     under paragraph (1); and\n       (B) the feasibility of providing the major project \n     authorization for projects related to missile defense \n     described in paragraph (2).\n       (b) Department of Defense Procedures for Expedited Review \n     of Licenses for the Transfer of Defense Items Related to \n     Missile Defense.--\n       (1) Procedures.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, prescribe \n     procedures to increase the efficiency and transparency of the \n     practices used by the Department of Defense to review \n     technical assistance agreements and related amendments and \n     munitions license applications related to international \n     cooperation on missile defense that are referred to the \n     Department.\n       (2) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, shall submit to the \n     Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services \n     and the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives a report--\n       (A) describing actions taken by the Secretary of Defense to \n     coordinate with the Secretary of State the establishment of \n     the expedited review process described in subsection (a)(1);\n       (B) identifying key defense items related to missile \n     defense that are suitable for comprehensive licensing \n     procedures; and\n       (C) describing the procedures prescribed pursuant to \n     paragraph (1).\n       (c) Definition of Defense Items.--In this section, the term \n     ``defense items'' has the meaning given that term in section \n     38(j)(4)(A) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2778(j)(4)(A)).\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I rise today to offer this amendment in order to draw \nattention to the importance of encouraging missile defense \ninternational cooperation.\n  My amendment accomplishes the following: First, it requires the \nSecretary of State, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to \nestablish an expedited process for considering the transfer of missile \ndefense-related agreements and licenses within 30 days. The Secretary \nof State may use more time if he determines the proposed transfer \nnecessitates a careful review to prevent the proliferation of U.S. \nballistic missile technology.\n  Second, the amendment requires the Secretary of State, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Defense, to conduct a study on major \nproject authorizations for missile defense. The purpose of this study \nwould be to examine the feasibility of providing major project \nauthorizations for projects related to missile defense.\n  Third, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to prescribe \nprocedures to increase the efficiency and transparency of the practices \nused by the Department of Defense to review applications for technical \nassistance agreements and licenses related to missile defense.\n  These provisions are limited in scope and have been refined \nconsiderably over the last month. They are specifically designed to \nprovide a mechanism for increasing our cooperation on missile defense \nwith our closest allies.\n  Why is this amendment important? Why should we work with our closest \nallies on missile defense? Let me take a moment to explain why.\n\n  Widespread proliferation of ballistic missiles and illegal weapons \ntechnology is a major threat to the United States as we enter the 21st \ncentury. Today, unfortunately, the United States remains defenseless \nagainst a ballistic missile attack.\n  President Bush, who is committed to eliminating this vulnerability, \nhas taken extraordinary measures to remove obstacles to developing a \nmissile defense capability. The technology has been proven. The timing \nis right. As a result, the President's vision for a national missile \ndefense system will likely become a reality this fall.\n  Yet we must acknowledge this complex system could become even more \ncomplicated without the assistance of other nations. We need early \nwarning and tracking sensors in other countries in order to predict and \nintercept an incoming ballistic missile. We also need intelligence \nother countries may have on the activities of those who may threaten \nour Nation.\n  Without this information, it could become extremely difficult for us \nto defeat a ballistic missile attack. A prudent step on our part would \nthen be to recognize the value of this assistance and exhibit a \nwillingness to help those who have been so willing to help us.\n  We cannot forget that while the United States may have a legitimate \nmissile defense capability, most of our allies do not. For example, \nJapan, Australia, and South Korea are perhaps more vulnerable than the \nUnited States due to their close proximity to the North Korean \nballistic missile threat. Yet these three close allies are defenseless \nagainst most ballistic missile attacks. Our NATO allies in Europe are \nalso vulnerable to a similar threat from the Middle East.\n  We also cannot forget hundreds of thousands of U.S. soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines are deployed in many tough regions around \nthe world, and many of these regions have rogue states that have \nsubstantial offensive ballistic missile capability. We cannot ignore \nthis looming threat to our troops overseas. Having allies with missile \ndefenses would greatly reduce the threat offensive ballistic missiles \ncould pose against our troops overseas.\n  Some might suggest cooperation on missile defense could lead to the \nproliferation of ballistic missile technologies. This is a legitimate \nconcern, and I certainly agree we must do everything we can to protect \nour most sensitive technologies. That is why I included in my amendment \nan exception that authorizes the Secretary of State to conduct an \nextended review of a proposed transfer if there is a concern about the \ntransfer of ballistic missile technologies. None of us want to see \nballistic missile technologies fall into the wrong hands.\n  We must recognize, though, that international cooperation on missile \ndefense can greatly reduce the proliferation of ballistic missiles. It \ndoes so by directly devaluing the ballistic missile as an offensive \nweapon of terror. With missile defenses deployed, as in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom, an enemy can no longer be assured of success when considering \na missile attack. It thus acts as a counterproliferation tool that \nforces our adversaries to think twice about investing billions of their \nscarce resources into ballistic missiles.\n  I commend President Bush for already taking the lead on international \ncooperation on missile defense. At his direction, the Pentagon is \nplanning wide-ranging cooperative missile defense activities with the \nUnited Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Germany, Italy, other NATO allies, \nand friends. The Pentagon is also looking into other opportunities with \nRussia in the wake of the decision to cancel the Russian-American \nObservation Satellite, or what we refer to as the RAMOS Program.\n  Yet our Government has only limited experience with large-scale \nmissile defense cooperation abroad. This limited experience has drawn \nout inefficiencies and problems that could limit cooperative missile \ndefense programs. Here are two recent examples that have troubled me.\n  First, it took almost 6 months to execute the United States-Japanese \ncooperative program on the Aegis-based Standard Missile-3. This holdup \nwas despite Japan's sterling nonproliferation reputation, a detailed \nUnited States and Japan memorandum of understanding, and a United \nStates-Japanese exchange of diplomatic notes underpinning the MOU.\n  Similarly, for our joint operations centers in NORAD, where we \nconduct missile defense operator training and exercises, we require \nnumerous special authorizations, taking months to review, to permit our \nindustry experts to work with Canadian military operators already in \nplace behind the computer\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\nterminals providing missile defense early warning in Colorado Springs.\n  I believe we should be thinking beyond our own borders and begin \nlooking at ways to assist our friends and allies. My amendment takes a \nsmall step forward in this direction. It still provides for a case-by-\ncase review and permits a careful and close review of a transfer that \nmight be of vital importance to our Nation. Perhaps most importantly, \nit upholds the virtue of our nonproliferation regimes and helps develop \nanother counterproliferation tool for the President's use in the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no objection to the Senator speaking, \nbut he has no right to yield to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may yield for a question.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma for a question.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Well, I appreciate that. First of all, I appreciate all \nthe Senator from Colorado has done in this field.\n  I say to the Senator, in your statement, when you talked about that \nsome of our allies, some of our friends, such as the Japanese, might be \nmore susceptible because of their proximity to North Korea, I remind my \ncolleagues what happened 6 years ago this coming August when the North \nKoreans did in fact fire a multistage rocket that had the capability of \nreaching the United States of America. So that threat is still there \nfor us.\n  I was going to ask my colleague a couple questions about his \namendment. But if somebody else desires the floor, that is perfectly \nall right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have no objection if the Senator from \nOklahoma wishes to speak. I am simply going to offer a second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will ask one question. In your amendment, you talked \nabout 30 days for considering technical assistance agreements and \nlicenses. Will you explain what that 30 days is and the significance of \nthat?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Well, the 30-day mandate is to emphasize the importance \nof considering these agreements and licenses for international \ncooperation on missile defense in a timely manner, not being dragged \nout forever and ever. Too often, applications for technical assistance \nprograms and licenses for missile defense are held up for months at a \ntime, causing our allies needless frustrations, in my view.\n  The process is so cumbersome for missile defense agreements and \nlicenses that it takes weeks to get an application approval for \nsomething as simple as permitting the British Ministry of Defense \nofficials to attend the Missile Defense Agency's annual conference we \nhave here in DC.\n  We are trying to bring a stroke of common sense in our cooperation \nwith our allies. There are cases, obviously, when more time is needed. \nSo the judgment can be applied by the Secretary of Defense, as well as \nthe Secretary of State, to use more time to determine the feasibility \nof extending licensing agreements to our allies.\n  What we are trying to reach is a proper balance. There are times when \nit is not necessary to delay this for extended times. Sometimes we may \ntake longer because of the type of technology we are dealing with. We \nare trying to have a proper balance so we can adequately protect our \ntechnical systems, defense systems, as well as to have a format out \nhere so we can work in an effective manner with our friends and allies.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3449 To Amendment No. 3322\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require that any plan for compensation to individuals in \nmilitary prisons in Iraq include provisions for compensation to former \n         prisoners of war held by the regime of Saddam Hussein)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title X, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1055. COMPENSATION FOR FORMER PRISONERS OF WAR.\n\n       Any plan of the Secretary of Defense to provide \n     compensation to an individual who was injured in a military \n     prison under the control of the United States in Iraq shall \n     include a provision to address the injuries suffered by the \n     17 citizens of the United States who were held as prisoners \n     of war by the regime of Saddam Hussein during the First Gulf \n     War.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. The \nSecretary of Defense, in testimony to Congress several weeks ago, said \nthat he is looking at ways to compensate the Iraqi nationals who were \nabused in American run prisons. I have no doubt that may be \nappropriate, but as the Defense Department considers its compensation \nplan, we should not forget about the American servicemen who were \ntortured and brutalized in this same prison, the Abu Ghraib prison, \nduring the first Gulf War. I know many of my colleagues will remember \nthe 17 American servicemen--including Colonel Jeff Tice from Las \nVegas--who were captured and subjected to weeks of torture, beatings, \nelectrocutions, starvation, and other despicable acts ordered by Saddam \nHussein and carried out by the Iraqi intelligence service.\n  The Federal Government, unfortunately, has turned its back on these \nheroes. Instead of working with them to deliver some means of \ncompensation for their many injuries,--in fact, the money at one time \nwas Saddam Hussein's money--the Bush administration has been \noutmaneuvering them at every turn, fighting them in court, moving to \nvacate earlier judgments they received, and trying to quash any efforts \nto bring them some relief. In fact, just last week the judgment was \nrescinded.\n  I regret to say that the Justice Department has been effective, \nprevailing on the American POWs in this recent court of appeals case. \nThe American POWs are back to square one. They have nothing except the \npermanent wounds which they suffered in Saddam's prisons.\n  My amendment says that as the Secretary develops the compensation \nplan for the Iraqi nationals, he also needs to include a provision \nwhich addresses the injuries suffered by brave American prisoners of \nwar. I don't know what the provision will say or should say, but the \nDefense Department cannot continue to turn its back on the brave men we \nsent into battle. I welcome their entry into this debate. They have \nbeen silent about this issue for too long. Nothing about this amendment \nprevents the Iraqis from being compensated; it just asks for some \nfairness. Our own brave service men and women are entitled to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before we started addressing the bill, the \nSenator from Nevada and I discussed this matter. I think we can work on \nthis one. But the other amendment--I do not recall your mentioning that \nyou were going to bring up a Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I did not specifically mention that. I said I would be \noffering an amendment. Senator Leahy will not be here until Wednesday, \nso he asked that I lay it down. He will not be in the Senate until \nWednesday. He has a personal situation that does not allow him to be \nhere until the day after tomorrow. He asked me last week to do this.\n  Mr. WARNER. So there will be no further addressing of that amendment \nuntil Wednesday.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Leahy will not be back until Wednesday.\n  Mr. WARNER. But you felt the necessity to it put it down now.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. He has been waiting around. He wanted to lay it down \nafter Senator Kennedy, but, of course, with the circumstances we have \nhad, he has been unable to do that. The only amendment I did discuss \nwith you was mine. I didn't discuss Senator Dodd's.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand. I discussed it with the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. REID. I thought we were trying to get some amendments down. Some \nof them, the managers will decide, along with the leadership, as to \nvotes that may even take place this evening. We can pick and choose \nwhat will be done with these other amendments. The only thing I \nmentioned to the distinguished chairman of the committee\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\nis that it is our understanding the junior Senator from Idaho is going \nto lay down an amendment, which we have no objection to his laying that \ndown, but we would not want to vote on that until there is a side-by-\nside with Senator Cantwell. That is the issue that has held up this \nbill for some time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished leader made that very \nclear to me. It is just the Leahy amendment which caught me somewhat \nunprepared. I would hope I would have a chance to look at it.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator is concerned, I would be happy to discuss \nthis prior to laying down any future amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would hope so.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Leahy has been very patient.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not suggesting that anyone else has been impatient. \nIt is just the first we have heard of it. I would hope to have, as a \nmatter of comity, an amendment from this side and an amendment from \nthat side, and we would go back and forth and not have too many up \nhere, gatekeepers to hold, have to lay them all aside seriatim.\n  Mr. REID. Maybe I should have waited until you offered one on the \nRepublican side before I offered mine.\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished leader and I have never had a problem \nwe could not work out. If this is a problem, we will work it out\n  Mr. REID. Our next amendment will be by the senior Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand. We are prepared to address that amendment. \nFor the moment, I will take a look at the Leahy amendment and figure \nout if there is a problem, and then I will bring it to the Senator's \nattention.\n  I turn now to the Senator from Colorado, his second-degree amendment. \nIs he prepared to address that?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I haven't had an opportunity to review \nthis particular amendment that I understand has just been laid down to \nmy amendment, and I need a little time to review that. I did have \nanother amendment that we are sharing with the other side, expecting \nthem to introduce another amendment. I am going to have to take some \ntime here and look at this particular amendment because I have not seen \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I fully understand that. So that we can then have the \nefficiency of time, perhaps the Senator from Connecticut could then \nmove to introduce his.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3312, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would be glad to. I am impressed by the \ndistinguished chairman's indulgence and patience as we wander through \nthis maze of amendments. I believe I have to ask unanimous consent to \nset aside the pending amendment, and I make such a request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3312 and send a \nmodification of that amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3312, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to provide reimbursement \nfor certain protective, safety, or health equipment purchased by or on \nbehalf of members of the Armed Forces for deployment in connection with \n Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom, or Operation Iraqi \n                                Freedom)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1068. REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN PROTECTIVE, SAFETY, OR \n                   HEALTH EQUIPMENT PURCHASED BY OR FOR MEMBERS OF \n                   THE ARMED FORCES FOR DEPLOYMENT IN OPERATIONS \n                   IN IRAQ AND CENTRAL ASIA.\n\n       (a) Reimbursement Required.--(1) Subject to subsections (c) \n     and (d), the Secretary of Defense shall reimburse a member of \n     the Armed Forces, or a person or entity referred to in \n     paragraph (2), for the cost (including shipping cost) of any \n     protective, safety, or health equipment that was purchased by \n     such member, or such person or entity on behalf of such \n     member, before or during the deployment of such member in \n     Operation Noble Eagle, Operation Enduring Freedom, or \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom for the use of such member in \n     connection with such operation if the unit commander of such \n     member certifies that such equipment was critical to the \n     protection, safety, or health of such member.\n       (2) A person or entity referred to in this paragraph is a \n     family member or relative of a member of the Armed Forces, a \n     non-profit organization, or a community group.\n       (b) Covered Protective, Safety, and Health Equipment.--(1) \n     Subject to paragraph (2), protective, safety, and health \n     equipment for which reimbursement shall be made under \n     subsection (a) shall include personal body armor, collective \n     armor or protective equipment (including armor or protective \n     equipment for high mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicles), \n     and items provided through the Rapid Fielding Initiative of \n     the Army such as the advanced (on-the-move) hydration system, \n     the advanced combat helmet, the close combat optics system, a \n     Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and a soldier \n     intercommunication device.\n       (2) Non-military equipment may be treated as protective, \n     safety, and health equipment for purposes of paragraph (1) \n     only if such equipment provides protection, safety, or health \n     benefits, as the case may be, such as would be provided by \n     equipment meeting military specifications.\n       (c) Limitations Regarding Date of Purchase of Equipment.--\n     (1) In the case of armor or protective equipment for high \n     mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicles (known as HUMVEEs), \n     reimbursement shall be made under subsection (a) only for \n     armor or equipment purchased during the period beginning on \n     September 11, 2001, and ending on July 31, 2004 or any date \n     thereafter as determined by the Secretary of Defense.\n       (2) In the case of any other protective, safety, and health \n     equipment, reimbursement shall be made under subsection (a) \n     only for equipment purchased during the period beginning on \n     September 11, 2001, and ending on December 31, 2003 or any \n     date thereafter as determined by the Secretary of Defense.\n       (d) Limitation Regarding Amount of Reimbursement.--The \n     aggregate amount of reimbursement provided under subsection \n     (a) for any protective, safety, and health equipment \n     purchased by or on behalf of any given member of the Armed \n     Forces may not exceed the lesser of--\n       (1) the cost of such equipment (including shipping cost); \n     or\n       (2) $1,100.\n       (e) Ownership of Equipment.--The Secretary may provide, in \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that the United \n     States shall assume title or ownership of any protective, \n     safety, or health equipment for which reimbursement is \n     provided under subsection (a).\n       (f) Funding.--Amounts for reimbursements under subsection \n     (a) shall be derived from amounts any amounts authorized to \n     be appropriated by this Act.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will go through and explain what this \namendment does. At the outset of my remarks, let me begin by commending \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, and Senator Levin of Michigan. The amendment I am \nraising here has been in many ways addressed by actions taken by the \nArmed Services Committee. I begin my comments by commending the \nchairman and the ranking member for the tremendous job they have done \nof improving what was a request by the administration in the area I am \ngoing to cover. I commend them as well for other matters but \nparticularly on this point.\n  Like all of my colleagues, without regard to party or ideology, we \nhave been concerned over the last number of months with the increasing \nnumber of reports that our men and women in uniform have had to dig \ndeep into their own pockets to pay for their own safety equipment. Most \ndisheartening have been the news accounts of men and women in uniform \nhaving to buy their own body armor here at home or having it bought for \nthem by their loved ones before they deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan or \nwhile they have been on duty.\n  There are stories like that of SPC Bill Palifka, a member of the \nConnecticut National Guard's 248th Engineering Company which was \nstationed in the west of Baghdad last year. He learned shortly before \ndeploying that his unit wouldn't have the interceptor vests that it \nneeded in order to be safe in Iraq. So his mother Pene, from East \nHartford, CN, went out and bought a vest for $1,100 from a private \ncompany.\n  These stories, unfortunately, have been all too common, as this chart \nshows. I brought up the news article from the New York Times, reported \njust 3 weeks ago, an article entitled ``Bulletproof Vests Collected To \nHelp A Son's Unit in Iraq.'' A New Jersey couple solicited donations of \nbody armor\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\nfrom the New Jersey City police so their son could lay down protecting \nvests on the floor of his Humvee, currently in Iraq. I quote:\n\n       Before his unit shipped from Kuwait to Iraq in March, First \n     Lt. Christian Boggiano, 23, made a special appeal to his \n     mother, Mary, by e-mail message. Please, he asked, scrounge \n     around for a few old police bulletproof vests and mail them \n     to [me]. ``Once I get up north, we'll use them on the doors \n     and floors of the Humvees so that when roadside bombs go off, \n     they'll catch a lot of shrapnel.''\n\n  This is what the young lieutenant wrote to his parents, a 2002 \ngraduate of West Point.\n  The Jersey Police Department and about 50 other police departments \nacross New Jersey came through for Lt. Boggiano.\n  His unit came through in ways our Government did not.\n  In my mind, no U.S. soldier should have to get his mother or father \nto help send body armor for his missions in Iraq. But people like Mr. \nand Mrs. Baggiano and the good citizens associated with New Jersey \npolice departments were driven to act. Why? Because there was a \ncritical need to fully equip our troops. Unfortunately, Lt. Baggiano is \nnot alone. A USA Today article recently reported on the village of \nFoley, AL, which held fundraisers, and eventually raised enough money \nto build and assemble their own protective steel armor for the Humvees \nof the AL National Guard's 711th Signal Battalion Charlie Company. That \ncommunity should be commended. But this situation seems ludicrous to \nme. Our troops and their loving neighbors should not be spending their \nown money to make sure our soldiers can have the protection they need.\n  For this reason, I am introducing an amendment today that will give \nour troops the support they deserve. My amendment will require the \nSecretary of Defense to reimburse soldiers, loved ones, and nonprofit \norganizations who have dug deep into their own pockets to provide our \ntroops with the equipment their Government should have provided them \nall along. This amendment will serve the health, safety, and protection \nof our soldiers, covering expenditures on items such as body armor, \nvehicle protection, hydration equipment, advanced combat helmets, and \nother gear needed to serve our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Not a day goes by when we don't hear of an incident in Iraq where a \nso-called ``improvised explosive device'' or IED, has detonated, \nkilling or maiming some of our brave men and women. At the outset of \nour post-war operations, it was reported that nearly one-quarter of \nAmerican troops serving in Iraq did not have ceramic plated body armor, \nwhich can stop bullets fired from assault rifles and shrapnel. It took \nmonths and hundreds of U.S. casualties before the administration \nfinally changed its priorities and decided to outfit all our deployed \ntroops with the most modern interceptor body armor, and to outfit their \nvehicles with protective armor.\n  In addition, according to the Army, soldiers have been spending \nupward of $300 per person on equipment to outfit themselves for war. In \nresponse, the Army established the ``Rapid Fielding Initiative'' \ndesigned to outfit our soldiers with the most modern equipment \navailable so that they do not have to spend their own money on the \nlatest combat helmets or hydration systems. With this program, our \nsoldiers--many of whom are less than the age of 21, making under \n$20,000 a year--will have the right gear for their mission, and they \nwon't have to dig deep into their own pockets to buy their own \nequipment. But unfortunately, not all of our soldiers in Iraq have \naccess to this program, because in the past, it hasn't been fully \nfunded. That needs to be remedied, and my amendment will make sure that \nour troops don't have to shell out their own money to get the Camelbak \nhydration systems, advanced combat helmets, and proper clothing they \nneed to do their jobs.\n  This chart shows what an average foot soldier is wearing in Iraq--60 \npounds of body armor plus tactical equipment in the hot desert heat, \nheavy Kevlar vests, high-tech GPS compass gear, special frame \nbackpacks, and other survival gear. In 120 degrees, carrying all of \nthis equipment becomes quite burdensome, and has made special hydration \nsystems necessary for our troops to safely survive the desert heat. \nWater-pack systems called Camelbaks are now being attached to soldiers' \nbackpacks, to allow them easy access to water even while they are in \npatrolling the streets of Iraq. And let's be honest about this. \nCamelbaks are no longer a matter of convenience. If a soldier has to \nstop moving to take out his canteen for a sip of water, he may be a \nsitting duck for a sniper or insurgent fire.\n  Unfortunately, with a shortage of funds, the Army cannot afford to \nequip all its soldiers with this kind of equipment, so many soldiers \nare still using bulky canteens that quickly heat up in the desert sun. \nMost of the canteens do not have adequate capacity to carry all the \nwater they need in Iraq's extreme heat. In other cases, soldiers are \npaying hundreds of dollars out of their own pocket to buy the equipment \nthemselves, everything ranging from these Camelbaks to radios, because, \nin spite of the Army's stated priorities, the administration did not \nprocure enough personal equipment for our fighting men and women. We \nneed to do better than this.\n  I want to commend the Armed Services Committee for recognizing the \nimportance of this program as well as that of critical body armor \nsystems. I was pleased to see the Senate Armed Services Committee \noverride the President's considerably low budget request for force \nprotection. Under the leadership of Senators Warner and Levin, the \nArmed Services Committee increased the Rapid Fielding Initiative from \nthe Bush administration's requested $57.2 million to $262 million. They \nalso demonstrated their usual good sense and further added to the \nPresident's considerably low-budget request for personal body armor and \narmored vehicles. The Army told Congress the President's budget was \nshortchanging them by $295 million in interceptor body armor. And the \nMarines said they would be short $16.6 million if the Bush budget were \nto prevail. In spite of the President's proposals, the committee fully \nfunded those programs.\n  In addition, $905 million was put toward the Stryker armored vehicles \nthat are already proving valuable in military operations in Iraq. \nAlmost $1.1 billion, an increase of $927 million over the President's \nproposed budget, was used to accelerate procurement of up-armored \nhumvees, as well as add-on ballistic armor for medium and heavy trucks, \nto protect our troops on patrol in hostile environments. As a result of \nthese provisions, critical resources will be sent to our troops to \nenhance their safety while in harm's way.\n  I applaud these efforts. I know some of my colleagues will suggest \nthat because the committee has now funded these programs, my amendment \nis unnecessary. Or, as I have already been hearing, perhaps they will \nsay that we are encouraging our troops to go out and buy new equipment \nsince we'll just reimburse them in the end. I have the official DOD \nposition paper with talking points opposing my amendment. I would like \nto address each of the issues raised, point by point.\n\n  First, DOD says, ``the amendment may not support the purchase of the \nproper equipment. The DOD spends millions to test and procure the \nneeded protective, safety, and health equipment for our service \nmembers. The DOD will have no way of knowing what testing personally \nprocured items went through or whether the equipment is effective.'' \nThis seems to be an unreasonable argument. In spite of the millions DOD \nspent on testing equipment, the fact remains that they failed to outfit \nour soldiers with the gear they needed. The Department acknowledged as \nmuch, saying that our soldiers did not receive enough personal body \narmor until January of this year and will still not have adequately \narmored vehicles until July. In my modified amendment, we say that a \nsoldier's company commander has the discretion to decide which \nprotective gear would be appropriate for reimbursement. These \ncommanders on the ground know our soldiers' needs the most. And it \nmakes sense for them to be the ones determining what equipment the \nsoldiers lacked when they headed over to Iraq and Afghanistan. This \naddresses another concern DOD seems to have that my amendment is \nsomehow too broad--this amendment says that if and only if a soldier \npurchased an item that he absolutely\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nneeded, according to the most knowledgeable soldiers in the field, he \nwill be reimbursed for that item.\n  DOD's talking points also suggest that my amendment will encourage \nservice members and their loved ones to purchase equipment on their own \noutside this accountability with the exception of receiving future \nreimbursement.'' That is absolutely misleading.\n  This amendment only applies to purchases made during finite periods, \nand by the Army's own admission they had not provided adequate supplies \nto our troops. This amendment only applies to purchases for personal \nbody armor and other safety equipment that can be made only for the \nperiod between September 11, 2001, and December 31, 2003. For purchases \nto provide Humvee protection, claims can be made only for the period of \nSeptember 11, 2001, and July 31, 2004.\n  We allow an exception to that if the Army decides they will have all \nthe necessary equipment by these dates. If for some reason they are \nunable to do it, we do not need to come back with another amendment. It \nseems to me we ought to leave it up to the military people to decide. \nIf they are not able to meet the dates, then they have authority to \nreimburse later. I leave that up to them to avoid any future need of \ntalking about this issue on the floor of the Senate. We are dealing \nwith finite periods. It is the field commanders who make the decisions.\n  Finally, to address the charge my amendment sets an unmanageable \nprecedent that the DOD claims will saddle the Department of Defense \nwith an open-ended financial burden, we also modified the amendment to \nset a $1,100 cap on money that can be reimbursed for purchases made on \nbehalf of any one individual. I was going to make it $1,000. I changed \nit to $1,100. Candidly, a family in Connecticut paid $1,100 for the \nvest their child needed while in combat. So we made the cap at that \nlevel. I believe, therefore, my colleagues will find this proposal more \nreasonable and, most importantly, necessary. It is a finite period of \ntime, there are individual caps on the amount that can be reimbursed, \nfield commanders would make the decision, and any extension of time \nwould have to come from a unilateral decision by the Department of \nDefense.\n  I think it is reasonable. If people went out, such as my constituents \nor in communities in New Jersey or towns in Alabama and provided \nadditional protection for our service men and women, the very least, it \nseems to me, we can do is reimburse their individual soldiers, their \nfamilies, or the organizations that provided that protection.\n  I, again, think we all understand how these things can happen. \nCertainly, there should have been better preparation to see to it these \nyoung men and women would have all the protection necessary, but for a \nvariety of reasons, which we do not need to pore over, they were not. \nAnd by the Department of the Army's own admission, we were not able to \nprovide that body armor until December 31 of last year. So there is a \ngap of almost 2 years where people were acquiring that equipment, and \nup until July of this year, the Humvee protections will not be in \nplace.\n  I do not think it is asking too much during a finite period of time \nfor a limited amount of money, where field commanders make the \ndecisions, that we cannot say to these families: Show us the proof of \nwhat you paid for this equipment, let the field commanders decide, and \nif you meet those tests, then your Government is going to say you \nshould not have to dish out money from your own pockets, particularly \nwhen we are talking about 21-year-old kids making $20,000 a year, where \nthey may have invested $1,000 in decent vests to protect from IEDs and \nother attacks occurring on the dangerous streets of Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  I believe this is a reasonable proposal we have offered. If we fail \nto adopt this amendment, I believe my colleagues and I will once again \nbe forced to answer tough questions, as we all do, when we go back and \nmeet our returning soldiers from the Guard and Reserve and their \nfamilies in our respective States.\n  At every meeting I have had in the State of Connecticut with families \nof men and women serving in Iraq, this issue has come up: Why are we \nnot providing the protection these men deserve?\n  I, along with General Cugno, my National Guard commander in \nConnecticut, tried to address these questions of how these things \nhappen. I told him we would make an effort to see that any costs they \nincurred of these items would be reimbursed. They believe that is the \nright thing to do. I hope my colleagues do as well.\n  I know money is tight this year. We are facing enormous budget \ndeficits. Again, I commend my friends and colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee. Mr. President, they have done a very good job in \nbeefing up the numbers that otherwise come from the Department of \nDefense and the White House, and by adding additional resources, they \nhave made it possible to do this.\n  The amendment provides Secretary of Defense discretion to determine \nfrom which accounts moneys will be sought to reimburse our soldiers. \nOne obvious place from which these moneys could be drawn is the $2.5 \nbillion contingency fund that was added by the Warner amendment a few \ndays ago as part of the $25 billion supplemental for operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  That is my argument. That is the amendment. My hope is we will be \nable to adopt it without much fanfare. It seems to be a reasonable \nrequest to make on behalf of our men and women in uniform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleague. Let me say at the \noffset, he has been most cooperative in working on this amendment, and \nhe recognizes the concerns the Department of Defense had and the staff \nfor the majority had. We have determined that the Senator has met each \nand every one of those concerns with a modification to his original \namendment. So I am prepared to indicate acceptance of that amendment, \nbut I wish to engage the Senator from Connecticut in a short colloquy.\n  This is a most unusual type of situation, Mr. President. We had the \ncall-up of a number of reservists, units put together rather hurriedly \nin some instances. As the Department of Defense--most specifically the \nArmy--stated, some errors were made, but I do not believe, as I \nlistened very carefully to the Senator's presentation, that the total \nnumber of errors is very large.\n  I do not find that it was a widespread situation. I say that only to \nindicate to the American public that following that unusual type of \namendment, which is necessary and we are prepared to accept it, but I \ndo not want to leave the impression with the American public that our \ncommander, starting with the Commander in Chief, the President, sent \nmen and women into harm's way where there was a widespread lacking of \nthe necessary equipment to give them the protections needed.\n  The concept of the use of body armor has been evolving over the \nyears. It is now proven to have been very successful in the operations \nin Afghanistan and Iraq. The orders the Army had placed somewhat fell \nshort, as the Senator said, over a period of time last fall. \nOur committee, indeed the other means of financing--I think some of the \nmoney in the supplemental that the Congress has adopted went to provide \nthe necessary funds, but it was not a widespread situation. I think the \nSenator would concur with me on that point; would he not?\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I certainly do \nnot disagree. I do not know the numbers myself. Others may have more \ndetailed information. We know there were some large stories--I do not \nhave all of them here. There have been widespread reports of it.\n  I accept in part what my colleague has said, that it would be \nunnecessary for massive amounts of this kind of armor. There was an \nanticipation about a different reception after the military victory in \nIraq. We discovered otherwise. Of course, somebody argued we should \nhave anticipated that. Nonetheless, there was concern.\n  I am not prepared to make a case here that this is terribly \nwidespread. I do not know that. I do know there were enough examples of \nit that I thought it warranted an issue.\n  I point out, again--I say this to my friend and Senator Levin as \nwell--my colleagues have done a terrific job. There is a difference in \nthis budget between what was sent and what the\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\ncommittee is asking us to support when it comes to these issues, and \nthe significant increase, from $57 million to $262 million for buying \nadditional equipment, is a significant amount of money. I commend both \nSenators for doing that.\n  There were other areas where additional resources were provided by \nthe committee that were not otherwise requested by the DOD. I applaud \nmy colleagues for that. I do not know what the numbers reflect in terms \nof widespread use. The committee did a very good job, and, as I said at \nthe outset, I commend you immensely for having recognized this issue \nand jumped into the void so that today it looks as though, based on \nassessments, by July 31 of this year the issue involving the Humvees \nwill be addressed, and back in December of last year the issue looks as \nif it was addressed in terms of body armor. So we cover those periods \nwhere there apparently was a lack of resources.\n  I do not think the issue would have come to closure if it had not \nbeen for the Senator from Virginia, and I also say this to my colleague \nfrom Michigan. It made a significant difference, and I thank my \ncolleagues immensely on behalf of my constituents and literally \nthousands of soldiers serving in dangerous places.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his statement. I would like to \naddress the Humvees because our committee had a special session on that \nissue. We should understand the Humvee was designed at the time to meet \nthe array of weaponry and other types of threats to it.\n  The proliferation, primarily in the campaign in Iraq, of the use of \nburied munitions in the roadway activated by a series of electronic \nways, or hand operated, this proposed a challenge because the explosion \ncame up beneath the vehicle. I think in a timely way we started to \naddress that by putting armor on certainly the Humvees and leaving \nothers without armor. One might ask: Well, why is that? It is because \nonce the armor is added, the maneuverability of the particular vehicle \nthat is armored becomes quite limited and that limits its tactical \nrole.\n  Consequently, the Army thought, and I agree with the Army on this, \nthey needed inventories of both armored and unarmored Humvees. It got \nto be a misperception across the land that we were not providing \nadequate armor for our men and women when, in fact, we were, but we had \nto have the two different inventories and, depending on which vehicle \nwas being used in an operation, problems could arise.\n  So I am prepared on this side to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, but I had hoped, if he \nwould not object, we could ask for a rollcall vote because we will be \nlooking to vote anyway, and this would help the conference as a whole. \nI know we want to move things along.\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly the Senator has a right to request it.\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to respect my friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was wondering if, as we go further into the afternoon, \ndepending on the number of votes, we could vitiate the vote, although I \nrecognize the Senator has a perfect right to ask for the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. That is a reasonable request. I will ask for one and we can \nvitiate it later.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a prudent way to proceed.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Dodd amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now we will turn to this side of the aisle for an \namendment and then come back to the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today with the intention of \ncalling up amendment No. 3223 to S. 2400, but rather than calling up \nthat amendment, since my intention was to withdraw it, I will make a \nfew comments on it.\n  I preface my comments by stating something to which no Member of the \nSenate will disagree, and that is that the way our Nation uses the \nReserve components of the U.S. military has fundamentally changed over \nthe last 15 years. Reserve components have changed from a ``force in \nreserve'' to an absolutely essential component of the warfight. Almost \nevery operation the military engages in today, and career field in the \nArmy, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are represented by our Guard \nand our Reserve.\n  The Reserve components are now and continue to become a true \noperational reserve without which our military cannot operate. This is \nreflected primarily in the rate of deployments and mobilizations of the \nReserve components. This rate of utilization, which has increased three \nor fourfold over the last decade, necessitates that we reexamine the \nway we manage the Reserve.\n  The Department of Defense has made changes in this area by improving \nthe process of training and equipping the Reserve and supporting \nchanges in personnel policies that improve quality of life for members \nof our Reserve.\n\n  I would say with respect to that, last year in the Defense \nauthorization bill we made some changes. Some of them seemed fairly \nminimal, such as allowing our Guard and Reserve members, while they \nwere not on active duty, to have access to commissaries. This seemingly \ninnocent act on our part was a huge benefit to our Guard and Reserve \nmembers who had the availability of commissaries when they were on \nactive duty, but now they have it full time. Particularly, those who \nare close to military installations have the availability of services \nthey simply did not have before, and it has been a huge morale booster \nfor our Guard and Reserve members.\n  With the possible exception of the TRICARE issue, though, the changes \nthat we have made have been at the margins. I believe we need to \nreexamine the personnel policies for the Reserve components based on \nthe fact that the way we use them has fundamentally changed.\n  As the chairman of the Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on \nPersonnel and co-chairman of the Senate Reserve Caucus, this is an \nissue I have wrestled with considerably and want to be sure that we \naccount for as we provide oversight of the personnel policies of the \nDepartment of Defense.\n  My amendment follows closely a bill that my colleague from Georgia, \nSenator Zell Miller, introduced several months ago. I, along with \nSenators Cochran, DeWine, Murkowski, Collins, and Ben Nelson, joined \nSenator Miller in cosponsoring this bill. My amendment would lower the \nage at which members of the Reserve component could collect retirement \npay based on the philosophy of a reduced annuity. The amount of \nretirement pay would be reduced by a small percentage for each year \nbelow the age of 60 that a member chose to collect their retirement--\nvery similar to the way Social Security benefits are reduced if a \nbeneficiary determines they want to retire following the achievement of \nage 62.\n  According to CBO, this provision would cost approximately $5 billion \nover 5 years.\n  There are several other bills pending before the Senate that would \nchange the retirement plan for reservists. In fact, I understand the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine, may introduce an amendment this \nweek that would reduce the age at which members of the Reserve could \ncollect retirement from age 60 to age 55 with no corresponding \nreduction in the annuity. According to CBO, this amendment would cost \nmore than $8 billion over 5 years.\n  The Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, has also introduced a bill \nthat would reduce the age to 55 but require a reservist to stay in the \nReserve longer in order to receive pay earlier.\n  All of these bills have merit. All of them deserve to be debated. \nHowever, all of them, including my own, carry a significant financial \ncost. What we have to do is try to balance, particularly in the middle \nof a war that we are now engaged in, whether we want to utilize our \nfunds to provide weapons systems to our men and women who are now in \nharm's way or whether we want to provide this kind of benefit which was \nnot anticipated in the budget.\n  As I stand here today, there are three studies currently underway to \naddress the issue of Reserve retirement. As I have already stated, \nthere are many good ideas regarding how the retirement benefit for the \nReserve and the\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nGuard should be changed, and they all have merit.\n  However, there are two important things about these various options \nthat we do not know. The first is we do not have a firm idea of how \nmuch any of these options will cost. We have estimates from CBO to \nwhich I have already alluded. They are significant. Costing these \nvarious proposals requires predicting the way people are going to \nbehave, and this is an inexact, difficult science.\n  Secondly, anytime one makes even a small change to something as large \nand complex as the military personnel process, it changes the entire \nsystem. A change in the Reserve retirement system will have effects \nboth on the Reserve and Active-Duty retention, recruiting, and \npromotion opportunities within the ranks which we cannot foresee \nwithout examining the associated impacts very closely.\n\n  That is why, even though I have introduced an amendment on this \nissue, I do not believe that now is the best time to act on the issue. \nI think we should wait until the three reports currently underway are \ncompleted and we have additional data upon which to look at this issue \nand make a better evaluation.\n  With this in mind, as I said earlier, I am simply not going to offer \nmy amendment today. Once we have the necessary data to show how the \nvarious proposals will impact the force and the cost implications, I \nlook forward to revisiting this issue and dialoguing with the other \nSenators who have introduced bills or amendments on this issue and \nthose who are concerned, as I am, about how we manage our Reserve \ncomponents.\n  There is no more important issue facing the Personnel Subcommittee of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee than how we treat our men and women \nin uniform, and their families, because every day this is more a family \nissue and a family-oriented military. It is my hope that as we proceed \nwith this bill over this week and as the committee entertains the \nlegislation and policy changes in the coming months, that we keep the \npeople at the receiving end of our decisions and deliberations foremost \nin our minds.\n  We will continue to include the members of the Reserve components in \nthose deliberations and ensure the Senate adopts policies that work to \ntheir advantage, that are fiscally responsible, and that recognize the \nsignificant changes that have taken place in the Reserve over the past \ndecade and a half.\n  I thank my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Ben Nelson, for \nhis cooperation and his work as we have moved through the Personnel \nSubcommittee process over the last year in preparation for this bill. \nSenator Nelson feels the same way I do about our Guard and Reserve and \nwas a cosponsor of a number of the amendments to which I have alluded.\n  I also thank the chairman and the ranking member. We have had \ndialogues about this issue within our committee, and without their \nsupport, guidance, and counsel, we would not be at the point we are \nwith respect to quality-of-life issues that our men and women in both \nthe Guard and the Reserve deserve and ultimately will receive once we \nenter into the budget process at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3305\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 3305, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for a number of months I have been working \nwith colleagues on both sides of the aisle--Senator Collins from Maine, \nSenator Stevens, Senator Warner--to try to get more oversight over the \nbillions of dollars worth of contracts that have been and are being let \nto rebuild Iraq. I come to the floor today to offer an amendment with \nmy colleague and friend, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota. We have \ndiscussed this amendment with Senator Levin and Senator Warner.\n  What Senator Dorgan and I have found is a shocking system of so-\ncalled oversight with respect to the use of taxpayers' dollars. With \nthe nation facing rising deficits and scarce federal dollars for our \nmany problems here at home, it is imperative that there be strong \noversight over the use of taxpayers' money. What our amendment deals \nwith is literally the outsourcing of the oversight of the billions of \ndollars worth of contracts to rebuild Iraq. It sounds incredible, but \nthe heart of the problem is, instead of having Federal employees \noversee these billions of dollars worth of contracts to rebuild Iraq, \nthe Department of Defense has outsourced the oversight of these huge \ncontracts to private companies. These companies are ``overseeing'' the \nwork of other private companies. If many of these companies didn't \nalready have joint ventures elsewhere or interlocking financial \ninterests or boards of directors, I guess one could plausibly say this \nwould be acceptable. But that has not been the case. Putting these \ncompanies in charge of oversight of one another strikes Senator Dorgan \nand me as simply an invitation to flagrant fraud, waste and abuse of \ntaxpayer money.\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\n  Senator Dorgan is here as well, and I want to give him ample time to \ndiscuss this, but I would like to give a brief example of the kind of \nproblem we seek to address in our legislation. The Parsons Company won \ntwo separate Defense Department oversight contracts that totaled nearly \n$72 million. Under each of those contracts, it overseas the Fluor \nCompany in Iraq. At the same time, Fluor and Parsons have a $2.6 \nbillion joint venture ongoing in Kazakhstan.\n  The question is, with such a significant shared financial interest, \nhow in the world is anybody in a situation like that going to have a \nreal incentive to take out a sharp pencil and protect the taxpayers.\n  We are talking about vast sums of money. $18 billion has been \nallocated by the Congress for reconstruction, and thus far 17 contracts \nhave been let: 10 for reconstruction and 7 for overseeing the \nreconstruction. I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia for his \ncooperation on this amendment. As I discussed with him, this amendment \nbuilds on the work that I was able to do in cooperation with Senator \nDorgan and Senator Collins on the issue of no-bid contracts in Iraq. \nThis amendment establishes that oversight and the protection of the \ntaxpayers' interests in these billions of dollars of contracts, is a \nGovernment function. It is not something that can be outsourced. This \namendment will prohibit companies with interlocking financial interests \nfrom ``overseeing'' one another.\n  We talk often about giving the fox the opportunity to oversee the \nhenhouse. This is a textbook case of just such a situation.\n  I mentioned to the distinguished chairman of the committee, the \nSenator from Virginia, and the ranking member of the committee, the \nSenator from Michigan, that this boils down to a simple issue of \ncommonsense. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. Senator Dorgan \nand I are pursuing this as a commonsense issue--oversight should not be \noutsourced, particularly when the projects to be reviewed involve \nbillions of taxpayer dollars. What's worse--these are cost-plus-plus \ncontracts. The contractors here get any unforeseen costs, plus they are \neligible for a bonus. Essentially, these contractors are rewarded if \nthe folks they oversee perform well. But who evaluates how well those \nfolks perform? The oversight contractors. Clearly, there are some \nperverse incentives at work in these oversight contracts.\n  We are talking about cost-plus-plus contracts that involve billions \nof taxpayers' dollars. It seems to me we have to get the oversight back \nwhere it belongs, and that is in the hands of the Department of Defense \nand not in the hands of the private contractors. Oversight is \ninherently a governmental function because accountability must be first \nand foremost to taxpayers.\n  I see my friend and colleague from North Dakota here. I want to yield \ntime to him. But in wrapping up this portion of my remarks, I would \nlike to express my appreciation to the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, and to the chairman of the committee, Senator Warner. This \namendment, in fact, builds on some of the earlier work we have tried to \ndo in a bipartisan fashion. It essentially comes about because, as \nSenator Dorgan and I have gone forward to try to make sure taxpayers' \ninterests are protected, we found a massive loophole, a loophole that \nwe think nobody in the Senate confronted in the past, that allows for \nprivate companies to oversee other private companies, even when they \nhave what strikes us as very serious potential conflicts of interest.\n  So we are looking forward, with Chairman Warner and Ranking Member \nLevin's cooperation, to have this amendment accepted. I believe it \nwarrants bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have looked this over and I am of the \nopinion that it can be eventually accepted. I am wondering if the \ncolleagues would just allow the Chair to put in a quorum call for no \nmore than 5 minutes, and then I will be right back to the floor to \naddress this amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, it was my intention to speak in favor of \nthe amendment prior to that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am very anxious to hear that. My requirement is to \ndepart the floor to check on something and I will be right back.\n  Mr. DORGAN. At which point I would be recognized?\n  Mr. WARNER. Absolutely. I have no objection to that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am agreeable to that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I now understand that the amendment will \nbe accepted in due course, but I am anxious to hear the perspectives of \nthe other cosponsor. I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I join my colleague, Senator Wyden, in \nworking on this amendment.\n  Let me say first that, as many know, I did not support the funding \nfor reconstruction projects in Iraq with American taxpayers' money. My \nfeeling was, if we were going to use American taxpayers' money to build \nchildren's hospitals and restore marshland and swampland, or to \npurchase garbage trucks, or to have a roads or jobs program, it ought \nto be done in this country--not Iraq. I felt strongly that the ability \nto fund the reconstruction in Iraq could easily come from Iraq oil.\n  It is true they are not pumping quite as much as they had anticipated \nby July 1 or June 1 of this year, but it is also true that the price is \nnear double what they expected--359 million barrels a day, which is \nwhat they intend to get. They will have a substantial amount of excess \nincome over that which they need for Iraq and could easily pay for the \nreconstruction of Iraq. It is estimated that $160 billion in a 10-year \nperiod is the export value of Iraqi oil generated for the country of \nIraq. But, nonetheless, the administration and a majority in the Senate \nand the Congress decided that U.S. taxpayers should fund the \nreconstruction in Iraq.\n  The only cut in the reconstruction proposal of some $20-plus \nbillion--the only cut in expenditures of that proposal--was offered by \nSenator Wyden and myself. We cut $1.8 billion from it with an amendment \non the floor of the Senate which included cutting $100 million for \ngasoline that was being transported.\n  Incidentally, I held a hearing on that in the policy committee. We \nhad the person who was in charge of delivering gasoline from the \nDepartment of Defense to projects such as this, and he said that the \ncontract for the delivery of gasoline into Iraq was costing $1 more a \ngallon than would have been delivered into Iraq by the agency in the \nDepartment of Defense which normally does that.\n  Having said all that--pointing out we were the only ones cutting \nfunding for the reconstruction projects--the Congress still passed that \nreconstruction project of nearly $18 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds for \nthe reconstruction in Iraq.\n  My concern--and I think the concern expressed by my colleague from \nOregon--is that money be spent effectively and wisely and not wasted. \nIf it is going to be spent--and I did not think this was the way to do \nit--but if it is going to be done, let us make sure it is not wasted.\n  The Pentagon announced that it wants to fund it and has already \nsigned and implemented contracts to fund $121 million for outsourcing \nthe oversight of these reconstruction contracts.\n  There is plenty going on in Iraq that ought to give us pause with \nrespect to contractors. This is not a reconstruction contract. But you \nknow what we know now about the Halliburton corporation charging the \nFederal Government for 42,000 meals a day and serving 14,000 meals a \nday to our soldiers. Let me say that again: charging for 42,000 meals a \nday which they say they delivered to U.S. soldiers when in fact they \nwere delivering 14,000 meals a day and missing 28,000 meals somewhere.\n  There is plenty of reason to be concerned about contractors that are \nengaged in that kind of behavior.\n  With respect to these series of contracts for $129 million, they have \nselected corporations, they have already\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\nsigned the contracts. The taxpayers, much to our chagrin, are obligated \nto pay these contracts. They have signed the contracts with companies \nthat have inherent conflicts, in my judgment. How do you oversee a \ncontract of another company with whom you already have an established \nbusiness relationship in another contract? I don't know how you do \nthat. Yet these contracts were signed and sealed and delivered and the \ntaxpayer is on the hook for $129 million.\n\n  I happen to think ``oversight'' is a responsibility of the \nGovernment, of the Federal agency that is going to spend the money. It \nis their responsibility to provide oversight, not someone else's \nresponsibility. The saying is, ``The buck stops here.'' Where does it \nstop? It stops, it seems to me, with the Federal agency that is given \nthe funding by this Congress. It is their requirement to provide \noversight to make sure that funding is used in a manner that is \nappropriate.\n  In this case, the Defense Department has said, no, we are not going \nto do that. We are going to contract out oversight responsibilities. \nNow I understand they are saying, well, it is not oversight. Really? \nThat is what the provisional authority calls it. In writing, these are \noversight contracts for $129 million. There ought not be oversight that \nis contracted out. It is a responsibility of the Federal agency.\n  This chart shows some of the relationships of the companies, \ncompanies that are overseeing other companies. I don't intend to say \nwith this chart these are bad companies. I intend to say a company that \nhas a relationship with another company, a business, a contractual \nrelationship, a financial relationship that is now told to oversee the \nwork of this company, even though you have other interests and other \nfinancial arrangements with this company, I am saying there is an \ninherent conflict there. That is not the way to do oversight. Even if \nthese potential conflicts did not exist, I would not support these \ncontracts. Oversight is not the responsibility of a hired gun \nsomeplace. It is the responsibility of the Federal agency.\n  Senator Wyden and I have offered a relatively simple amendment. We \nwould have offered an amendment that strikes or nullifies those \ncontracts, but we have been told to do so still leaves the Federal \nGovernment on the hook. That does not make much sense. It seems to me \nwhat we ought to do is make sure this does not happen again.\n  The amendment we are offering says oversight is a government \nresponsibility, first and foremost. We establish that principle. \nSecond, we say these oversight contracts shall not be renewed. And \nthird, it says the Pentagon cannot award such contracts in the future.\n  We have provided a couple of exceptions where we think it is \nimpossible for them to do anything other than have some narrow \ncontracts where it is required, but generally speaking, the approach \nthe Pentagon has used would be prevented prospectively by the amendment \nwe now offer.\n  Again, our original proposal would have terminated all these \ncontracts outright. I prefer that be the case. These contracts, as I \nunderstand it, would still obligate the American taxpayers, and are \nenforceable. I think that is an approach we cannot get through.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, yes, the Senator has very \ncarefully recrafted the amendment. That is the reason we will be able \nto accept it on this side.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate the Senator's point and the cooperation of \nthe Chairman and Senator Levin.\n  It is also clear if anyone tries to renew any of the old contracts \nwhich we sought to set aside, they would have to meet the new conflict-\nof-interest standards established in our amendment, is that correct?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I say to my colleague from Oregon, that is correct. Our \napproach is simple. We think there are so many billions of dollars \nricocheting around on reconstruction with respect to Iraq that there is \na profound opportunity for waste. I don't think anyone in this Chamber \nwants money wasted. We all want good oversight. We want good \nstewardship of the taxpayers' funds. We do not believe that is the case \nwhen inherent conflicts of interest result. That is the purpose of our \noffering this amendment.\n  Let me again say the Senator from Oregon, Senator Wyden, not just on \nthis issue but on the other issues relating to the $1.8 billion in \nspending cuts we got done with our joint amendment, does extraordinary \nwork in this area. I appreciate the opportunity to work with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend our colleagues from Oregon and \nNorth Dakota for this amendment. They have put their finger on a very \nsignificant problem in Iraq which is symptomatic. They would be the \nfirst to acknowledge this is a deeper problem. That is, we have reduced \nthe number of our acquisition workforce.\n  The chairman of the committee and other members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, including myself, every year for the past I don't know how \nmany years have been to conference with the House of Representatives. \nThey have tried and successfully achieved reduction to the acquisition \nworkforce despite our opposition to those efforts. They have made major \ncuts in the acquisition workforce. They call it bureaucracy. We have \nfought against some of the cuts. We have been able to reduce the size \nof the cuts. Nonetheless, over time, there have been significant \nreductions in the acquisition workforce, including people to oversee \ncontracts, which is what we are talking about here.\n  Our good friends from Oregon and North Dakota have identified a real \nproblem. I congratulate the Senators for doing it. It is a problem \nreflective of a deeper problem we have now in the Defense Department.\n  There has been an amendment offered by Senator Byrd which we have \naccepted which gradually increases the size of the acquisition \nworkforce. That would help get to the underlying systemic cause of this \nproblem. We are going to go to conference, hoping we will be able to \nadd some people to our acquisition workforce who can do the very \noversight which is so essential to avoid the very conflicts of interest \nwhich the two Senators have identified.\n  The fact that the Byrd amendment has been adopted and we have added \npeople on this side will put us in a better position, as well as this \namendment, of course, of the Senators from Oregon and North Dakota.\n  I commend them. It will help us not simply to hopefully avoid this \nkind of absurd situation where nongovernmental employees are overseeing \nthe operations of Government contracts, frequently with inherent \nconflicts of interest involved, but where we are going to be able to \ncure the cause of this situation as well on a long-term basis.\n  I commend them and thank them for the modifications they have made \nwhich I think will put us in a stronger position to defend this action \nin conference.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this side is prepared to accept this \namendment.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield the floor and thank the distinguished chairman and \nSenator Levin.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the amendment be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3305) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see my distinguished colleague from Connecticut and I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3313, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. I call up amendment 3313 and I send a modification to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mrs. Feinstein proposes an amendment numbered \n     3313, as modified.\n\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\n\n  The amendment (No. 3313), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the use of contractors for certain Department of \n  Defense activities and to establish limitations on the transfer of \n           custody of prisoners of the Department of Defense)\n\n       On page 195, between lines 10 and 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 868.

Mr. President, I wonder if we could ask the Senator from \nConnecticut if we could temporarily lay this matter to one side while \nwe finish processing the amendment by the Senator from Colorado? It \nwould take but a few minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this point in time--\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have sent the modification to the desk.

I thank the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see the Senator from Colorado. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3449\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have an amendment that we have laid \naside. I guess the proper thing is we need to call it up for \nconsideration. The reason I am calling it up is because our staffs have \nworked this out. There is a second-degree amendment that was offered by \nSenator Reid on behalf of Senator Levin. We have worked out an \nagreement, I understand, between the staffs, and I know the chairman \nwould like to expedite and move forward and not leave these amendments \nhanging out there.\n  So I call up that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator request the regular order \nwith respect to the amendment?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes, I request the regular order on that amendment, \nplease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Now, I think Senator Levin has to be recognized to move \nthe modification forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3449, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, has our modification to the second-degree \namendment been sent to the desk yet? We will send up a modification to \nthe second-degree amendment, and then I understand, as modified, \nSenator Allard will be accepting the second-degree.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment, No. 3449, as modified, is \npending.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 1069. POLICY ON NONPROLIFERATION OF BALLISTIC MISSILES.\n\n       (a) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     develop, support, and strengthen international accords and \n     other cooperative efforts to curtail the proliferation of \n     ballistic missiles and related technologies which could \n     threaten the territory of the United States, allies and \n     friends of the United States, and deployed members of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States with weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (A) Certain countries are seeking to acquire ballistic \n     missiles and related technologies that could be used to \n     attack the United States or place at risk United States \n     interests, forward-deployed members of the Armed Forces, and \n     allies and friends of the United States.\n       (B) Certain countries continue to actively transfer or sell \n     ballistic missile technologies in contravention of standards \n     of behavior established by the United States and allies and \n     friends of the United States.\n       (C) The spread of ballistic missiles and related \n     technologies worldwide has been slowed by a combination of \n     national and international export controls, forward-looking \n     diplomacy, and multilateral interdiction activities to \n     restrict the development and transfer of such weapons and \n     technologies.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the United States should vigorously pursue foreign \n     policy initiatives aimed at eliminating, reducing, or \n     retarding the proliferation of ballistic missiles and related \n     technologies; and\n       (B) the United States and the international community \n     should continue to support and strengthen established \n     international accords and other cooperative efforts, \n     including United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540 and \n     the Missile Technology Control Regime, that are designed to \n     eliminate, reduce, or retard the proliferation of ballistic \n     missiles and related technologies.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, very briefly--and I thank Senator Allard \nand our staffs for working this out--we have expressed some real \nconcerns in terms of the proliferation challenges in terms of the \nballistic missile technology which is at issue.\n  Technology can be called defensive technology, but it also can be \nused offensively. The line between offensive and defensive missile \ntechnology is not a perfect line and, indeed, some of the technologies \nare both offensive and defensive. So it is important that the concerns \nwe had expressed, and do express, in our second-degree amendment \nrelative to the technology and the proliferation of these technologies \nbe expressed in the underlying amendment, and that would remain.\n  What we have removed from our second-degree amendment is the \nelimination of what amounts to, I guess, that 30-day either goal or \ndeadline,\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\nwhich is waiveable by the Secretary of State. So what we have in our \nsecond-degree amendment now, as modified, is that we have left that 30-\nday goal in place--and Senator Allard had it in his amendment--but the \nefforts to try to address some of the proliferation concerns will \nremain in the second-degree amendment.\n  I understand, as modified, that Senator Allard is willing to accept \nthe second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes.\n  Madam President, if I could be recognized briefly, we did have some \nexceptions in that to be sensitive to your concerns about the 30-day \nportion. In the judgment of the Secretary of State, they could extend \nthat if they believe that is necessary. There is also a paragraph in \nhere that was adopted on policy to address some of your concerns about \nproliferation and whatnot. Hopefully, we met those concerns.\n  I think this is a good compromise. I thank the Senator from Michigan \nfor working with me and our staff over here and for your staff working \ntogether with us. I think now that we have resolved this matter we can \nmove forward on the amendment.\n  Now, Madam President, have we adopted the modification?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification has been made.\n  The amendment is pending.\n  The question is on agreeing to the second-degree amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3449), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3322, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the Allard \namendment, as amended.\n  The amendment, as amended, is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 3322), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3313, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we now be \nallowed to debate amendment No. 3313, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. DODD. Thank you, Madam President. And, again, I commend my two \nfriends and colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Let me briefly describe what this amendment is and what we try to do.\n  This amendment attempts to address what I believe is a very \nlegitimate and serious concern that has come to light in recent days \nwith respect to the use or misuse of contractors in the treatment of \ndetainees in Iraq.\n  Quite simply, this amendment would prohibit the use of contractors in \nthe interrogation of prisoners and offensive military operations and \nestablish certain restrictions with respect to the transfer of \nprisoners to contractors and foreign nations.\n  Let me try to explain why this is so and what the background of all \nthis is. According to some estimates, there are as many as 20,000 \ncontractors operating in Iraq today, many carrying out mission-critical \nmilitary roles, such as security, protection, interrogation, logistics \nsupport, and paramilitary and military training.\n  Increasingly, U.S. contractor activities have become deeply \nintertwined with those of U.S. troops and Coalition Provisional \nAuthority personnel. These activities have put them in harm's way. As \nwe have all painfully learned, contractors are among those who have \nbeen taken hostage by insurgents in Iraq. They have also suffered \nterrible injuries and loss of life, the most horrific of which occurred \non April 13 of this year when the bodies of four contractors were \nburned, mutilated, and hung from a bridge in Iraq.\n  Equally troubling, it looks more and more likely that contractors may \nhave taken part in the interrogation of Iraqi prisoners and may be \nlinked directly or indirectly to the reported abuses of those \nprisoners. Even today there may be still some taking part in the \ninterrogation of prisoners.\n  Let me say as an aside, by the way, that I commend, again, the Armed \nServices Committee under the leadership of Senator Warner and Senator \nLevin for the very thoughtful hearings the Armed Services Committee had \nabout this matter and the professional manner in which they went about \nexamining these issues and doing the kind of thorough look that a \nstanding committee of the Senate ought to make, regardless of the party \nin power in the White House. They have done a very good job and have \nbeen tremendously helpful to the American public.\n  We have all read reports and seen graphic pictures of the heinous \nabuses associated with the incarceration of Iraqi prisoners. \nUnfortunately, so has almost the entire world been witness to these \nphotographs and the stories about what has occurred.\n  It does not take much of an imagination to figure out that the \nconsequence of those abuses has been a disaster not only with respect \nto the U.S. policy in Iraq but also with respect to our policies \nthroughout the greater Middle East. That is why I have included a \nprovision in the pending amendment to prohibit the use of contractors \nin the interrogation of prisoners, detainees, and combatants. However, \nmindful that in the short term we may not have sufficient military \npersonnel with requisite language and interrogation skills at certain \ncritical moments, I have also included in this pending amendment \nPresidential authority to waive these restrictions under certain narrow \nconstrictions: During fiscal year 2005 with respect to their use as \ntranslators, and for the first 90 days of the next fiscal year with \nrespect to interrogations.\n  It should go without saying that any contractor who is employed by \nthe United States as a translator or interrogator must be certified as \nhighly proficient in the areas for which he or she is being employed, \nand such contractors must be properly supervised at all times by \nofficial U.S. military personnel. To help ensure that is the case, the \namendment I am offering this afternoon would also require the President \nto submit a quarterly report to Congress on the use of contractors as \ntranslators and in interrogations.\n  I remind my colleagues that at this very moment contractors in Iraq \ngo about their business virtually unregulated. They have been exempted \nfrom local law by CPA regulation. They are also outside the Uniform \nMilitary Code of Justice and could, therefore, avoid prosecution in a \nmilitary court of law. Contractors' accountability under U.S. \ninternational law remains untested. And now the Bush administration is \nputting pressure on the transitional Iraqi government to grant immunity \nto contractors after the June 30 transfer of power. If the transitional \nIraqi government succumbs to this pressure, contractors won't only have \nimmunity from prosecution, they will likely be able to act with \nimpunity while they participate in some of our most sensitive military \nintelligence operations. I think this is unacceptable and puts our \ntroops and our mission at great risk.\n  The more we learn, the more it seems this whole business of hiring \ncontractors has gotten out of control. We need to be more scrupulous--\nnot less--about the tasks we assign to contractors. Quite frankly, I \ndon't think it makes much sense to have contractors performing \ninterrogations. Apparently neither does the Army, whose policy \nreportedly bars contractors from military intelligence jobs such as \ninterrogating prisoners unless there are not enough qualified people in \nthe Army to perform those duties.\n  According to recent reports, the source of this policy is an Army \npolicy memo, written in December 2000, by Patrick T. Henry, then the \nArmy's top personnel official. In this memo he asserted that allowing \nprivate workers to gather military intelligence presented ``a risk to \nnational security.'' That statement is anything but ambiguous. Let me \nquote it again. From the Army's top personnel official, it is ``a risk \nto national security,'' in a 2000 memo prepared by the U.S. Army.\n  Thomas White, the former Secretary of the Army, has also expressed \nhis opposition to hiring contractors to question prisoners, stating in \nan interview ``the basic process of interrogation should be kept in-\nhouse on the Army side.''\n  Moreover, last week it was reported that CACI International, a \ncontractor caught up in this controversy, was not\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\neven under contract with the Department of Defense. Rather its \nactivities were being managed by the U.S. Department of Interior which \napproved the company's hiring of interrogators utilizing a preexisting \ncontract for computer services with that company. The particular \ncircumstances of the CACI contract blur even further the accountability \nof its employees because Department of Interior contractors may not be \ncovered by certain U.S. laws specifically enacted to cover Department \nof Defense contractors, such as the Military Extraterritorial \nJurisdiction Act, which attempts to make U.S. Department of Defense \ncontractors working overseas legally accountable.\n  How many other contractors have been employed by non-Department of \nDefense agencies to carry out activities in Iraq? To say we have seen \nsome extraordinary contracting practices in the case of Iraq is an \nunderstatement. I would hope these practices are not being employed to \ncircumvent the requirements of the Geneva Conventions or other \ninternational U.S. laws, because if you are doing this as a matter of \npolicy, I am deeply concerned that we will be inviting other nations to \ndo the same to the detriment of the safety of American military and \ncivilian personnel around the globe.\n  Indeed, according to the comprehensive report of MG Antonio Taguba, \ncontractors employed in Iraq participated in prisoner interrogations \nwith minimal supervision. And I quote him:\n\n       They allegedly on occasion even provided direction to U.S. \n     military police.\n\n  The words ``minimal supervision'' are not mine. They were part of a \njob posting for the interrogator international analyst team lead \nassistant which is listed on the contract at CACI International's Web \nsite.\n  I have reproduced an excerpt from the job posting as it was reprinted \nin the Washington Post on May 10 on the poster behind me. It reads:\n\n       Description: Assists the interrogation support program team \n     . . . to increase the effectiveness of dealing with \n     detainees, persons of interest and prisoners of war (POWs) \n     that are in the custody of the U.S./Coalition forces . . . in \n     terms of screening, interrogation, and debriefing of persons \n     of intelligence value. Under minimal supervision, will assist \n     . . .\n\n  The key words are ``under minimal supervision.'' The new posting now \nreads ``under minimal CACI supervision,'' the name of the international \ncompany.\n  This isn't all. A former CACI interrogator was quoted on May 13 in \nthe Washington Post as saying:\n\n       Civilian interrogators were often free to conduct \n     interrogations as they best saw fit.\n\n  And General Taguba reportedly recommended to one employee of CACI \nthat he be ``fired, reprimanded, and denied his security clearances for \ngiving instructions to Army policemen that he clearly knew equated to \nphysical abuse.''\n  Indeed, this lack of supervision may have been the rule rather than \nthe exception in the Abu Ghraib prison. More importantly, with the fate \nof our mission in Iraq and our international reputation at stake, the \nAmerican people deserve to know why civilian contractors were \nparticipating in these interrogations in the first place.\n  This Senator--and I am sure many of my colleagues would agree--does \nnot think private contractors have any place in such highly sensitive \nmilitary operations. That is not only because of these human rights \nabuses or potential violations of U.S. international law, it is because \nthey have exponentially increased the danger level for more than \n135,000 honorable and dedicated U.S. troops currently risking their \nlives in Iraq. We owe it to all those brave men and women who now face \na far more difficult task in winning the hearts and minds of Iraqis or \nsetting the stage for the successful handover of sovereignty to Iraqi \nofficials less than 15 days from now.\n  My amendment also addresses the related issue of the transfer of \nprisoners in U.S. custody. It would not only prohibit the U.S. \nDepartment of Defense from transferring prisoners into a contractor's \ncustody, but it would also require the Secretary of Defense to keep a \nwritten record of prisoner transfers from DOD custody to foreign \nnations.\n\n  Why is this provision necessary? Because according to published \nreports, interrogation strategies reportedly included sending detainees \nto third countries where in some cases, according to the New York \nTimes, they are convinced they might be executed.\n  A set of post-9/11 legal memoranda prepared by the U.S. Government \neven suggested ``if U.S. Government officials are contemplating \nprocedures that may put them in violation of American statutes that \nprohibit torture, degrading treatment, or the Geneva Conventions, they \nwill not be held responsible if it can be argued that the detainees are \nformally in the custody of another nation.''\n  There may be instances when the transfer of prisoners to third \ncountries would serve our interests. My amendment does not prohibit \nthat from happening. But at the very least, records of transfers should \nbe kept to ensure that the transfer of prisoners to countries with poor \nhuman rights records is not used to circumvent U.S. and international \nlaw. My amendment would mandate that such records be kept.\n  Finally, this amendment would also prohibit contractors from \nparticipating in most combat operations except in cases of self-\ndefense, and it would prevent U.S. moneys from being used to pay \ncontractors for those purposes. I understand our stated U.S. policy \ndoes not permit U.S. contractors in combat. The chaos on the ground has \ncreated a climate where, for the most part, these individuals operate \nwith little or no oversight. Without specific language in statute which \nclearly spells out what are and are not permissible contractor \nactivities, there will always exist the danger that circumstances will \ndraw private citizens into armed conflict.\n  I would hope my colleagues would support codifying into law what the \nadministration has said is its policy with respect to the use of \nprivate contractors in combat situations.\n  Madam President, I will briefly sum up what I am trying to accomplish \nwith the pending amendment. First, I propose to restrict the use of \ncontractors in prisoner interrogations. I point out that we provide for \na little leeway here that would allow, during fiscal 2005, for a little \ntime to be used, because we may not have the people at hand who can do \ntranslations, or perform interrogations, so we provide leeway to build \nthis up. We would prohibit such individuals from being employed in \nprisoner interrogations.\n  Second, we would prohibit such individuals from being employed in \noffensive combat missions.\n  Finally, I would keep private contractors out of the prisoner \ncontracting business.\n  I commend Senators Warner and Levin for their willingness to address \nsome of the issues I have touched on in this amendment in the last few \nweeks. This is so we in the Congress ``get it,'' so to speak, and we \nare ready to begin repairing the damage caused by these problems which, \nin some cases, continue to endanger our efforts in Iraq and throughout \nthe globe.\n  I believe the amendment is a reasonable and measured response to the \nchallenges we face. I urge my colleagues to support the efforts \nembodied in this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I have looked over this amendment very \ncarefully. We will have to oppose it for a number of reasons. There may \nbe some parts of it on which we could have a meeting of the minds. I \nwould like to walk through the amendment with my good friend and ask \nhim a few questions about this amendment.\n  Let's go to the title:\n\n       Prohibitions on the Use of Contractors for Certain \n     Department of Defense Activities.\n       (A) Prohibition on Use of Contractors in Interrogation of \n     Prisoners and Combat Operations.\n\n  That and combat operations poses a dilemma. For example, as the \ndistinguished Senator knows, in his State are a number of our \nsubmarines. At any one time, those submarines have a board of \ncontractors who are working on the equipment, training of sailors, \ntaking an aircraft carrier. At any one time, you have maybe several \nhundred contractors aboard an aircraft carrier. On a moment's notice, \neither of those vessels could be given a tactical order to go into \nharm's way.\n  The way this amendment is drawn--so broadly--I think the Senator had \nbetter look at it again. I could not in\n\n[[Page S6707]]\n\nany way support an amendment that says contractors are prohibited from \ngoing into harm's way, because they are forward-deployed with our \nunits; they are aboard our vessels. At any time, on a moment's notice, \nthey could be put into a position of being in harm's way.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me respond, if I may. It is an anticipated argument. We \nhave similar provisions applying in certain categories under the United \nStates Code here, 10 U.S.C. Section 113, Notice to Congress of Proposed \nChanges in Combat Assignments to Which Female Members May be Assigned; \nand also in Public Law 103-160.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have both of these provisions of the \nUnited States Code printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From 10 U.S.C., Public Law 103-160]\n\nSec. 542.

First, it would come under defending themselves to \na certain point. The idea we are trying to get at is to have these \npersonnel not become directly involved in combat.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is not the way it is crafted, as I read it. If the \nSenator wishes to proceed on this part of the amendment, the Senator \nwould be well advised to try to make reference to the existing law in \nsuch a way as to make it clear.\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to do that. My intention is, obviously, not to \ntry to chart new areas of law.\n  Mr. WARNER. The way it is drawn, it could be interpreted that way.\n  Mr. DODD. We will talk with staff to see if we might make the \nlanguage tighter.\n  Mr. WARNER. My second concern goes to the question of the \ninterrogation of prisoners. Clearly, the Armed Services Committee has \nhad hearings on the very difficult problems that we encountered in the \nprisons in Iraq, and perhaps in certain areas in Afghanistan; and we, \nby no means, have concluded--either the Congress or the Department of \nDefense--our examination of these problems. As the Senator well knows, \nthe Army, in particular, and the Department of Defense have a number of \nongoing investigations with regard to these prisoner problems. It \nrelates, as my good friend from Connecticut stated, to the use of, in \nsome instances, interrogators who were contractors.\n  This is the problem, as I see it. As we do our defense planning, we \ndo our very best to have trained and ready cadres of individuals in \ncombat areas and cadres of individuals for medical purposes and other \npurposes. If we were to put this type of prohibition into law, the \nDepartment of Defense--primarily the Department of the Army--would have \nto put into place a very significant number of individuals who would at \nall times be trained and ready to go in following combat operations to \ndo the interrogations of prisoners.\n  That, it seems to me, puts a burden on the Department which is not a \nwise expenditure of funds and use of military personnel. I don't know \nwhat the estimate would be. Let's assume that in due course our \nsituations in Afghanistan and Iraq are secured in such a way that our \nforces withdraw and we hopefully return to a period where there would \nbe more equilibrium in the use of our Armed Forces in conducting \nmissions around the world. As this is drawn, the Department of the Army \nwould have to have a very significant cadre of individuals who are just \nwaiting assignment at a future time, as a\n\n[[Page S6708]]\n\nconsequence of some future military operation, to perform the \ninterrogations. That has been an area that I think in the past has \nsuccessfully been performed by contractors, providing there are rules \nand regulations laying down the specific requirements of the training \nof those contractors, the expertise. They just cannot pick up \nindividuals off the street and put them into positions of \nresponsibility. It is that general reason--and I will go on in a \nmoment, but I will allow my colleague to reply--that I have great \nconcern about the intention of this amendment. Those are two points I \nwish to make in terms of opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may respond, it is not an illegitimate concern in \ntalking about personnel. We have all seen what could happen when you \nhave people operating who are unregulated. In some cases, contractors \nhave worked out of the Department of the Interior, so there is no \nsupervision by the DOD. We are asking these people, unregulated, with \nno clear lines of authority, to do these things, and we have seen what \nhappens when that occurs. It appears this is getting out of hand by \nprivate contractors.\n  In the area of intelligence gathering, dealing with sensitive \nmatters--sensitive to the issue of having enough personnel on the \nground to do these things--I am far more worried about the fact of \nrogue elements being able to cause us tremendous harm.\n  I think all would admit certainly that the result of what happened in \nAbu Ghraib prison and what the world knows today has been tremendously \nharmful to the United States and potentially to our men and women in \nuniform who may be subjected to interrogations. We know we are going to \nsee the answers raised by others.\n  I provided in the amendment some leeway to allow for a period of time \nso it would not be required to have an immediate requirement that all \nof these individuals be replaced on the adoption of this particular law \nbut allow for some leeway.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator direct the Senate to \nthat portion where he thinks there is flexibility.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, if the Senator will go to page 2 of the \namendment, the very bottom line, 25, section (b), the President may \nalso waive the prohibition in paragraph 1 with respect to the use of \ncontractors. Otherwise provided by that paragraph during the 90-day \nperiod--going on page 3--beginning on the date of enactment of this \nact, but any such waiver shall cease to be effective on the last day of \nsuch period.\n  There is also an earlier provision in regard to translator services \nregarding additional time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I could not find that language. I \nlistened carefully to the Senator's presentation. I can understand the \ntranslator.\n  Mr. DODD. I am quoting from the bill. With regard to 1(a) on page 2--\nand you go to page 2 of the amendment--\n  Mr. WARNER. I am on page 2.\n  Mr. DODD. Then go to line 10. It talks about interrogation of \nprisoners, detainees, and the like. Paragraph (b), and then it goes, on \nline 17, during fiscal year 2005 the President may waive prohibition in \nparagraph 1 with respect to contractors and provide translator services \nunder paragraph (a), if the President determines no United States \nmilitary personnel or appropriate language skills are available.\n  Go on down to line 25, page 2, section (b): The President may also \nwaive the prohibition in paragraph 1(a) with respect to the use of any \ncontractors. I am reading on page 3.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if the Senator will withhold, I have two \namendments here, and I suspect what I was working off of was the--I \nthought it was the one that had been modified. I am now told this is \nthe original amendment and that you have modified it.\n  Mr. DODD. I have modified it, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Once again, if the Senator will direct me.\n  Mr. DODD. On page 2 of the amendment, go down and begin on line 10, \nand I believe that is section (a). It talks about the interrogation of \nprisoners, what would not be allowed. Then paragraph (a) and paragraph \n(b). Then on line 17, 2(a), it says: During fiscal year 2005, the \nPresident may waive the prohibition in paragraph 1 with respect to the \nuse of contractors to provide translator services under paragraph (a) \nof that paragraph.\n  Without reading the rest of that language, going to line 25, \nsubparagraph (b) on page 2: The President may also waive the \nprohibition in paragraph 1(a) with respect to use of contractors--page \n3 now--otherwise prohibited by that paragraph during the 90-day period \nbeginning on the date of the enactment of this act.\n\n  Senator Levin raised this question, and we discussed it. It is a \nlegitimate point. We do not expect for this to happen overnight. It \nwould be unreasonable.\n  The point I want to make generically, because I think my colleague \nraises a very legitimate issue, is that the war on terror is not going \nto be over tomorrow, and it seems to me we better get the expertise in \nthese areas. They are going to be an integral part of our Government \nservice to have this talent, this ability. It is a new age we have \nentered, and we have to be prepared to address it.\n  I am deeply worried about having these unregulated, uncontrolled \ncontractors, many of which are operating with agencies that are not \neven under the Department of Defense in a theater of conflict where the \nability to control, regulate, and supervise may be going out the \nwindow.\n  As I say, I was stunned to read about the Department of the Interior. \nWhat is the Department of the Interior doing and what authority does \nthe Department of Defense have over contractors hired by the Department \nof the Interior operating in a prison environment in Baghdad? That \nworries me. If they are not trained, who are these people gathering \nintelligence? How much reliance can we have?\n  I realize we are in tough shape with personnel, but my point is the \nsooner we start developing the in-house capabilities--I recall reading \nafter 9/11 that we actually ran advertisements in local papers for \npeople who could speak Arabic for jobs in the State Department. This is \na terrible revelation that we do not have people capable of doing this \nskill.\n  I am worried that if we continue to rely on a very loose operation--\nwe found out what happens, and we have suffered terribly as a result of \nthese abuses that occurred.\n  I do not know to the extent and, obviously, others are looking into \nthe details of it now, but certainly we know now there were a number of \nprivate contractors basically unsupervised operating in their own world \nand may have been directed by our military personnel under certain \ncircumstances.\n  I am sensitive to the concerns raised by the chairman who, by the \nway--and I will state it again. The hearings that the chairman and the \nranking member have held on this issue have been tremendously \nworthwhile, and I commend them immensely for what they are doing. If \nthere are ways in which this amendment can be modified to address the \nnot illegitimate concerns about how do you transition from a present \nsituation into one we can build, then I am interested in how we do \nthat.\n  I am not interested in having an amendment and having a vote, \nallowing it to come out one way or the other. I think it is a \ncritically important issue. We have at least 20,000 people operating as \nindependent contractors in a very important theater, and we are going \nto face more situations not unlike this in the coming years.\n  It seems to me we better start addressing this pretty quickly, and \nthis amendment is an effort to do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. On the question of the interrogation, I would like to \nhave an opportunity to revisit that. My immediate concern is maybe 90 \ndays is short and perhaps there is some flexibility there.\n  If I can return to the part B, that gives me very serious concern, \nand that is the combat missions that require routine engagement. For \nexample, so much of the security for Ambassador Bremer today is all \ncontracted. Much of the security, as I understand, which is given to \nother members of the Iraqi government, to the extent they avail \nthemselves of what the coalition forces--that is nonmilitary, \nAmbassador Bremer's operation--make available to them, I do not know \nhow we are going to meet those needs. If you follow this to the letter, \nyou would have to have all soldiers doing that.\n\n[[Page S6709]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. As I said, the idea is it is one thing for them to be in a \ncapacity to provide protection and certainly take steps for self-\ndefense. I am trying to draw a distinction of engaging in offensive \ncombat missions because there is some concern they have been involved \nin that level of activity.\n  Again, I hope the language used in existing law that draws a \ndistinction between ground activity, combat activity, and noncombat \nactivity, defensive activity, would be clear enough. Again, I am happy \nto spell out that language more clearly. I am just trying to avoid a \nsituation where, again, people who are untrained, unregulated, and \nunsupervised can get us into a lot of difficulty in a very sensitive \narea.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator's point is well taken. He \nhas served in this body many years and during that period of time, we \nhave engaged in a number of military operations. This one is unique.\n  I made a quick reference to the existing statutes, 113 U.S.C. and \nothers. I am fearful the Senator has thrown out a fishnet here that \ncatches too many when he says prohibit the use of contractors as \nrelates to combat missions. I just do not know how we would operate \naboard our ships. I do not know how we would operate in a number of \ntheaters without the benefit of contractors, and, at certain times, \nthey are in harm's way.\n  So at the moment we will have to have very vigorous opposition to \nthis amendment as it is presently drawn. If the Senator from \nConnecticut wants to lay it aside and take a look at it, I will be \nhappy to do so.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me put this in the Record, if I may, \nfor my colleagues. Under Public Law 107-306, November 27, 2002, \nsubsection (e), ``Limitation on Participation of United States \nPersonnel'':\n\n       No United States Armed Forces personnel or United States \n     civilian contractor employed by the United States will \n     participate in any combat operation in connection with \n     assistance made available under this section, except for the \n     purpose of acting in self defense or rescuing any United \n     States citizen to include United States Armed Forces \n     personnel, United States civilian employees, and civilian \n     contractors employed by the United States.\n\n  I am not creating new law. That is a public law that is on the books. \nSo I say to my colleagues, I do not believe we are going off in an area \nthat would be unwarranted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this Public Law 107-306 dated \nNovember 27, 2002 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Public Law 107-306--Nov. 27, 2002]\n\n         TITLE V--DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES\n\n     SEC. 501. USE OF FUNDS FOR COUNTERDRUG AND COUNTERTERRORISM \n                   ACTIVITIES FOR COLOMBIA.\n\n       (e) Limitation on Participation of United States \n     Personnel.--No United States Armed Forces personnel or United \n     States civilian contractor employed by the United States will \n     participate in any combat operation in connection with \n     assistance made available under this section, except for the \n     purpose of acting in self defense or rescuing any United \n     States citizen to include United States Armed Forces \n     personnel, United States civilian employees, and civilian \n     contractors employed by the United States.\n\n  Mr. DODD. It is Title V, the Department of Defense Intelligence \nActivities. That is the section, subsection e, of that title V.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I again draw my colleague to paragraph \nB, United States-led combat missions that require routine engagement in \ndirect combat, that implies that the uniformed people are in direct \ncombat and the presence in a supporting role of contractors can often \nbe the case unexpectedly in connection with naval vessels which are a \nmatter of a moment's notice.\n  Mr. DODD. I have no difficulty with----\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not sure this is drawn in such a way as to continue \nwhat I deem essential practice with regard to naval ships. I would have \nto study it considerably to determine how it might impede ground \noperations.\n  Mr. DODD. I always appreciate the advice and counsel of the chairman \nof the committee so I will take a look and see if there is some common \nlanguage that might meet those concerns.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is it the intention of my colleague in due course to lay \nthis aside?\n  Mr. DODD. I presume others would want to lay it aside when other \namendments are being considered. I do not object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first let me comment on what I think is \nthe heart of the amendment the Senator from Connecticut has offered, \nand that has to do with the interrogation function and whether that \nought to be performed by private contractors.\n  It seems to me abundantly clear that we cannot hire private \ncontractors to perform a function that is inherently governmental, \ninherently sensitive, indeed inherently explosive, and on which there \nmust be accountability, such as the interrogation of prisoners. We have \ntreaty obligations. We have to live up to those treaty obligations, not \nbecause they are treaty obligations, although that should be enough, \nbut also because the safety of our own troops is directly involved if \nwe fail to abide by treaty obligations.\n  The stakes are absolutely huge and we must have people performing \nthese functions who are accountable to us, where there is \naccountability.\n  Now the chairman has pointed out a problem with so-called \nsubparagraph 1(b). I do think that is going to require additional \nexploration, and the Senator from Connecticut is perfectly happy to \ntake a look at that additional exploration.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut points out, there may indeed already \nbe law on the books that this simply would reinforce. If that is true, \nit is possible we may not even need this provision, but that is \nsomething which the exploration of law can tell us. We may not need, or \nthe Senator from Connecticut more properly may not need, the provision \n1(b) if the current law already addresses that issue. But that is \nsomething we ought to explore when we lay this amendment aside.\n  I will tell my friend from Virginia, the chairman of the committee, \nthat the heart of this amendment, as I read it, is not section 1(b) but \nsection 1(a). I think the Senator from Connecticut can speak most \ndirectly to that issue, but it is a question of whether we are going to \ncontract out the interrogation function, where there is no \naccountability in something as grave as this procedure. Interrogating \npeople who are captured in war has ramifications that are so \nsignificant to the security of our own troops, I think we must have the \nfull accountability, which is only achievable when we have this \nperformed by our own governmental operations, our own forces, our own \ngovernmental employees. So I think 1(a) is right on target.\n\n  It is possible, and I think there is another reason to lay this \naside, that according to at least an article which I read over the \nweekend there already is an Army policy directive on this subject, when \nI read this article----\n  Mr. WARNER. Excuse me, Madam President, but on which subject?\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the subject of (a).\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us make it clear because the Senator is mixing (a) \nand (b).\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my chairman. This is what the article reads, and \nbecause I have a reprint of it I am not sure what paper I read it in, \nbut this is the computer reprint of an article by Joe Brinkley, which \nsays the following: That the use of private contractors as \ninterrogators at Abu Ghraib and other prisons violates an Army policy \nthat requires such jobs to be filled by Government employees because of \nthe risk to ``national security,'' among other concerns, the Army \nacknowledged on Friday. An Army policy directive published in 2000 and \nstill in effect today, the military said, classifies any job that \ninvolves the gathering and analysis of tactical intelligence as \ninherently governmental functions borrowed from private sector \nperformance.\n  Now if we are going to set this amendment aside, there is an \nadditional reason to do so. In addition to taking a look at whether \n1(b) is necessary, the issue raised by the chairman, we should also \ntake a look at what current Army policy is relative to the hiring of \ncontractors to perform the interrogation function. I have tried in the \nlast few minutes to get a copy of that Army policy, and I have been \nunable to do so in the last few minutes, so I could actually check it \nout myself. So\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\nif this amendment is laid aside, I would seek to do exactly that.\n  One other comment, and that is this so-called Department of Interior. \nWhat is the Department of Interior doing here? Talk about lack of \naccountability. This is a contract which the Department of Interior \nentered into with private contractors to do interrogation. We talk \nabout lack of responsibility, lack of accountability. The Army has lost \ncontrol of its own contractors. These are not Army contractors, they \nare Department of Interior contractors. And why? Because they have \nengaged in a so-called offloading mechanism, where they use a contract \nof another agency to pay for the performance of functions which they, \nthe Army, want.\n  That is an area which I would hope our committee would look into \nbecause, to me, we have laws against this kind of offloading. The \nsubcommittee of which I am ranking member, the Permanent Subcommittee \nof Investigations, has had hearings on these offloading abuses. We have \npassed law to try to prohibit these offloading abuses. We have \nlanguage, as a matter of fact, in this bill that would prevent some of \nthe abuses the GSA was involved in in terms of offloading. If we had \nknown about this particular problem, we would have included that in our \ncommittee consideration of this issue.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is pointing out something which is \nvitally important to us, and that is people who do interrogations on \nbehalf of our Nation, relative to prisoners of war, must be \naccountable. We must be able to deter abuses of the rights of prisoners \nunder treaties, or else when our people are captured, we are going to \nfind we are in the same position as these prisoners. We need \naccountable people. That requires the people who are doing the \ninterrogation be Government employees, at a minimum, hopefully \nuniformed employees, secondly.\n  We have two problems that are sort of parallel. We have this \noffloading problem where the Department of Interior contract is used to \nhire contractors. By the way, this also goes back in part to the \nreduction of the acquisition workforce. It goes back to the same issue \nwe addressed on the prior subject. The chairman of our committee, of \nwhich the Presiding Officer is an extremely valued member, will \nremember the last conference, and the conference before that, and the \nconference before that with the House of Representatives. Every year we \nface this effort to reduce the amount of people who are working in our \nacquisition workforce. We are paying the price for those cuts.\n  We tried to stop those cuts, and we succeeded in at least reducing \nthe scope of the cuts year after year, but as conferences work out, \nthere are compromises on this. So there have been cuts, against our \nwishes, in the acquisition workforce. This again is a price we are \npaying for the reductions in the acquisition workforce which have \noccurred in prior years.\n  I commend the Senator from Connecticut for identifying an issue. We \nmust make sure the interrogation of prisoners, detainees, or \ncombatants, as he puts it in his amendment, at any U.S. military \ninstallation or any installation under the authority of the U.S. \nmilitary or civilian personnel must be carried out by people who are \nresponsible to us, who are part of the U.S. Government. If they are not \nin the military, or at least governmental employees, and not simply \ncontractors, where the accountability is much less, where is the \naccountability for contractors? Where is the accountability? We passed \na law recently which provides the criminal accountability if you can \nmake out a crime, but it is very difficult at times to prove crimes.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am happy to yield, but I encourage us to lay aside this \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. So we can accommodate Senators, I would like to propose a \nunanimous consent request that the vote in relation to Dodd amendment \nNo. 3312, which is the one covering equipment for the military forces, \noccur today at 5:30 p.m., provided that no amendments be in order to \nthe amendment prior to the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the Chairman add 10 minutes of discussion on the \namendment prior to the vote?\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest we go to the vote. I have indicated a \nwillingness to support it, so I don't think----\n  Mr. DODD. Let's take 1 minute prior to the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine, 1 minute each side? Let's make it 2. I can't clear \nmy throat in 1.\n  I repropound the unanimous consent request to the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. It was modified to 2 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. WARNER. Two minutes to each side, not equally divided.\n  Mr. DODD. OK. Two minutes to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if that is out of the way, I will yield \nthe floor----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I support the suggestion that the pending amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut be laid aside to hear two issues.\n  Mr. WARNER. I failed to hear what you said. Would you repeat that?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am sorry. I want to support the suggestion that the \npending amendment of the Senator from Connecticut be laid aside so that \ntwo things can be carried out: One is that we look at section 1(b) \nrelative to the combat language, both in terms of the points that the \nchairman has made and also in terms of the current law relative to \ncombat. Also, that would give us an opportunity to check out this \nreported Army policy directive which has been referred to in this \nnewspaper article to see what the current law is, at least what the \ncurrent policy----\n  Mr. WARNER. Regulations.\n  Mr. LEVIN.----regulations of the Army are relative to this particular \nissue. I think it is important we at least know that before we act on \nthe amendment. I leave this up to our friend from Connecticut, but I \nthink the heart of this amendment relates to the interrogation of the \nprisoners, rather than 1(b).\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, just going over this--and I \ncertainly have no difficulty at all trying to clear up, if we can, the \nsection 1(b) issue that my colleague from Virginia has raised. To the \nbest of my knowledge at this point, we will explore it further, but my \nexamination shows dealing with interrogation is a directive. It's not a \nlaw. It has been a policy, and the policy allowed for exceptions to be \nmade when there were not enough personnel or whatever else to deal with \nit.\n\n  That is what has happened here. This is a policy that has been around \nfor about 4 years--maybe a little earlier, maybe 1998, certainly no \nlater than 2000. As such, it lacks codification in any sense at all, \nand it has been adhered to in the breach more than in the letter of it. \nThat is how I understand this. I know of no Army regulations dealing \nwith this issue, other than a general policy direction.\n  It seemed to me on this particular point, the codification of our \nfeelings about this, if a majority of my colleagues in the other body \nagree, should be put in place. We are going to be faced with more of \nthis in the years ahead. I think some very clear direction for the U.S. \nCongress on how interrogations ought to be conducted and who conducts \nthem, under what authority, what supervision, what regulation, is \nabsolutely essential.\n  That is the heart of the amendment. The combat function was really \njust a throwaway because it was existing law, as I understood it. But I \nam prepared to be corrected if that is not the case. I was reading from \nexisting statutes regarding contractors and use in combat situations, \nunder what parameters they are allowed to operate, sort of tracking \nthat as to be included here. But I am prepared to stand corrected if \nthat is not the case.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield on this issue?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I very much support his effort to codify what should be \nthe rule relative to the use of outside people when it comes to \ncarrying out such a critical function as interrogating prisoners of \nwar.\n  The same article says--this is the exceptions reference the Senator \nmade--according to the public affairs officer, military commanders in \nIraq, and I presume otherwise, ``retain the right to\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nmake exceptions.'' That is the reference the Senator from Connecticut \nmade.\n  The paragraph after that said the rule does not authorize exceptions \ninvolving collection or analysis of tactical intelligence. That is not \nin quotes. I think it really is important that we see exactly what that \npolicy currently provides, not because it will take the place of a \nlaw--it will not, for the reasons given by the Senator from \nConnecticut. I think we must codify what is right in this area. Whether \nthe policy that exists now is correct or not, we should put this into \nlaw because we have to make this point about how significant this is. \nThat means the highest possible level of requirement, which is law--not \npolicy, which can easily be changed or ignored, but law which cannot be \nignored--is appropriate here.\n  I think for a lot of reasons we should try to take a look at what the \nexact wording of the policy is, not because it will substitute for what \nthe Senator is doing, which is essential, but because we ought to know \nprecisely what the current provisions are.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Michigan for his comments. I \ntotally agree with him. I thank my colleague from Virginia as well for \nhis counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent this amendment be laid aside unless my \ncolleague wants to address it any further, and then we will do some \nwork to see if we can't resolve some of these issues before we move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3295\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask the pending amendment be set aside, and I call up an \namendment numbered 3295.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3295.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the purchase of aircraft for use in aerial \n                             firefighting)\n\n       On page 280, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1068. AERIAL FIREFIGHTING EQUIPMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Interagency Fire Center does not possess \n     an adequate number of aircraft for use in aerial firefighting \n     and personnel at the Center rely on military aircraft to \n     provide such firefighting services.\n       (2) It is in the national security interest of the United \n     States for the National Interagency Fire Center to purchase \n     aircraft for use in aerial firefighting so that military \n     aircraft used for aerial firefighting may be available for \n     use by the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Authority To Purchase Aerial Firefighting Equipment.--\n     (1) The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to purchase 10 \n     aircraft, as described in paragraph (2), for the National \n     Interagency Fire Center for use in aerial firefighting.\n       (2) The aircraft referred to in paragraph (1) shall be--\n       (A) aircraft that are specifically designed and built for \n     aerial firefighting;\n       (B) certified by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration for use in aerial firefighting; and\n       (C) manufactured in a manner that is consistent with the \n     recommendations for aircraft used in aerial firefighting \n     contained in--\n       (i) the Blue Ribbon Panel Report to the Chief of the Forest \n     Service and the Director of the Bureau of Land Management \n     dated December 2002; and\n       (ii) the Safety Recommendation of the Chairman of the \n     National Transportation Safety Board related to aircraft used \n     in aerial firefighting dated April 23, 2004.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Agriculture for fiscal \n     year 2005 such funds as may be necessary to purchase the 10 \n     aircraft described in subsection (b).\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their cooperation on this amendment.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to authorize the Secretary of \nAgriculture to purchase 10 aircraft that were designed and built to \nfight fires.\n  The U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management need to develop \na new fleet of aircraft for aerial firefighting in order to free up \ncurrent military aircraft to fly military missions.\n  My amendment takes the first step to create a new fleet of aircraft \nspecifically designed for aerial firefighting. Once the new fleet is in \nplace all dedicated military aircraft will be freed up and allowed to \nbe dedicated, once again, for military missions.\n  On May 10, 2004, the USDA Forest Service and the Department of the \nInterior terminated the contract for 33 large airtankers used for \naerial fire fighting because of ``concerns over the airworthiness of \nthe aircraft and public safety.'' The large, fixed-wing airtankers were \nused in wildland firefighting primarily for initial attack and \nstructure protection support.\n  The old fleet was made up of aging, former military aircraft that \nwere purchased at bargain basement prices from the surplus military \nmarket. They were the worst of the worst and required extensive repairs \nand refurbishing before they were ready for aerial firefighting.\n  The USFS has planned to replace the 33 air tankers with 8 military \nC130s that will be dedicated during the fire session to fly support for \ndomestic fire fighting missions. These planes, therefore, will not be \navailable to support necessary military missions.\n  The first step in relieving these planes from domestic duty, \nand making them available for military utilization, is to find a \nreasonable replacement that is safe and specifically designed for \naerial fire fighting.\n\n  One example of the kind of aircraft that could be purchased is the \nBe-200 that would be serviced by a company in my home State of Wyoming.\n  It was specifically designed to operate as an air tanker and can \ndeliver up to 6,000 gallons of water or other fire suppressants.\n  It is an amphibious plane that can scoop up the water on the fly.\n  It can mix the water with slurry in regulated amounts while in the \nair so it will not be required to fill up at a slurry base after every \nrun.\n  And, because the water tanks were designed to fit under the cabin \nfloor, it can also carry up to 60 firefighters and their gear as a \ntransport plane while it is functioning as a firefighting tanker.\n  Our pilots put their lives on the lines to save our property and to \nsave other lives. We owe it to them to have a modern fleet where the \nrisks they face are significantly diminished.\n  We also owe it to our military to free up our military aircraft for \nmilitary missions. Right now there are 8 C-130 transport aircraft that \ncannot be used to fly support missions in the Middle East because they \nhave to be on hand to fight fires in the West.\n  We have options available to free those aircraft up and we should be \ndeveloping those options as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment so that I might bring up amendment 3183.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the pending amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3183\n\n      (Purpose: To provide Federal assistance to States and local \n                jurisdictions to prosecute hate crimes)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3183.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, if there were a Senator here objecting to \nlaying aside an amendment, I apologize to him or her, but I make no \napology for the amendment I am submitting.\n  The Senate knows well the substance of this amendment because we have \ndebated it in every Congress because it\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\nneeds to be debated. But, more importantly, it needs to be passed; that \nis, the whole issue of hate crimes. People will wonder why it is on a \ndefense authorization. The answer is simply: Because the military, as I \nwill demonstrate, is not immune to the scourge of hate crimes in our \ncountry. Second, this is a piece of legislation that needs to pass, and \nthis issue needs to get as far in the process as possible, and I hope \nto the desk of the President so it can be signed into law.\n  It needs to be taken up as well because it has overwhelming support \nin the Senate. On this Defense authorization and in a previous \nCongress, 57 Senators voted in favor of this amendment. I believe it \nwill have well over 60 this time.\n  Unfortunately, despite the fact that a majority of Senators support \nthe legislation, Senator Kennedy and I have felt we need to look for \nopportunities where there is an obvious nexus between this needed law \nand a piece of legislation that is likely to move.\n  The last time, 13 Republicans voted in favor of this legislation. I \nurge more to do so at this time.\n  It is no secret that with all the turmoil on the issue of gays and \nlesbians and their rights in this country, there are very strong \nfeelings on both sides of this issue. I, for one, seek happiness for \ngays and lesbians in America. I believe in gay rights. But I also \nbelieve it is not right in the case of marriage for a few liberals to \ndictate to the rest of the country a new standard.\n\n  Notwithstanding that, I have always felt before you get to marriage, \nyou ought to get rid of hate. I say that as a man who has been married \nnearly 30 years now. And I think before we take up the issue of \nmarriage we ought to deal with the issue of hate crimes.\n  Back to the nexus between hate crimes and the defense of our Nation. \nTwo obvious examples come to mind.\n  In 1992, Navy Seaman Allen R. Schindler was brutally murdered by his \nshipmate Terry Helvey in Okinawa, Japan. Helvey beat and stomped \nSchindler to death simply because he was gay. He was attacked so \nviciously that he destroyed every organ in Schindler's body. He was so \nbadly beaten that Schindler's own mother could not identify him except \nby the remains of the tattoo on his arm. The medical examiner compared \nSchindler's injuries to those sustained by victims of fatal airplane \ncrashes.\n  In another tragic case, PFC Barry Winchell was forced outside his \nbarracks at Fort Campbell Army Base where he was stationed. In the \nearly morning hours of July 5, 1999, Winchell was repeatedly beaten \nwith a baseball bat by another Army private. He was beaten with such \nforce and his injuries so severe that he died shortly thereafter. Barry \nwas only 21, and he was murdered simply because he was gay.\n  As a nation--a nation that serves as the beacon of freedom and \nliberty everywhere--we simply cannot tolerate violence against people \nbased on their race, color, religion, or national origin.\n  No matter how far our Nation has come and the progress we have made \nin protecting civil rights for all Americans, there is much work that \nremains. You cannot fight terror abroad and accept terror at home. We \nhave had in this country hate crimes laws on our books for well over 30 \nyears. They were contested as to their legitimacy all the way to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. For conservatives who would argue we should not \nhave this as a category of crime, I simply respond it is a category of \ncrime. Motive has always been a category of crime and establishing \nwhether a crime has occurred. William Rehnquist, Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, now its Chief Justice, wrote the opinion. It is hard to \nthink of a more conservative Justice than Justice Rehnquist. But he is \nthe one who said hate crimes are not just legitimate, they are \nconstitutional.\n  So the question then becomes, if we have constitutional hate crimes \nlaws on the Federal books that cover race and religion, why not sexual \norientation? Is it because some hate them? Do some think it is not \nlegitimate to include them? I simply say that America, if it is to live \nup to its motto, e pluribus unum, must include them.\n  I think we all know too well the tragic story of James Byrd who was \ndragged to death in Texas because of his race. We all know the \ntragically heartrending story of Matthew Shepard who was beaten to \ndeath along a lonely stretch of Wyoming fence because he was hated--not \nbecause they wanted his watch or his wallet; they didn't like him \nbecause he was gay. So they beat him to death.\n  Why Federal hate crimes laws? Wyoming does not have them, but many \nStates do have hate crimes laws. Why isn't that enough?\n  Look at what happened in Wyoming. When this little town of Laramie \nbegan to pursue the issue, it took on national ramifications. They \ncould have used the help of the Federal Government and its resources. \nBut because of the nature of this hate crime--because it would involve \nsexual orientation and not race--the Federal authorities were not able \nto be of any assistance to this case in Wyoming. A Republican sheriff \nfrom Wyoming told me they could have used the help, and that he \nsupported this legislation based on his experience.\n  These last two Congresses, I have entered into the Record everyday \nstatements on hate crimes, actual hate crimes committed in our country. \nI have entered countless hate crime statements into the Record--over \n300 in the last 300 days we have been in session. I do it to raise \nawareness, not only about the severity of these crimes but to show the \nfrequency of these crimes.\n  As the Nobel laureate Eli Wiesel once said: ``To hate is to deny \nanother person's humanity.'' So I do it to remember the victims of \nthese hate crimes and to give a human face to this violence--to the \nmurderers of these men, the Navy man, the Army private, to Matthew \nShepard, to James Byrd.\n  These murders have shocked the Nation. To think that such virulent \nhatred of another person's skin or sexual orientation drove another to \ncommit such a heinous act is truly unthinkable, yet it has happened.\n  Hate crimes tear at the very fabric of our Nation. They seek to \nintimidate entire groups of Americans and as such divide our Nation. \nThese kinds of crimes do more than harm the victims. They terrorize our \nentire society and send a message of hate and intolerance to millions \nof Americans.\n  What can we do? We can pass this legislation. This legislation, known \nas the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, is a symbol that can \nbecome substance.\n  The law is a teacher, and we should teach our fellow Americans that \nbigotry will not be tolerated. The Federal Government must have the \npower to persuade, to pursue, and to prosecute when hate is the motive \nof violence against an American, no matter their race, sexual \norientation, religion, disability, or gender. By changing the law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to do so, to change hearts and minds, and in \nsome cases to change their vote, and to vote in favor of this \namendment. Don't go to marriage until we have gotten rid of hate.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the amendment from our distinguished \ncolleague from Oregon will require the attention of a number of \ncolleagues. While there was no specific agenda for the amendments \ntoday, as a matter of comity we need some time.\n  For the moment, I am wondering if we could put in a quorum so we can \nassert the availability of one or more Members who might wish to \naddress this. If not, there are other amendments which the Senator from \nMichigan and I are prepared to clear. Without any procedure by which it \nimpedes the Senate addressing the Senator's amendment, I am sure the \nSenator would be willing to lay the amendment aside for the purpose of \nclearing amendments.\n  Mr. SMITH. I would accommodate any colleagues in any sense of comity \nthat is appropriate to the Senate. I do want to vote. I do want to \ndebate. We do not need to take a lot of time. This has overwhelming \nbipartisan support. We do not mean to gum up this bill. As I believe \nthe chairman knows, this is offered in good faith. I know there are \nsome objections to it. It is fine to air those. But let's discuss it \nquickly and\n\n[[Page S6713]]\n\nvote on it so we can get on with the other defense issues.\n  Mr. WARNER. In no way do I indicate it would gum up the bill. I am \njust trying to address the procedure so colleagues on the other side \nare given the opportunity to come to the Senate. I am exploring that \nnow. It is a very serious amendment, and it deserves careful \nconsideration by the proponents as well as the opponents.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I know Senator Kennedy cosponsored this \nbill and has a major interest in this bill. We are trying to determine \nwhether he wishes to speak at this point.\n  For the reasons given by our chairman, I gather this amendment will \nbe laid aside until other colleagues who wish to have something to say \non it have that opportunity. We are checking also with Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. SMITH. I note that Senator Kennedy did not know I was coming here \ntoday, but I was told by good authority that if we wanted this included \nat all, we should include it today. I would very much like to make \navailable a time--a time agreement can be short--that includes remarks \nby Senator Kennedy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I don't know whether it is possible to enter into a time \nagreement. The chairman would have a better feel for that.\n  I am a strong supporter of this amendment and this effort of Senator \nSmith and Senator Kennedy. From my perspective, the sooner we vote on \nthis, the better. It is long overdue that it become law. I commend the \nSenator on this amendment and Senator Kennedy for his tenacity as well. \nI hope the chairman can work out with other colleagues who want to \nspeak on it in relation to some time agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3312, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think now the order of business is that \nwe have 2 minutes, as I remember, equally divided on the Dodd \namendment. Then we will proceed to a vote at 5:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleagues on the \nArmed Services Committee, the chairman, Senator Warner, and Senator \nLevin. I do not want to speak for the majority, but based on what \nSenator Warner said earlier, I believe he may be supportive of the \namendment. If that is the case, I welcome that.\n  Very briefly, the amendment is designed to provide reimbursement \ndollars for expenditures incurred by people in the military, their \nfamily members, or nonprofit organizations that have purchased body \narmor, additional protection for our men and women serving in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  There are limitations. There is a time-definite period during which \nthose acquisitions had to occur. The acquisitions must be approved by \nfield commanders rather than just the individuals. There is a dollar-\namount limitation of $1,100 on any purchase.\n  I do not know how widespread this is. I have commended the Armed \nServices Committee for substantially increasing the President's request \nof some $57 million to $262 million in this area, which I believe is \ngoing to tremendously assist in seeing to it that our men and women in \nuniform have whatever they need to allow them to perform their very \ndifficult functions in two very different and difficult theaters.\n  Certainly, having loved ones acquire this equipment is unacceptable \nto all of us. This amendment is designed to make whole those who have \nincurred the costs. Again, I am grateful to the Armed Services \nCommittee for what I assume is an indication of some support of the \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very \nimportant amendment to the Defense authorization bill. I have worked \nwith my colleague from Connecticut to draft an amendment that will \nreimburse U.S. troops serving in Iraq and Central Asia and their family \nmembers for flak jackets, weapons and other equipment they have bought \nout of their own pocket.\n  At the beginning of this war, the President claimed, ``We must always \nmake sure that America's soldiers are well-equipped and well trained to \nfight this war on terror.'' However, the administration has not \nprovided the adequate equipment the troops need to do their work, such \nas enough body armor or the most up to date Global Positioning Systems, \nGPS.\n  In March 2004, I traveled to Iraq with a group of Senators. I spoke \nto soldiers from all different types of units, both active duty and \nreservists. When I spoke to the brave members of our Armed Services, I \nwas appalled to hear that many of them needed higher quality flak \njackets, more modern, lighter rifles, and armor for their HUMVEE \nvehicles.\n  I have since learned that worried mothers and fathers throughout the \ncountry have gone to great lengths to purchase expensive equipment for \nsons or daughters, because they are dissatisfied with the inferior, \ninadequate equipment the Pentagon is providing.\n  In a few instances, parents in New Jersey and elsewhere have gone out \nand bought the equipment for their sons and daughters and shipped it \nthrough Federal Express to Iraq. I find this fact incredible. It is \nunconscionable that the parents of our service members and their loved \nones fighting on behalf of our country have been abandoned by the \ncivilian war planners at the Pentagon.\n  The administration, because of its inept planning and military \nmiscalculations has forced hardworking Americans to pay for equipment \nthat should be provided by the Armed Services.\n  Our amendment instructs the Secretary of Defense to immediately \nreimburse our courageous troops and their families for protective, \nsafety or health equipment they have purchased with their own funds. \nThis includes both the cost of the equipment itself and the shipping \ncosts.\n  The civilian Pentagon war planners have been planning the Iraq war \nsince 2002. That is two years to figure out how to get the correct body \narmor and lighter weapons to our troops. The Pentagon's inability to \nequip our young men and women who are sacrificing their lives on behalf \nof this country is just among many egregious, unforgivable mistakes \nthey have made.\n  I am deeply disappointed with the civilian war planners at the \nadministration and I hope through this amendment, the Senate will speak \non behalf of the over 170,000 U.S. personnel currently serving in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and their safety and protection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have indicated my support. I ask \nunanimous consent that I may proceed for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I had asked my colleague, in the course of our colloquy, \nand I think he agreed with me, that so much of this purchase of odd \npieces of equipment is anecdotal. You actually had a case in which you \nhad documentation. But a lot of the other instances are anecdotal. \nGiven the callup of so many people in the Reserves and Guard and so \nforth, coming loyally to do their duty, I think there had been some \nmisunderstanding. We agreed in the area of Humvees, the Army got a bit \nbehind on some of the modifications necessary. The Army got somewhat \nbehind on the body armor. But generally speaking, the U.S. military has \nbeen well supplied and well equipped, and no large numbers of them were \nsent into harm's way--in this particular situation, two of them in \nAfghanistan and Iraq--without the benefit of that equipment. We concur \non that.\n  But I am glad to assist the Senator and indicate a willingness to \nsupport the amendment in those isolated areas where in good faith \ncitizens of our community and the soldiers themselves bought bits and \npieces of equipment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have no information to argue with the \nconclusions of the chairman of the committee. My hope would be that is \nexactly the case. There are only a few isolated cases. If there are \nmore, we will discover that. But on the basis of what we know thus far, \nthere was a case in Connecticut, a serious one in Alabama, one in New \nJersey. There\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\nhave been others. Even if there are a few, they are a few too many. In \nthis case, we will provide some compensation for them as a result of \nthose acquisitions.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding the yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. We are prepared to move forward with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3312, as modified. The \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Harkin, \n     proposes amendment numbered 3316, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Expressing the sense of the Senate on Armed Forces Radio and \n                    Television Service programming)\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       Whereas it is the mission of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service to provide U.S. military commanders \n     overseas and at sea with a broadcast media resource to \n     effectively communicate DoD, Service-unique, theater, and \n     local command information to personnel under their commands \n     and to provide U.S. military members, DoD civilians, and \n     their families stationed outside the Continental U.S. and at \n     sea with the same type and quality of American radio and \n     television news, information, sports, and entertainment that \n     would be available to them if they were in the continental \n     U.S.; and\n       Whereas key principles of American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service broadcasting policy, as outlined in \n     Department of Defense Regulation 5120.20R, are to ensure \n     political programming characterized by fairness and balance \n     and to provide a free flow of political programming from U.S. \n     commercial and public networks without manipulation or \n     censorship of any news content to the men and women of the \n     Armed Forces and their dependents; and\n       Whereas the stated policy of the American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service is to select programming that represents a \n     cross-section of popular American radio and television \n     offerings and to emulate stateside scheduling and programming \n     seen and heard in the United States; and\n       Whereas it is the policy of American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service to select news and public affairs programs \n     for airing that provide balance and diversity from available \n     nationally recognized program sources, including broadcast \n     and cable networks, Headquarters, American Forces Radio and \n     Television Service, the military departments, and other \n     government or public service agencies. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       that the mission statement and policies of the American \n     Forces Radio and Television Service appropriately state the \n     goal of maintaining equal opportunity balance with respect to \n     political programming and that the Secretary of Defense \n     should therefore ensure that these policies are fully being \n     implemented by developing appropriate methods of oversight to \n     ensure presentation of all sides of important public \n     questions with the fairness and balance envisioned by the \n     Department of Defense throughout the American Forces Radio \n     and Television Service system.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3316) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3164, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WARNER. On behalf of Senator Gregg, I call up amendment No. 3164 \nthat expresses the sense of the Senate that the Internal Revenue \nService should provide further guidance to clarify under the tax laws \nthe rights and responsibility of employers who generously continue \npayments to employees who are mobilized Reserve or Guard members, and \non behalf of Senator Gregg, I send a modification to the desk and ask \nit be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for Mr. Gregg, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3164, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the coordination of \nrights under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights \n          Act of 1994 with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)\n\n       On page 280, after line 22, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1068. COORDINATION OF USERRA WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE \n                   CODE OF 1986.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Employers of reservists called up for active duty are \n     required to treat them as if they are on a leave of absence \n     or furlough under the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (in this section referred to \n     as ``USERRA'').\n       (2) USERRA does not require employers to pay reservists who \n     are on active duty, but many employers pay the reservists the \n     difference between their military stipends and their regular \n     salaries. Some employers provide this ``differential pay'' \n     for up to 3 years.\n       (3) For employee convenience, many of these employers also \n     allow deductions from the differential payments for \n     contributions to employer-provided retirement savings plans.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Internal Revenue Service should, to the extent it is \n     able within its authority, provide guidance consistent\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n     with the goal of promoting and ensuring the validity of \n     voluntary differential pay arrangements, benefits payments, \n     and contributions to retirement savings plans related \n     thereto.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, military action in Afghanistan and Iraq has \nbrought to light yet another example of how outdated and burdensome \ngovernment policies often punish generous employers in America. \nApparently, when it comes to companies showing respect for employees \nwho are called to active duty in the military, there is special meaning \nto the old cliche that ``no good deed goes unpunished.''\n  The National Committee for Employer Support for the Guard and \nReserve, a nationwide association, reports that over 2,500 employers \nhave signed a pledge of support and have gone above and beyond the \nrequirements of the law in support of their National Guard and Reserve \nemployees. This includes many of our Nation's largest and most \nreputable corporations, including 3M, McDonalds, Wal-Mart, Home Depot, \nLiberty Mutual and many others. These remarkable companies provide \nreservist employees who are on active duty with ``differential pay'' \nthat makes up the difference between their military stipend and \ncivilian salary.\n  National companies are not the only patriotic businesses providing \nspecial pay to our men and women who are called to serve overseas. Some \nof the most remarkable stories of corporate patriotism can be found in \nmy state of New Hampshire.\n  BAE Systems of Nashua provides differential pay to their 25 called-up \nemployees and continuing access to benefits to family members. The \ncompany even provides a stipend to make up the lost pay of active duty \nspouses of company employees when the spouse's employer is not able to \nprovide differential pay. The corporate culture of support for the \ntroops at BAE Systems is universal. Employees are encouraged to stay in \ntouch with the families of fellow employees on active duty to help out \nwhere they can, and to avoid the Vietnam Syndrome of isolation. When \nyou walk into BAE Systems headquarters, you cannot help but notice the \nflags of the branches of the United States armed services.\n  And then there is the story of Mr. Marian Noronha, Chairman and \nFounder of Turbocam, a manufacturer based in Dover, New Hampshire. An \nimmigrant from India, Mr. Noronha has not only provided his employees \nwith differential pay and continued family health benefits, but he has \nalso extended to each of his activated employees a $10,000 line of \ncredit. His active duty reservist and Guard employees have used this \nmoney to, among other things, purchase personal computers so their \nfamilies can communicate with them while they are overseas. Beyond \nthis, Mr. Noronha actively encourages other employers to treat their \nreservist employees in a similar manner.\n  Several other New Hampshire private-sector companies, including \nHitchiner Manufacturing Company in Milford, also have exemplary records \nwhen it comes to dealing with their employees in the Reserves and \nNational Guard.\n  Finally, New Hampshire's Governor Benson by Executive Order has also \nextended differential pay for up to 18 months to State employees who \nhave been called to active duty.\n  Unfortunately, an arcane IRS interpretation of tax law actually \npenalizes these kinds of employers that voluntarily pay their National \nGuard and reservist employees the difference between their military \nstipends and their previous civilian salaries--which appropriately is \ncalled ``differential pay.'' The law also penalizes employers that \ncontinue making contributions to retirement plans for such employees.\n  According to the IRS, members of the Guard and reserves called up for \nactive duty are required to be treated as if they are on a leave of \nabsence by their employers under the Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act of 1994, USERRA. Therefore, the act does not \nrequire employers to pay workers who are on active duty. However, many \nemployers--out of a sense of civic duty--continue to pay active duty \nGuard members and reservists the difference between their military \nstipends and their regular salaries with some employers providing such \n``differential pay'' for up to 3 years. In additions, many of these \nremarkable companies go even further and allow their active duty \nemployees to continue making contributions to their 401(k) retirement \nplans via deductions from the ``differential payments.''\n  However, rather than applauding and encouraging such selfless \nbehavior by companies in continuing to provide retirement benefits for \nReservists, the IRS's 1969 Revenue Ruling requires that the active duty \nworkers be treated as if they were ``terminated.'' As a result, this \nlaw then puts at risk the retirement plan for an employer's entire \nworkforce and could make all amounts in the plan immediately taxable to \nthe plan's participants and the employer. Adding to the absurdity of \nthe situation, preventing an employer from treating ``differential \npay'' as wages under the law means employers are prohibited from \nwithholding income taxes, which in turn causes their active duty former \nemployees to face large and unexpected tax bills at the end of the \nyear.\n  We should change this Vietnam War-era IRS interpretation of tax law \nthat actually penalizes responsible, caring, patriotic employers like \nBAE Systems, Hitchiner Manufacturing, and many other companies who \nvoluntarily provide differential pay. I have offered a bill to do just \nthat, S. 2448, but the problem could be corrected more appropriately \nand quickly by the Internal Revenue Service by revising the outdated \nrevenue ruling that effectively discourages employers from providing \nadditional pay to their employees who are reservists or Guard members \ncalled to active duty. The sense of the Senate amendment I am offering \ntoday urges the Internal Revenue Service to reconsider the \nramifications of applying a Vietnam-era revenue ruling to the \nprevailing circumstances of the present day.\n  Specifically it expresses the sense of the Senate that the IRS \nshould, ``to the extent it is able within its authority, provide \nguidance consistent with the goal of promoting and ensuring the \nvalidity of voluntary differential pay arrangements, benefits payments, \nand contributions related thereto.''\n  Employers should not be penalized for the generosity they provide to \nour nation's reservists and members of the Guard. This sense of the \nSenate urges the Internal Revenue Service to help employers avoid these \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent a newsletter be printed \nin the Record from BAE Systems titled ``Connections,'' published last \nmonth, that outlines the differential pay benefits that BAE provides \ntheir employees called up to active National Guard or Reserve duty.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n BAE Systems Spouses Get Support While Loved Ones Are Miles Away From \n                                  Home\n\n       Marine Corps Reserve Sgt. Hunter Philbrick returned to his \n     civilian job as a Milford, N.H., police officer in January. \n     His year-long military deployment in support of the War on \n     Terrorism was made a little easier by BAE Systems' support \n     for his family.\n       Sgt. Philbrick's wife Tina--a senior program control \n     administrator on the F/A-22 program--says the Company helped \n     to ease the difficulties of her husband's absence. Philbrick \n     is one of four Information & Electronic Warfare Systems (IEWS \n     employees whose non-BAE Systems spouses have been called to \n     active duty over the past few years.\n       ``It was really, really appreciated.'' says Philbrick.\n       ``IEWS is committed to supporting its Reservists,'' said \n     Jon Murphy, vice president of IEWS' Human Resources. ``IEWS' \n     policy goes well beyond the 1994 Uniformed Serviced \n     Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).''\n       IEWS' policy is so strong, a New Hampshire state legislator \n     recently attempted to model state policy after IEWS' outreach \n     towards its Reserve and Guard employees.\n       ``IEWS' policy is seen as a real beacon of support for our \n     Guard and Reserve employees and their families.'' said Dennis \n     Viola of the State Veterans Council. ``When we asked Ted Kerr \n     of the New Hampshire Guard office about company policies to \n     emulate, he didn't hesitate to mention BAE Systems and Public \n     Service of New Hampshire.''\n       IEWS employs 72 U.S. military Reservists or National \n     Guardsmen and women. Nine of these employees, currently on \n     active duty, support operations Nobel Eagle, Enduring \n     Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom. Four other employees have non-BAE \n     Systems spouses also called to active duty.\n       ``Anything the Company does for members of the military and \n     their families is really appreciated'' Said Philbrick.\n       BAE Systems does all it can to support men and women in \n     uniform and that includes employees who are ``Citizen \n     Soldiers'' by\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\n     serving in the National Guard and Reserve. Not only do we \n     support those directly serving in the Armed Forces, but we're \n     also here to help the families of troops. Whether it's \n     through a Charity Challenge bike drive where employees raise \n     money and donate time to build bikes for distribution to \n     local military families, or through a business unit stipend, \n     we stand behind men and women who choose to serve our \n     country. Support may vary somewhat between business units and \n     locations, but the desire to do the right thing is always \n     there.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3164) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay the \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3295\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I call up an amendment on behalf of the \nSenator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, amendment No. 3295. My understanding is \nit has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3295) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3307\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I call up an amendment on behalf of Senator \nHarry Reid. I believe it is No. 3307.\n  Mr. WARNER. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment provides for parallel \ncompensation for our POWS from the first gulf war. I think the language \nis at the desk.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the hard work of these two great \nSenators. I especially appreciate their recognizing the importance of \nthis amendment. We had 17 American prisoners of war, and they were \ntreated very brutally, with jaws broken, electricity applied to various \nparts of their body. A number of the 17 have permanent damages as a \nresult of this brutal treatment.\n  They had a large judgment at one time. It was opposed by the Justice \nDepartment. Last week, that was knocked out.\n  I simply want, as the ranking member of the committee said, that \nthese POWs who were so brutalized have equal treatment with the Iraqis \nwho were brutalized in the prison in Iraq. This does not call for a \nspecific sum of money. It just says the Defense Department must come up \nwith a plan for these 17 people before we agree to anything for the \nIraqis who the Secretary of Defense has said should be compensated.\n  It is the fair thing to do. We have these 17 brave American patriots \nwho feel put down by their Government for having had Saddam Hussein's \nmoney at one time taken away from them.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of our \ndistinguished Democratic leader. The amendment is carefully thought \nthrough. It should be given to these men and families.\n  I would like to be added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me add my thanks to the Senator from \nNevada for, as always, looking out for the interests of our troops, the \nmen and women in the Armed Forces. Where it is necessary to make up for \nfailures, he is the first to find ways to do that. It is a very \nimportant function of this Senate. I commend the Senator.\n  I ask to be added, also, as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3307) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while I have the attention of the two \nmanagers of the bill, just so other Senators have an idea of what we on \nthis side are planning on doing, I have consulted with the \ndistinguished manager of the bill on our side. Senator Crapo is going \nto try to offer an amendment sometime tomorrow. Once that is resolved \none way or the other, the next Democratic amendment in order will be by \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois. So that is going to be our \nnext amendment in order following the Crapo amendment. We are having a \nfew little parliamentary problems with that right now, but we will work \non that through the evening and tomorrow.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot think I will, I just want to clarify the situation. I would have to \nobject now to any further amendments being laid down tonight.\n  Mr. REID. No. If my distinguished friend will yield, Mr. President, \nwhat I simply said is that it is my understanding the next Republican \namendment in order is the Crapo amendment. We have an objection on our \nside at this time that that amendment be laid down.\n  Mr. WARNER. Right.\n  Mr. REID. We are going to try to resolve that. What I indicated is \nthat following that amendment, we would likely go to Senator Durbin, \nunless Senator Cantwell wants to offer hers. But those are our next two \namendments in order, and the next one will either be Cantwell or \nDurbin, whenever she decides she wants to offer hers. That is just an \nagreement so people know what we are trying to do on our side.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I hope we are not asking for any unanimous consent \nto lock anything in. You are simply notifying the Senate. I would like \nto be cooperative to see that sequence of events transpires. So at this \ntime there will not be a laying down of an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. Until we get the matter resolved with \nSenator Cantwell and Senator Hollings, we will not be able to go to the \nCrapo amendment. We are going to work on that. But after that, we have \na number of amendments on our side that we want to offer, and I have \nindicated to the Chair what we plan to do.\n  Mr. WARNER. So we have had a colloquy in which we have indicated this \nis the manner in which we hope to proceed. We will have the Kennedy \namendment first. Once that is concluded--presumably there will be a \nrollcall vote--then we will proceed to the next amendment. It is a \nRepublican that is in the queue. It is likely to be Mr. Crapo. At that \ntime, I hope this matter will be resolved so there can be this sequence \nof events.\n  Mr. REID. One reason I want to do this, I say through the Chair to \nthe distinguished managers, is that Senator Durbin is a very patient \nman. He has actually three amendments. He is only going to offer one at \nthis time. He always is willing to wait until someone else does \nsomething else, and in this instance we believe he should be one of \nthose first Democratic amendments offered because he has been ready to \ngo for some time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that choice is entirely on your side. If \nthat is your wish, I think, in all likelihood, it will take place.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am not sure who has the floor at this \nmoment.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this point in time the Chair is perfectly in order to \nrecognize the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Warner, and his ranking member, Senator Levin, for \ntheir endurance and patience.\n  This is an extremely important bill with many important issues. I say \nto the Senators, you have served the Senate well, both of you, in the \nmanner you have handled this bill. Many of us with amendments that we \nconsider of importance have stepped back, some\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\nbecause of events, such as the departure and the demise of President \nReagan, and others because of other issues.\n  It is my understanding that there will not be a unanimous consent \nrequest tonight in terms of the order of business. I am not going to \nmake one. I thank Senator Reid for acknowledging that I do have several \namendments pending. I am anxious to call up the amendments. I will \nagree to time limits on debate so this will not go on for a lengthy \nperiod. I would just like to bring the matters to the floor for \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, does the Senator from Illinois have the \nnumber of the amendment he is likely to propose in the event the \nsequence of events as outlined by the three Senators here, momentarily, \nevolves?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I spoke to him earlier \nabout an amendment relative to the policy on torture. That is amendment \nNo. 3386. But I would like to defer that until the Senator from \nVirginia has had a chance to review it, in the hopes he will be \nsupportive.\n  Another amendment is No. 3196, reservist pay. This is an amendment \nwhich passed the Senate with a 96-to-3 vote last year, which I am \nhoping we can make a part of this bill. Finally, I have an amendment \nrelative to the sale of dietary supplements on base exchanges, \namendment No. 3225. Those are the three amendments I have pending.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator, thank you.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think that concludes the matters with regard to \nthis bill for tonight. I believe we can now proceed to wrap-up session.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6722-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I pay special tribute to Nancy Reagan who \nhas been indispensable throughout the public life of the Reagans, and \nparticularly during this past decade. It was my privilege to sit beside \nMrs. Reagan during several White House and Republican Party events and \nto understand her strength and shared dream for America.\n  The service of President Reagan to our country can only be approached \nby understanding how wide he cast the net of potential achievement, and \nfulfillment of dreams, hopes and visions.\n  President Reagan actually believed and articulated that our country \nhad a special destiny, that no barriers were insurmountable because we \nare Americans. He actually believed and said that the Soviet Union was \nan evil empire, that its political and economic institutions were \ndisintegrating, and that if its leadership and people knew the \nalternatives which our country presented, they would choose democracy \nand market economics.\n  President Reagan was prepared to invest an increasing portion of our \nnational treasure in military defense with the certainty that we would \nnegotiate successfully with our adversaries from a position of \nstrength. He shocked foreign policy and defense specialists by \nproposing that all intermediate nuclear missiles be destroyed, a \nnegotiating position labeled universally as a bizarre arms-control non-\nstarter.\n  He affirmed the staying power of NATO by deploying Pershing missiles \nto Germany and cruise missiles to Italy even after the Soviets declared \nthat such deployment would end all arms control negotiations and \nstimulate Soviet nuclear buildup.\n  Add to this, President Reagan's startling proposal that the United \nStates should develop a Strategic Defense Initiative to protect our \ncountry against incoming missiles fired upon us. He contended that we \nshould and could try to defend ourselves against the so-called balance \nof terror.\n  He proposed to President Gorbachev that the United States and the \nSoviet Union ban all nuclear weapons. In fact, he was confident that if \nhe could take Gorbachev on an extended tour of America that Gorbachev \nwould want to shape the Soviet Union into many of our successful \ntraditions.\n  Meanwhile, President Reagan knew that substantial new growth must \noccur in our domestic economy to pay for the special leadership role he \nhad envisioned in foreign policy. He was confident that substantial \ncuts in individual marginal tax rates and a host of investment \nincentives would establish and sustain the longest peacetime prosperity \nwe had ever enjoyed. Our prosperity underwrote the magnificent gains in \nfree and fair trade which he championed and world wide wealth grew \nabundantly.\n  When Ronald Reagan stood on a balcony of the Reichstag in Berlin and \nchallenged Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall, he could see white \ncrosses just below where courageous persons seeking freedom had lost \ntheir lives in that pursuit. Everything still appeared to be so locked \nup and grim, and sophisticated observers were barely patronizing in \ncomment on his Berlin wall challenge.\n  The ``evil empire'' crumbled, the Berlin wall and other walls fell, \nall of the Intermediate Nuclear Force weapons were destroyed exactly in \nthree years as the INF Treaty provided, and the United States became \nthe only superpower with the strongest economy and the ability, \nuniquely, to extend military authority around the world.\n  All of this occurred because President Reagan persuaded the Congress \nand his countrymen to build our armed forces, to build our economy \nthrough the growth incentives termed ``Reaganomics,'' to maintain the \nsuccessful strategies of our NATO alliance, to utilize military force \nto support foreign policy as required, and to commence Strategic \nDefense Initiative research.\n  We now know that the Soviets were much weaker than experts estimated. \nWe now know that they could not keep up the pace and that desperate \nattempts to do so led to the collapse of the Soviet Empire and then to \nthe collapse of the Union, itself.\n  President Reagan advocated two more things which were inspiring and \ncritically important in world history.\n  First, he rejected the Brezhnev Doctrine, the idea that territory \nwhich socialism had occupied could never be reclaimed. When he \nadvocated this roll back of the iron curtain, he created deep anxiety \nand alarm among most international foreign policy advisers who loved \nliberty a lot, but loved stability even more.\n  U.S. Stinger missiles shipped to the expert ministrations of the \nMujadahin in Afghanistan were a major instrument of the Soviet roll \nback, and the world watched in awe as the Soviet troops withdrew to a \nsmaller Socialist world.\n  Second, President Reagan enunciated a new policy in a statement sent \nto the Congress after the Philippine election and revolution. He stated \nthat henceforth, we would oppose tyranny of the left and tyranny of the \nright, that we were for democracy developed by people who sought to \nknow and enjoy democracy and human rights. This statement was severely \ncriticized by experts who suggested that in the ``real world'' a good \nnumber of dictators were friendly to the U.S. and certainly useful in \nwaging the cold war against Communism.\n  In articulating his vision on the roll back of the Iron Curtain; in \nidentifying with nations all over the world who applauded our passion \nfor building democratic institutions; in celebrating human rights and \nfree market principles; in all of these areas, Ronald Reagan was far \nahead of the prevailing wisdom. Yet he ultimately brought other leaders \nin America and around the world to his point of view in a relatively \nshort interval.\n  President Reagan was courageous and on the right side of history. He \nperformed these deeds in a very public way which instructed and \ninspired others. Those of us in public service learned much from \nPresident Reagan as we watched him speak and act. He was charismatic, \nhe was determined and consistent, and he enjoyed a remarkable batting \naverage of being right.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, at sunset last Friday, the 40th \nPresident of the United States was laid to rest on a hill overlooking \nthe Pacific Ocean. The consummate optimist, who etched the promise of a \n``shining city upon a\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\nhill'' into the Nation's conscience, leaves behind a legacy that \nbeckons us to stay true to the American spirit.\n  Whether folks agree with his political philosophy or not, the actor-\nturned-politician-turned-statesman from the Midwest helped usher in the \ndawn of a new day for millions of jobless Americans and to those living \nin oppression behind the Iron Curtain.\n  Through bold, buoyant leadership, Ronald Wilson Reagan, 1911-2004, \npersuaded his fellow citizens that it was ``morning again in America'' \nby restoring the promise of peace and prosperity.\n  The outpouring of support during last week's remembrance for the \nformer President reflects Reagan's ability to bring out the best in \npeople and unite America.\n  The pageantry evoked patriotism. The solemnity of the events \nunderscored the public's appreciation and respect for this leader who \nchampioned the cause of freedom all around the world. For 8 years, he \nserved as a beacon of hope for those cast under the dark shadows of \ntotalitarianism.\n  The ``Great Communicator'' arrived in the Oval Office when America \nwas licking wounds left by Watergate and Vietnam. Stifled by a sinking \neconomy, joblessness and sky-high inflation, the national mood also \nwavered under the uncertainty of the Cold War. Americans yearned for \nbrighter days.\n  Elected to his first term in November 1980, President Reagan exuded \noptimism, charm and kinship with ordinary Americans. His good-natured \ndisposition, self-deprecating humor and can-do attitude launched a new \nera in American politics. Like Reagan, I won an upset victory over an \nincumbent in that election.\n  He and I shared a conservative political philosophy rooted in core \nbeliefs spelled out by the Nation's Founders and agreed much more often \nthan not. Now 24 years after the ``Reagan Revolution,'' I am privileged \nto continue advancing our shared principles: Big ideas instead of big \ngovernment. Deregulation to foster free enterprise. Tax relief that \nencourages productivity, growth and individual ingenuity. Self-reliance \nrather than self-pity.\n  Reagan's policies proved that economic and political freedom bring \nabout peace and prosperity. As Reagan said in his 1989 farewell address \nto the Nation: ``Democracy, the profoundly good, is also the profoundly \nproductive.''\n  Many people grossly underestimated the strength of Reagan's \nconvictions and the foot soldiers who helped sweep him into office. \nWith a steely determination coupled with folksy charm, Reagan \nmasterminded the efforts that liberated Eastern Europe in 1989.\n  Eight years earlier, he had predicted the end of Communism as the \n``sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now \nbeing written.'' Reagan's leadership helped change the course of \nhistory for the better.\n  On June 5, 2004, Reagan lost his 10-year battle with the Alzheimer's \ndisease. A decade earlier, in a hand-written note to the American \npeople, Reagan again looked on the bright side: ``When the Lord calls \nme home, whenever that day may be, I will leave with the greatest love \nfor this country of ours and eternal optimism for its future.''\n  President Reagan valued the gift of life. He used his to expand human \nfreedom. His legacy shapes America's character and lights our way as we \ncontinue the ``march to freedom'' against evil in the world.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today in great sadness, to speak \non the passing of President Ronald Wilson Reagan. It is a sad time for \nour Nation; a monumental figure in the history of the United States has \ngone to his rest. The response to his passing in our Nation's capital \nand across this country has been overwhelming and a fitting tribute to \nthis giant of 20th century politics.\n  First, I would like to offer my heartfelt condolences to Nancy and \nthe Reagan family in this difficult time. Mrs. Reagan was not only an \nincredible role model for faithfulness to her spouse, but was always \nthe rock that he leaned on when the entire world leaned on him.\n  In speeches on this floor, we have heard much about President \nReagan's vision and leadership on foreign and economic policy, which \nindeed continue to bear fruit. Yet, I come to the floor to speak about \nan aspect of the Reagan Presidency that is less commented upon: \nPresident Reagan's legacy on social policy, which stands still as a \nmoral compass for our Nation's future.\n  As has been remarked, President Reagan was a fabulous optimist. He \nworked to create a society where good and evil, life and death, are \nrecognized for what they are, and are not obscured by the gray tones of \nmoral relativism. After years of lingering malaise following Vietnam \nand Watergate, Ronald Reagan came forward and proclaimed that America \nwas ``in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal.'' That \nwas a message of hope that America sorely needed to hear.\n  He believed that America's strength came not just from military \nmight, but also from its moral superiority. As much of a priority as he \nmade foreign and military policy, he strived just as hard to ensure \nthat our Nation's roots as a people of faith, who value life and each \nother, was not diminished. It was that social foundation that made us \ndifferent from the godless Soviet state that oppressed the Russian \npeople.\n  President Reagan spoke forcefully and brilliantly about the \nimportance of family, the religious foundations of American democracy, \nand the tragedy of Roe v. Wade. He knew that strong families were a key \nto America's continued success as the land of opportunity. This \nconviction is clear in a proclamation he issued one Father's Day, where \nhe asserted:\n\n       There is no institution more vital to our Nation's survival \n     than the American family. Here the seeds of personal \n     character are planted, the roots of public virtue first \n     nourished. Through love and instruction, discipline, guidance \n     and example, we learn from our mothers and fathers the values \n     that will shape our private lives and our public citizenship.\n\n  His political beliefs were greatly shaped by the sensible religion he \ngrew up with in small-town Illinois, which permeated all aspects of \ndaily life. He found the attempts of some to excise religion from the \npublic square wrong-headed. He knew that Founding Fathers barred not \nonly the government establishment of religion, but also any law \n``prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''\n  As President Reagan told those gathered at the Ecumenical Prayer \nBreakfast during the Republican National Convention in Dallas, TX:\n\n       Without God, there is no virtue, because there's no \n     prompting of the conscience. Without God, we're mired in the \n     material, that flat world that tells us only what the senses \n     perceive. Without God, there is a coarsening of the society. \n     And without God, democracy will not and cannot long endure. \n     If we ever forget that we're one nation under God, then we \n     will be a nation gone under.\n\n  I began this speech by stating I would focus of President Reagan's \nmoral and social legacy rather than on the tremendous impact he had in \nbringing down the Iron Curtain and freeing Eastern Europe. But in \ntruth, these different areas of policy all flowed from the same \nwellspring of faith and conscience.\n  In a particularly moving speech before the National Religious \nBroadcasters Convention in 1984, President Reagan tied together these \nseemingly separate strands. He told listeners:\n\n       Our mission stretches far beyond our borders: God's family \n     knows no borders. In your life, you face daily trials, but \n     millions of believers in other lands face far worse. They are \n     mocked and persecuted for the crime of loving God. To every \n     religious dissident trapped in that cold, cruel existence, we \n     send our love and support. Our message? You are not alone; \n     you are not forgotten; do not lose your faith and hope \n     because someday you, too, will be free.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a larger excerpt of this \nspeech be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Ronald Reagan was a champion of the pro-life movement \nand believed that abortion was a grave threat to the liberties we \ncherish as Americans. When President Reagan came to office, the shock \nof Roe v. Wade was still fresh. It was commonly believed that the \nSupreme Court had had the final say on abortion, and that there was no \nhope in turning back the tide of the abortion-on-demand culture. The \nconventional wisdom was that enacting legislation to regulate abortion \nwas politically impossible.\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\n  But President Reagan chose to use the one tool that the Senate could \nnot stall and the House could not block: his voice. His voice was \nstrong and reassuring, and it reached the American people in their \nliving rooms, bypassing those in Washington who thought they knew much \nbetter. Even his own advisors urged him not to speak out on abortion, \nyet he would not be silenced. He always spoke his conscience on the \nmatters that weighed heavily on his heart, and no one could convince \nhim to do otherwise.\n  On the tenth anniversary of Roe v. Wade, President Reagan spoke from \nthe heart against the abortion-on-demand culture, to poignant effect. \nThat day, he said:\n\n       I too have always believed that God's greatest gift is \n     human life, and that we have a duty to protect the life of an \n     unborn child. Until someone can prove the unborn child is not \n     a life, shouldn't we give it the benefit of the doubt, and \n     assume it is?\n\n  Perhaps the only President to publish a book while in the Oval \nOffice, President Reagan's 1984 volume, entitled Abortion and the \nConscience of the Nation, stood as a thoughtful and moving essay that \ninspired the growing pro-life movement. This message of this book was \nhopeful. ``As a nation today, we have not rejected the sanctity of \nhuman life,'' he writes. ``I am convinced that Americans do not want to \nplay God with the value of human life.''\n  Given his remarkable legacy on foreign and economic policy, I am not \nsurprised that his moral agenda is less commented upon. Yet in his \nMarch 8, 1983 ``evil empire'' speech, President Reagan devoted as much \ntime talking about the sanctity of all human life as he did addressing \nforeign policy. On abortion, he told the audience:\n\n       Human life legislation ending this tragedy will someday \n     pass the Congress, and you and I must never rest until it \n     does.\n\n  Sadly, President Reagan has gone to his rest without being able to \nsee that glorious day when we again recognize the full and equal value \nof all human lives. But those of us who proudly follow in his footsteps \nwill tirelessly continue the struggle until we correct this grievous \nwrong.\n  President Reagan, that day, I know you will be smiling down on us \nfrom above.\n\n                               Exhibit 1 \n\n          ``America is Hungry for a Spiritual Revival . . . ''\n\n\n                           (By Ronald Reagan)\n\n       An excerpt from President Reagan's address January 30, \n     1984, at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention in \n     Washington D.C.\n       I was pleased last year to proclaim 1983 The Year of the \n     Bible. But, you know, a group called the A.C.L.U. severely \n     criticized me for doing that. Well, I wear their indictment \n     like a badge of honor. I believe I stand in pretty good \n     company. Abraham Lincoln called the Bible, ``The best gift \n     God has given to man. But for it,'' he said, ``we could not \n     know right from wrong.''\n       Like that image of George Washington kneeling in prayer in \n     snow at Valley Forge, Lincoln described a people who knew it \n     was not enough to depend on their own courage and goodness. \n     They must also look to God their Father and Preserver. And \n     their faith to walk with Him, and trust in His Word, brought \n     them the blessings of comfort, power, and peace that they \n     sought.\n       The torch of their faith has been passed from generation to \n     generation. ``The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, but the \n     word of our God shall stand forever.'' More and more \n     Americans believe that loving God in their hearts is the \n     ultimate value. My experience in this office I hold has only \n     deepened a belief I've held for many years: within the cover \n     of that single Book are all the answers to all the problems \n     that face us today--if we'd only read and believe.\n       Let's begin at the beginning. God is the center of our \n     lives: the human family stands at the center of society: and \n     our greatest hope for the future is in the faces of our \n     children. God's most blessed gift to His family is the gift \n     of life. He sent us the Prince of Peace as a babe in a \n     manger. I've said that we must be cautious in claiming God is \n     on our side. I think the real question we must answer is, are \n     we on His side?\n       Our mission stretches far beyond our borders: God's family \n     knows no borders. In your life, you face daily trials, but \n     millions of believers in other lands face far worse. They are \n     mocked and persecuted for the crime of loving God. To every \n     religious dissident trapped in that cold, cruel existence, we \n     send our love and support. Our message? You are not alone; \n     you are not forgotten; do not lose your faith and hope \n     because someday you, too, will be free.\n       If the Lord is our light, our strength and our salvation, \n     whom shall we fear? Of whom shall we be afraid? No matter \n     where we live, we have a promise from Jesus that can soothe \n     our sorrows, heal our hearts and drive away our fears. He \n     promised there will never be a dark night that does not end. \n     Our weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the \n     morning. He promised if our hearts are true, His love will be \n     as sure as sunlight. And, by dying for us, Jesus showed how \n     far our love should be ready to go: all the way.\n       ``For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten \n     Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish but \n     have everlasting life . . . '' Helping each other, believing \n     in Him, we need never be afraid. We will be part of something \n     far more powerful, enduring and good than all the forces here \n     on earth. We will be part of a paradise.\n       May God keep you always and may you always keep God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6724-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6724-S6725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RONALD REAGAN\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor and remember the \ngreatest President of the 20th century, Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  Ronald Reagan is widely known for taking some of the most courageous \nstands on behalf of our Nation and for truly changing the course of the \nworld, but Ronald Reagan may have never known the impact that he had on \nso many individuals, including me.\n  I was in college when Ronald Reagan swept through our country in \n1980--on a mission to empower Americans by reducing taxes, shrinking \nthe Federal bureaucracy, and instilling a sense of hope for the future. \nUntil that point, I had always considered myself a Democrat. Ronald \nReagan's straight talk and emphasis on common sense and individual \nempowerment changed the way I looked at politics. As Ronald Reagan used \nto say--and he would know--I became ``a former Democrat who saw the \nlight.'' He opened my eyes to a philosophy that I truly felt could \nchange the direction of our country.\n  I was not alone. President Reagan's popularity while in the Oval \nOffice for two terms showed that Americans--Republicans, Democrats, and \nindependents--were inspired by him the way I was. More impressively, \ntens of thousands of Americans are mourning his death and reflecting on \nhow he touched and changed their lives. The endless line of mourners, \nwaiting for hours to walk past his coffin and pay final respects, is \nunparalleled. The most heartwarming for me is to see parents with their \nchildren, teaching them about the legacy of this great President and \nhopefully instilling a dose of Reagan optimism in the next generation.\n  There are many lessons to teach our children about Ronald Reagan. I \nknow I will teach them to my own children.\n  Respect for others: Many of the stories that are being shared by \nthose who knew Ronald Reagan revolve around his respect for all people. \nWhether it was someone who washed dishes in the White House or the \nleader of another Nation, Ronald Reagan treated each with the same \namount of dignity and respect--and loving humor.\n  Commitment to principles: Ronald Reagan never shied away from his \nprinciples. His steadfast commitment led to monumental changes in the \nworld landscape--making it a better place for all of us. On Memorial \nDay 1986, President Reagan said at Arlington National Cemetery:\n\n       If we really care about peace, we must stay strong. If we \n     really care about peace, we must, through our strength, \n     demonstrate our unwillingness to accept an ending of the \n     peace. We must be strong enough to create peace where it does \n     not exist and strong enough to protect it where it does. \n     That's the lesson of this century. . . .\n\n  And that is a lesson from our 40th President.\n  Mutural love and admiration: I would be remiss if I did not note the \nrelationship that Ronald and Nancy Reagan shared. Reading some of their \nold love letters, watching them together during his presidency, and \nseeing her devotion over these most trying last 10 years, one cannot \nhelp but be touched by the feelings that emanated from their marriage. \nNancy Reagan was every bit Ronald Reagan's partner in the White House, \nand his legacy is theirs. Today Nancy Reagan grieves--she has lost her \nsoul mate. And we grieve for her loss.\n  Optimism and hope for tomorrow: If nothing else, I hope that \nAmericans today are inspired by Ronald Reagan's eternal optimism. He \nbelieved in this country and its people with every fiber of his being. \nHe once told a gathering of youth in 1985 that:\n\n       True wealth, and the real hope for the future comes from \n     the heart--from the treasure of ideas and spirit, from free \n     people with a vision of the future, trust in their fellow \n     men, and faith in God. The better future that\n\n[[Page S6725]]\n\n     we all yearn for will not be built by skeptics who spend \n     their lives admiring the complexity of the problems. It'll be \n     built by free men and women who believe in themselves.\n\n  I know Ronald Reagan is in a better place today, and, from his view, \nhe is rooting for us and believing in our future.\n  Leaders like Ronald Reagan change the course of history with their \nvision and inspire a new generation. I serve Nevada in the United \nStates Senate because I, too, was inspired by Ronald Reagan. Today, I \nthank him from the bottom of my heart for his service to this nation, \nfor his unwavering leadership, and for his spirit that will always \nrepresent our greatness and remind us that we can achieve anything.\n  President Reagan, may God bless you and watch over you. And may God \ncontinue to bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6725-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6725-S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FLAG DAY AND THE BIRTHDAY OF THE ARMY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, our Nation celebrates two birthdays \ntoday.\n  On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress agreed to forge, from \nseveral different State militias, one single Army to fight America's \nWar of Independence.\n  Congress called for 10 companies of expert rifleman to be raised from \namong the colonies of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia and ordered \nthem to march to Boston to meet the British Army.\n  Two years later, Congress established a flag for the young Army to \nfight under.\n  With the war still raging, and the future of the Revolution very much \nin doubt, the Continental Congress decreed it ``Resolved, That the Flag \nof the 13 United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white; \nThat the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a \nnew constellation.''\n  In a way, the entire history of our Nation is contained within these \nevents. From diverse parts, America set forth to create a single \nnation, founded on common values and a shared vision for its future.\n  Struggling against the preeminent military power of its age, our \nFounding Fathers looked upon the different rebellions waged by State \nmilitia, independent of one another, taking place throughout the \ncolonies, and determined that if the 13 colonies were to share a single \nfate, it would be best if we chose to meet it together.\n  The design of the new American flag reflected that wisdom and \nsymbolizes the union of disparate parts. While the 13 stripes and the \n13 stars represented the different colonies, the colors signified the \ncommon values that bound us together as a nation. Red for valor. White \nfor liberty. Blue for justice.\n  Today, Old Glory is America's most treasured national symbol. It \ncaptures the imagination of both young and old because, in a way, each \nAmerican is represented.\n  Each of us can see among the stars in the deep blue field one star \nthat represents our State, our neighborhood, ourselves. And in the 13 \nstripes representing the colonies that banded together, each of us can \nalso feel the connection to our history.\n  In this way, the flag is alive. Each American adds to its meaning and \nsignificance through the work we do to build our Nation.\n  Few expressed this better than Franklin Lane, Woodrow Wilson's \nSecretary for the Interior. Speaking to a group of civil servants in \n1914, Secretary Lane imagined a conversation with, as he called it, \n``Mr. Flag.''\n  ``Yesterday,'' the Flag tells Lane, ``the President spoke a word that \nmade happier the future of ten million . . . but that act looms no \nlarger on the Flag than the struggle which the boy in Georgia is making \nto win the Corn Club prize this summer. . . .\n  ``Yesterday the Congress spoke a word which will open the door of \nAlaska; but a mother in Michigan worked from sunrise until far into the \nnight, to give her boy an education. She, too, is making the Flag.\n  ``Yesterday we made a new law to prevent financial panics, and \nyesterday, maybe a schoolteacher in Ohio taught his first letters to a \nboy who will one day write a song that will give cheer to the millions. \n. . . We are all making the Flag. I am your belief in yourself, your \ndream of what a people may become . . . I am no more than what you \nbelieve me to be and I am all that you believe I can be. . . . I am \nwhat you make me; nothing more.''\n  Looking back at 227 years under Old Glory, the American people can be \nproud of what we have made the flag. Throughout the world it is \nrecognized as a symbol of freedom and valor.\n  And, there can be no doubt, few American institutions have done more \nto make this true than the United States Army, the oldest institution \nin the world dedicated to defending a democracy.\n  In its 229 years, the Army has engaged in more than 175 different \ncampaigns to defend our Nation, and to defend freedom throughout the \nworld.\n  As we celebrate the Army and the incalculable contributions it has \nmade to the life of our Nation, and the world, members of the Army are \nonce again far from their families, fighting shoulder to shoulder, to \nextend freedom's reach throughout the world.\n  Each day, we see new examples of the courage, loyalty, and fortitude \nthat have been hallmarks of the Army since its birth more than two \ncenturies ago.\n  The stories of the heroism of Army troops rescuing our Nation from a \npivotal moment are too numerous to count. But I would like to relate \none of my favorites from the War of 1812.\n  For the first 2 years of that war, the American forces had been \nbeaten badly by the British. The English generals had become openly \ncontemptuous of the American forces, which they considered little more \nthan a ragtag band of untrained and unprofessional conscripts.\n  As the British met the American Army on the banks of the Chippewa \nRiver, the British general looked out over the American Army and mocked \nthem as little more than a militia--the same forces they had been \nrouting for the past 2 years.\n  The British opened fire, expecting the Americans to scatter. But the \nArmy marched directly through the British fire.\n  Seeing a bravery and professionalism he had never encountered, the \nBritish general cried out, ``Those are regulars, by God.''\n  Soon, the Army troops had encircled the British forces, catching them \nin crossfire. The Battle of Chippewa was soon won, and it brought about \na turning point in the War of 1812, and the history of our young \nNation.\n  Countless times, the United States Army has stunned an enemy \ncommander by its discipline, its skill, and its bravery. But while \nAmerica continues to be awed by the achievements of the U.S. Army, we \nare no longer surprised.\n  Whether on the banks of the Chippewa, the fields of Gettysburg, the \nbanks of Normandy, or the streets of Baghdad, the U.S. Army continues \nto represent the best hopes and the best achievement of a single \nnation, united in common defense of its shared values and dreams.\n  They have brought honor and freedom to our Nation for 229 years. And \nwhile it is historical coincidence that the Army birthday and Flag Day \nfall together on June 14 each year, it is altogether fitting that they \ndo so.\n  The same values the Flag represents, the Army exemplifies and \ndefends. When we look upon the flag, we see the heroism with which our \nmilitary has defended it, and we are proud.\n  All this is represented in the American flag. And when Americans \npledge allegiance to the flag, it is this history, these values, these \nideals, to which we promise loyalty.\n  Knowing the power of the Pledge to unite Americans, I was encouraged \nto learn that the Supreme Court has rejected the recent challenge to \nthe constitutionality of the Pledge.\n  I have long believed in the constitutionality of the Pledge of \nAllegiance, and though the Supreme Court Decision was made on \nprocedural grounds, it represents a positive step forward in our \nefforts to affirm its central place in the life of our Nation.\n  In a simple way, the Pledge gives us the chance to reaffirm the \nhistory and values that bind us together--the history and values \nrepresented by our flag.\n  When I think of the importance of the flag to our country, I am \nreminded of the days after September 11, 2001.\n  One week after the attacks, I recall walking into the Hart Senate \nOffice Building to see American flags hanging\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\nfrom each window, on each of the eight floors of the building.\n  Like the individual stars standing united together, the Senate \noffices were spontaneously united in a pure and impromptu display of \npatriotism and loyalty.\n  If anyone ever had doubts about our Nation's resolve to persevere in \nthe face of terrorism, they would be put to rest at that moment.\n  As Franklin Lane said, each of us makes the Flag.\n  As we work to build our Nation and extend its ideals throughout the \nworld, we are extending the constellation of stars our Founding Fathers \nsaw in the 13 colonies. And today, the light of this constellation \nextends throughout the world.\n  This is what we celebrate on both Flag Day and the Army's birthday.\n  Each in its way reminds us of the continuing work of our Nation, to \ncreate a more perfect union, united under one flag, defended by one \nforce, and inspired by a shared vision of a future, as the Pledge \nstates, ``with liberty and justice for all.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6726-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AULD-BROKAW TRAIL DAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I recognize the Auld-Brokaw Trail \nDay that is scheduled for June 19, 2004, in Yankton, SD. This day-long \ninitiative is the culmination of years of hard work from numerous \nYankton leaders, including the Yankton Rotary Club, the Auld-Brokaw \nTrail Committee, the City of Yankton and the Yankton Parks and \nRecreation Department.\n  This day also represents the completion of Tom Brokaw and Meredith \nAuld Brokaw's vision to further enhance the community where they first \nmet nearly a half century ago.\n  Several years ago, Yankton leaders designed the concept for an \nexpansive walking trail as part of a flood mitigation project. Yankton \nraised $1 million for the Auld-Brokaw Trail, relying upon investments \nfrom residents--past and present. With a generous donation from the \nBrokaws, the dream soon became a reality. The city began construction \nin 2001.\n  As the trail began to take shape, an Outdoor Classroom to further \ncapitalize on the educational opportunities that it presented. The \npartnership that developed between the Brokaws, the Yankton Rotary Club \nand the Rotary Foundation is the way that most things get accomplished \nin my State--good people working together toward a shared vision.\n  The Outdoor Campus along the Auld-Brokaw Trail will feature flowers \nand grasses native to the South Dakota prairie. The nearly 3 acres of \nnatural lands will be a great resource to showcase the area's beauty. \nThe Yankton Chamber of Commerce has already found the Auld-Brokaw Trail \nto be a strong regional recreational attraction.\n  As we know all too well, Americans are spending less active time \noutdoors. This trend is having a negative impact on our country's \ncollective health, and I was pleased to learn that the Avera Sacred \nHeart Hospital in Yankton will sponsor health and walking programs \nalong the Auld-Brokaw Trail in conjunction with the upcoming events. A \nPilates demonstration, nutrition forum and community walk will teach \narea residents about the important contribution that the Auld-Brokaw \nTrail can make to the community's health.\n  The Auld-Brokaw Trail is an outstanding enhancement of Yankton's \nbeauty, and the Outdoor Classroom addition will strengthen the trail's \nattractiveness. I am pleased that Yankton residents will soon come \ntogether to celebrate the completion of this outstanding project, and I \nam proud to recognize this outstanding effort.\n  Tom and Meredith Brokaw's friendship began in high school. He went to \nBoys State, allowing him to have lunch with South Dakota Governor Joe \nFoss, a World War Congressional Medal of Honor winner. She went to \nGirls Nation, where she met President Eisenhower in the Rose Garden of \nthe White House. They were class leaders; Tom's broadcast career began \non KYNT Radio. Though they are far away geographically, their emotional \nbond remains strong.\n  ``The world in which I work and live is a long way from home,'' \nBrokaw wrote in his 2002 book, ``but the early bearings I took as a \nchild on the prairie, surrounded by working people and the communities \nthey established, often in difficult circumstances, have been a \nsteadying and reassuring presence. They are familiar markers and \nsentinels, useful and reliable even now, forty years after I left the \nland and the people that launched me.''\n  Yankton continues to be blessed by the generous way that Tom and \nMeredith Brokaw have chosen to give back to the community that provided \nso much to them. The Auld-Brokaw Trail and the Outdoor Classroom are \ntwo of the latest examples.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6726-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING SHANKARI RAJAGOPAL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I congratulate Shankari Rajagopal on her \noutstanding performance at the 77th annual Scripps National Spelling \nBee.\n  Nevada's lone speller at the national competition, Shankari outlasted \n219 of 265 contestants to earn a spot among the top 46 competitors. An \neighth grader at Churchill County High School, Shankari won the Nevada \nState Spelling Bee in March to earn the right to participate in the \nnational competition. She had finished 12th and 6th in the State \ncontest the previous 2 years.\n  Administered by The E.W. Scripps Company in conjunction with more \nthan 250 sponsors around the world, the Scripps National Spelling Bee \nis the Nation's largest and longest-running educational promotion. Each \nsponsor organizes a spelling bee program in its community, with the \nlocal champions advancing to the finals in Washington, DC. This \ntremendous program helps thousands of students every year improve their \nspelling and expand their vocabularies through a fun competition.\n  I was able to visit with Shankari an hour before her last day of \ncompetition. She was relaxed and satisfied with her tremendous \naccomplishment, as well she should be. I was very impressed with her \nparents who came to Washington, DC, to support her. They too were proud \nof what she had accomplished, and this helped to put her at ease.\n  I have seen too many parents, in athletics and other student \nactivities, put such tremendous pressure on their children that it \ntakes away from the pleasure of the student's involvement. But not so \nwith Shankari's parents. I congratulate Jeeks and Karpagam, her mother \nand father, for doing such a great job of raising their daughter.\n  The Fallon community and the State of Nevada can take great pride in \nShankari's performance in the State and national competitions. It \nreflects her strong commitment to her education and her tremendous \npotential. Please join me in congratulating this talented young Nevadan \non her impressive achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6726-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING ALVIN McLANE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I congratulate Mr. Alvin McLane, a Nevada \nBureau of Land Management, BLM, volunteer, on his selection for the \n``Making A Difference'' award. This award recognizes Alvin's strong \ncommitment to preserving the natural and cultural heritage of our \npublic lands.\n  Mr. McLane is one of seven individuals who received this prestigious \nnational award this year. As a volunteer for the Nevada BLM's Carson \nCity field office, he recorded more than 120 discrete cultural sites \nprimarily in the Dry Lake area of northwestern Nevada. Mr. McLane also \ninstituted a full-scale monitoring program for the area.\n  Thousands of volunteers throughout the country contribute to the \npreservation of the 261 million acres of public lands managed by the \nBLM. Volunteers donated approximately 1.5 million hours last year \nalone, tantamount to the work of 866 full-time employees with an \nestimated value of $25 million. Launched in 1996 as a part of the \n``Take Pride in America'' initiative, the ``Making A Difference'' \nprogram has recognized 87 individuals or groups for their exemplary \nservice.\n  Mr. McLane has demonstrated a commendable commitment to public \nservice.

Mr. President, I extend my condolences to the family of \nRoger\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\nPeltyn, who passed away in Las Vegas on June 3.\n  Roger left behind his loving wife Sandy, with whom he shared his life \nfor 33 years, and two sons, R.J. and Michael. His passing leaves an \nempty place in the lives of those who knew and loved him. It also \nleaves a void in our community.\n  Roger was a structural engineer, and he was instrumental in building \nmany glamorous structures that are synonymous with Las Vegas--landmarks \nlike the Mirage, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, and Excalibur. He also \nhelped to build many schools, stores, office properties, and much more.\n  But Roger did not just build structures. He also helped to build a \nstronger community in southern Nevada. The projects and causes that he \nadopted are almost too numerous to name: the UNLV President's Council, \nthe Nevada Development Authority, the Clark County Public Education \nFoundation, the Desert Research Institute, Opportunity Village, and \nmany other charities.\n  For the past decade, Roger served as president of an organization \ncalled Nevada Arts Advocates, which is dedicated to improving the \ncultural climate in Nevada and promoting the arts. His love of the arts \nenriched our whole State.\n  With Sandy by his side, Roger raised millions of dollars for worthy \ncauses. Every Nevadan owes both of them a debt of gratitude.\n  Roger was born in Brooklyn, and he came to Las Vegas as so many folks \ndo, by way of California. He moved to Las Vegas when Steve Wynn asked \nfor his help during the expansion of the famous Golden Nugget resort. \nAnd just a month ago, Roger was still giving Steve Wynn advice about \nthe new resort he is building.\n  Roger and his partner Jack Martin started a 5 man engineering firm \nthat now employs more than 60 people. That is a testament to the \namazing growth of Las Vegas, which would not have been possible without \nRoger Peltyn.\n  Nevada will miss Roger Peltyn. He left us too soon. But his legacy \nwill live on in the magnificent buildings he helped to construct, and \nthe community he helped to create. Nevada is a better place because of \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6727-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Jeremy Bohlman\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON.

He \nwas completing his second tour of duty in Iraq when he was killed by an \nexplosion while conducting combat operations in Al Anbar Province, \nIraq.\n  Jeremy, who was married 2 weeks before being deployed, is described \nby friends and family as a hard worker with lots of friends who found \nhis niche in the Marines. He served with great distinction and received \nthe Combat Action Ribbon, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, the \nMarine Corps Expeditionary Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, \nthe Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and the Sea Service \nDeployment Ribbon.\n  The lives of countless people were enormously enhanced by Jeremy's \ngoodwill and service. He inspired all those who knew him. Our Nation is \na far better place because of his life. All Americans owe Jeremy, and \nthe other soldiers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of \nfreedom, a tremendous debt of gratitude for their service.\n  I express my sympathies to the family and friends of Lance Corporal \nJeremy Bohlman.

Mr. President, in August 1814, during the War of 1812, the \nBritish Navy bombarded Fort McHenry in Baltimore. A lawyer and amateur \npoet named Francis Scott Key from nearby Washington witnessed the \nattack from a British ship, where he had been attempting to secure the \nrelease of some American prisoners. The bombardment continued through \nthe night and many watching feared that the fort, which guarded the \napproach to Baltimore, would shatter under the onslaught. When at last \nthe dawn came, Fort McHenry still stood, its enormous American flag, \nthough tattered, still flying. The exhausted British forces retreated.\n  Francis Scott Key captured the relief and exhilaration of that \nturning point in history in a poem, which he titled ``The Defense of \nFort M'Henry.'' His verses were subsequently printed widely, and a note \nadded that said the accompanying tune was ``Anacreon in Heaven,'' then \na popular tune. In October 1814, a Baltimore actor sang Key's new song \nin a public performance, calling it, for the first time, ``The Star \nSpangled Banner.'' The Star Spangled Banner became the national anthem \nin 1931 by an act of Congress. Though difficult for many people to \nsing, this anthem has retained its popularity because it so eloquently \ncaptures the love we have as a nation for our flag and the tender \nregard we have for the Nation those colors represent.\n  Since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Americans have grown \nused to the sight of American flags. Beginning just hours after those \nhorrifying images hit our television screens, people reached into their \nclosets and hung flags by their front doors, in their front yards, from \ntheir cars, and in front of their businesses. After the gauntlet of \nterrorism had been flung in our face, we as a nation answered the \ninsult in a resounding and defiant way. Instinctively, we knew what to \ndo. Our collective consciousness recalled the words from the Star \nSpangled Banner: ``Oh, say, does that star spangled banner yet wave? \nO'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?'' Together, we \nmade sure that our banner still waved.\n  This last weekend, on the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of \nNormandy, American flags again flew proudly as Americans and Europeans \nremembered and honored the heroic sacrifices of June 4, 1944, that led \nto the liberation of that beleaguered continent. On those distant \nshores, the last cohort of an earlier generation accepted the enduring \nthanks of nations and peoples freed from the terrible bonds of \noccupation.\n  World War II brought out the best in America. Facing a clear and \npresent danger, the Nation, like a team of horses hitched to a heavy \nload, dug deep and pulled together to put the enormous energy and \nresources of our bountiful land to work. Vast armies were trained and \nsent to battlefields across three continents. Fleets of ships were \nbuilt to ferry unimaginable quantities of materiel to support those \ntroops. Swarms of aircraft, armadas of battleships, and vast thundering \nherds of tanks were built and sent forth to defeat our enemies. Our \nscientists harnessed their creativity to produce new technology and new \nweapons more deadly and more terrifying than any mankind had ever \nbefore seen. Though our losses were staggering, the Nation persevered \nuntil the happy days that American flags drove proudly into Paris and \nflew over Germany, Italy and Japan. Never before, and, I fervently hope \nand pray, never again will the world see war waged on such a scale.\n\n  Today, we are again at war. Our enemies are different, shadowy and \nelusive, and their tactics and methods of operation are most un-\nmilitary. Not for them the open field of battle, but rather the \nsaboteur's stealthy attack. Still, American troops lie encamped in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. Daily, they face attacks that, sadly, send home \ntoo many of our men and women in uniform shrouded beneath an American \nflag. For these fallen heroes, the music is ``Taps,'' not the ``Star \nSpangled Banner.'' The flag, however, was much the same as the one that \nflew over Fort McHenry all those years ago.\n  Each June 14, we honor the flag, marking the day in 1777 that the \nContinental Congress adopted a resolution that stated simply: \n``Resolved, That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen \nstripes alternate red and white; that the union be thirteen stars, \nwhite in a blue field, representing a new constellation.''\n  In the Nation's early years, the actual design of the flag, whether \nthe\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\nstars had five points or six or whether they were arranged in rows or a \ncircle, was open to different interpretations. Also in our Nation's \nearly years, a new star and a new stripe were added as each new State \nwas added to the Union. The flag that flew over Fort McHenry in 1814 \nhad fifteen stars and fifteen stripes. On April 4, 1818, President \nJames Monroe signed into law the Flag Act of 1818. That act stipulated \nthat, as of July 4, 1819, the flag would consist of thirteen stripes, \nfor the thirteen original colonies, and twenty stars, one for each \nState at the time. Further, upon admission to the Union, a new star \nwould represent each new State. Thus was born the flag that we know \ntoday, the flag that flies over this Capitol building.\n  Through war and peace, triumph and tragedy, our flag, like our \nNation, has endured much over the last two centuries. Hoisted over the \nvictory stand at the Olympics, as it surely will be this summer in \nGreece, draped over the gaping wound in the side of the Pentagon before \nit was reconstructed, or printed on sacks of relief supplies sent to \ncrisis situations across the globe, our Nation's flag conveys our \npride, our courage, our defiance, and our magnanimity in the face of \ngreat challenges. The flag is a part of so many other holidays and \ncelebrations. At the Fourth of July, on Memorial Day, on Veterans Day, \nand now on the 11th of September, the flag will be flying. And always, \nthe sight of the red, white, and blue pulls us to our feet and stirs \nour emotions. So it is more than fitting that on one day each year, we \nhonor the flag itself.\n\n  I would like to close with one of my favorite poems, by Henry \nHolcomb, entitled ``Hats Off.'' It is a fitting tribute to our flag.\n\n                                Flag Day\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n     A flash of color beneath the sky:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n     Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n     Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n     Hats off!\n     The colors before us fly;\n     But more than the flag is passing by.\n\n     Sea-fights and land fights, grim and great,\n     Fought to make and save the State:\n     Weary marches and sinking ships;\n     Cheers of victory on dying lips;\n\n     Days of plenty and years of peace;\n     March of a strong land's swift increase;\n     Equal justice, right and law,\n     Stately honor and reverend awe;\n\n     Sign of a nation, great and strong\n     Toward her people from foreign wrong;\n     Pride and glory and honor, all\n     Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n\n     Hats off !\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n     And loyal hearts are beating high:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6728-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO MAJOR ANNETTE ORTIZ, U.S. AIR FORCE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nan outstanding Air Force Officer, MAJ Annette Ortiz, for the tremendous \nwork she has done as a member of my staff during the 108th Congress. It \nis my privilege to recognize her career accomplishments and to commend \nher for the superb service she has provided the Air Force, the great \nState of Mississippi, and our Nation.\n  Major Ortiz earned her commission through ROTC at the University of \nHawaii where she graduated in 1990 with a bachelor of arts degree in \ntelecommunications with a minor in German. She completed specialized \nundergraduate navigator training at Mather Air Force Base in November \n1991, and KC-135 Combat Crew Training School at Castle Air Force Base \nin August 1992. In July 1994, Major Ortiz retrained into the C-130E at \nLittle Rock Air Force Base, where she demonstrated academic excellence.\n  Following flight school, Major Ortiz reported to the 906th Air \nRefueling Squadron, 43rd Air Refueling Wing, at Minot Air Force base. \nWhile assigned to the 906th, she deployed on inter-command refuelings \nin the Pacific, European, and Southwest Asian theaters. In support of \nOperation Restore Hope, the humanitarian re-supply operation in \nSomalia, she was the lone recipient of the coveted ``outstanding \nperformance'' evaluation rating during the 15th Air Force \nStandardization and Evaluation Inspection. She also flew several combat \nmissions into Tuzla and Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, including \nparticipation in Operations Provide Promise, Joint Endeavor, Deny \nFlight, Joint Guard, and other NATO supported European operations.\n  Major Ortiz subsequently served as an Instructor Navigator, C-130E, \nfor the 37th Airlift Squadron, 86th Airlift Wing, at Ramstein Air Force \nbase. During this assignment, she instructed combat employment of the \nC-130 Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System, AWADS, and Aircraft \nDefensive System, ADS. She also led tactical formations of multiple \naircraft during joint airborne transportability training and special \nassignment airdrop missions. Following that assignment, Major Ortiz \nserved as a C-130 FTU instructor navigator and assistant flight \nCommander at the 53rd Airlift Squadron, Little Rock Air Force base. In \nthis capacity, she provided training to students from the US Armed \nForces and 27 allied nations regarding combat mission planning, \ntactical formation, and airdrop/airland procedures.\n  Major Ortiz's next assignment was air operations staff officer, \nSpecial Operations Command Pacific, Camp Smith, HI. During this tour, \nshe was first attached to the Air Mobility Warfare Center Tactics \nDivision where she assisted with the instruction of the Combat Aircrew \nTactics Training course. She also updated and developed course \ncurriculum, including the Blue Command and Control course that focused \non development of tactics. Subsequently, Major Ortiz was attached to \nthe headquarters Air Force, Directorate for Future Strategic Plan. In \nthis capacity, she participated in the Quadrennial Defense Review and \ndeveloped strategic personnel initiatives. Major Ortiz was instrumental \nin the formulation of doctrine and policy that pertained to the total \nforce of Active, Reserve, and civilian Air Force personnel.\n  In October 2002, Major Ortiz was selected to serve as a legislative \nfellow and special assistant on my staff. During this 1-year \nassignment, she was responsible for a wide spectrum of issues that \ndirectly affected the security and national defense of the United \nStates. She was also instrumental in carrying out a wide range of \nspecial projects, and was particularly effective at coordinating and \nresolving a broad range of complex military issues for constituents. \nMajor Ortiz also provided expert advice regarding foreign policy \nmatters, and provided effective liaison with senior staff of the \nForeign Relations Committee and both Defense Committees. Upon \ncompletion of her fellowship, Major Ortiz resumed her status as a \nReservist and became a permanent member of my staff, serving as the \ndeputy national security advisor.\n  Throughout her most distinguished career, MAJ Annette Ortiz has \nserved the Air Force and our Nation with pride and excellence. Her \nawards include two Air Force commendation medals, Air medal, three \nAerial Achievement medals, two with Oak Leaf Cluster, the 15th Air \nForce outstanding performance flight evaluation, and numerous other \ncampaign and unit distinctions.\n  Major Ortiz has been an integral member of my staff and has \ncontributed greatly to the best-trained, best-equipped, and best-\nprepared Air Force in the history of the world. Annette's superb \nleadership, integrity, and limitless energy have had a profound impact \non my entire staff and will continue to positively impact the United \nStates Air Force and our Nation. On behalf of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, I wish Annette, her husband Carlos, and their \nchildren Sofia Anna and Carlos Joseph Alejandro the best of luck in \ntheir bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6728-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6728-S6729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On July 23, 2003, Gregory Johnson, a 17-year-old gay man, and his \nfemale friend Brandie Coleman were shot in\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\nthe front of the head at point-blank range. The gunman was angry \nbecause his sexuality was threatened after an intimate encounter with \nthe cross-dressing Johnson.

Mr. President, today the United States Supreme Court \nissued its decision in the case of Elk Grove Unified School District v. \nMichael Newdon. In Elk Grove, as my colleagues are very much aware, the \nUnited States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that \nthe phrase ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance was \nunconstitutional. On an 8 to 0 vote the Supreme Court dismissed the \ncase on procedural grounds. The ruling effectively preserves the right \nof children in public schools to recite the full Pledge of Allegiance. \nI applaud the decision of the Supreme Court.\n  It is truly right, and a bit ironic, that the Supreme Court issued \nits decision today on ``Flag Day.'' Today is also the Golden \nAnniversary of congressional action that added the words ``under God'' \nto the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  I commend Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Judges Sandra Day \nO'Connor and Clarence Thomas who agreed, I believe properly, that the \ndecision by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit should \nbe overturned not on the standing issue but instead because the words \n``under God'' in the pledge do not violate the Constitution.\n  In response to the decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, I \nintroduced Senate Resolution 71, which passed this body by a 94 to 0 \nvote. The resolution expressed the sense of the Senate that we \n``strongly disapprove'' the decision of the Ninth Circuit and further \ninstructed the Senate Legal Counsel to intervene in the case to defend \nthe constitutionality of the words ``under God'' in the Pledge and if \nunable to intervene, to file an amicus curiae brief in support of \ncontinuing the constitutionality of the words ``under God'' in the \nPledge.\n  I do not if my colleagues have had the opportunity to read the amicus \ncuriae brief filed on behalf of the United States Senate. But I want to \ncompliment Patricia Mack Bryan, the Senate Legal Counsel; Morgan J. \nFrankel, the Deputy Senate Legal Counsel; and Grant Vinik and Thomas \nCaballero, who are Assistant Senate Legal Counsels. I know they worked \nhard on the brief that was filed in December. They said in the brief:\n\n       The First Congress not only acknowledged a proper role for \n     religion in public life, but did so at the very time it \n     drafted the Establishment Clause.\n\n  They also noted that:\n\n     the Public manifestations of our Nation's religious heritage \n     include ``an unbroken history of official acknowledgement by \n     all three branches of the government.\n\n  The mere reference to a Higher Being or God does not amount to a \nbreach of the establishment clause of the Constitution.\n  The children born of this century will probably never appreciate the \ncold war and how in the early fifties, our country felt threatened by \nChina, Russia and the spread of communism. It was in that historical \ncontext that Congress added the phrase ``under God'' to the pledge. As \nthe Senate Legal Counsel related in their brief, the legislative \nhistory makes clear that Congress wanted to give credence to the \nfundamental truth that a Government deriving its powers from the \nconsent of the governed must look to God for divine leadership.\n  There can be no doubt our Founding Fathers believed then, as I firmly \nbelieve today, that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in \nGod, and that the actions we take here in the United States Senate and \nthose of our children when they start their day in school each morning \nmust be governed by the principles invoked by a belief in a dedication \nto our Country and to God, by whatever name you choose to make \nreference to that power and foundation.\n  I welcome the decision of the United States Supreme Court that \npreserves the right of our children and ourselves to say the words \n``under God'' in our Pledge of Allegiance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6729-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6729-S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SCHIP EXPANSION ACT SUPPORT\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe following letters related to the May 13 introduction of the SCHIP \nExpansion Act, S. 2420, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         Children's Hospitals,\n\n                                                     June 4, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Children's Hospitals and our more than 120 member \n     hospitals from across the country, I would like to express \n     our strong support for your bill, S. 2420, ``the SCHIP \n     Expansion Act of 2004.'' Your legislation takes important \n     steps to ensure broader access to health coverage for \n     children, which in turn will improve the overall state of our \n     nation's health.\n       Since 1997, State have made remarkable progress in their \n     effort to insure low-income children under SCHIP. As of June \n     2003, SCHIP provided health coverage for 3.9 million \n     children. Over the year from June 2002 to June 2003, \n     enrollment of children in the State Children's Health \n     Insurance Program (SCHIP) increased by roughly 264,000, an \n     increase of 7.3 percent.\n       But for all that the SCHIP program has accomplished, still \n     more needs to be done. More than 6 million children in the \n     United States remain uninsured. We could reduce the number of \n     uninsured children by more than two-thirds--thereby insuring \n     almost all children--if all children eligible for Medicaid \n     and SCHIP were simply enrolled. By eliminating the upper \n     income eligibility limit in SCHIP, your bill would pave the \n     way to removing children from the ranks of the uninsured.\n       As providers of care to all children, regardless of their \n     economic status, children's hospitals have extensive \n     experience in assisting families to enroll eligible children \n     in Medicaid and SCHIP. They are keenly aware of the \n     importance of addressing the challenges that states face in \n     enrolling this often hard to reach population of eligible \n     children. We strongly support your efforts to reward States \n     that streamline the SCHIP enrollment and renewal process by \n     providing them with a five percentage point increase in the \n     SCHIP matching rate for specified outreach activities, \n     particularly presumptive and 12-month continuous eligibility.\n       The Nation's children's hospitals are grateful for your \n     leadership in attempting to provide States with the needed \n     funding and flexibility to expand health coverage to our \n     country's uninsured children. We look forward to working with \n     you to advance this important legislation and once and for \n     all ensure that all children have access to the quality \n     health services they need and deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Lawrence A. McAndrews,\n     President & Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Academy of Pediatrics\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2004.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I write today on behalf of the 57,000 \n     members of the American Academy of Pediatrics to express our \n     support for the SCHIP Expansion Act of 2004 (S. 2420).\n       As you know, the State Children's Health Insurance Program \n     (SCHIP) provides health insurance to over 6 million low-\n     income children whose family income is not low enough to \n     qualify for Medicaid but are unable to afford health \n     insurance in the private market. SCHIP and the Medicaid \n     program are a critical child health safety net that currently \n     provides health insurance to over 17 million low-income \n     children. Furthermore, eligibility of these programs covers \n     almost two-thirds of the more than 9 million uninsured \n     children in this country; however, these 6.7 million children \n     remain uninsured because of insufficient enrollment and \n     outreach efforts to enroll these eligible children. Your \n     legislation is an important step towards strengthening and \n     sustaining SCHIP, an important part of the child health \n     safety net.\n       In particular, this legislation would provide necessary \n     additional funds to fix the SCHIP funding ``dip'' and allow \n     states to maintain current coverage in the program. As you \n     know, when SCHIP was enacted it was funded at lower levels in \n     the later years of the program in order to meet budget \n     requirements. This ``dip'' in program funding is coming at a \n     time when states are in need of funds. Estimates suggest that \n     17 states will experience a federal funding shortfall by \n     FY07. S. 2420 provides necessary funds to allow states to \n     maintain current coverage in SCHIP. This legislation also \n     provides an incentive to the states to improve outreach\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n     and enrollment efforts in both Medicaid and SCHIP in order to \n     enroll the nearly 7 million children who are eligible for \n     Medicaid or SCHIP but unenrolled. In addition, this \n     legislation addresses another important barrier to enrolling \n     SCHIP eligible children by prohibiting states from capping \n     their SCHIP programs without first exhausting all available \n     federal funding. Although this provision is a step in the \n     right direction, the American Academy of Pediatrics believes \n     that any cap on health care funding for public program \n     coverage is detrimental to ensuring that all uninsured, \n     eligible children and families are able to enroll.\n       The American Academy of Pediatrics believes that all \n     children, regardless of income, should have access to \n     affordable health insurance such that their families can \n     afford health care services necessary for healthy \n     development. We therefore commend your efforts to strengthen \n     the SCHIP program and give states the option to expand this \n     program to reach more children in their state whose families \n     are unable to afford health insurance in the private market. \n     We encourage states to maintain efforts mandated in the SCHIP \n     statute to minimize crowd-out of the private market as they \n     consider such expansions of SCHIP coverage. Because in most \n     states Medicaid and SCHIP currently pay physicians who care \n     for children at inadequate rates, maintaining the private \n     market is necessary to allow physicians to subsidize care for \n     these children. The Academy urges Congress to consider the \n     impact of inadequate payment rates for services under \n     Medicaid and SCHIP on access to necessary services for \n     beneficiaries in these programs.\n       The American Academy of Pediatrics is committed to \n     protecting Medicaid and SCHIP. We look forward to working \n     with you on this and other legislative efforts to protect, \n     sustain, and strengthen these critical child health safety \n     net programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Carden Johnston, MD, FAAP,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6730-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THREE MONTHS AND COUNTING\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, 3 months from yesterday is the expiration \ndate for the assault weapons ban. Despite Senate passage of a \nbipartisan amendment that would have reauthorized the ban, it appears \nthat this important gun safety law will be allowed to expire. The House \nRepublican leadership opposes reviewing the law and President Bush, \nthough he has said he supports it, has done little to help keep the law \nalive.\n  In April of this year, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \njoined hundreds of local elected officials and senior law enforcement \nofficials to urge President Bush to push for reauthorization of this \ncritical piece of gun safety legislation. I commend them for their \nefforts and continue to support this commonsense gun safety \nlegislation.\n  The 1994 law banned a list of 19 specific weapons, as well as a \nnumber of other weapons incorporating certain design characteristics \nsuch as pistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, and flash \nsuppressors. The assault weapons ban also prohibited the manufacture of \nsemiautomatic weapons that incorporate at least two of these military \nfeatures and which accept a detachable magazine.\n  I support the efforts of the law enforcement community and local \nleaders who are calling for legislation extending the law. In 1994, I \nvoted for the assault weapons ban and, in March of this year, I joined \na bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend the assault \nweapons ban for 10 years.\n  Law enforcement support for the assault weapons ban is broad. It \nincludes the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major \nCities Chiefs Association, the Police Foundation, the Police Executive \nResearch Forum, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the \nNational Association of School Resource Officers, the National \nFraternal Order of Police, the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives, the Hispanic American Police Command Officers \nAssociation, and the National Black Police Association.\n  In addition, mayors and police chiefs from Detroit, Los Angeles, San \nFrancisco, Miami, Seattle, Chicago, and Washington, D.C. have joined \nover 200 other local leaders in urging Congress to immediately pass a \n10-year extension of the current ban.\n  Despite broad support for this law, the National Rifle Association \nfought against passage of the assault weapons ban in 1994 and continues \nto oppose it to this day. The ban is a major public safety measure that \nprotects citizens and police officers and I urge the President and the \nCongress to act immediately to reauthorize the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6730-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FRANCES WILLIAMS PRESTON\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an outstanding \nnative Tennessean, Frances Williams Preston.\n  Frances Preston was born in Nashville, TN and attended elementary, \nhigh school and Peabody College at Vanderbilt University there. She \nholds honorary degrees from the Berklee School of Music, Boston, MA, \nLincoln College, Lincoln, IL, and Oklahoma University, Tulsa, OK. Ms. \nPreston is married to Nashville businessman E.J. Preston, and she is \nthe mother of three children and the grandmother of six children.\n  This year, Frances Preston will retire from her position of President \nand Chief Executive Officer of Broadcast Music Inc., BMI. Under Ms. \nPreston's leadership for the past 18 years, BMI gained international \nrespect as a leader in the entertainment industry and is viewed as one \nof the music industry's most consistently successful and progressive \nentities. BMI was founded in 1939 and it operates as a non-profit \nmaking business. After operating expenses are paid, BMI returns all \nroyalties to approximately 300,000 creators and copyright owners that \nit represents.\n  Ms. Preston began her career in the music industry when she joined \nthe nationally known Nashville radio station, WSM, in mid-1950 as a \nmail room employee and where she answered fan mail sent to Hank \nWilliams. Later, she became the popular hostess of a daily fashion and \nstyle television show on the WSM station. In 1958, Ms. Preston became a \npart of BMI when she opened a BMI operation in Nashville as a result of \nsome slight prodding by the first President of BMI, Bob Burton. Ms. \nPreston began her career with BMI with one assistant working in her \nparents' garage and oversaw the company's growth to more than 400 \nemployees in Nashville. In 1986, Ms. Preston was appointed to serve as \nPresident & CEO of BMI. Ms. Preston played a lead role in building \nBMI's 2004 repertoire of nearly 4.5 million musical works.\n  Ms. Preston has been vigilant and supported legislation with respect \nto rights and incomes of songwriters, composers and publishers.\n  Frances Preston has received numerous awards and recognition, \nincluding but not limited to the T.J. Martell Foundation Humanitarian \nAward in 1992, the Friar's Applause Award in 1993, the International \nAchievement in Arts Humanitarian Awards in 1995 and 1997, the American \nWomen in Radio and Television's Outstanding Achievement Award in 1998, \nthe American Women in Radio and Television President's Award in 1998, \nthe National Trustees Award at the 1998 Grammy Awards, the Society for \nthe Advancement of Women's Health Research Woman of Achievement Award \nin 1999, the National Music Publishers' Association's President's Award \nin 2001, the Nashville Songwriters Association International \nPresident's Award in 2002, the Women in Music Touchstone Advocate Award \nin 2003, the Michael Bolton Charities' Lifetime Achievement Award in \n2003, the Irving Waugh Award of Excellence, and the Broadcasters' \nFoundation's Golden Mike Award in 2004.\n  Ms. Preston sits on numerous boards and generously volunteers her \ntime to many charitable organizations.\n  This brief statement cannot capture all the strengths of Frances \nWilliams Preston and her manifold good works for songwriters, composers \nand publishers, and America as a whole. I did want to bring to my \ncolleagues' attention the accomplishments and legacy of Frances \nPreston, and I am honored to recognize the contributions of this great \nTennessean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6730-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6730-S6731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. President, in our formative years, many of us \nwere exposed to the phrase ``you can do anything that you set your mind \nto.'' This cliche is symbolic of the optimism embodied in the American \nDream. Across the width and breadth of this great land, we see \ncountless examples of people who exemplify that spirit.\n  Some of us live out that dream by finding success as teachers, others \nas doctors. Some of us find passion in the freedom of flight, while \nsome of us thrive in the rigid structure of the military. Very few of \nus are able to test our limits and succeed in multiple areas. I stand \nbefore you to recognize one such person.\n  Dr. John Burson is a shining example of what a human being is capable \nof if one has the will and the focus to reach for the stars. He has \nspend the last 25 years serving the citizens of Carroll County, GA, as \nan ear, nose, and throat specialist. All the time and effort required \nto become a practicing physician is a lot to ask of anyone, however it \nis merely the tip of the iceberg fo Dr. Burson.\n  Before pursuing a career in medicine at the age of 37, Dr. Burson \nspent his time acquiring a bachelor's degree and a master's degree, as \nwell as a Ph.D. in Engineering, from the Georgia Institute of \nTechnology. Upon completing his doctorate, he continued to pass on his \nknowledge to others for several years as a professor at Georgia Tech. \nDr. Burson obtained his post-graduate degrees and professorship while \nsimultaneously serving as an officer and pilot in the Army Reserves, \nwhere Dr. Burson rose to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Only after \nachieving all of this, at the age of 37, with a wife and children, did \nJohn decide it was time to pursue a career in medicine.\n  Twenty five years later, John has found a way to impress us all \nagain. In a short time, he will be heading to a field hospital in Iraq \nto relieve an active duty physician for 3 months, allowing that \nphysician 3 months back home with his or her family. While many his age \nare beginning to look towards quieter days, John Burson is once again \nserving his country, as well as providing a most precious gift to a \nperson that he has never met.\n  Orison Swett Marden, a famed Nineteenth Century thinker, stated that \n``the greatest thing a man can do in this world is to make the most \npossible out of the stuff that has been given to him. This is success \nand there is none other.'' Soldier. Scholar. Doctor. Husband. Father. I \nbelieve that Mr. Marden, were he still alive, would not hesitate to \nproclaim John Burson a successful man. People spend most of their lives \nattempting to do one thing well. Few and far between are the people who \nhave the courage to try and determination to achieve success at all. \nDr. John Burson is one of those few and I am proud to call him a fellow \nGeorgian and a fellow American, and I thank him for his years of \nservice to our country, to the State of Georgia, and to his \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6731-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LARSON MANUFACTURING\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Being one of the few firms \nin the area offering this combination of services, today, it has carved \nits own sizable niche, providing excellence in engineering, design and \nfield services to Kentucky.\n  Kohrs Lonnemann Heil Engineers is an outstanding example of how \nKentuckians use their entrepreneurial talent, drive and vision to \ncreate opportunities not just for themselves, but for others. What \nbegan as a humble business almost 47 years ago is now a leading \nengineering firm that is a leader in giving back to the community.\n  Northern Kentucky is fortunate to have Kohrs Lonnemann Heil Engineers \nas a home-based business. But more importantly, it is fortunate to have \nMr. Kohrs, Mr. Heil, and Mr. Lonnemann call Northern Kentucky home. I \nappreciate their loyalty to Kentucky and their community. The company \nhas been a shining example of leadership, hard work, and compassion. \nThey are an inspiration to all throughout the Commonwealth.\n  Congratulaions, Kohrs Lonnemann Heil Engineers. You are Kentucky at \nits finest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6731-4", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6731-S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMEMORATING FRANK BAKER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize a constituent, \nFrank Baker, who will mark his 50th year of exemplary service to the \nAmerican Legion California Boys State Program.\n  Since 1935, the Boys State Program has brought together high school \nboys from across their States to immerse them in a week of education \nabout, and simulation of, their State government. The California \nprogram began in 1938,\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\nand Mr. Baker is the second person in the history of the California \nBoys State program to reach the milestone of 50 years of service.\n  Mr. Baker joined the California Boys State staff in 1955 as a clerk \nand in 1958 was named secretary of the program. He supported the \ncounseling staff in delivering excellent programming to the Boys State \ndelegates year after year.\n  In 1975, Mr. Baker was elevated to the treasurer of the Boys State \nProgram. He became the program administrator in 1982 and has been \nresponsible for overseeing the infrastructure of the Boys State \nProgram. The 2004 California Boys State session will be Mr. Baker's \n50th consecutive year of service.\n  Mr. Baker has been a leader outside of the California Boys State \nprogram as well, serving in the U.S. Army's 103rd Infantry in Germany, \nFrance, and Italy in World War II. Mr. Baker has been active in the Boy \nScouts of America and was involved with the Sea Scouts in the 1940s. \nSince 1990, Mr. Baker has been a Kiwanis member and has raised money \nfor Kiwanis House, the Just for Kids Program and the Teddy Bear \nPurchase Program for the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department. He \nalso volunteered his time as a court spokesman for neglected and abused \nchildren for 8 years through the court-appointed special advocates of \nSacramento.\n  Mr. Baker began a long teaching career in 1952 when he joined the \nbusiness department at Sacramento High School. After moving to Hiram \nJohnson High School--where he taught until his retirement in 1998--he \nserved as chairman of the business department and taught classes at \nSacramento City College.\n  Mr. Baker's actions demonstrate his dedication to serving his country \nand the State of California, and I offer my hearty congratulations to \nhim on his 50th year of service to the California Boys State \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6732-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6732-2", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6732-3", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TEXT OF AN AMENDMENT TO THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE \n UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOM OF \n   GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND FOR COOPERATION ON THE USES OF \n    ATOMIC ENERGY FOR MUTUAL DEFENSE PURPOSES OF JULY 3, 1958--PM 85\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to section 123d. \nof the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the text of an amendment \nto the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America \nand the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \nIreland for Cooperation on the Uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense \nPurposes of July 3, 1958, as amended, and my written approval, \nauthorization, and determination concerning the agreement.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. PRYOR:\n  S. 2516. A bill to recognize the sacrifices of the members of the \nArmed Forces who are injured in combat, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I come to the Chamber today to discuss a \nreality of today's world in Iraq and elsewhere that I think has not \nreceived the appropriate attention. I am referring to the thousands of \nmen and women who have been seriously wounded in recent U.S. combat \nmissions. The numbers wounded in Iraq have soared in recent weeks. \nFatalities have risen likewise to a total of 817 yesterday. Of the \nlatest data I have been able to find, 5,015 military personnel have \nbeen injured in Iraq, 2,049 have been able to return to action within \n72 hours, and 2,964 could not, and many of these injured troops will \nface months, if not years, of rehabilitation. Many of these troops will \nsuffer lifelong disabilities.\n  I am told Walter Reed Army Hospital is close to being filled to \ncapacity. I have been to Walter Reed twice this year, and while I \ntalked with soldiers who were wounded in the Iraqi theater, I can tell \nyou that coming face to face with our soldiers in a hospital ward is a \nsobering event. It makes you think about the costs of war and the \nsacrifices these men and women have made for our Nation, for each of \nus.\n  Memorial Day has just passed, and I have tried to think how best to \nrecognize the sacrifices of our wounded service men and women. I am not \nsure that I ever can appropriately and fully recognize their sacrifice, \nbut I want to try. That is why I introduce today the Service Act for \nCare and Relief Initiatives for Forces Injured in Combat Engagement \nAct, or the SACRIFICE Act. The SACRIFICE Act addresses the commitment \nshown by our troops injured in combat and attempts to reciprocate in \nkind.\n  My bill does three things. First, it would recognize the sacrifice of \nAmerican military personnel killed and injured in combat and the heroic \nefforts of our medical teams through a sense of the Senate.\n  Second, it would aim to ease the stress of families who are \nattempting to follow the whereabouts of a loved one injured by combat \nby establishing a tracking system for wounded personnel being \ntransported out of a combat zone.\n  Third, it would call for a $10 million authorization to modernize \nmedical combat equipment, treatment, and combat care triage for our \nmedics in their fight to save lives.\n  Let me tell my colleagues how I came to write this bill.\n  Arkansas is a relatively small State with a relatively high \nenrollment of Arkansans serving our Nation in Active Duty and in the \nNational Guard and Reserve. In March of this year, we said goodbye to \n3,000 fellow Arkansans who were deployed to Iraq as part of the 39th \nInfantry Brigade of the first Cavalry.\n  It was hard for me to witness separation of families as soldiers \nprepared for year long war zone deployment. It has been painful to \nreceive news of the 8 Arkansans who have fallen since the beginning of \nthat deployment and the additional 44 who have been seriously injured \nand transported out of theater.\n  In honor of this sacrifice, the first section of my bill is a sense \nof the Senate regarding the American military personnel killed and \ninjured in combat and the heroic efforts of our medical teams.\n  The second section of the bill, the tracking portion, is an easy, no-\ncost provision to ease emotional stress of families whose loved ones \nhave been listed as seriously injured or very seriously injured and are \nbeing transported out of theater.\n  As I mentioned before, 44 Arkansas members of the 39th Infantry \nBrigade have thus far been listed as seriously injured or very \nseriously injured and evacuated out of theater. Although Congress does \nnot receive notification of the wounded, I continuously receive calls \nfrom families who are distraught and worried because of failures in the \ncurrent family notification system.\n  The Defense Department has a computer tracking system that is \ndesigned to help keep families of fallen soldiers informed of their \nwhereabouts, but the system is not without glitches. For example, some \nfamilies who have contacted my office have been distraught after \nhearing from military that they are not exactly sure where the soldiers \nwere at the time. This has made it difficult for families to make plans \nto travel to the hospitals where their loved one are being cared for.\n  Also, when a soldier is upgraded from seriously injured or very \nseriously injured to not seriously injured, the Department of the Army \ncloses out their case in the computer tracking system, making it \nparticularly difficult for families to keep track of their loved ones. \nWe can and should do more for families of loved ones during such trying \ntimes.\n  I want to recognize SPC Henry Austin Phillips of Charlie Company of \nthe 153rd Infantry, 39th Brigade out of DeQueen, AR.\n  For example, some families that have contacted my office have been \ndistraught after hearing from the military that they were not sure \nexactly where the soldiers were at that time. This has made it \ndifficult for families to make plans to travel to the hospital where \ntheir loved ones are being cared for.\n  Also, when a soldier is upgraded from ``seriously injured'' or ``very \nseriously injured'' to ``not seriously inured,'' the Department of the \nArmy closes out their case in the computer tracking system, making it \nparticularly difficult for families to keep track of their loved ones. \nWe can--and should--do more for the families of loved ones during such \ntrying times.\n  I want to recognize SPC Henry Austin Phillips of the Charlie Company, \n1-153d Infantry, 39th Brigade out of DeQueen, AR. He did a great job in \nthe field, and the communication problems that ensued following his \ninjury are not a reflection of him or the military.\n  He was proud to serve his country, and his State and country are \nproud of him. I know that if he could return, he would.\n  As I understand it, this is the situation that Pam Phillips endured \nwhen her husband was wounded in Iraq, losing his lower right leg.\n  After suffering his injury, Specialist Phillips requested that he \ndeliver the news to Pam regarding the seriousness of his condition.\n  He talked with Pam on Wednesday, May 19, asked her to join him as \nsoon as possible at the Landstuhl Hospital in Germany, where Specialist \nPhillips understood he would be receiving critical treatment. \nNaturally, Pam told her husband that she would be there.\n  I can only imagine that call but it should come as no surprise that \nPam and Specialist Phillips both assumed that the Army would assist Pam \nin joining her husband as soon as possible. That was Specialist \nPhillips's wish.\n  But that did not happen.\n  The nature of Specialist Phillips's injuries required that he be \nheavily sedated following this phone call so he was unable to speak \ndirectly with his wife for several days.\n  After talking with her husband on May 19, Pam assumed that someone in \nthe Army would assist her in getting to Germany and advise her of her \nhusband's health status. For the record, we do indeed provide spouses \nwith Invitational Travel Orders to transport immediate family members \nof the seriously wounded. I have encountered several problems with \nthose orders, too.\n\n[[Page S6738]]\n\n  However, Pam received no additional communication from the Army. Two \ndays later, on May 21, I received a call from Arkansas State \nRepresentative Daryl Pace, Pam's brother. Regrettably, this was not the \nfirst call I have gotten from families trying to locate their loved \nones who have been wounded. I have had four such calls since April.\n  My staff and the Arkansas National Guard worked tirelessly to track \ndown Specialist Phillips. Finally, on Monday, May 24, 5 days later, Pam \nlearned that her husband had arrived at Walter Reed on Friday, May 21. \nAfter 5 days of sheer emotional stress, Pam finally learned that her \nhusband was recovering, that he was OK.\n  Here is what Daryl Pace has to say about the experience that his \nsister Pam went through:\n\n       There's an empty channel between the field and the \n     hospital. When nobody could find Austin, Pam was horrified \n     that Austin's condition had deteriorated. We were left with \n     the assumption that he was no longer with us.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, can they imagine getting a phone call from their \nson, their daughter, their husband or their wife telling them that they \nhad lost their leg and that they wanted my colleagues to be with them \nas soon as possible?\n  Can you imagine that their loved one is in the care of the U.S. Armed \nForces, but nobody in the military calls them? Nobody can answer an \ninquiry about their loved one's whereabouts?\n  Again, my bill language is direct, I simply want the Secretary of \nDefense to put into place a uniform policy and procedure that notifies \nfamilies of an injury to a loved one in combat, followed by regular \nupdates on the health and location of the wounded member.\n  I ask my colleagues to support me in helping families during a time \nof terrible tension and emotional pain by requesting that the Secretary \nreview this matter and put into place a policy that supports families \nrather than burdens them.\n  The last section of the bill aims to reduce fatalities and disability \nrates by providing medics in theater with tools that they need.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have taken note of the rising \ncasualties and the rising wounded count. But I have also taken note of \na rising number of news articles detailing the conditions that our \nmedics must work under while treating our wounded.\n  According to a Washington Post article on April 27, 2004: ``So far in \nApril, more than 900 soldiers and Marines have been wounded in Iraq, \nmore than twice the number wounded in October, the previous high.'' \nWhile half of those wounded were able to return to duty, ``The others \narrive on stretchers at the hospitals operated by the 31st Combat \nSupport Hospital.\n  And I quote, ``These injuries,'' said LTC Stephen M. Smith, executive \nofficer of the Baghdad facility, ``are horrific.''\n  The article goes on to document the struggles that the medical team \nconfronts everyday in meeting their goal to provide ``lightning-swift, \nexpert treatment'' and the transfer of the wounded to a military \nhospital.\n  An Army survey has documented that the unit with the lowest morale in \nIraq was one that ran the combat hospitals.\n  Another article from the Washington Times dated May 5, 2004, carries \nthe headline: ``Casualties of Iraq war can `get to' U.S. Medics.'' The \narticle reports that in April 2004, the deadliest month for the U.S.-\nled coalition in Iraq, the Baghdad hospital treated more than 500 \nwounded Americans.\n  The article chronicles the amazing efforts by U.S. medical personnel \nto save the lives of the wounded.\n  It details the adverse conditions where ``the emergency room \noverflows with wounded soldiers on stretchers.'' It quotes Major \nWenner, a family doctor from Fort Sill, OK, as saying that:\n\n       It's not the names I remember as I go to sleep, It is the \n     faces and the injuries. . . . My alarm goes off, and it is \n     time to start all over again. Groundhog Day, we call it.\n\n  These medics and the wounded that they tend to everyday merit \nimmediate attention by this body for the conditions they work under and \nmedical equipment they work with.\n  The 212th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is an example of our current \ncombat support hospital system that we use in Iraq. It is basically a \nbunch of tents. I have had the opportunity to tour a model similar to \nthat used by the 212th, but that was on the Capitol lawn when it wasn't \nin use.\n  According to an Army Lessons Learned Report on the 212th, the reality \nof these medic platforms is frightening. The tents are porous and the \nreport sites adverse conditions for medical personnel and the wounded \nthey treat due to sand and dirt filtering through the seams, doors and \nfloors impacting the medical team's ability to function.\n  I think we can do better than this and in fact, so does the Army. The \nArmy has a plan to modernize the combat support hospitals into the \nFuture Combat Hospital Systems. Let me share with you the Army's view:\n\n       The U.S. Army Medical Department has a continuing \n     requirement to support its deployed medical forces with \n     shelters appropriate to battlefield medical missions. \n     Currently a combination of aged ISO Shelters and TEMPER Tents \n     are being used at Combat Support Hospital (CSHs), and Forward \n     Surgical Teams (FST) are using a composite of less than \n     optimal tents. A formal Operational Requirements Document was \n     drafted by the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School \n     to support an upgrade/modernization to these new platforms. \n     With the recent changeover to the new Joint requirements \n     process, this document will eventually roll into this new \n     format.\n\n  This Army report further states that the U.S. Army Medical Research \nand Material Command placed a requirement into the fiscal year 2006-\n2011 Program Objective Memorandum for the development effort. The \nfunding requested was $14 million for fiscal year 2005-2006 and $10 \nmillion for fiscal year 2007. However, modernization of the Combat \nSupport Hospital System fell below the core funding capability.\n  In another report, the modernization, conversion and recapitalization \nfor the non-medical equipment components necessary to support the Army \nmedical casualty care platform was recognized as a shortfall in the \norganizational structure in the first gulf war, Operation Desert \nShield/Desert Storm.\n  In other words, we have known for more than a decade that the current \nsystem does not work well in today's battlefields but we didn't fund \nthe upgrade. We are basically putting U.S. medical personnel in a \nsituation that makes their jobs even harder.\n  I am not aware of any objection to this provision, except for the \noffset. It is not the merits, it is the money.\n  So I ask my colleagues, what is it worth to save one soldier, one \nMarine? I think it is worth at least $10 million for medical equipment \nthat has been identified as a necessary readiness requirement. I think \n$10 million is more than reasonable.\n  Medical analysis suggests that each additional dollar spent on \nmodernization of medical equipment can produce health gains, including \nreducing death and disability rates.\n  Just as important, additional investments in the combat support \nhospital system will send a message to our doctors, nurses and other \ncritical medical support personnel in theater. It will tell them that \nwe recognize the tremendous job that they are doing and that we back up \nthat recognition with real tools that will aid them in their work. \nGiven the conditions that these medics are working under, $10 million \nis the least we can do.\n  The $10 million for medical equipment and combat casualty care \ntechnologies would be funded by an offset from a defense-wide reduction \nin travel monies. The General Accounting Office recently found that the \nDepartment of Defense is losing millions of dollars in fraud, waste and \nimproper papers for travel. Fixing this problem is a double victory for \ntaxpayers and our Defense priorities.\n  In closing, my bill SACRIFICE is a humble act that holds very \nimportant initiatives. I urge my colleagues to join me in my effort to \nrecognize the sacrifice being made by members of the Armed Forces, to \nprovide support for their families, and to provide the necessary tools \nto bring them home safely.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2517. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in commemoration of Ronald Wilson Reagan, the 40th President of \nthe United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Ronald Wilson\n\n[[Page S6739]]\n\nReagan Commemorative Coin Act of 2004.''\n  This bill is the same as one I introduced in the 107th Congress, and \nwould accomplish two worthy goals. First, it would help honor Ronald \nWilson Reagan, the 40th President of the United States, and the many \nworthy contributions he made to this nation. Second, it would also help \nraise much needed resources to help families across the United States \nprovide care for their loved ones who have been stricken by Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  This legislation's timeliness is obviously without question, as we as \na nation honor Ronald Reagan this week and mourn his passing. The \nworthiness of the bill also goes without question. Most of us have seen \nNancy Reagan discuss her husband's illness. Watching Mrs. Reagan as she \nhas so openly and eloquently shared touching insights about their \nstruggle with Alzheimer's disease has always been very moving. There is \nno doubt about the truly deep bonds that united Ronald and Nancy Reagan \nand that we need to continue to do what we can to fight the disease \nthat slowly took it's terrible toll on the Reagans and so many other \nAmerican families.\n  Ronald Reagan wore many hats in his life, including endeavors as a \nsports announcer, actor, governor and President of the United States. \nHe was first elected president in 1980 and served two terms, becoming \nthe first president to serve two full terms since Dwight Eisenhower.\n  His boundless optimism and deep-seated belief in the people of the \nUnited States and the American Dream helped restore our Nation's pride \nin itself and brought about a new ``Morning in America.'' His challenge \nto Gorbachev to ``tear down this wall,'' his successful revival of our \neconomic power, his determination to rebuild our armed forces in order \nto contain the spread of communism, and his international summitry \nskills as seen at Reykjavik, Iceland, combined to help bring an end to \nthe Cold War. Ronald Reagan left our Nation in much better shape than \nit was in when he took office.\n  As Alzheimer's sets in, brain cells gradually deteriorate and die. \nPeople afflicted by the disease gradually lose their cognitive ability. \nPatients eventually become completely helpless and dependent on those \naround them for even the most basic daily needs. Each of the millions \nof Americans who is now affected will eventually, barring new \ndiscoveries in treatment, lose their ability to remember recent and \npast events, family and friends, even simple things like how to take a \nbath or turn on lights. Ronald Reagan, one of the most courageous and \noptimistic Presidents in American history, was no exception.\n  Shortly after being shot in an assassination attempt, Ronald Reagan's \ncourage and good humor in the face of a life threatening situation were \nevident when he famously apologized to his wife Nancy saying ``Sorry \nhoney. I forgot to duck.'' Unfortunately, once Alzheimer's disease \ntakes hold, it delivers a slow mind destroying bullet that none of us \ncan duck to avoid. As Ronald Reagan wrote shortly after learning of his \ndiagnosis ``I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from \nthis painful experience.'' From the moment of diagnosis, it's ``a truly \nlong, long, goodbye,'' Nancy Reagan said.\n  Fortunately for all of us, when Ronald Reagan courageously announced \nin such an honest and public manner that he had Alzheimer's, rather \nthan covering it up, he did a great deal to help alleviate the negative \nstigma that has long faced those suffering from this terrible disease. \nMuch of the shame and pity traditionally associated with Alzheimer's \nwas transformed almost overnight into sympathy and understanding as \npublic awareness suddenly shot up and those suffering from Alzheimer's, \nand their families, knew that they were not alone.\n  While Ronald Reagan's health didn't deteriorate right away, according \nto Mrs. Reagan, he had his good days and bad days, ``just like \neverybody else.'' In recent years, however, Reagan's condition \ncompletely deteriorated--and quickly. ``It's frightening and it's \ncruel,'' Nancy said, speaking of the disease and what it has done to \nher husband and family. ``It's sad to see somebody you love and have \nbeen married to for so long, with Alzheimer's, and you can't share \nmemories,'' Mrs. Reagan said.\n  In the introduction to a recently released book based on the touching \nlove letters exchanged between herself and Reagan, Nancy elaborated on \nher sense of loss when she wrote, ``You know that it's a progressive \ndisease and that there's no place to go but down, no light at the end \nof the tunnel. You get tired and frustrated, because you have no \ncontrol and you feel helpless.'' She also said, ``There are so many \nmemories that I can no longer share, which makes it very difficult.''\n  Nancy Reagan has earned our Nation's admiration for her steadfast and \nloving dedication to her husband as she watched her beloved husband \nslowly fade away. Likewise, families all across our Nation, day in and \nday out, choose to personally provide care for their loved ones \nsuffering from Alzheimer's, rather than putting them in institutions. \nThey deserve our respect and support.\n  Fortunately, Mrs. Reagan has had access to vital resources that \nhelped her care for her husband. This is how it should be. \nUnfortunately, there are many American families out there who do not \nhave access to these resources. This bill will help alleviate that by \nraising money to help American families who are struggling while \nproviding care for their loved ones.\n  Funding for Alzheimer's research has increased significantly over the \npast several years. Ronald Reagan's courage in coming forward and \npublicly announcing his condition played an important role in raising \npublic awareness of Alzheimer's and paved the way for the recent \nincreases in research funding. But much more needs to be done and this \nbill would complement these efforts.\n  Once again, the legislation I am introducing today authorizes the \nU.S. Mint to produce commemorative coins honoring Ronald W. Reagan \nwhile raising funds to help families care for their family members \nsuffering from Alzheimer's disease. I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of this legislation.\n  Ronald Reagan's eternal optimism and deep seated belief in an even \nbetter future for our Nation was underscored when he said. ``I know \nthat for America, there will always be a bright future ahead.'' In \nhonoring him this week, and in honoring his struggle, this bill, in \nkeeping with this quote's spirit, will help provide for a better future \nfor many American families.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2517\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 378\n\n       Whereas the United States flag is a unique symbol of the \n     United States and its ideals;\n       Whereas millions of Americans instinctively look to the \n     United States flag with reverence, in times of national \n     crisis and triumph alike;\n       Whereas no other American symbol has been as universally \n     honored as the United States flag;\n       Whereas the United States flag has always played a unique \n     role in honoring the men and women of the Armed Forces who \n     have died in defense of the United States;\n       Whereas to the countless families of loved ones who have \n     died in defense of the United States, the United States flag \n     is a treasured possession and a poignant memory of their \n     loss;\n       Whereas the Second Continental Congress adopted the Stars \n     and Stripes as the official flag of the United States on June \n     14, 1777;\n       Whereas Congress has designated June 14 as Flag Day (36 \n     U.S.C. 110);\n       Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance is recited by millions of \n     Americans who wish to demonstrate their loyalty and \n     allegiance to the flag of the United States and to the \n     republic for which it stands;\n       Whereas President Eisenhower signed into law the modern \n     version of the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954 (Joint \n     Resolution entitled ``Joint Resolution to amend the pledge of \n     allegiance to the flag of the United States of America'', \n     Public Law 83-396, approved June 14, 1954), making Flag Day, \n     2004, the 50th anniversary of the modern version of the \n     Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas a 3-judge panel of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Newdow v. United \n     States Congress, 328 F.3d 466 (9th Cir. 2002), that the words \n     ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance violate the \n     establishment clause of the first amendment of the \n     Constitution of the United States when recited voluntarily by \n     students in public schools;\n       Whereas on June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court issued a \n     decision, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow (docket \n     number 02-1624), that reversed the decision of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Newdow \n     case solely on procedural grounds, but that leaves unresolved \n     whether the Supreme Court agrees with the decision of the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to \n     strike down the Pledge of Allegiance as unconstitutional;\n       Whereas Congress, in 1954, believed that it was acting \n     constitutionally when it revised the Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas the Senate believes that the Pledge of Allegiance, \n     as revised in 1954 and as recodified in 2002 (4 U.S.C. 4), is \n     a fully constitutional expression of patriotism; and\n       Whereas the Senate has twice acted by unanimous consent to \n     authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to defend the \n     constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance in the Federal \n     courts (Senate Resolution 134, 108th Congress, agreed to May \n     8, 2003, and Senate Resolution 292, 107th Congress, agreed to \n     June 26, 2002): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports and reveres the United States flag and the \n     Pledge of Allegiance;\n       (2) strongly disapproves of the decision by the 3-judge \n     panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit in Newdow v. United States Congress; and\n       (3) hereby designates June 14, 2004, as ``National Pledge \n     of Allegiance to the Flag Day''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 379--PROTECTING, PROMOTING, AND CELEBRATING \n                               FATHERHOOD\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Allen, Mr. \nBennett, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Crapo, \nMr. Domenici, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nLott, Mr. Miller, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. Talent) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 379\n\n       Whereas the third Sunday of June is observed as Father's \n     Day;\n       Whereas fathers have a unique bond with their children \n     which is often unrecognized;\n       Whereas the complimentary nature of the roles and \n     contributions of fathers and mothers should be recognized and \n     encouraged;\n       Whereas fathers have an indispensable role in building and \n     transforming society to build a culture of life;\n       Whereas fathers, along with their wives, form an emotional \n     template for the future professional and personal \n     relationships of a child;\n       Whereas the involvement of a father in the life of his \n     child significantly influences economic and educational \n     attainment and delinquency of the child; and\n       Whereas children who experience a close relationship with \n     their fathers are protected from delinquency and \n     psychological distress: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes the importance of \n     fathers to a healthy society and calls on all the people of \n     the United States to observe Father's Day by considering how \n     society can better respect and support fatherhood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/06/14/senate-section/article/S6741-1", "month": "06", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3449.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 378, which was \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A Senate resolution (S. Res. 378) designating June 14, \n     2004, as ``National Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will approve \nS. Res. 378, designating today--June 14, 2004--as the National Pledge \nof Allegiance to the Flag Day.\n  The resolution, which I introduced earlier today, is cosponsored by \nseveral of my fellow Judiciary Committee members--Senators Feinstein, \nCraig, Grassley, Chambliss, Graham of South Carolina, and DeWine. I \nthank them.\n  For Americans across the land, today is a special day.\n  First of all, today is Flag Day. This morning, I was honored to \nattend a Flag Day commemoration event at VFW Post 2494, located in the \ncity of Grand Prairie in my beloved home State of Texas. Flag Day is \nthe anniversary of the Flag Resolution of 1777. It was officially \nestablished in a proclamation by President Woodrow Wilson on May 30, \n1916, and on August 3, 1949, President Harry S. Truman signed an act of \nCongress designating June 14 of each year as National Flag Day.\n  I look forward to Flag Day every year, because--as today's resolution \nnotes--Flag Day gives Americans across the land the opportunity to \nremember and reaffirm that the United States flag is a unique symbol of \nthe United States and its ideals. Millions of Americans instinctively \nlook to the United States flag with reverence, in times of national \ncrisis and triumph alike. No other American symbol has been as \nuniversally honored as the United States flag. The United States flag \nhas always played a unique role in honoring the men and women of the \nArmed Forces who have died in defense of the United States. To the \ncountless families of loved ones who have died in defense of the United \nStates, the United States flag is a treasured possession and a poignant \nmemory of their loss.\n  But today is also special for another reason. As the resolution also \nnotes, today is the 50th anniversary of the modern version of the \nPledge of Allegiance. The pledge has come under attack in recent years, \nhowever. Two years ago, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, the Federal court of appeals based in \nSan Francisco, ruled in the case of Newdow v. United States Congress, \n328 F.3d 466 (9th Cir. 2002), that the establishment clause of the \nfirst amendment of the Constitution forbids public school teachers from \nleading willing students in the voluntary recitation of the Pledge of \nAllegiance, simply because the pledge confirms that our Nation was \nfounded ``under God.''\n  Most Americans were alarmed by the decision, and rightly so. In \nresponse, a majority of the Senate subcommittee on the Constitution, \nCivil Rights and Property Rights filed the first amicus brief in the \nU.S. Supreme Court defending the pledge on the merits. The Senate legal \ncounsel also filed a brief defending the pledge on behalf of the entire \nU.S. Senate. Clearly, members of both parties reject the views of the \nNinth Circuit, the ACLU, and Americans United for the Separation of \nChurch and State, and instead believe in the constitutionality of the \nPledge of Allegiance.\n  Just last week, the subcommittee convened a hearing, entitled \n``Beyond the Pledge of Allegiance: Hostility to Religious Expression in \nthe Public Square.'' At that hearing, scholars testified that our \ncourts have become so hostile to democracy and to religious expression \nthat they object even to patriotic references to God, such as those \ncontained in the pledge.\n  Let us be clear: There is nothing unconstitutional about pledging \nallegiance to the flag. And thankfully, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed \nthe Ninth Circuit decision in the Newdow case just this morning.\n  The Court did so, however, solely on procedural grounds--leaving for \nanother day a determination by the Supreme Court as to whether it \nagrees with the Ninth Circuit's decision striking down the Pledge as \nunconstitutional.\n  I am glad to see that at least three members of the Supreme Court--\nChief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas--\nspecifically acknowledged the constitutionality of the pledge in their \nopinions this morning. Their expressions follow a long line of \nstatements in previous Supreme Court decisions supporting the Pledge. \nSee, e.g., Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 440 n.5 (1962) (Douglas, J., \nconcurring) (``The Pledge of Allegiance . . . in no way run[s] contrary \nto the First Amendment but recognize[s] only the guidance of God in our \nnational affairs.'') (quotations and citations omitted); Sch. Dist. of \nAbington v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 304 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) \n(``The reference to divinity in the revised pledge of allegiance . . . \nmay merely recognize the historical fact that our Nation was believed \nto have been founded `under God.' Thus reciting the pledge may be no \nmore of a religious exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's \nGettysburg Address, which contains an allusion to the same historical \nfact.''); Lynch v. Donelly, 465 U.S. 668, 676 (1984) (``There is an \nunbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of \ngovernment of the role of religion in American life from at least 1789 \n. . . [E]xamples of reference to our religious heritage are found . . . \nin the language `One Nation under God,' as part of the Pledge of \nAllegiance to the American flag. That pledge is recited by many \nthousands of public school children--and adults--every year.''); \nWallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 78 n.5 (1985) (O'Connor, J., \nconcurring) (``In my view, the words `under God' in the Pledge . . . \nserve as an acknowledgment of religion with `the legitimate secular \npurposes of solemnizing public occasions, [and] expressing confidence \nin the future.' ''); County of Allegheny v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 602-3 \n(1989) (``Our previous opinions have considered in dicta the motto and \nthe pledge, characterizing them as consistent with the proposition that \ngovernment may not communicate an endorsement of religious belief.''); \nsee also Sherman v. Community Consolidated\n\n[[Page S6744]]\n\nSch. Dist. 21, 980 F.2d 437 (7th Cir. 1992) (upholding \nconstitutionality of school district policy providing for voluntary \nrecitation of the Pledge).\n  However, the other five Justices of the Supreme Court--Justices \nStevens, Kennedy, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer--did not see fit to join \nthe other three Justices in supporting the constitutionality of the \npledge. They appear to have remained largely silent on the issue. I \nhope that they are not sending a signal with their silence--a signal \nthat they may strike down the pledge in some future case. Certainly, by \nreversing the Ninth Circuit on solely procedural grounds, they \neffectively reserve for themselves the opportunity to strike down the \npledge in a future case.\n  The majority opinion does state that, ``as its history illustrates, \nthe Pledge of Allegiance evolved as a common public acknowledgement of \nthe ideals that our flag symbolizes. Its recitation is a patriotic \nexercise designed to foster national unity and pride in those \nprinciples.'' This passage suggests that the majority would uphold the \nPledge of Allegiance against constitutional attack under the \nestablishment clause. I hope that that is ultimately what the Court \nwill do. I hope that the Court will ultimately vote to uphold and \nprotect the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  I am not so optimistic about the Court voting to protect the flag \nitself, however--as I wrote in an op-ed published in the Fort Worth \nStar-Telegram just this morning, a copy of which I ask unanimous \nconsent be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. To be sure, from the founding, of our Nation until 1989, \nthe power to protect the flag was not in doubt. In Smith v. Goguen, \n1974, the U.S. Supreme Court held, in a decision authored by Justice \nLewis Powell, that ``nothing prevents a legislature from defining with \nsubstantial specificity what constitutes forbidden treatment of United \nStates flags.'' Justice Byron White stated in that same case that \n``[i]t would be foolishness to suggest that the men who wrote the \nConstitution thought they were violating it when they specified a flag \nfor the new Nation. . . . There would seem to be little question about \nthe power of Congress to forbid the mutilation of the Lincoln Memorial. \n. . . The Flag is itself a monument, subject to similar protection.'' \nIn Street v. New York, 1969, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that ``the \nStates and Federal Government do have the power to protect the flag \nfrom acts of desecration and disgrace.'' Justice Hugo Black wrote in \nthat same case that ``[i]t passes my belief that anything in the \nFederal Constitution bars a State from making the deliberate burning of \nthe American Flag an offense.'' And Justice Abe Fortas noted that ``the \nStates and the Federal Government have the power to protect the flag \nfrom acts of desecration committed in public.'' More recently, Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist, Justice John Paul Stevens, and Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor have all expressed their belief that nothing in the \nfirst amendment prohibits protection of the flag.\n  Accordingly, until recently, 48 States have had laws on the books \nprotecting the flag--most of them patterned after the Uniform Flag Act \nof 1917. The Federal Government enacted its own law in 1967. And \nCongress reaffirmed that law in 1989 with the support of 91 Senators.\n  This historic power to protect the flag was eviscerated in 1989, \nhowever when the U.S. Supreme Court issued the first of two decisions, \nboth decided by a bare 5 to 4 majority, declaring that flag desecration \nconstitutes speech protected by the first amendment. See Texas v. \nJohnson, 1989, and United States v. Eichman, 1990.\n  Legal scholars agree that the flag protection amendment is the only \nway to restore the law as it existed for most of our Nation's history. \nConstitutional amendments are the only way for the American people to \nreverse judicial constitutional decisions they reject. The Eleventh, \nFourteenth, Sixteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-Fourth, and Twenty-Sixth \namendments were all ratified in order to reverse judicial decisions \nwith which the American people disagreed.\n  So I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the flag protection \namendment, S.J. Res. 4. That resolution was introduced by Senator Hatch \nand by my Democrat cosponsor of today's resolution, Senator Feinstein. \nThe amendment states simply that ``[t]he Congress shall have power to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States.'' I \nam proud to be an original cosponsor of the flag protection amendment, \nbecause I firmly believe that the flag occupies a unique place in our \nNation and deserves constitutional recognition as such.\n  Of course, the first amendment guarantees freedom of speech, and \nthankfully so. And of course, the requirement that constitutional \namendments be approved by two-thirds of each House of Congress and \nthree-fourths of the States guarantees that the liberties we hold dear \nwill not be taken away, just because we have acted today to protect the \nU.S. flag against physical desecration.\n  Moreover, the first amendment itself already contains exceptions. For \nexample, the law does not allow individuals to yell ``Fire!'' in a \ncrowded theater--even though such laws do impose a burden on the \nfreedom of speech, albeit a minor one. Likewise, the vast majority of \nAmericans agree that the Nation is better off when our flag is \nprotected.\n  The House has approved the flag protection amendment five times in \nthe past five Congresses--including just last year. All 50 State \nlegislatures have approved resolutions asking Congress to give them the \nopportunity to vote on the amendment. The last time that the amendment \nwas brought to a vote on the Senate floor, in 2000, 63 Senators voted \nin favor of it--just four votes shy of the necessary two-thirds.\n  I urge my colleagues at least to give the States the opportunity to \nconsider this amendment. And I urge my colleagues at least to give \nconstitutional recognition to the importance of the United States flag \nto millions of Americans--even if they ultimately would oppose \nimplementing legislation to protect the flag against physical \ndesecration.\n  After all, the flag protection amendment does nothing more than to \nrecognize that the United States flag occupies a unique position as the \nsymbol of our Nation and, accordingly, deserves constitutional \nrecognition as such. The amendment would empower Congress to take \naction to protect the flag, but it would not require Congress to do \nanything whatsoever.\n  There are many ways to express one's political views. But there is \nonly one United States flag--and it deserves constitutional protection.\n  I look forward to the debate over the flag protection amendment, and \nI look forward to a decision of the U.S. Supreme Court affirming for \nall time the constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  Until then, I am pleased that, because of the Senate's action today, \ntoday will forever be known as the National Pledge of Allegiance to the \nFlag Day.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           [From the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, June 14, 2004]\n\n             Our Banner Deserves Constitutional Protection\n\n                            (By John Cornyn)\n\n       For Americans everywhere, Flag Day is special. And today we \n     mark not only the annual celebration of the U.S. flag but \n     also the 50th anniversary of the modern Pledge of Allegiance.\n       The U.S. flag is a uniquely powerful symbol of our nation \n     and of our commitment to freedom and democracy. Therefore, it \n     is deeply regrettable that our democratic system of \n     government to date has not properly protected it.\n       A June 2 hearing of the Senate subcommittee on the \n     Constitution, Civil Rights and Property Rights got to the \n     heart of this problem.\n       Legal scholars testified that our courts have become so \n     hostile to democracy and to religious expression that even \n     patriotic references to God, such as those contained in the \n     Pledge of Allegiance, are being wrongly struck down by the \n     courts.\n       Let's be clear: There is nothing unconstitutional about \n     pledging allegiance to the flag. Yet a federal appeals court \n     in San Francisco struck down the pledge anyway simply because \n     it acknowledges that our nation was founded and exists \n     ``under God.''\n       The U.S. Supreme Court will soon decide whether the First \n     Amendment forbids schoolteachers across America from leading \n     students in voluntary recitation of the pledge.\n       The vast majority of Americans believe that the pledge is \n     constitutional and reject\n\n[[Page S6745]]\n\n     the views of the 9th Circuit Court and the American Civil \n     Liberties Union. A majority of the Constitution subcommittee \n     members filed the first amicus brief in the Supreme Court \n     defending the pledge on its merits.\n       Many legal observers predict that the Supreme Court will \n     reverse the 9th Circuit's decision. The same cannot be said, \n     however, for protecting the flag itself.\n       The ability to protect the flag against physical \n     desecration was not in doubt throughout most of American \n     history. For example, in 1974, the Supreme Court held that \n     ``nothing prevents a legislature from defining with \n     substantial specificity what constitutes forbidden treatment \n     of United States flags.''\n       Congress' power to protect the flag has also been supported \n     by Chief Justices Earl Warren and William Rehnquist and \n     Justices Byron White, Hugo Black, Abe Fortas, John Paul \n     Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.\n       This power, however, was eviscerated in 1989 when the \n     Supreme Court decided by a 5-4 majority that flag desecration \n     constitutes speech protected by the First Amendment.\n       The flag deserves constitutional protection, and legal \n     scholars agree that the Flag Protection Amendment is the only \n     way to restore the law as it existed for most of our nation's \n     history. That is why the Constitution subcommittee recently \n     approved the amendment, and the full committee is scheduled \n     to vote on it this month.\n       The First Amendment guarantees freedom of speech, and \n     rightfully so. The requirement that constitutional amendments \n     be approved by two-thirds of each chamber of Congress and \n     three-fourths of the states guarantees that the liberties we \n     hold dear will not be taken away just because the American \n     people decide to take action to protect the U.S. flag against \n     physical desecration.\n       The House has approved the Flag Protection Amendment five \n     times in the past five Congresses--including just last year. \n     All 50 state legislatures have approved resolutions asking \n     Congress to give them the opportunity to vote on the \n     amendment.\n       The last time that the amendment was brought to a vote on \n     the Senate floor, in 2000, 63 senators voted in favor of it--\n     just four votes shy of the necessary two-thirds. This year, \n     the prospects for passage could be even better.\n       In times of national crisis and triumph alike, it is the \n     U.S. flag that Americans look to with reverence. No other \n     American symbol has been as universally honored.\n       In a time of war, it is even clearer that the flag plays a \n     unique role in honoring the men and women of the military who \n     died for the ideals that the flag represents.\n       If a soldier dies in defense of our nation, the United \n     States gives the family a flag in honor of that service. To \n     countless families, the flag is a treasured possession and a \n     poignant memory of their loss.\n       There are many ways to express one's political views. But \n     there is only one United States flag--and it deserves \n     constitutional protection.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could proceed, it is very appropriate \nthat today--I do not know if the distinguished Chair knows this, being \nas busy as he has been all day--the Supreme Court upheld our being able \nto pledge allegiance to the flag. They did it on a procedural grounds, \nbut I do not think it matters. We won.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished leader for advising the Senate \nof that. I had heard of that earlier today. I think it is most \nappropriate that our colleague from Texas has acted. The Senate will \nact without any further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 378) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 378\n\n       Whereas the United States flag is a unique symbol of the \n     United States and its ideals;\n       Whereas millions of Americans instinctively look to the \n     United States flag with reverence, in times of national \n     crisis and triumph alike;\n       Whereas no other American symbol has been as universally \n     honored as the United States flag;\n       Whereas the United States flag has always played a unique \n     role in honoring the men and women of the Armed Forces who \n     have died in defense of the United States;\n       Whereas to the countless families of loved ones who have \n     died in defense of the United States, the United States flag \n     is a treasured possession and a poignant memory of their \n     loss;\n       Whereas the Second Continental Congress adopted the Stars \n     and Stripes as the official flag of the United States on June \n     14, 1777;\n       Whereas Congress has designated June 14 as Flag Day (36 \n     U.S.C. 110);\n       Whereas the Pledge of Allegiance is recited by millions of \n     Americans who wish to demonstrate their loyalty and \n     allegiance to the flag of the United States and to the \n     republic for which it stands;\n       Whereas President Eisenhower signed into law the modern \n     version of the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954 (Joint \n     Resolution entitled ``Joint Resolution to amend the pledge of \n     allegiance to the flag of the United States of America'', \n     Public Law 83-396, approved June 14, 1954), making Flag Day, \n     2004, the 50th anniversary of the modern version of the \n     Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas a 3-judge panel of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Newdow v. United \n     States Congress, 328 F.3d 466 (9th Cir. 2002), that the words \n     ``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance violate the \n     establishment clause of the first amendment of the \n     Constitution of the United States when recited voluntarily by \n     students in public schools;\n       Whereas on June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court issued a \n     decision, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow (docket \n     number 02-1624), that reversed the decision of the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the Newdow \n     case solely on procedural grounds, but that leaves unresolved \n     whether the Supreme Court agrees with the decision of the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to \n     strike down the Pledge of Allegiance as unconstitutional;\n       Whereas Congress, in 1954, believed that it was acting \n     constitutionally when it revised the Pledge of Allegiance;\n       Whereas the Senate believes that the Pledge of Allegiance, \n     as revised in 1954 and as recodified in 2002 (4 U.S.C. 4), is \n     a fully constitutional expression of patriotism; and\n       Whereas the Senate has twice acted by unanimous consent to \n     authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to defend the \n     constitutionality of the Pledge of Allegiance in the Federal \n     courts (Senate Resolution 134, 108th Congress, agreed to May \n     8, 2003, and Senate Resolution 292, 107th Congress, agreed to \n     June 26, 2002): Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports and reveres the United States flag and the \n     Pledge of Allegiance;\n       (2) strongly disapproves of the decision by the 3-judge \n     panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \n     Circuit in Newdow v.
