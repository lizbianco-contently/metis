The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I welcome back the distinguished \nassistant Republican leader and the Presiding Officer.\n  I come to the floor today to say a few words about what I believe is \none of the most difficult issues to talk about in the ongoing conflict \nin Iraq. My remarks will not address whether I support our troops in \nIraq, because I do. All Americans, I believe, are awed by the courage \nand sacrifice of our troops in Iraq. My remarks will not address \nwhether I am concerned about the administration's failure to honor its \ncommitment to our troops that they would be required to serve no more \nthan 365 days ``boots on the ground,'' because I am. My remarks will \nnot address whether I believe it is essential that we win the fight to \nbring democracy, stay the course in Iraq until we see Iraq on the road \nto democracy, because I do. Instead, I rise for the sole purpose of \nacknowledging the terrible, growing toll this war is taking on some of\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nAmerica's finest citizens and their families.\n  More than 700 American troops have died in the war, and this month, \nas we all know, has been the deadliest month for U.S. soldiers in Iraq. \nMore than 100 Americans soldiers have been killed in Iraq since April \n1. Twelve more brave soldiers lost their lives in Iraq this past \nweekend.\n  I come to the floor to pay tribute to the sacrifice of these \nsoldiers. They sacrificed everything because our Nation asked them to, \nand we owe them an enormous debt of gratitude. I say to the grieving \nfamilies of our fallen heroes: America is with you in sorrow, and we \nwill not forget you or the loved ones you have lost.\n  On Holy Thursday, April 8, on the western outskirts of Baghdad, on \nthe road to Fallujah, Marine Lance Corporal Levi Angell died when the \nHumvee he was riding in was hit by a rocket propelled grenade. He was \n20 years old. After learning of his son's death, Levi Angell's father \nstood outside the family's home in St. Louis, MN, clutching an 8-by-10-\ninch photo of his son close to his heart. ``This was my son,'' he told \nreporters. ``I am as proud as proud can be of that young man.'' He \nadded, ``It's a sad, sad day. This is a sad, sad country right now.''\n  This is a sad, sad day in South Dakota, too. Last night, we learned \nthat one of the 12 American soldiers killed in Iraq this past weekend \nwas a member of the South Dakota National Guard. Army Specialist Dennis \nMorgan was the sixth South Dakota soldier to die in Iraq and the first \nmember of the South Dakota National Guard killed in this war. A \nmilitary spokesman said he was helping clear mines and explosives \nSaturday when a roadside bomb went off. He was 22 years old, and \nmarried.\n  He joined the Guard immediately after graduating from high school in \nWinner, SD, class of 2000. He had been in the Middle East for just \nunder 2 months. Today, South Dakotans are mourning Specialist Morgan's \ndeath, and praying that his family can find some comfort for their \nsorrow. We also pray for the safety of the soldiers who remain in Iraq.\n  I want to say a few words about some of the other fallen American \nheroes who lost their lives in Iraq this month.\n  Marine Private First Class Dustin Sekula, of Edinburg, TX, was killed \nby enemy fire in Fallujah on April 1. Private First Class Dustin Sekula \ngraduated from high school last year and gave up a full college \nscholarship to join the Marines. The father of a high school friend \ntold his hometown newspaper, ``He was worth his weight in gold. He \nwould try to conquer anything they would throw at him.''\n  Twelve American soldiers died in Iraq on April 4, Palm Sunday. Eight \nof those soldiers died together in a battle with militia loyal to \nShiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr in Sadr City, a Shiite slum on the \noutskirts of Baghdad. The soldiers were part of a quick response team \nthat rushed to rescue a platoon pinned down by gunfire in Sadr City.\n  Seven of the eight were members of the Army's 2nd Battalion, 5th \nCavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. They had been in Iraq less than \n3 weeks. They were: Specialist Casey Sheehan, 24, from Vacaville, CA; \nSpecialist Dustin Hiller, 25, of Opelika, AL; Specialist Ahmed Cason, \n24, of McCalla, AL; Corporal Forest Jostes, 22, of Albion, IL; Sergeant \nYihjyn Chen, 31, from Saipan, Marianas Protectorate, who spoke five \nlanguages and became a U.S. citizen in the Army; and Private First \nClass Robert Arsiaga, and Specialist Israel Garza, two West Texans, \nboth 25, both married, who became best friends at Fort Hood.\n  At a memorial service in Baghdad for the fallen seven, their \nBattalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Gary Volesky, said, ``Uncommon \nvalor was common that day.''\n  The eighth soldier killed in the firefight in Sadr City, Sergeant \nMichael Mitchell, 25, of Porterville, CA, was with the Army's 1st \nArmored Division. He had been in Baghdad for 11 months and had re-\nenlisted 3 months before he died. His father joined hundreds of other \npeople marching in a peace rally in San Luis Obispo on the first \nanniversary of the war. Bill Mitchell told reporters, ``I said, `Bring \nmy son home now.' I should have said, `Bring my son home alive.' ''\n  Seven American soldiers died in Iraq on Monday, April 5, Passover. \nAmong them was Army Sergeant Lee Todacheene, of Farmington, New Mexico, \na member of the Army's 1st Infantry medic unit. He was killed instantly \nwhen mortar fire hit his guard post in Balad.\n\n  Sergeant Todacheene was the nephew of Navajo Nation Vice President \nFrank Dayish Jr., through Dayish's wife, Virginia. He is the third \nNative American soldier to die in Iraq. Army Specialist Lori Piestawa, \na member of the Hopi tribe killed last March, was the first woman \nkilled in combat in the war. Sheldon Hawk Eagle, a member of the \nCheyenne River Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, died last November.\n  Leaders of the Navajo Nation praised Todacheene as a ``Navajo \nwarrior'' who ``went to war not to hurt, but to help.'' His younger \nbrother, Rydell, said, ``He was proud to be in the U.S. Army and a \nmedic. He was proud to be a Navajo. He believed he was doing some good \nin Iraq when everyone thought it was wrong. He was a quiet man. He was \na strong man, a gentleman. He respected himself and everybody, He was \ngenerous and kind, and he loved his family above everything else.''\n  Tuesday, April 6, was one of the deadliest days of fighting in Iraq \nsince the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. Thirteen Americans died in \nIraq that day. Among them were two 18-year-old Marines, both killed by \nhostile fire in Fallujah.\n  Marine Lance Corporal Anthony Roberts, of Bear, DE, was a member of \nthe Air Force ROTC in high school. In an interview with the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer, his former ROTC instructor recalled Lance \nCorporal Roberts as ``the rare recruit who seemed not to care about the \nsteady employment, decent pay and educational benefits that the \nmilitary offers. `He only talked about serving his country.' ''\n  Marine Private First Class Ryan Jerback was from Oneida, WI. He was \nkilled by hostile fire in Fallujah. His father told the Green Bay Press \nGazette that his son told him, ``Dad, maybe I can go over there and \nmake some change. Maybe I can do something with the people and show \nthem that we're not animals here, you know?''\n  ``He gave everything he had,'' his father said, ``and it cost him his \nlife.''\n  Six American soldiers died in Iraq on April 7. Among them was Army \nStaff Sergeant George Scott Rentschler, of Louisville, KY. He was \nchecking on his platoon members, who were working at a checkpoint, when \na rocket propelled grenade hit the side of a tank in which he was \nriding. Iraq was his second war. He had also served in Bosnia.\n  His mother told the Louisville Gleaner, ``He always told me that the \nonly way he would get hurt was if they took a rocket to the side of his \ntank. That's what happened.''\n  Staff Sergeant Rentschler had been scheduled to leave Iraq today. He \nwas 31 years old. He leaves a wife and two sons, ages 12 and 5.\n  Eight Americans died in Iraq on April 8, Holy Thursday. Marine Staff \nSergeant William Harrell, 30, Placentia, CA, was one of them. He was \nkilled by hostile fire in Fallujah.\n  His widow, Kelli, told the Associated Press that when she broke the \nnews to her 7-year-old son, he asked her, ``If (Daddy) just got shot, \ncan't they help him?'' She replied, ``Daddy can't be helped right now. \nDaddy's with God.''\n  Thirteen American soldiers died on April 9, Good Friday. Among them \nwas Army National Guard Specialist Michelle Witmer, of New Berlin, WI, \nwho died when her Humvee was ambushed in Baghdad.\n  Michelle's 24-year-old sister, Rachel, served in the same unit, the \n32nd Military Police Company. Her twin sister, Charity, was sent to \nIraq last year as a medic. The sisters and the rest of the Witmer \nfamily is agonizing now about whether they should rejoin their units in \nIraq. Michelle Witmer was one of at least two women, and four National \nGuard members, killed this month in Iraq.\n  Eight American soldiers died in Iraq on Easter Sunday, April 11. Army \nSergeant Major Michael Stack and Marine Lance Corporal Torrey Gray were \namong them. Sergeant Major Stack, a Special Forces soldier, was 48, a \nfather of six and grandfather of three. Lance Corporal Gray was 19; he \nwas on his second tour in Iraq. They both died from hostile fire, in \nseparate incidents, in Fallujah. As word of Lance Corporal\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\nGray's death spread through his hometown of Patoka, IL, a small town \nabout 60 miles east of St. Louis, village officials put up the ``Avenue \nof Flags,'' an observance usually reserved for national holidays.\n  Army Specialist Richard Trevithick, of Gaines, MI, was one of two \nU.S. soldiers killed in Iraq on April 14. The 20-year-old combat \nengineer died when an improvised explosive device exploded near his \nHumvee in the city of Balad. The explosion caused massive damage to his \nchest and killed him instantly. He had been in Iraq 2 months.\n  His father told the Associated Press, ``You hear it, you process it, \nyou understand the words, but the impact doesn't hit you. You wake up \nin the morning thinking it was a mad dream, then realize it was not.''\n  As I said, I support our troops and what they are trying to \naccomplish in Iraq--under the most difficult of circumstances.\n  The reality is that this war requires almost no sacrifice for the \noverwhelming number of Americans.

Mr. President, I listened to the comments of my dear \nfriend, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota. I share his grief \nand his concerns over how many of our young people have sacrificed \ntheir lives for all of us. There is no question about it; these are \nheroes to all of us. As the son of parents who lost their only other \nson in the Second World War, I know a family's grief over such a \ndevastating loss. We know what it is like to have a son missing in \naction and, whose remains were found 2 years later. Our family had to \ngo through all of the pain, difficulty, grieving, and remorse. But all \nof that didn't take away the fact that my brother, Jesse Moreland \nHatch, was a great hero like so many others who died in all of our \nwars, but in World War II in this particular case, and the 50,000-plus \nyoung men and women who died in Vietnam.\n  These young people are doing the Lord's work. They deposed a tyrant \nthat killed hundreds of thousands of his own people and threatened the \nwhole Middle East, and, by his association with terrorists at war with \nus, threatened us. Our heroes are fighting to bring stability to the \nMiddle East, and they have put pressure on all of the tyrannies of the \nMiddle East. They have taken a stand against tyranny, against \nterrorists, and for the prospect of decent societies throughout that \nregion.\n  I have seen letter after letter of people who have served in Iraq who \nhave made it very clear that the work they are doing is work for all of \nus, and we ought to be proud. They are helping people to find \nthemselves in decent and safe societies. They are helping people down \nthe road to freedom. They are helping people who have never understood \nwhat it is like to have a free market economy. They are helping people \nfor the first time in their lives to have some sort of hope that they \nmight be free--and free from brutality, terrorism, vindictive \ntreatment, murder, and death.\n  Our young men and women understand that what they are doing is very \nimportant; and it is important for everybody in America to stand with \nthem. It is important for everybody in America to realize that we pay \nextraordinary costs, borne by the families who lost their loved ones in \norder to stand up for freedom.\n  In this particular case, I think it is pretty hard to make a case \nthat we shouldn't be there. It is pretty hard to make a case that we \nshouldn't have deposed Saddam Hussein. It is pretty hard to make a case \nthat we shouldn't be trying to bring some sort of representative form \nof government to Iraq and, therefore, the whole Middle East. It is \npretty hard to oppose the fact that our young men and women are serving \nwith distinction for a good cause. It is pretty hard to make some of \nthe ridiculous arguments that have been made by those who are opposed \nto U.S. involvement anywhere.\n  I want to pay tribute to these young men and women who are serving \nover there, and also to the civilians who are serving over there. They \nmay be getting paid for their jobs, but it is a dangerous place--at \nleast some areas are very dangerous--to be. But what they are doing is \ncritical to our security. I think they deserve the applause of all of \nus and the support of all of us.\n  I hope all of our colleagues will always continue to support not only \nour troops over there but also our President who has all that any \nPresident really needs to handle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4077-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4077-S4078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                OAK HILL\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes today to report \non the very shocking and troubling situation right here in our Nation's \nCapitol. I am speaking of the situation of the District of Columbia's \njuvenile detention center known as Oak Hill.\n  Right before the Easter recess I visited the center. Also, as \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the District of \nColumbia, I held a hearing to review the operations of Oak Hill. \nActually we held the hearing first. As a result of that hearing, I then \nmade a point to personally visit Oak Hill. Based on what I saw at this \njuvenile facility and the testimony we heard at a hearing, it is clear \nto me Oak Hill is not meeting the needs of the children it serves, that \nthe conditions there are abysmal to say the least, and this place \nsimply needs to be shut down once and for all.\n  At our hearing the inspector general for the District of Columbia \nreleased a comprehensive report about the situation at Oak Hill. Let me \nmention some of the more egregious deficiencies outlined in that \nreport. First, illegal drugs such as marijuana and PCP were regularly \nsmuggled into Oak Hill in the past. In some cases, youth correction \nofficers in the past were the source of some of the illegal substances. \nThat is a rather shocking thought, that the correctional officers were \nthe sources of some of these illegal drugs actually coming into this \njuvenile detention facility. Substance abuse treatment contractors \nactually refused to renew contracts because Oak Hill was unable to stop \nthe influx of drugs.\n  They also found some youths entering Oak Hill drug free actually \nstarted taking drugs once they were inside the facility because they \nhad easy access to drugs there.\n  They also found the Youth Services Administration, which runs Oak \nHill, wasted millions of dollars on contractors who did not provide any \nmeaningful services or deliverables.\n  During this hearing Senator Landrieu and I held, the director of the \nPublic Defender Service of the District of Columbia testified the Youth \nServices Administration has failed to protect youths from harm while \nunder its care. For example--this is a very sad story--last year a 12-\nyear-old held at Oak Hill overnight, not accused of any crime, was \nplaced in a room with two other children. This 12-year-old was sexually \nassaulted by one of the other youths.\n  Several months later a 13-year-old was arrested and held at Oak Hill \nwaiting for shelter space to be available. The 13-year-old was placed \nin a room with the same child who had committed the sexual assault \nbefore on the 12-year-old. Not surprisingly, another sexual incident \noccurred and there was another victim; this sexual predator had another \nvictim.\n  Furthermore, I understand this practice of assigning more than one \nchild to a room has led to the commingling of status offenders, kids \nwho are runaways or truants--commingling them with delinquent youth as \nwell as detained committed youths. For example, these practices led to \na child detained as a truant and a runaway being housed in the same \nroom as a youth detained on charges of negligent homicide. That simply \nis not right. It is not\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\ngood practice. It is not permitted and should not have been allowed. \nAmazingly, these are only the latest in a long list of deficiencies \nwith the Youth Services Administration that stretches back at least 19 \nyears. Indeed, it was 19 years ago this month the Public Defender \nService filed a complaint against the District for failure to protect \nyouth under its custody. Year after year, the city has fallen short of \nthe court's ``Jerry M. Decree,'' which is the name of the court decree, \nand is now facing the prospect of being taken over by a court receiver. \nEqually amazing, some estimates are it costs nearly $90,000 a year to \nhouse a child at Oak Hill. But even more astounding than that is when I \nvisited this facility a little over a week ago and asked the interim \nadministrator and the interim special counsel from the Youth Services \nAdministration who gave me the tour how much it cost to house a child \nthere, they simply could not give me an answer. Their answer was they \ndid not break out how much it cost to run Oak Hill from a total cost of \nthe whole Youth Services Administration.\n\n  I find that to be astounding frankly. They did not know. They could \nnot give me a breakout so they couldn't tell us what Oak Hill cost to \nrun a year and therefore obviously they couldn't tell us whether the \n$90,000-a-year figure, which is what we believe it costs to house a \nchild there for a year, is an accurate figure.\n  I visited many youth detention facilities in Ohio in my public \ncareer. I was Lieutenant Governor of the State of Ohio and had the \nopportunity to visit, I think, all of our juvenile facilities during \nthe 4 years when I was Lieutenant Governor. I was a county prosecuting \nattorney. I learned a lot about these types of centers. I know what \nthey do well and what they do not do well. I can tell you with \ncertainty there are several things they are not doing very well at Oak \nHill right now.\n  The buildings are decrepit. They are falling apart. Important \nservices such as substance abuse treatment programs are certainly \npiecemeal at best. Children who are detained and awaiting trial are \ncommingled with those who are committed offenders. In fact, I learned \none girl who was committed merely because she is a truant has been \nhoused with committed delinquents since October. This, I understand, is \nin violation of the D.C. Code.\n  What is particularly troubling is what happens sometimes is the \nteenagers who are in foster care or group homes run away because they \nare being victimized by other youths in the same home or they run away \nfor other reasons. Once these children run away or are truant from \nschool, for example, they are labeled delinquents and they are often \npicked up and sent to Oak Hill. So neglected youths who are failed by a \nbroken foster care system now find themselves locked up and labeled \njuvenile delinquents and then are commingled in Oak Hill with dangerous \ndelinquents at a place where they are currently able to get ready \naccess to illicit drugs. What a horrible situation.\n  The Federal Government contributes about $15 million annually to the \nDistrict's Youth Services Administration, which administers Oak Hill. \nThe YSA would be eligible for even more Federal funding if it had a \nqualified drug treatment program in place. A large number of the \nchildren at Oak Hill have a substance abuse problem. That should not \nsurprise us. It is what I would expect. What I did not expect is to go \nto Oak Hill and find very little, if any, substance abuse treatment in \nplace.\n  In all fairness, when we went out there we were told substance abuse \ntreatment was on the way, that a program was going to be started. But \nthere was not much going on at all when we were there and there was a \npromise of something happening in the future. But that is what it was, \na promise.\n  Clearly, Congress has a vested interest in assuring the proper use of \nthe money we provide. We have, more importantly, a moral interest in \nensuring the proper treatment of youths at Oak Hill.\n  After touring the facility and after hearing from expert witnesses \nand after reading the November 6, 2001, recommendation of the Blue \nRibbon Commission on Youth Safety and Juvenile Justice Reform in the \nDistrict, I believe Oak Hill should be closed. The children of the \nDistrict of Columbia deserve better. The communities to which these \nyouths will one day be returned deserve better. It is our duty to work \nhard to rehabilitate these young offenders who have, frankly, often \nbeen failed by their parents and, yes, overlooked by their communities.\n  Not only do I recommend that Oak Hill be demolished, but I expect to \nsee the Mayor develop a comprehensive plan afterward so the problems at \nOak Hill are not repeated elsewhere. Just this past Thursday, Judge \nDixon of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia found that the \nDistrict is in contempt of court regarding Oak Hill having violated \nnumerous provisions of the ``Jerry M. Decree.'' Because of this \ncontempt finding, the city will be fined $1,000 per day and may be \nsubject to additional sanctions.\n  It is our hope these sanctions and this court order will push the \ncity towards addressing the intractable problems at Oak Hill. As I have \nalready stated, trying to fix this broken facility is, in my opinion, a \nwaste of time and a waste of money and is futile. We have waited 19 \nyears for improvements. Yet no one has stepped up to take the lead. If \nno one does, the problems at Oak Hill will continue.\n  The blue ribbon commission recommended that Oak Hill be shut down. \nJudges have recommended that it be shut down. And now it is time for \nthe District to step to the plate, take the lead, and shut this place \ndown once and for all.\n  Let me make one final comment in conclusion. When I was the Governor \nof Ohio, I visited every juvenile facility and every adult facility in \nOhio. I don't pretend to be an expert in this area, but I think I know \nsomething about it. What has happened at Oak Hill over the last few \nyears is that the District knows the place eventually is going to be \nclosed. So every problem they see, they look at it and they say, Well, \nthere is no reason to put money into fixing this problem or to fix that \nproblem. So it keeps getting worse and worse. It is sort of like a \nhouse you know you are going to bulldoze down in a few months, and you \nare not going to fix anything. Yet the District, for some inexplicable \nreason, does not have the will to shut this place down--to pull the \nplug and say enough is enough.\n  After touring this facility, I am saying enough is enough. It is not \nfair to the kids who are being sent out there. It is not fair to the \nemployees who have to work out there. And it is not fair to the \ntaxpayers to continue to put money into this facility. This facility \nhas to be shut down. The District has to move forward. It is in the \nbest interests of the children of the District of Columbia to do so.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for as long as I need.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4078-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4078-S4083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE FAIRNESS IN ASBESTOS RESOLUTION ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2290, the \nbipartisan Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act, appropriately \ncalled the FAIR Act. Let me talk about the problems for a minute. I \nthink I am stating the obvious, but it bears repeating.\n  Our country is faced with an asbestos litigation crisis of \nunparalleled magnitude. Something is terribly wrong when asbestos \nvictims who suffer from debilitating injuries recover mere pennies on \nthe dollar while people who are not sick and never have been sick a day \nin their lives from asbestos recover millions. Something is terribly \nwrong when scores of companies, many which never produced a shred of \nasbestos fiber, are forced into bankruptcy triggering lost jobs and \ndepleting pensions for those who lost their jobs. Something is terribly \nwrong when the only real winners in the current system are the handful \nof personal injury lawyers who walk to the bank with billions of \ndollars in fees.\n\n  Members may have heard the statistics before, but I will say them \nagain so that everyone knows the scope of the problem facing this \ncountry. According to the Rand Institute for Civil Justice, more than \n730,000 people have filed claims, with a sharp increase in filing\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nin the last 10 years. More than one million claims are expected to be \nfiled in the near future. The Rand study states the reason for this \ndramatic rise in claims is that through the 1980s, claims were filed \nonly by the manifestly ill. Beginning in the 1990s, about two-thirds of \nthe existing claims were and still are filed by people who are \nunimpaired, who are not sick. Listeners, you heard correctly. \nAstonishingly, the great majority of asbestos lawsuits are brought by \nthose who are not even sick.\n  This has led to an unacceptable division of resources to the wrong \npeople. Nonmalignant claimants take over 60 percent of the \ncompensation, leaving mesothelioma victims with only 20 percent. Worse \nyet, many mesothelioma victims are not able to recover any money at all \nbecause the companies they would have sued are insolvent.\n  The fact is, unscrupulous personal injury lawyers are abusing the \nsystem and getting a windfall in fees. They know the companies, even \nones with the most remote connections to asbestos, are fearful of \nrunaway verdicts. They exploit the uncertainty these tangential \ncompanies face in the current system by overwhelming them with huge \nnumbers of unimpaired claims in order to force massive settlements. I \nmight add that many of these companies have never had anything to do \nwith asbestos, but they are stuck defending themselves at a tremendous, \nhumongous cost because of what is going on. The result is the personal \ninjury lawyers--and it is a small percentage of the American Trial \nLawyers Association, a very small percentage of these personal injury \nlawyers--are reaping huge portions for themselves: over $20 billion so \nfar in attorney's fees alone in asbestos litigation thus far.\n  One actuarial firm estimates that personal injury lawyers are \nexpected to siphon more than $60 billion out of asbestos litigation \nbefore it is over. It is no wonder that the personal injury lawyers are \nfighting tooth and nail to keep the golden goose alive. These fees \ndetract from the moneys that should go to those who are truly sick, \nespecially the mesothelioma victims. Their tactics are not just about \nbuying private planes and sport teams and huge mansions while the \npersonal injury lawyers are busy making themselves into millionaires, \nmultimillionaires, in some cases billionaires; they are depriving the \ntruly sick of available resources.\n  Let me tell Members about a pipefitter from Illinois. I learned his \nstory from his daughter who lives in the State of Washington. A World \nWar II Navy veteran, he joined the pipefitters union in Chicago and \nworked at several locations in the Midwest, including sites in \nIllinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It was during this period \nthat he was repeatedly exposed to asbestos. Eighteen years ago, at the \nage of 61, he learned he had mesothelioma. Understanding the medical \nquagmire he faced and the consequences for his family, he quickly filed \nsuit against those he believed were responsible for his exposure. \nSadly, just months later, as with all mesothelioma victims of this \nvirulent form of cancer, he died.\n  His case was lumped together with others, many of whom were not as \nsick as he, and some of whom were not sick at all. For years, nothing \nhappened. It simply gathered dust on the docket. Eventually, it was \ntransferred from Illinois to Pennsylvania. It has now been 17 years \nsince his case was filed. Think about that. He never got to have his \nday in court. His widow is still waiting, 17 years later.\n\n  What would happen in his case if S. 2290 is enacted? First, because \nhe had mesothelioma, his estate would be paid $1 million. It would be \npaid on an expedited basis. Second, his claim would have been evaluated \nand processed in a matter of months, not decades. Third, he would not \nbe forced to give up half of the awards--moneys desperately needed for \nmedical bills, treatment, and all of the economic and personal losses \nthat afflicted his family--to his lawyers.\n  What is wrong with the asbestos litigation system? This Navy veteran \nwith mesothelioma got zero out of this tort system. Out of the FAIR \nAct, he would get $1 million. He would not even need an attorney to get \nit. He would not have to pay 50 percent to attorneys. That is the way \nit should work.\n  Let me mention the case of Rick Napier who suffers from asbestosis. \nHe has trouble breathing. He cannot even walk without great difficulty \nbecause of the disease. He no longer has the lung capacity he needs for \nphysical labor, let alone normal, everyday activities. Rick Napier \nworked for W.R. Grace for 3\\1/2\\ years until he was laid off. He was a \nskip operator. He ran small cars that carried ore up and down the hills \nof Libby, MT. He has lived in Libby for 55 years and knows, as do his \nneighbors, that asbestos is everywhere in the area. It is in the \ngardens and yards of places at work, homes, playgrounds. It is \neverywhere.\n  Four years ago, Rick was diagnosed with asbestosis. He filed a \nlawsuit but was told, despite his illness, there was really nothing \nthat could be done. W.R. Grace has gone bankrupt. There is no one left \nto sue, no one left to compensate him for his illness. The current tort \nsystem has failed Rick Napier. Unless we pass this legislation for a \nnational, privately funded trust for compensation based on illness and \nnot on the solvency of the defendant company, we continue to fail Rick \nNapier and many others like him. Without it, we leave Rick Napier and \nthe rest of the victims in Libby, MT, with no resource, no relief, and \nno hope.\n  What is wrong with asbestos litigation? Compensation for victims like \nRick Napier under the current tort system is not always available if \nthe company he could sue to receive some compensation is bankrupt. \nUnder the FAIR Act, he would get compensation even though he is no \nlonger with us. It is high time we put victims first.\n  I would be remiss not to mention the staggering toll the asbestos \nlitigation problem has also inflicted on our economy. As the number of \nclaims continues to rise, at least 70 companies to date have already \nbeen forced into bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the number of companies pulled \ninto the web of this abusive litigation is on the rise, many of which \nhave little, if any, culpability. These business bankruptcies translate \ndirectly into lost jobs, lost pensions, and weaker financial markets. \nIt is a detriment to our country.\n  According to a letter from the nonpartisan Academy of Actuaries:\n\n     . . . bankruptcies of corporate asbestos defendants have \n     affected 47 states, resulting in the loss of 52,000-60,000 \n     jobs, with each displaced worker losing $25,000-$50,000 in \n     wages and 25% of their 401(k).\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter from the American Academy of \nActuaries be printed in the Record.\n\n                                American Academy of Actuaries,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2004.\n     Re asbestos.\n\n     Senator Bill Frist,\n     Marjority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The Mass Torts Subcommittee of the \n     American Academy of Actuaries published a monograph, \n     ``Overview of Asbestos Issues and Trends'' in December 2001. \n     The Academy monograph is currently being updated. Meanwhile, \n     as S. 1125 nears debate on the Senate floor, I am pleased to \n     provide this letter, which provides a brief summary of some \n     of the key points regarding asbestos litigation.\n       The asbestos problem, initially recognized decades ago, is \n     not going away.\n       Exposure to asbestos has been linked to malignant diseases \n     including mesothelioma, lung and other cancers, as well as \n     nonmalignant conditions such as asbestosis and pleural \n     injuries.\n       Asbestos use was widespread in the United States for \n     decades, and although exposure levels have declined \n     significantly since OSHA requirements were implemented, \n     asbestos use is still legal in the United States today.\n       The number of claimants filing lawsuits annually has \n     increased dramatically in recent years and shows no signs of \n     a return to prior levels experienced during the 1990s. Most \n     of the increase in claim filings relate to individuals who \n     are not functionally impaired.\n       Approximately 730,000 claims were filed through 2002 and \n     estimates of the ultimate number of claimants range from 1 \n     million to 3 million.\n       Many believe that some current claimants are not being \n     compensated fairly or promptly. Additionally, there are \n     widespread concerns that funds will not be available to \n     compensate future claimants.\n       The size of recent awards made to settle claims has also \n     increased. In turn, contributions paid by individual \n     corporate defendants and their insurers/reinsurers have \n     increased. Additionally, demands against solvent defendants \n     have reflected upward pressure to cover amounts that are no \n     longer funded by defendants that have sought protection from \n     asbestos litigation through Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions.\n       At least 70 companies have sought bankruptcy protection due \n     to asbestos litigation\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\n     to date. Further, recent bankruptcy filings (i.e., pre-\n     packaged petitions) have exacerbated inequities in the \n     asbestos litigation system.\n       The number of corporations named as defendants in the \n     litigation has grown dramatically. Asbestos claimants \n     typically name 60 to 70 defendants in each lawsuit. While \n     approximately 300 companies were sued in the 1980s, RAND \n     estimates that approximately 8,400 companies had been sued as \n     of 2002. The potential culpability of this expanded list of \n     defendants is significantly different from the initial group \n     of companies that mined or manufactured asbestos products, \n     knew of it dangers, and failed to protect and/or warn their \n     workers.\n       Direct costs are significant--estimates of ultimate costs \n     relating to U.S. exposure to asbestos range from $200 billion \n     to $265 billion. More than half of the costs relate to \n     plaintiff and defense attorney fees.\n       Indirect costs are also large: Bankruptcies of corporate \n     asbestos defendants have affected 47 states, resulting in the \n     loss of 52,000-60,000 jobs, with each displaced worker losing \n     $25,000-$50,000 in wages and 25% of the value of their \n     401(k); For every 10 jobs lost in an asbestos-related \n     bankruptcy, an additional 8 jobs are lost in the surrounding \n     community; and Failure to enact legislative reform could \n     reduce economic growth by $2.4 billion per year and cost \n     30,770 jobs annually.\n       The U.S. Supreme Court has twice overturned efforts to \n     resolve the litigation through class action settlements \n     (Georgine and Fibreboard) and has called upon Congress to \n     address the situation.\n       Various reform measures have been enacted or are being \n     considered at the state level, such as: Imposing medical \n     criteria to bring a claim; Creating inactive docket systems \n     to preserve the rights of individuals who are not currently \n     impaired; and Addressing consolidation, joint and several \n     liability, and venue issues.\n       However, it is difficult to implement meaningful changes on \n     a state-by-state basis, and as long as some states are \n     perceived as plaintiff friendly jurisdictions and claims \n     remain portable, forum shopping will be a problem.\n       Several asbestos-related bills were introduced in the 108th \n     Congress, and the issue of federal reform to the asbestos \n     litigation crisis deserves careful attention. Thank you very \n     much for your consideration of the information presented \n     herein. Please do not hesitate to contact Greg Vass, the \n     Academy's Senior Casualty Policy Analyst, at (202) 223-8196 \n     if you have any questions or would like additional details.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    Jennifer L. Biggs, FCAS, MAAA,\n                             Chairperson, Mass Torts Subcommittee.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The Rand Institute estimates this litigation eventually \nwill result in 430,000 lost jobs. These are pretty good jobs. In fact, \nvery good jobs. It is because of the very serious problems that I stand \nhere today to express my steadfast support for the legislation we are \non the verge of considering, if our friends on the other side will \nallow us to consider.\n  We will make a motion to proceed, and hopefully they will not block a \nmotion to proceed because we ought to debate, we ought to look at \namendments, we ought to do what has to be done. We ought to perfect \nthis bill if we can. It is about as perfect as I think we can get it \nunder the process so far. It is a darn good bill and would certainly do \na lot of good for people.\n  I turn for a moment to the comparison of the current tort system and \nthe FAIR Act. This is why we should pass the FAIR Act. Under the \ncurrent tort system, even the Supreme Court Justices have described it \nas jackpot justice; under the FAIR Act we have certainty.\n  Under the tort system, we have a litigation lottery really, in real \nterms. Under the FAIR Act, it is a no-fault system. You do not even \nneed attorneys to recover. Under the tort system, you have ``magic'' \njurisdictions; in other words, jurisdictions where you can go where the \njudges are corrupt and the juries do not care how much they award the \npeople who don't deserve it. In other words, there are special \njurisdictions in this country where that happens.\n  Under the FAIR Act, you have a system of fairness. Under the tort \nsystem, we are pushing companies into bankruptcy. Mr. President, 8,400 \ncompanies have been sued, with over 300,000 claims, as I have \nmentioned. Many of those companies are going to have to go into \nbankruptcy if we do not solve this problem, which even the Supreme \nCourt has asked us to do. Under the FAIR Act, these companies would \nremain solvent.\n  Under the current tort system, we have decades of delays, as I have \nmentioned. Under the FAIR Act, we would have expedited payments in a \nnumber of months.\n  It is hard to imagine that anyone cannot see the benefits of the FAIR \nAct over the current system. I understand why the personal injury \nlawyers who are handling these asbestos cases do not want this to \nhappen. Of course, they are going to make upwards of $60 billion, right \nout of the pockets of the people who deserve those moneys, where we \ngive them to the people who are injured.\n  Let me talk about the particulars of what the bill does. S. 2290 \nwould provide fair and timely compensation to asbestos victims and \ncertainty to American workers, retirees, shareholders, and, of course, \nour whole U.S. economy. Hardly anything would do more for our economy \nthan the FAIR Act right now. It would establish a privately funded, no-\nfault, national asbestos victims compensation fund to replace the \nbroken tort system and ensure that individuals who are truly sick \nreceive compensation quickly, fairly, and efficiently.\n  The legislation retains the bipartisan agreement on medical criteria \nthat was approved by a unanimous vote in the Judiciary Committee. These \ncriteria form the basis of a no-fault victims compensation fund that \nwill stop the flow of resources to the unimpaired and ensure that the \ntruly ill will be paid quickly and fairly. S. 2290 also contains \nimprovements made to its predecessor, S. 1125, that have been developed \nover the last several months during extensive negotiations by the \nstakeholders.\n  S. 2290 includes a number of new provisions that ensure the fund will \nbe set up, processing and paying claims quickly. First, it places the \noffice within the Department of Labor in order to utilize its existing \ninfrastructure and experienced personnel to facilitate a faster \nstartup. In order to allow the office to begin accepting and processing \nclaims in short order, the legislation requires the enactment of \ninterim regulations and procedures within 90 days after the date of \nenactment, including the expedited processing of exigent claims.\n  To avoid potential delays associated with the appointment process, \nthe legislation grants interim authority to an existing Assistant \nSecretary of the Department of Labor until the new Administrator is \nappointed. To ensure that adequate initial funding will be available to \nmeet demand, the bill provides for up-front funding from fund \nparticipants, as well as increased borrowing authority. These new \nprovisions address concerns that claimants must have speedy access to \nthe fund while halting the admittedly broken tort system that continues \nto divert scarce resources away from the sick to the unimpaired.\n\n  S. 2290 also includes revised funding provisions. It establishes a \nfund that can pay $114 billion in claims, with an additional $10 \nbillion in contingent funding available from defendant companies--these \n8,400 companies. Money required to go to the fund from defendants and \ninsurers is assured over a period of 27 years.\n  Defendant participants, for example, guarantee their funding \nobligations through a grant of authority to the Administrator to impose \na surcharge in any year where moneys received fall short of the annual \nrequirements. In addition, S. 2290 provides up to $300 million annually \nin hardship and inequity adjustments that may be granted by the \nAdministrator among defendant participants. Money from insurers is \nfront-loaded for the early years of the fund where the most stress on \nthe system is anticipated.\n  Enforcement provisions have been strengthened to help the \nAdministrator go after recalcitrant participants. Additional safeguards \nto insure the funding have also been added, such as establishing a \npriority for payment obligations to the fund in State insurance \nreceivership proceedings.\n  Based on the funding now available under S. 2290, increased \ncompensation will go to claimants. Claims values have been increased in \nseveral disease categories over the levels approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. We have even gone \nbeyond those claims values. Furthermore, S. 2290 now provides \nreimbursement for out-of-pocket costs of physical examinations by \nclaimants' physicians, as well as costs for x rays and pulmonary \nfunction testing for level I claimants.\n  Let me talk about the bill.\n  Unfortunately, some Members on the other side of the aisle want to \nblock us\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\nfrom proceeding to the bill--even proceeding to the bill. Even on a \nmotion to proceed, we have heard there may be a filibuster. Well, I am \nnot surprised by these obstructive tactics. We have been getting used \nto them over the last 3\\1/2\\ years. I find it truly regrettable, given \nthe tremendous importance of this legislation to our country.\n  I find this type of obstruction particularly troubling because \nwithout the FAIR Act more and more Americans are certain to lose their \njobs. Anyone who is serious about preserving jobs should be actively \nhelping us move forward to the consideration of this bill. I have heard \na lot of mouthing off by Presidential contenders in this matter, that \njobs are the most important issue. Where are they when it comes to \nvoting for jobs that this bill would provide and for the preservation \nof jobs that this bill would provide?\n  Anyone who is serious about preserving jobs should be actively \nhelping us on this bill. They should not be standing in its way. But \nthe personal injury lawyers are a powerful force, and some on the other \nside of the aisle are willing to hear the voice of the personal injury \nbar over hard-working Americans who want to keep their jobs and \npensions.\n  I might mention that a lot of trial lawyers are very unnerved by \nthis. They see the injustices going on here and they themselves decry \nit. It is a small percentage of the American Trial Lawyers Association \nwho are doing this. Many other top-notch trial lawyers are very \nconcerned.\n\n  Now, to legitimize the obstructive tactics of these lawyers and the \nother opponents, opponents of this bill argue the legislation is \ncompletely different from the one we reported from the committee last \nyear. This argument particularly lacks merit because the bill retains \nthe core features of the legislation that was introduced as S. 1125 and \nsubsequently marked up in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Again, we have taken steps to ensure the solvency of the fund. As I \nmentioned, we replaced some contingent funding by calling for more up-\nfront funding, extended borrowing authority and guarantees for funding, \namong other added funding safeguards--all of which are additional \nstrengths to the bill that we passed out of the committee.\n  The fact is, this bill we are about to bring up continues to create a \nfair and efficient alternative compensation system to resolve the \nclaims for injury caused by asbestos exposure. The fund is still \ncapitalized through private contributions from defendants and insurers, \nand compensates victims under the very same medical criteria that we \nreached on a bipartisan basis last year. The bill still brings \nuniformity and rationality to a broken system so that resources are \nmore effectively directed towards those who are truly sick.\n  Indeed, this bill still preserves no less than 53 compromise measures \ndemanded by Democrats last year when this bill moved through \ncommittee--53 changes we made in the bill that we thought was pretty \ngood to begin with, all to accommodate our friends on the other side. \nIn fact, it adds many more provisions requested by Democrats and labor \nunions. And while this bill contains certain modifications from earlier \nversions, the modifications represent dramatic improvements to \ncontroversial measures that all interested parties had ample \nopportunity to discuss and work out after S. 1125 was reported from the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  While the Judiciary Committee reported S. 1125 favorably from the \ncommittee on a near party-line vote, the markup produced some measures \nthat required retooling. These measures jeopardized any meaningful \nchances of getting the bill passed into law. If not for the tireless \nefforts of our distinguished majority leader and Senator Specter, this \nbill would have achieved what its opponents have yearned for all \nalong--a dead bill.\n  But through the stewardship of Senator Specter and Chief Judge \nEmeritus of the Third Circuit, Edward R. Becker, we were able to \nprovide a forum through which the major stakeholders provided \ninvaluable expertise and solutions with respect to the remaining \ncontroversial issues left on the legislation, such as fund reversion, \nstartup, and administrative process.\n  This group, which included representatives from labor unions and \nindustry, among others, met dozens of times in the last 8 months. Our \nstaff was there throughout working with them. This process proved to be \nnot only insightful but also very helpful in resolving many of the key \ndifferences in this legislation. Through the leadership of Senator \nFrist, we were able to get the insurers and the defendants to agree on \nan even more equitable funding allocation and, among other things, \nprovide for more flexible borrowing authority and front-loaded funding \nto address the anticipated flood of claims that would come through the \nfund during its early years, something we would have liked to have done \nbefore but which we have done now.\n  Opponents of this bill have also justified their obstructive tactics \nby passing misinformation about this bill. First, some Members on the \nother side of the aisle have stated repeatedly that bill does not \nprovide enough money. I find these statements to be misleading and a \nstark contrast to several studies of future asbestos-related costs \nunder the current system. For example, one study shows the highest \nreasonable estimate of prospective costs, the Milliman study, would \nresult in approximately $92 billion for victims after attorney's fees \nand expenses.\n  In yet another study, commissioned by Tillinghast-Towers & Perrin, \nfuture amounts to compensate victims are estimated at $61 billion after \nattorney's fees and expenses.\n  As you can see from this chart, Asbestos Victims Compensation, this \nis in billions. Under the current tort system, the dark blue, $41 \nbillion--let's take the Tillinghast figure, the top circle on that \nside--will go to trial lawyers for fees. Twenty-eight billion will go \nto defendant lawyers for defending these cases. Better than half the \nmoney is going to go to lawyers. Those are the Tillinghast estimates, \nwhich I believe are quite accurate. Only $61 billion will go to \npotential future plaintiff compensation or to those who are really sick \nand some who aren't sick.\n  Let's take the bottom, the Milliman study, $61 billion will go to the \nattorneys, the personal injury lawyers; $42 billion would go to the \ndefense lawyers, defending these companies and insurance companies, \nalthough there are very few insurance companies involved; $92 billion \nwould go to the victims.\n  Under the FAIR Act, only $2.5 billion would go to the trial lawyers, \nand the full $111.5 billion would go to the victims. I don't see how \nanybody could argue against that. I might add, on top of that would be \nanother $10 billion in contingencies, if the $111.5 billion or the \ntotal of the $114 billion does not solve the problem.\n  These other two say it would solve the problem, that lesser amounts--\nand these are estimates by top-flight actuarial firms--that it would \nsolve the problem with lesser amounts than what we are willing to put \nin the trust fund. Under the FAIR Act it is estimated claimants will \nreceive 95 percent or more of the total funds under the no-fault \nnonadversarial system this bill amounts to. This means the FAIR Act \nfund, which would be able to pay more than $120 billion in awards, will \nallow claimants to take home well over $100 billion. This is more total \nmoney than they are projected to receive under the current tort system.\n  But it is not just more money in the pockets of victims. It is faster \nand more compensation as well. The difference is, the personal injury \nlawyers won't get as much money out of it, but there is still $2.5 \nbillion there for them for cases that are like rolling off a log. We \nanticipate the claimants will not have to endure years of discovery \nbattles between the defense and plaintiffs' lawyers and endless \nlitigation before they get paid. As I have shown in one case, 17 years \nold; others are up to 20 years old and still no compensation for the \nvictims who have died long since and the families have suffered all \nthose years.\n\n  Currently, whether some victims get paid depends on the solvency of \nthe business. But under the FAIR Act, these victims will no longer have \nto go without payment. These are the ones where their companies were \ninsolvent.\n  It is time to end the current system of jackpot justice where only \nsome win and many lose. The some who win in many cases don't deserve to \nwin because these personal injury lawyers go into renegade areas where \nthey know the judges are either corrupt or totally in their pocket and \nthey know there\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\nare runaway juries. That is how everybody loses except for those who \nare not sick or getting these huge multimillion dollar awards out of \nthese unfair jurisdictions.\n  Opponents of this bill have also argued there are inadequate \nsafeguards to insure the solvency of the fund. My response to this is \nvery simple: Baloney. This fund, which is funded at the highest \nreasonable claim rate scenario, is equipped with many mechanisms to \nensure the pay-in and payout requirements are met. Once again, this \nincludes more flexible borrowing authority against future \ncontributions, front-loaded contributions from insurers, and \ncontingency funding of $10 billion additional to the $114 billion. To \nbe absolutely certain, this bill also includes guaranteed surcharge and \norphan-share reserve accounts which set aside money to grow and pay for \nunexpected shortfalls and empowers the Attorney General to enforce \ncontribution obligations. On top of all these safeguards, if the fund \nstill becomes insolvent, claims would revert back to the tort system, a \nprovision Democrats insisted be part of the bill as the ultimate \nprotection. It is not going to be needed, but it is in the bill, trying \nto accommodate, once more, demands on the other side.\n  Given that this bill is a clear net monetary gain for legitimate \nvictims and provides payments faster and with more certainty, I am at a \nloss to explain why anybody would object to this bill. The unions that \ncontinue to oppose the bill risk throwing away the last best chance to \ncompensate fairly those who are truly sick and provide some protection \nto those whose jobs and pensions are at risk because of the asbestos \nlitigation crisis, because their pensions are going to be lost as more \ncompanies go into bankruptcy, forced into it by the phony system we \ncurrently are undergoing.\n  Quite frankly, the only entity that stands to lose under this bill is \nthe handful--and it is a handful--of personal injury lawyers who have \nguzzled more than $20 billion of the costs incurred on this issue as of \nthe last year--$20 billion. No wonder they want this gravy train to \nkeep going. If the improved FAIR Act is passed, they will not be able \nto leverage unimpaired claims anymore to squeeze a projected $41 \nbillion more for themselves from remotely connected companies by \nrefusing a broken system. I am talking about the personal injuries \nlawyers. Defense lawyers who have to defend these cases are going to \npull a huge amount of money out, too, as these cases go on for 20 years \nor more. I am all in support of compensating attorneys for the value of \ntheir work--no question about that--but when the lawyers get rich while \ndiverting the valuable resources away from sick victims, something is \nwrong with the system.\n  You don't need me to tell you this. The Supreme Court thinks that is \nthe case. Think tanks and other nonpartisan commentators have been \nsaying that for years.\n  We have a serious problem on our hands that demands this body's full \nattention. I applaud our distinguished majority leader for his work in \nhelping us this far and in bringing this bill to the floor because the \ntime to act is now.\n  We have studied the asbestos problem at length for decades. We have \nheld numerous hearings, considered various legislative proposals, and \nwe even underwent several marathon markups in the Judiciary Committee \nlast June. Over the past year, we met with our Democratic counterparts \nto assuage their concerns about the bill.\n  We have provided a meaningful 8-month mediation forum through which \nthe major stakeholders could bridge different recommendations on issues \ncritical to the bill. We provided one of the finest Federal judges in \nthe country to preside over the negotiation. Judge Becker has done an \nexcellent job. To the extent we were able to reach consensus on issues, \nthe appropriate language is embodied in the bill before us. To the \nextent there are issues that remain unresolved, we ought to openly \ndebate them on the floor of the Senate.\n  The time has come to stop talking about doing something and to take \ndecisive action. Every day that passes is a day we withhold meaningful \nrecovery to truly sick victims. Every day that passes is a day in which \nhard-working Americans at companies that had little or nothing to do \nwith asbestos face decreased pensions and an uncertain employment \nfuture, with a real potential for loss of jobs. Every day that passes \nis a day we deny consideration of a comprehensive solution to one of \nthe most plaguing civil justice issues of our time.\n  Mr. President, I have heard that some on the other side have said the \none reason they really don't want to go ahead with the bill is not \nbecause they doubt its efficacy, or that it is right, or that they \ndoubt the words I have been saying today; the real reason behind it, \nsome have said, is that the personal injury lawyers are expected to put \nup at least $50 million or more for their Presidential candidate. It is \nnot hard to figure out where they are going to get the money. It is \ngoing to be right out of the hides of these asbestos victims, many of \nwhom have died. I hope that is not the case. I hope that is just a set \nof rumors, but it is coming up all too frequently.\n  Is that why we cannot even proceed to the bill? I have been here a \nlong time and very few motions to proceed have been filibustered, \nexcept for a delay of a day or 2, and even then we have had very few. \nWe have always been able to proceed to the bill.\n  I suspect the reason they are going to filibuster the motion to \nproceed is because it is a little more difficult to figure out by the \ngeneral public that you are not on the bill yet, so a motion to proceed \nis just a procedural gimmick or gibberish. No, it is serious stuff. If \nwe cannot proceed to the bill, we cannot get to the bill. Why would \nfolks on the other side not want to get to the bill and try to improve \nit if they have improvements they would like to put up for a vote? We \ncan vote on them. I am sure they will win on some of their \nimprovements--if they are improvements--or even some things they want \nthat are not improvements but might be deleterious to this bill.\n  Let's go to the bill and not continue this feckless filibustering of \neverything in the Senate, making a supermajority vote the absolute \npremise for everything they are doing. This is an important bill. We \nhave worked as hard as we can with everybody concerned with it, from \nthe trial lawyers, the personal injury lawyers, to the unions, \nbusinesses, insurance companies, to the victims. We have worked our \ntails off. There are some unions that support this bill. They realize \ntheir people will lose jobs and they will never get as much money. They \nrealize the attorneys are taking too much out of this process. They \nrealize it takes years and years to get just compensation--if that--to \nthe women and children who are left behind from the mesothelioma \nvictims. Most of those victims are already dead. Most of them work for \ncompanies that have already gone bankrupt. Their pensions are \ngone, their jobs are gone. Think about it.\n\n  In our medical criteria, we have provided hundreds of thousands of \ndollars for central categories of people who will never get \nmesothelioma, many of whom are not sick, many of whom have cancer but \nwere ardent smokers most of their lives, where 99-to-1 their cancer \ncame from smoking and not from exposure to asbestos. But in this bill, \nwe give them the benefit of the doubt. Not only do those union members \nlose out on these moneys that will be very easy to obtain once they \nmeet certain minimum medical criteria that everybody agreed to--\nDemocrats and Republicans--but they will do it without huge attorney \nfees, and they will do it without knowing that their injuries came from \nasbestos exposure, when they probably did come from the excessive \nsmoking they did all their lives. But we have given them the benefit of \nthe doubt. They will do it without losing their pensions, their jobs. \nTheir families will be better off.\n  To some of my colleagues on the other side, there is never going to \nbe enough money, no matter what you do. But there are limits to what \nthese companies can pay without going into bankruptcy. Like I said, 70 \nhave already gone into bankruptcy and there will be many more if they \ndon't resolve these problems. This bill will resolve them. It does it \nin a reasonable, decent, honorable way, and still provides $2.5 billion \nfor lawyer fees. That is a lot of money for a no-fault system, even \nthough those who have been raking in the billions of dollars--the very \nfew\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\nlawyers--are giving other trial lawyers a bad image and are ripping off \nthe system.\n  Having said that, there are trial lawyers in this country who deserve \nour respect, who are honest, who do not buy off judges, who do not \nabuse the system, who do not forum shop into these jurisdictions that \nyou know are going to violate the basic strictures of society, giving \nhuge verdicts to those who don't even deserve anything. These trial \nlawyers are people who basically help keep society straight. Many of \nthem were people who basically sued the companies that were most \nresponsible for these problems.\n  But now we are coming down to a lot of personal injury lawyers who \nreally should be ashamed of themselves. You have seen the ads in the \nnewspapers and so forth. They are as trumped up as anything I have ever \nseen, and they are even on television. Nobody should exploit the \nsuffering of others, including ourselves. We are trying to do our very \nbest to make sure everybody who truly suffered gets just compensation \nunder the circumstances. That is what this bill will do. We have worked \nhard to get it here and it is time that we pass it.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side don't filibuster the motion to \nproceed. That should not be done on something this important.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4083-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4083-S4084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GAS PRICES\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, like you, I was home over the last few days \nand very much enjoyed being with you, and I particularly enjoyed the \nhonor we received from the Classroom Law Project. It has been a \ntremendous privilege to be able to team up with you on those kinds of \ninitiatives.\n  I want to discuss one of the issues about which I heard a great deal \nand I am sure you did as well when we were home. Gas prices in Oregon \nhave now hit an all-time high. Over this past weekend, folks in Eugene \nand Medford in particular were paying more than $2 a gallon. Of course \nin our State this works a tremendous economic hardship. Folks have to \ndrive long distances in many communities, and particularly for small \nbusinesses it is of tremendous economic concern at this time.\n  In light of what I saw last night on the news program ``60 Minutes,'' \nI want to talk for a few moments about a resolution I have introduced \nrecently calling on President Bush to put some real heat on the Saudis \nand OPEC to increase oil production in order to help the kind of people \nI saw over this last week in Oregon who are getting mugged at the gas \npump.\n  When I introduced this resolution recently, to put some real \npressure, a full-court press on OPEC to increase oil production, I \nwrote a resolution that mirrored what a number of our colleagues \noffered during the years when Bill Clinton was President.\n  There was an objection to the Senate considering my resolution to \nstart putting some pressure on OPEC and the Saudis to increase \nproduction. It seems to me given what a lot of us saw on ``60 Minutes'' \nlast night, I hope some of our colleagues and friends on the other side \nof the aisle would now reconsider my resolution and reconsider their \nobjection to it.\n  In an interview last night on the CBS news magazine, the Washington \nPost's Bob Woodward talked about the substance of a reported \nconversation between our President and Saudi Arabia's Ambassador to the \nUnited States, Prince Bandar. Reading a portion of Mr. Woodward's new \nbook, correspondent Mike Wallace said last night, ``Bandar wanted Bush \nto know that the Saudis hoped to fine-tune oil prices to prime the \neconomy 2004. What was key, Bandar understood, were the economic \nconditions before a Presidential election.''\n  I want to start my discussion this afternoon with the question, \nShould the United States allow a foreign power to decide our Nation's \nenergy security? Certainly this is a troubling question.\n  It seems to me the pieces of the gas price puzzle are beginning to \ncome together. I will tell you that I believe it forms a very troubling \npicture.\n  On March 31, the New York Times reported a senior official in an OPEC \ncountry as having said the United States is placing ``very little'' \npressure on the oil cartel to increase gas prices. The Saudi official \ncontinued by saying of OPEC's discussions with the United States, \n``We're telling them, keep your mouth shut.''\n  Days later, OPEC moved to ratify a 1-million-barrel-per-day \nproduction cut that would further drive up gasoline prices in our \ncountry. The Reuters news service then reported the Saudi Foreign \nMinister was asked whether the United States had expressed any \ndisappointment over OPEC's production cut. The Saudi Foreign Minister \nsaid, ``I didn't hear from this Bush administration. I'm hearing it \nfrom you that they are disappointed.''\n  Last night on ``60 Minutes,'' Bob Woodward told us the Saudi \nAmbassador indicated to the President that ``certainly over the summer, \nor as we get closer to the election, they could increase production \nseveral million barrels a day and the price would drop significantly.''\n  I can understand why the Saudis would want to cut production right \nbefore the heavy summer driving season, the period that is coming upon \nus. The Saudis want to boost their profits. I have always said OPEC is \ngoing to stand up for OPEC. Anybody who thinks OPEC stands up for the \nAmerican consumer thinks Colonel Sanders stands up for chickens.\n  I understand the Saudis and that country are going to be interested \nin everything that will boost their profits. I can understand why any \nPresident would want gas prices to be low with an election coming fast. \nBut what about what the American families want?\n  We know what the Saudis want. We know about the climate before a \nPresidential election. While the Saudis count the profits and the \nPresident counts on the word of the Saudis, American consumers are \ncounting out more and more of their hard-earned dollars just to fill up \nat the gas pump.\n  When the market opened this morning, U.S. crude oil futures were \n$37.74 a barrel, which is about $8.50--or about 30 percent--higher than \na year ago.\n  As I noted over this last weekend, Oregon families were paying an \nall-time high for gasoline. A number of our communities have seen \nprices of over $2 a gallon.\n  With gas prices through the roof, the administration should have \npressured OPEC ahead of the cartel's planned reduction cut, and the \nPresident should have used his relationship with the Saudis to bring \nrelief to American consumers.\n  Let me repeat that. You have the prices soaring through the roof. You \nhave the administration with an opportunity ahead of time to put \npressure on OPEC ahead of their planned production cut. Certainly the \nPresident has had the kind of relationship with the Saudis that would \nensure they listen seriously, and yet we saw this morning's report \nindicating the White House had different priorities when it came to \ngasoline prices, OPEC, and the Saudis.\n  My view is there just isn't any substitute for leadership when our \nfamilies are hurting financially. Unfortunately, we haven't seen it in \nrecent days.\n  I call on the Senate once again to send a clear message that the \nAmerican people come first. The President ought to be using his \nrelationship with the Saudis to help reduce gasoline prices now--not at \na time of his choosing or the Saudis' choosing. It ought to be at a \ntime when it best meets the needs of our consumers, and that is right \nnow.\n  I ask the Senate to once again consider my simple resolution. It \nparallels the one that was authored by our friends and colleagues now \nin the Cabinet, Senator Abraham and Senator Ashcroft, who were then \nserving in this distinguished body. The resolution I authored mirrors \ntheirs to bring pressure to bear on OPEC and the Saudis to increase \nproduction. The Senate ought to be able to act at least as quickly on \nmy resolution as it did on the one that passed in 2000. That was good \nenough\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\nfor President Clinton, and it ought to be good enough for this \nPresident.\n  As I noted, we have had a number of our former colleagues in support \nof it. The previous resolution was introduced on February 28, 2000, and \nwas passed on March 27. I am very hopeful with crude oil prices at a \n13-year record high the Senate will now apply the same principle in \nthis administration that was applied in the Clinton administration. We \nought to say on a bipartisan basis that every American President ought \nto have a full-court press in place in order to stand up for the \nconsumer, to stand up to OPEC, and to speak up for our families who are \ngetting clobbered at the gas pumps.\n  In conclusion, this morning I noted the White House had no comment on \nthe Saudi promise to cut oil prices. They said, Well, you can ask \nPrince Bandar, and essentially said they weren't going to get involved.\n  I will say based on what I heard this weekend that standing on the \nsidelines isn't good enough. This is an area that the Senate ought to \ncome together on in a bipartisan basis, the way it did in 2000. It is a \nkey part of I think a comprehensive strategy to hold down gasoline \nprices.\n  I have been trying to get the Federal Trade Commission off the \nsidelines. Certainly a lot of these refinery shutdowns smell because \nthey look more to be boosting profits than boosting competition. But \ntoday I come to the floor of the Senate, given that very troubling \nreport last night on ``60 Minutes'' and say I think there needs to be a \nfull-court press and a comprehensive push on OPEC in order to lower \ngasoline prices.\n  We have seen this troubling issue raised in the last 24 hours which \nmakes me feel the question of how much pressure is being put on OPEC \nand when it is being put doesn't seem to be done in a way that is going \nto best get relief to the American consumer. The American consumer \ndeserves to have a White House that is pushing now and pushing hard to \nget relief for the consumer at the gas pumps.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will reconsider \ntheir objection to my resolution to urge OPEC to increase production \nand increase it quickly so it can be passed by this body on a \nbipartisan basis as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4084-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4084-S4087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ASBESTOS LITIGATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, shortly, we hope to be taking up S. \n2290, the asbestos bill. I have come to the Senate this afternoon to \ntalk a little bit about the legislation. It is a good bill. It is a \nbill that, quite frankly, needs to be passed. I believe our civil \njustice system generally works very well. Like many of my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle, I think our State and Federal courts are a \nvital part of our entire system of government. Our court system ensures \na level of fairness and justice for our citizens that is second to none \nin the entire world.\n  Our civil justice system works well when we let juries decide \ndisputes between two individuals or a limited number of parties. It \nusually works well in class action cases with large numbers of \nindividuals with similar injuries caused by one or a handful of \ndefendants. But we all have to admit our justice system is not perfect. \nIt doesn't always work.\n  We all know our justice system has failed to deal with the asbestos \ncrisis. I use the term ``crisis'' because that is exactly what it is. \nThe system is not adequately protecting the rights of victims nor \ndefendants. As things stand now, some victims are successful in getting \njury verdicts that compensate them fairly. But many victims have no one \nto sue and receive perhaps 5 percent or 10 percent of the total value \nof their claims from asbestos bankruptcy trusts. That is not right. It \nis not fair.\n  On the other extreme, some victims receive huge awards or settlements \nthat are way out of proportion to their injuries. The bottom line is, \nmore and more victims face a risk of never being compensated for \nasbestos-related illnesses at all, ever.\n  It is our responsibility in the Senate to deal with this crisis. We \nmust not wait any longer to act. I would like to take a moment to talk \nabout why we have this asbestos crisis and why the courts are ill \nequipped to deal with it.\n  First, the sheer volume of claims is staggering. So far through the \nyear 2002--the last figures we have--730,000 individuals have made \nclaims for asbestos exposure, and the most recent Rand study estimates \nthat anywhere between 1 million and 3 million total individuals could \nmake claims in the future.\n  The second factor is the unusual nature of the illnesses caused by \nexposure to asbestos. As witnesses before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee testified, there is a long latency period between exposure to \nasbestos and the actual illness or impairment. People are exposed to \nasbestos for long periods of time and then don't show symptoms of \nillness for 25 or sometimes even 30 years. Not everyone exposed to \nasbestos ever gets sick, thank heavens. Yet our tort system requires a \npotential victim to file his or her claim for injury within a year or \ntwo from discovering the potential harm. What this means is the vast \nmajority of people who are filing claims don't have any actual symptoms \nat that time, and many may not ever even get sick. Still they have to \nsue to protect their rights.\n  Third, many of those who are exposed to asbestos feel compelled to \nsue immediately because the number of financially sound potential \ndefendants is rapidly diminishing. Someone who has been exposed to \nasbestos, even if he or she has no symptoms, may decide to sue now or \ntake the risk that nobody will be left to pay a claim down the road.\n\n  Clearly, this system isn't meeting the needs of victims, and it also \nis causing tremendous problems for the business community. Candidly, \nasbestos liability is bankrupting many potential defendants as claims \nare now being brought against businesses that have a very remote \nconnection to the manufacture of asbestos. So the impact of asbestos \nclaims is overwhelming, not just to some of our Nation's largest \ncompanies but to our small businesses as well.\n  As a consequence, tens of thousands of workers, people employed by \nthese businesses, are, in fact, being affected. Thousands and thousands \nand thousands of people are being affected. Employees and their \nfamilies who never had any exposure to asbestos are, in fact, feeling \nthe effects in lost wages, and for many of them lost jobs.\n  The impact in my State of Ohio is particularly severe. From 1998 to \nthe year 2000, Ohio was one of the top five States in which asbestos \nlitigants chose to file their suits. This is partly because Ohio is the \nhome of many businesses that at one time or another used asbestos in \nproducts. It is also likely the result of a litigation strategy in \nwhich attorneys look for a court that has a history of allowing overly \ngenerous verdicts for claimants. This is known, of course, as forum \nshopping. But either way, literally thousands of companies have been \nnamed as defendants in our Ohio courts.\n  Out of 8,400 firms that have been named as defendants nationwide, \nover 7,000 have been named in cases filed in Ohio. Of the 66 or so \ncompanies that filed bankruptcy because of asbestos-related liability, \nmore than 20 of these companies are headquartered or have significant \nfacilities in Ohio.\n  Perhaps most important is the impact this has on jobs. More than \n200,000 people worked for those bankrupt companies. Not every job was \nlost, but many were because of the bankruptcy and many employees were \naffected in other ways. It is simply devastating for an employee whose \nemployer goes bankrupt--wages are cut, promotions are scaled back, and \npension funds can be completely wiped out. Of course, many of these \n200,000 employees are in Ohio.\n  Let me be clear--I believe that companies should be held accountable \nfor their conduct. I am concerned, however, about the many companies \nthat now find themselves held responsible for the actions of other \ncompanies. These companies employ thousands of\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\npeople and contribute to our economy and tax base. No one, including \nthe victims of asbestos, is served by the closure or dramatic \nreorganization of these companies. With both victims and employers at \nrisk, we have no choice but to enact a legislative remedy to address \nthis problem. We need to do something that protects the rights of those \nharmed by exposure to asbestos and allows businesses at least to \npredict how much this crisis will cost. ``Predictability'' is the key \nword for business. The FAIR Act provides that protection and \npredictability--protection for the victims and predictability for \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I will respond to an ad campaign that paints the FAIR \nAct as nothing but a bailout for big companies that manufactured \nasbestos products. The ad includes some outrageous and indefensible \nquotes from asbestos company executives, and implies that Congress \nwants to bailout the companies that were the source of these quotes.\n  I want to try to set the record straight. But first, I want to say \nthat I would not, under any circumstances, vote to bailout any company \nthat intentionally harmed its employees. However, this bill is not \nabout releasing big asbestos companies from liability simply because \nthere are virtually no companies left that manufactured asbestos.\n  With one notable exception, they all went bankrupt. I'll talk about \nthe exception in a moment, but let me tall you what the essential facts \nare with regard to asbestos manufacturing companies. Johns-Manville \nwent bankrupt in 1982; 48 Insulations went bankrupt in 1985; Raymark \nwent bankrupt in 1989; Celoteax went bankrupt in 1990; Eagle Picher \nwent bankrupt in 1991; Armstrong World Industries went bankrupt in \n2000; Babcock & Wilcox went bankrupt in 2000; Federal Mogul went \nbankrupt in 2001; Owens-Corning went bankrupt in 2000; U.S. Gypsum went \nbankrupt in 2001; and W.R. Grace went bankrupt in 2001.\n  Some of these companies had a lot to answer for with regard to the \nasbestos exposure; others manufactured asbestos products before the \ndangers were known. We don't need to judge their culpability, however. \nThey no longer exist as companies that must account for their conduct \nwith regard to asbestos. And, most importantly, this bill has little \neffect on these companies. It is clearly not a ``bailout.'' Here's why.\n  In an asbestos liability bankruptcy, a majority of the assets of the \ncompany are put into a trust fund to compensate asbestos claimants. I \nwant to note here that traditional creditors, such as banks, suppliers, \nand stockholders are the minority creditors and often get mostly shut \nout of recovery all together.\n  Please keep in mind that a company's stockholders often include the \ncompany's pension fund. This bankruptcy process eliminates all of a \ncompany's asbestos liability. If there is a ``bail out'' here, it is in \nthe current bankruptcy code.\n  The Johns-Manville Company is a perfect example of an asbestos \nmanufacturing company gone bankrupt. For years, Manville produced a \nwhole range of products containing asbestos and had as much as one half \nthe market share for manufactured asbestos products. They were the \nsubject of intense asbestos litigation and filed for bankruptcy in \n1982. All the assets of Johns-Manville were sold years ago and the \nproceeds are in the Manville Trust. Johns-Manville as it existed pre-\nbankruptcy is long gone. The Manville Trust exists solely to compensate \nvictims of asbestos exposure.\n  In the real world, as it exists today, Johns-Manville's asbestos \nliability is limited to the assets which are held by the Manville \nTrust. Johns-Manville will never have to pay another dime for asbestos \nexposure, over what is currently in the trust. Under our bill, all the \nmoney in the Manville trust will be rolled into the national trust. \nManville will not get a dime back; they will not save a single dime. \nAnd, they are not relieved from a single cent of their existing \nliability. This is true for all the asbestos manufacturing companies, \nwhich have gone bankrupt.\n  My point is that the suggestion that this bill bails out big asbestos \nmanufacturing companies is almost silly--there are virtually no \n``asbestos'' companies left to bail out.\n  And, I should note, the Manville Trust is currently paying claimants \n5 cents on the dollar. So, the future victims of asbestos exposure \nwhose only recourse will be against the Manville Trust do stand to \nbenefit greatly by this bill. The truly sick individuals who only have \nclaims against Manville will receive significantly more compensation \nunder the national trust than they would from Manville.\n  Now, I mentioned an exception a minute ago. There is one company that \ncould be considered an asbestos manufacturing company. The company is a \nlarge and diversified manufacturer. But, it had a small division that \nmade pipe that included asbestos up until 1958, when the pipe \nmanufacturing division was sold.\n  But, here is the key--to date, this company has paid more than $1.5 \nbillion towards its asbestos liability--liability that is largely \nexhausted because it has not manufactured an asbestos product for 45 \nyears. Nonetheless, under this bill, the company will pay hundreds of \nmillions of additional dollars into the trust fund. Is this bill a \n``bailout'' for this company? Clearly, it is not.\n  Mr. President, in addition to protecting the victims of asbestos \nexposure, at issue in this bill are small and mid-size businesses which \ndid not manufacture asbestos products. These are businesses that \nprovide needed jobs to Americans across the country--businesses that \nare being driven to bankruptcy themselves due to the remotest of \nconnections to asbestos.\n  These are bankruptcies that will cost thousands of Americans their \njobs and their pensions--bankruptcies that mean that fewer and fewer \nvictims will receive compensation in the civil justice system. This is \nwhy the legal system is broken and why we need the bill before us to \nhelp fix it.\n  Mr. President, I will talk about just one example from my State of \nOhio. In my State, there is a medium-sized company that employs over a \nthousand hardworking Ohioans. Before the dangers of asbestos were \nknown--when the industry standard was to use asbestos in a variety of \nproducts--this company sold a home repair product for do-it-\nyourselfers; the product was a drywall paste. This product was not used \nin big commercial applications. Professional contractors did not use \nthis product. It was sold in local hardware stores to average Americans \nwho wanted to do things such as patch nail holes in their own homes or \nmaybe finish the inside of a garage.\n\n  At its peak, this company had less than a 1-percent market share for \nthis product and made less than $500,000 total. As soon as the dangers \nof asbestos were known, this company immediately stopped production of \ntheir product.\n  I would like everyone to keep in mind that the majority of harm \ncaused by exposure to asbestos is a result of occupational exposure \nwhich is individuals who routinely work with asbestos products on the \njob over a long and continuous period of time. It was unlikely that \nanyone had any occupational exposure to the product made by this Ohio \ncompany.\n  Let's take these two important facts together. One, the product was \nnot sold for use in commercial settings. By definition, then, an \nindividual could not have been exposed to this product over time as \npart of his occupation and, two, a vast majority of asbestos-related \ndiseases were only caused by occupational exposure over long periods of \ntime. One would think this adds up to a pretty good defense in \nlitigation. One would think this company should not fear defending \nthemselves in court. One would think they would do OK in our civil \njustice system. Let me tell you what has happened over the last few \nyears to this company.\n  They have been named in over 4,000 lawsuits that include something \nlike 15,000 individual claimants. The company has actually won all of \nthe few cases it has tried. However, in most of these cases, they have \na number of codefendants ranging from 6 to 20 or sometimes 30 in a \nsingle case. Sometimes these codefendants settle early on. Sometimes \ncodefendants are bankrupt companies which were, in fact, bad actors \nwhen it came to asbestos.\n  As litigation proceeds, this Ohio company finds itself in an \nextremely difficult position over and over. It may be one of three or \nfour solvent defendants left in the case. Although it has a valid \ndefense, other defendants may not have a good defense.\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\n  The problem is, many States have something called joint and several \nliability. What that means is if a jury finds another defendant liable \nand grants a huge jury verdict and that liable defendant is bankrupt, \nour Ohio company is on the hook for the entire amount. So instead of \ntaking a chance, the company I am talking about in Ohio figures it is \nin their best interest to settle. They settle over and over again in \ncases in which they have a legitimate, significant defense.\n  In this example, this Ohio company has spent in excess of $175 \nmillion on asbestos litigation so far. They have a good defense. They \nhave won 100 percent of the cases they have taken to trial. Yet they \nhave spent $175 million on asbestos litigation.\n  The Senate is not a court. We are not in a position to judge \nliability or nonliability of every defendant. I am not asking my \ncolleagues to do this, but I can say this Ohio company seems to have an \nextremely good defense to liability, and a jury has said so several \ntimes. I doubt all manufacturers that have been named in lawsuits have \nsuch a good defense. So I want to make it clear that the last thing I \nwant is for a company that is legitimately liable for causing someone \nharm to get off free. There is really no chance of that under this \nbill, and I want to make that clear.\n  Under this bill, this Ohio company I described will be required to \npay $450 million into a trust fund for people who have health problems \ncaused by exposure to asbestos. That is $450 million in addition to \n$175 million already spent. That does not seem fair. It does not seem \nfair to them when they look at it. But this company and hundreds of \nothers like it are willing to go along with this solution even though \nto them it does not seem fair. It does not seem fair to them when they \nlook at it, but they are willing to do it because it is better than the \nstatus quo. It is better than the uncertainty they are facing today. It \nis going to be painful for the companies and their employees, but it is \nbetter than the uncertain future they face under the status quo today.\n\n  I have heard from several Ohio companies that, frankly, are not happy \nabout some of the provisions of this bill. If we can debate this bill \nin the Senate, I plan to work with Senator Hatch and others to make \nsome additional refinements to the bill. Still, I anticipate that many \nbusinesses will be concerned that we have gone too far and demand they \npay too much into the trust fund. But it is what must be done, I \nbelieve, to guarantee that American owned and operated companies have \nthe certainty and predictability they need in dealing with their \npotential asbestos liability. Hopefully, we will save companies from \nthe bankruptcies that cost jobs and pensions.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks. I see my colleague from \nTennessee is in the Chamber. I assure him I am wrapping up. I conclude \nmy remarks by talking for a couple more minutes about the process that \nhas led us to this point where we are actually debating whether to \nbring the asbestos reform bill to the Senate floor for debate.\n  I have been working on and supporting efforts to deal with the \nasbestos crisis for most of my time in the Senate. A little over a year \nago, my staff and I had numerous meetings to discuss the issue. I met \nwith a lot of folks from Ohio who told me stories that the impact of \nthe asbestos crisis had on them. These meetings were not only happening \nin my office, but were happening all over the Senate in Democratic and \nRepublican offices alike. My colleagues had similar experiences. They \nwere experiences with companies, but, frankly, they were also \nexperiences with victims.\n  We had a hearing in the Judiciary Committee in early March of 2003. \nThen I recall participating in a bipartisan asbestos summit which was \norganized by our friend and colleague, Senator Dodd. That occurred \nApril 1 of last year. A large number of Senators on both sides of the \naisle participated in that summit. Then for months, through the spring \nand summer, we all worked intensely, meeting and negotiating. A point \ncame when we decided the best approach to solving this problem was to \ncreate a privately funded trust which would be managed by the Federal \nGovernment to compensate victims.\n  This approach won out over the traditional-tort-reform-type approach \nthat had been discussed previously. Some of my colleagues were not \nhappy about that decision, and some outside businesses affected by \nasbestos were not happy about that decision either, but it was a \ncompromise reached with the input of a number of Republican and \nDemocratic Senators and with the input of industry and organized labor.\n  Our staff and outside groups representing organized labor, big and \nsmall manufacturers, and insurers met and worked for dozens of hours on \nthe structure of the fund, medical criteria, claims values, and \nfunding. They worked on nights and weekends. I recall when my staff \nreported to me about progress in an intense all-day session on a sunny \nSaturday in June, which included representatives from the AFL-CIO, the \nAsbestos Study Group, the Asbestos Alliance, the American Insurance \nAssociation, and staff from Senator Leahy's office, Senator Kennedy's \noffice, Senator Dodd's office, Senator Hatch's office, my office, and \nother offices as well.\n  I recall we had another meeting in the Judiciary Committee in early \nJune. I recall that we welcomed the attendance of other Senators who \nwere not on the Judiciary Committee at that hearing. I believe Senator \nDodd, Senator Carper, and Senator Murray attended some of the hearings. \nI know staff from many other Senate offices were there as well.\n  My only point is this was a group effort, where virtually every \nMember of the Senate it seems like at one time or another has been \ninvolved.\n  Negotiations continued behind the scenes. Every Senate office and \nevery party was not at every single meeting. That would not have been \nimpractical, if not impossible. Yet countless suggestions, and \nsuggestions from Senators and outside parties, were included in the \ndiscussions and negotiations. Then in June 2003, the Judiciary \nCommittee began marking up a draft bill which we formulated from the \nearlier discussions--and what a markup it was. It was an unbelievable \ntime. I think it took place during 4 full days over the course of \nseveral weeks. I think we adopted 35 bipartisan amendments, many of \nthem making significant changes to the bill.\n  It is safe to say not a single Senator on the committee was entirely \nhappy with the resulting bill we reported. While the final vote was not \noverwhelming, the process was bipartisan. Nobody got everything they \nwanted. In fact, we created a little bit of a mess. It is a large and \ncomplicated bill, and some of the amendments we adopted conflicted with \nothers. Some of the amendments we adopted sounded very reasonable, but \nfrankly did not withstand post-markup scrutiny. That is the way it \nworks sometimes in the Senate.\n  So the negotiations and redrafting started again, as often happens in \nlarge, complex bills. Again, many Senators from both sides of the aisle \nand outside parties submitted input into the process. Meetings took \nplace on at least two or three different tracks. Senator Frist's office \nled staff negotiations that included representatives for Senator \nDaschle, Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, Senator Specter, Senator Dodd, \nand others. Again everyone was not at every meeting. Many times more \nthan one meeting was going on. It was not practical to have everyone \nwho was interested in attendance at all times, but a range of political \nviews was represented at these meetings.\n  At the same time, Senator Specter convened a series of very important \nmeetings with the help of retired Circuit Judge Becker. These \ncomprehensive meetings involved stakeholders in the asbestos issue, \nmany of whom I have mentioned earlier. These meetings continued up \nuntil last week, as I understand it.\n  I have gone through this tedious history for one reason, to point out \nthis bill is not a result of a single Senator's partisan effort to \ncraft a biased asbestos reform bill. Anyone who thinks that just has \nnot followed the laborious history of this bill. That is not the fact. \nThat is not true. Thousands of hours have gone into creating this bill \nwith input from all directions in this Senate. It is easy to say now, \nwell, that was not or this was not put into the bill or that meeting \nwas not attended or I was excluded from that meeting, or hundreds of \nother allegations that the process for this bill was insufficient or\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\nmaybe not even fair. The fact is this has been a good process.\n  I conclude by saying in fact the process that led to this bill was \ncomprehensive, it was fair, it was bipartisan. I do not think we should \nuse complaints about process as an excuse to vote against proceeding to \ndebate on this bill. We should bring this bill to the floor. We have \nbeen through a long, laborious, and a good process. It has gotten us \nthis far.\n  If anyone would have said to me 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 18 months \nago we would have been this far on this bill, I would have said, I do \nnot think so; I do not think we can craft a bill that would be even \nthis close. We have come a long way.\n  First of all, we owe it to the victims who are still not being \ncompensated, either at all or adequately, to craft this bill and to \nreport a bill. We owe it to the victims to debate this and give it our \nbest efforts on the Senate floor. Too much work has gone into this. We \nhave come too far. We owe it to the workers who will lose their jobs if \nmore companies have to declare bankruptcy or if more companies go out \nof business. We owe it to those companies, but most of all we owe it to \nthe victims.\n  So let's bring this bill to the floor. Let's give it the chance it \ndeserves. We have put a great deal of effort in it. Let's do the right \nthing, bring this bill to the Senate floor.\n\n  I thank my colleague from Tennessee for his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Ohio for \nhis comments on the asbestos legislation. This is a time when Americans \nare concerned about jobs, especially about manufacturing jobs. In the \nState of Tennessee, as in the State of Ohio, a large number of those \njobs are in the automotive industry. About one-third of the \nmanufacturing jobs in Tennessee is in the automotive industry. Making \nautomobiles is a very competitive business. There are companies all \nover the world making cars. They are putting their assembly plants and \ntheir parts suppliers in Ohio and in Tennessee, but they can put them \nin Germany, South Korea, Mexico, and other places. If costs in \nmanufacturing cars and trucks in America go a little bit higher, then \nwe hear a lot about jobs going overseas.\n  All Senators who are worried about good manufacturing jobs going \noverseas, jobs in the automotive industry in Ohio and in Tennessee, \nshould be wanting to come to the Senate floor and raise their hand and \nsay, let's get on with this asbestos legislation because it is slowing \ndown our economy, it is going to hurt the companies that produce the \njobs and it is keeping the victims from getting a fair recovery. So I \ncongratulate the Senator from Ohio. This helps Americans, and it is a \npiece of jobs legislation. I hear about it from auto parts suppliers. I \nhear about it, as I am sure the Senator does, from many manufacturers. \nI thank him for his leadership. I ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized as in morning business for the purpose of introducing \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander and Mr. Chambliss pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2319 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Madam President, I rise today to speak on the need to \nresolve the crisis in the asbestos litigation.\n  S. 2290, the Hatch-Frist-Miller FAIR Act of 2004--FAIR, of course, \nstands for Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act--is a bill that \nwould solve many of these problems in an expedited fashion.\n  S. 2290 will secure fair and equitable compensation for asbestos \nvictims who, right now, face uncertainty, delay, and risk in the court \nsystem. As things stand today, compensation for asbestos-related \ninjuries is more likely to be determined by where and when your claim \nis filed and who your lawyer or judge is than by how sick you are.\n  Under the current system where companies can declare bankruptcy and \nsubstantially avoid paying damages, a truly injured victim might \nrecover absolutely nothing for their actual harm, while a claimant with \nno physical impairment can recover his or her whole claim. That is \nsimply not right.\n  The FAIR Act would cut down on delays in compensation to asbestos \nvictims. Today, courts are being overwhelmed by a flood of asbestos \ncases, with some truly ill victims actually dying before they see their \nday in court. An estimated 300,000 claims are pending; 730,000 \nindividuals have already brought claims; and 60,000 to 100,000 new \nclaims are filed each and every year. However, at least three-quarters \nor more of current claims are from the unimpaired. Bankruptcies which \noften result from massive court filings by unimpaired claimants further \ndelay and diminish compensation to truly injured victims.\n  S. 2290 would save American jobs and preserve pensions. American jobs \nare being lost because of this broken system. Asbestos-related \nbankruptcies have led to the direct loss of as many as 60,000 jobs, \nwith each displaced worker losing up to $50,000 in average wages and an \naverage of 25 percent of the value of their 401(k) accounts. Moreover, \nan estimated 423,000 new jobs will not be created because asbestos \ndefendants will have to reduce capital investments by as much as $33 \nbillion.\n  The FAIR Act would revive the economy, as asbestos litigation costs \nare currently wreaking havoc on American business. As approximately \n8,400 companies in all industries have been targeted, the cost of \ncapital for American businesses has increased by as much as 14 percent, \nannual capital investment has gone down $1.6 billion, and annual \neconomic growth has been slowed by $2.4 billion. More than 70 American \nbusinesses have filed for asbestos-related bankruptcies, 35 of these \njust since the year 2000.\n  In sum, S. 2290 will provide fair and timely compensation to asbestos \nvictims and certainly to American workers, retirees, shareholders, and \nthe U.S. economy. Congress has never been more close to resolving the \nasbestos litigation crisis than it now is with S. 2290.\n  This bill provides for a privately funded, no-fault national asbestos \nvictims' compensation fund that will step into the shoes of the Federal \ncourt system and ensure that individuals who are truly sick receive \ncompensation quickly, fairly, and efficiently. The FAIR Act retains the \nbipartisan agreement on medical criteria that the Judiciary Committee \napproved last year. These criteria form the basis of a no-fault \nvictims' compensation fund that will stop the flow of resources to the \nunimpaired and ensure that the truly ill will be paid quickly and \nfairly.\n  S. 2290 contains many improvements made to its predecessor, S. 1125. \nThe new bill reflects several months of intensive negotiations by the \nstakeholders in this important debate and affirmatively addresses the \nmajor issues of concern identified by the stakeholders following the \nJudiciary Committee approval of the original bill S. 1125.\n  Let me take a minute to say that as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have been a party to a lot of the negotiations--certainly \nnot all of them. Chairman Hatch has done a great job of steering the \nnegotiations, but this has been a bipartisan effort.\n  I take a minute to commend Senators on the other side of the aisle, \nsome who are on the Judiciary Committee and some who are not, including \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Biden, Senator Dodd, Senator Kohl, and \nothers, who have been strong proponents of trying to reach a conclusion \nof this asbestos litigation issue. I don't know how they will vote on \nthe final bill. That is not important to me right now. But it is \nimportant they have negotiated in good faith and been a party to the \nnegotiations in a fair and reasonable manner. I commend them for taking \npart and for their cooperative spirit\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nas we have gone through these negotiations.\n  S. 2290 includes revised funding provisions. The new bill establishes \na fund that can pay $114 billion in claims, with an additional $10 \nbillion in contingent funding available from defendant companies. Money \nrequired to go to the fund from defendants and insurers is assured over \na period of 27 years. Defendant participants, for example, guarantee \ntheir funding obligations through a grant of authority to the \nadministrator of the fund to impose a surcharge in any year where \nmonies received fall short of the annual requirements. S. 2290 also \nprovides up to $300 million annually in hardship and inequity \nadjustments that may be granted by the administrator among defendant \nparticipants. Money from insurers is front loaded for the early years \nof the fund where the most stress on the system is expected. \nEnforcement provisions have been strengthened to help the administrator \ngo after recalcitrant participants.\n  The new FAIR Act increases compensation going to claimants. Based on \nthe funding now available under S. 2290, claims values have been \nincreased in several disease categories. S. 2290 also now provides for \nreimbursement for out-of-pocket costs of physical examinations by \nclaimants' physicians as well as costs for x-rays and pulmonary \nfunction testing at the lowest level of diseased-inflicted claimants or \nLevel I claimants.\n  S. 2290 establishes a new streamlined administrative structure. \nRather than administering claims in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, \nas was the case when S. 1125 came out of the Judiciary Committee, the \nnew bill creates a new executive Office of Asbestos Disease \nCompensation within the Department of Labor, which has 90 years of \nexperience in administering similar compensation programs, to process \nclaims as well as manage the fund. The new administrative structure \nwill be more streamlined, more efficient, less adversarial, and less \nburdensome on claimants. The program can be effectively run at a \nfraction of the cost. The application process is faster, is more user \nfriendly, and is fairer to claimants. To further ease the burden on \nclaimants, S. 2290 also establishes a claimant-assistance program. The \nadministrator of the new office will be appointed by the President with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\n\n  S. 2290 ensures a quick start to processing and paying claims. S. \n2290 includes a number of new provisions that ensure the fund will be \nset up and that processing and payment of claims occurs as quickly as \npossible. Placement of the claims-handling office within the Department \nof Labor will utilize DOL's existing infrastructure and experienced \npersonnel to facilitate startup. S. 2290 requires implementation of \ninterim regulations and procedures within 90 days after the bill is \nenacted to allow the office to begin accepting and processing claims in \nshort order. Our new bill grants interim authority to an existing \nAssistant Secretary of the Department of Labor until the new \nadministrator is appointed to avoid potential delays associated with \nthe appointment process.\n  Lastly, S. 2290 provides for upfront funding, as early as 90 days \nafter date of enactment, from fund participants, as well as increased \nborrowing authority, to ensure adequate initial funding will be \navailable to fully meet demand. These new provisions are meant to \ninsure that claimants will have speedy access to the fund while \nstopping any court actions in their tracks; this is to prevent any \nfurther, scarce resources from being siphoned away from the truly sick \nto the unimpaired claimants.\n  The new FAIR Act ensures that any risk of insufficient funds does not \nfall on claimants. S. 2290 establishes a fund that can pay $114 billion \nin claims, with an additional $10 billion in contingent funding \navailable from defendant participants. It also provides the \nadministrator with more management flexibility and increased borrowing \nauthority to be able to address any short-term funding issues.\n  Under the terms of the new bill, if after 7 years it is determined \nthat the fund will have insufficient resources to pay off 100 percent \nof all claims, the administrator is empowered to take actions to sunset \nthe fund. In this event, S. 2290 fully protects the rights of claimants \nby creating a federal cause of action, so claimants will be able to \npursue their claims in the U.S. District Court where they live or where \nthey were exposed to asbestos.\n  In closing, it is important to note that asbestos victims, American \nbusinesses, workers, retirees, shareholders, and the U.S. economy \ncannot afford to wait any longer for asbestos litigation reform. \nConsideration of the FAIR Act on the floor will allow what I'm sure \nwill be a spirited debate and consideration of any reasonable \namendments to our new proposal. That being said, we need move forward \nwith the debate on the FAIR Act and enact S. 2290 now. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in voting to move forward on this important bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4088-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4088-S4092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOW CAN WE TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, yesterday's New York Times Magazine \ncontained a very insightful article written by our colleague from New \nYork, Senator Clinton. This article, entitled ``Now Can We Talk About \nHealth Care?,'' is truly a call to action.\n  Senator Clinton could not be more right when she points out that if \nwe were starting from scratch in designing a health care system, ``none \nof us, from dyed-in-the-wool liberals to rock-solid conservatives, \nwould fashion the kind of health care system America has inherited.'' \nShe pointedly asks why we should carry this flawed system and its \nproblems into the future. It is a rhetorical question, of course, but \nthe answer, unfortunately, is that we are doing just that.\n  Last year, 43.6 million Americans were without health coverage--an \nincrease of over 2 million from the year before. About 74,800 people in \nmy State of South Dakota--12 percent of the population--are without \nhealth insurance. But statistics alone do not communicate the anguish \nfelt by so many people in our country regarding an issue as personal as \ntheir health care.\n  Senator Clinton correctly notes that things will only get worse. Her \narticle explains that the very manner in which we finance care is ``so \nseriously flawed that if we fail to fix it, we face a fiscal disaster \nthat will not only deny quality care to the uninsured and underinsured \nbut also undermine the capacity of the system to care for even the well \ninsured.'' This a sobering warning.\n  It does not have to be this way. The United States is the only major \nindustrialized nation that fails to provide guaranteed health care to \nall its citizens. And, in many countries--Canada, the United Kingdom, \nJapan, France, and Sweden to name a few--they do it while spending less \nper capita than we do in the United States. Yet in each of those \ncountries, citizens have greater life expectancies and lower rates of \nchild mortality than we have in the United States.\n  We must act. The nonpartisan Institute of Medicine recently \nrecommended that by 2010, everyone in the United States should be \ninsured. That is no small task, and it won't come free. But, as Senator \nClinton points out, it will save us money in other ways. People will \nget the preventive care they need and deserve, and this will save us \nthe cost of treating conditions and diseases that have progressed. And, \ncertainly, it is a moral imperative when we are talking about people's \nhealth.\n  We must invest in our public health infrastructure, in preventive \ncare, and in covering the care people need. We can save money by \nincreasing our reliance on information technology with appropriate \nprivacy protections. And we can use every tool we have--including \ngenetic testing--to prevent and contain disease. We can encourage these \ntests by enacting the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, a \nbipartisan bill that has already passed the Senate but awaits action in \nthe House. We can reduce health disparities by passing the Healthcare \nEquality and Accountability Act, a bill I introduced with each of the \nHouse minority caucuses last year. And we can address the problem of \nthe uninsured in a serious manner rather than proposing tax credits \nthat will do little to help those most in need or pushing consumer-\ndriven plans that shift cost and risk onto the individual.\n  I commend Senator Clinton on her thoughtful article. It is something \nwe\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nall should read. Health care should not be a partisan issue. It is a \nnecessity. Whether someone receives the health care they need should \nnot depend on whether they are fortunate enough to access and afford \nadequate health insurance under our current system. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Clinton's article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 18, 2004]\n\n                   Now Can We Talk About Health Care?\n\n                      (By Hillary Rodham Clinton)\n\n       I know that you're thinking. Hillary Clinton and health \n     care? Been there. Didn't do that!\n       No, it's not 1994; it's 2004. And believe it or not, we \n     have more problems today than we had back then. Issues like \n     soaring health costs and millions of uninsured have yet to \n     fix themselves. And now we are confronting a new set of \n     challenges associated with the arrival of the information \n     age, the technological revolution and modern life.\n       Think for a moment about recent advances in genetic \n     testing. Knowing you are prone to cancer or heart disease or \n     Lou Gehrig's disease may give you a fighting chance. But just \n     try, with that information in hand, to get health insurance \n     in a system without strong protections against discrimination \n     for pre-existing or generic conditions. Each vaunted \n     scientific breakthrough brings with it new challenges to our \n     health system. But it's not only medicine that is changing. \n     So, too, are the economy, our personal behaviors and our \n     environment. Unless Americans across the political spectrum \n     come together to change our health care system, that system, \n     already buckling under the pressures of today, will collapse \n     with the problems of tomorrow.\n       Twenty-first-century problems, like genetic mapping, an \n     aging population and globalization, are combining with old \n     problems like skyrocketing costs and skyrocketing numbers of \n     uninsured, to overwhelm the 20th-century system we have \n     inherited.\n       The way we finance care is so seriously flawed that if we \n     fail to fix it, we face a fiscal disaster that will not only \n     deny quality health care to the uninsured and underinsured \n     but also undermine the capacity of the system to care for \n     even the well insured. For example, if a hospital's trauma \n     center is closed or so crowded that it cannot take any more \n     patients, your insurance card won't help much if you're the \n     one in the freeway accident.\n       Let's face it--if we were to start from scratch, none of \n     us, from dyed-in-the-wool liberals to rock-solid \n     conservatives, would fashion the kind of health care system \n     America has inherited. So why should we carry the problems of \n     this system into the future?\n\n\n                         21st-century problems\n\n       At the dawn of the last century, America was coping with \n     the effects of the industrial revolution--crowded living \n     conditions, dangerous workplaces, inadequate sanitation and \n     infrastructure in cities and pollution and infectious \n     diseases like typhoid fever and cholera that exacted a huge \n     toll on the oldest and youngest in society.\n       Since then, a century's worth of advances yielded \n     remarkable results. Antibiotics were developed. Anesthesia \n     was improved. Public health programs like mosquito control \n     and childhood immunizations succeeded in reducing or even \n     eradicating diseases like malaria and polio in this \n     country. Congress passed legislation regulating the \n     quality of food and drugs and assuring that safety and \n     science guided medical developments. Workplace and \n     product-safety standards resulted in fewer deaths and \n     injuries from accidents. Effective campaigns cut tobacco \n     use and alcohol abuse. Employers began providing some \n     workers with health care coverage, primarily for \n     hospitalization costs. And to aid some of those left out, \n     President Lyndon B. Johnson persuaded Congress to \n     establish Medicare and Medicaid to address the poorest, \n     sickest, oldest and highest-risk patients in our society. \n     As a result of these accumulated gains, life expectancy \n     grew from 47 years in 1900 to 77 years for those born in \n     2000.\n       As astounding as those changes were, we are likely to see \n     even more revolutionary changes in the next 100 years. \n     Advances in medicine coincide with advances in computers and \n     communications. The American workplace is changing in \n     response to global pressures. But even positive advances may \n     come with a negative underside. Our affluence contributes to \n     an increasingly sedentary lifestyle that, combined with a \n     diet filled with sugar and fat-rich foods, undermines our \n     ability to fend off chronic diseases like diabetes. And \n     research is proving that the pollutants and contaminants in \n     our environment cause disease and mortality.\n       It is overwhelming just thinking about the problems, never \n     mind dealing with them. But we have to begin applying \n     American ingenuity and resolve or watch the best health care \n     system in the world deteriorate.\n\n\n                            medical advances\n\n       The pace of scientific development in medicine is so rapid \n     that the next hundred years is likely to be called the \n     Century of the Life Sciences. We have mapped the human genome \n     and seen the birth of the burgeoning field of genomics, \n     offering the opportunity to pinpoint and modify the genes \n     responsible for a whole host of conditions. Scientists are \n     exploring whether nanotechnology can target drugs to diseased \n     tissues or implant sensors to detect disease in its earliest \n     forms. We can look forward to ``designer drugs'' tailored to \n     individual genetic profiles. But the advances we herald carry \n     challenges and costs.\n       Think about the potential for inequities in drug research. \n     Today, pharmaceutical and biotech companies have little \n     incentive to research and develop treatments for individuals \n     with rare diseases. Never heard of progeria? That's the \n     point. This fatal syndrome, also called premature-aging \n     disease, affects one in four million newborns a year. It's \n     rare enough that there is no profit in developing a cure. \n     This is known as the ``orphan drug'' problem. Genetic \n     profiles and individualized therapies have the potential to \n     increase the problem of orphaned drugs by further fragmenting \n     the market. Even manufacturers of drugs for conditions like \n     high blood pressure might focus their efforts on people with \n     common genetic profiles. Depending on your genes, you could \n     be out of luck.\n       The increasing understanding and use of genomics may also \n     undermine the insurance system. Health insurance, like other \n     insurance, exists to protect against unpredictable, costly \n     events. It is based on risk. As genetic information allows us \n     to predict illness with greater certainty, it threatens to \n     turn the most susceptible patients into the most vulnerable. \n     Many of us will become uninsurable, like the two young \n     sisters with a congenital disease I met in Cleveland. Their \n     father went from insurance company to insurance company \n     trying to get coverage, until one insurance agent looked at \n     him and said, ``We don't insure burning houses.''\n       Many have worked to get laws on the books to protect people \n     from genetic discrimination, but we have yet to pass \n     legislation that addresses job security and health coverage. \n     The challenges do not stop there. Health insurance will have \n     to change fundamentally to cope with predictable, knowable \n     risks. Will health insurance companies offer coverage \n     tailored to a person's future health prospects? Right now, if \n     you have asthma, or even just allergies, insurers in the \n     individual market can exclude your respiratory system from \n     your health insurance policy. Will all health plans stop \n     offering benefits that relate to genetic diseases?\n       The ability to predict illness may overwhelm more than just \n     the insurance system; it may overwhelm the patient and the \n     provider. Studies in The Journal of the American Medical \n     Association found that nearly 6 out of 10 patients at risk \n     for breast and ovarian cancer declined a genetic test, and a \n     similar fraction of those at risk for colon cancer also \n     declined testing. Why? One reason is probably to avoid higher \n     insurance premiums. But the decision to undergo genetic \n     testing is a complex one that involves many issues. Positive \n     test results often indicate increased risk but no certainty \n     that a disease will occur. Negative results also come without \n     guarantees. The development of genetic profiles and \n     individual therapies will exponentially increase the amount \n     of information a physician is expected to manage. Instead of \n     remembering one or two drugs for any condition, a physician \n     will have to analyze all the different genetic, demographic \n     and behavioral variables to generate optimal treatment for a \n     patient.\n       Medical advances have the potential to overwhelm the health \n     care system top to bottom. At the very least, the pace of \n     technological progress is so rapid that our antiquated health \n     care system is ill equipped to deliver the fruits of that \n     progress. But these advances are not occurring in isolation \n     from other factors affecting both how we finance health care \n     and how much care we need and expect.\n\n\n                             Globalization\n\n       The globalization of our economy has changed everything \n     from how we work as individuals to what we produce as a \n     nation to how quickly diseases can spread. American \n     companies--and workers--compete not only with one another but \n     all over the world. It is called competitive advantage, but \n     it can put American businesses and workers at a disadvantage.\n       The United States' closest economic rivals have mandatory \n     national health care systems rather than the voluntary \n     employer-based model we have. Automakers in the United States \n     and Canada pay taxes to help finance public health care. But \n     in the United States, automakers also pay about $1,300 per \n     midsize car produced for private employee health insurance. \n     Automakers in Canada come out ahead, according to recent news \n     reports, even after paying higher taxes.\n       At the same time, American companies are outsourcing jobs \n     to countries where the price of labor does not include health \n     coverage, which costs Americans jobs and puts pressure on \n     employers who continue to cover their employees at home.\n       And many new jobs, especially those in the service sector \n     and part-time jobs, don't include comprehensive health \n     benefits. More uninsured and underinsured workers impose \n     major strains on a health system that relies on employer-\n     based insurance. In addition, the failure of government to \n     help contain health costs for employers has led to a fraying \n     of the implicit social contract in which a good job came with \n     affordable coverage.\n       Gone are the days when a young person would start in the \n     mail room and stay with the company until retirement. \n     Employee\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\n     mobility is now the rule rather than the exception. Those who \n     pay for health care--insurance companies and employers--\n     increasingly deal with employees who change jobs every few \n     years. This has the effect of not only increasing the numbers \n     of uninsured but also of decreasing the incentive for \n     employers to underwrite access to preventive care.\n       At the same time, war, poverty, environmental degradation \n     and increased world travel for business and pleasure mean \n     greater migration of people across borders. And with people \n     go diseases. The likes of SARS can travel quickly from Hong \n     Kong to Toronto, and news of a strange flu in Asia worries us \n     in New York. Welcome to the world without borders.\n       The Pulitzer Prize-winning science writer Laurie Garrett \n     has described it as ``payback for decades of shunning the \n     desperate health needs of the poor world.'' No matter the \n     blame, the need to act now to address issues of global health \n     is no longer just a moral imperative; it is self-interest.\n\n\n                   Lifestyle and Demographic Changes\n\n       One hundred years ago, who could have predicted that living \n     longer would be a problem?\n       In three decades, the number of Medicare beneficiaries will \n     double. By the year 2050, one in five Americans will be 65 or \n     older. We will have to find a way to finance the growing \n     demand not only for health care but also for long-term care, \n     which is now largely left out of Medicare.\n       Our society's affluence is only half of the story. Widening \n     disparities in wealth and in health care too often cleave \n     along ethnic lines. Today, a Hispanic child with asthma is \n     far less likely than a non-Hispanic white child to get needed \n     medication. African-Americans are systematically less likely \n     to get state-of-the-art cardiac care. As our country becomes \n     more and more diverse, these disparities become more obvious \n     and more intolerable.\n       Our changing lifestyles also contribute to behavior-induced \n     health problems. We can shop online, order in fast food, \n     drive to our errands. Entertainment--movies, TV, video games \n     and music--is one click away. The physical activity required \n     to get through the day has decreased, while the pace and \n     stress of daily life has quickened, affecting mental health. \n     Persistent poverty, risky behaviors like substance abuse and \n     unprotected sex and pollution from cars and power plants all \n     add to the country's health problems. As Judith Stern of the \n     University of California at Davis so aptly put it, genetics \n     may load the gun, but environment pulls the trigger.\n\n\n                          old problems persist\n\n       If all we had to do was face these tremendous changes, that \n     would be daunting enough. But many of the systemic problems \n     we have struggled with for decades--like high costs and the \n     uninsured--are simply getting worse.\n       In 1993, the critics predicted that if the Clinton \n     administration's universal health care coverage plan became \n     law, costs would go through the roof. ``Hospitals will have \n     to close,'' they said, ``Families will lose their choice of \n     doctors. Bureaucrats will deny medically necessary care.''\n       They were half-right. All that has happened. They were just \n     wrong about the reason.\n       In 1993, there were 37 million uninsured Americans. In the \n     late 90's, the situation improved slightly, largely because \n     of the improved economy and the passage of the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program. But now some 43.6 million Americans \n     are uninsured, and the vast majority of them are in working \n     families.\n       While employer-sponsored insurance remains a major source \n     of coverage for workers, it is becoming less accessible and \n     affordable for spouses, dependents and retirees. In 1993, 46 \n     percent of companies with 500 or more employees offered some \n     type of retiree health benefit. That declined to 29 percent \n     in 2001. When you think about the new economy and worker \n     mobility, it's no wonder employees are dropping retiree \n     health benefits. You can only wonder how many yet-to-retire \n     workers are next.\n       Even those Americans not among the ranks of the uninsured \n     increasingly find themselves underinsured. In 2003, two-\n     thirds of companies with 200 or more employees dealt with \n     increasing costs by increasing the share that their \n     employees had to pay and dropping coverage for particular \n     services. With rising deductibles and co-pays, even if you \n     have insurance, you may not be able to afford the care you \n     need, and some benefits, like mental health services, may \n     not be covered at all.\n       The problem of the insured and underinsured affects \n     everyone. A recent Institute of Medicine study estimates that \n     18,000 25- to 64-year old adults die every year as a result \n     of lack of coverage. But even if you are insured, if you have \n     a heart attack, and the ambulance that picks you up has to go \n     three hospitals away because the nearby emergency rooms are \n     full, you will have suffered from our inadequate system of \n     coverage.\n       If, as a nation, we were saving money by denying insurance \n     to some people, you could at least say there's some logic to \n     it--no matter how cruel. But that's not the case. Despite the \n     lack of universal coverage in our country, we still spend \n     much more than countries that provide health care to all \n     their citizens. We are No. 1 in the world in health care \n     spending. On a per capita basis, health spending in the \n     United States is 50 percent higher than the second-highest-\n     spending country: Switzerland. Our health costs now \n     constitute 14.9 percent of our gross domestic product and are \n     growing at an alarming rate: by 2013, per capita health care \n     spending is projected to increase to 18.4 percent of G.D.P.\n       What drives skyrocketing spending? The cost of prescription \n     drugs rose almost twice as fast as spending on all health \n     services, 40 percent in just the last few years.\n       Hospital costs have been rising as well, in large measure \n     because more than one in four health care dollars go to \n     administration. In 1999, that meant $300 billion per year \n     went to pay for administrative bureaucracy; accountants and \n     bookkeepers, who collect bills, negotiate with insurance \n     companies and squeeze every possible reimbursement out of \n     public programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Asthma and other \n     pulmonary disorders linked to pollution contribute \n     significantly to these costs, according to the health \n     economist Ken Thorpe. Diabetes, high blood pressure and \n     mental illness are also among the conditions that keep these \n     costs rising.\n       If we spend so much, even after administrative costs, why \n     does the United States rank behind 47 other countries in life \n     expectancy and 42nd in infant mortality?\n       A lot of the money Americans spend is wasted on care that \n     doesn't improve health. A recent study by Dartmouth \n     researchers argues that close to a third of the $1.6 trillion \n     we now spend on health care goes to care that is duplicative, \n     fails to improve patient health or may even make it worse. A \n     study in Santa Barbara, Calif., found that one out of every \n     five lab tests and X-rays were conducted solely because \n     previous test results were unavailable. A recent study found \n     that for two-thirds of the patients who received a $15,000 \n     surgery to prevent stroke, there was no compelling evidence \n     that the surgery worked.\n       In situations in which the benefits of intervention are \n     clear, many patients are not receiving that care. For \n     example, few hospitalized patients at risk for bacterial \n     pneumonia get the vaccine against it during their hospital \n     stays. A recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine \n     by Elizabeth McGlynn found that, overall, Americans are \n     getting the care they should only 55 percent of the time.\n       As a whole, our ailing health care system is plagued with \n     underuse, overuse and misuse. In a fundamental way, we pay \n     far more less than citizens in other advanced economies get.\n\n\n                          how we deliver care\n\n       There is no ``one size fits all'' solution to our health \n     care problems, but there are common-sense solutions that call \n     for aggressive, creative and effective strategies as bold \n     in their approach as they are practical in their effect.\n       First, the way we deliver health care must change. For too \n     long our model of health care delivery has been based on the \n     provider, the payer, anyone but the patient. Think about the \n     fact that our medical records are still owned by a physician \n     or a hospital, in bits and pieces, with no reasonable way to \n     connect the dots of our conditions and our care over the \n     years.\n       If we as individuals are responsible for keeping our own \n     passports, 401(k) and tax files, educational histories and \n     virtually every other document of our lives, then surely we \n     can be responsible for keeping, or at least sharing custody \n     of, our medical records. Studies have shown that when \n     patients have a greater stake in their own care, they make \n     better choices.\n       We should adopt the model of a ``personal health record'' \n     controlled by the patient, who could use it not only to \n     access the latest reliable health information on the Internet \n     but also to record weight and blood sugar and to receive \n     daily reminders to take asthma or cholesterol medication. \n     Moreover, our current system revolves around ``cases'' rather \n     than patients. Reimbursements are based on ``episodes of \n     treatment'' rather than on a broader consideration of a \n     patient's well-being. Thus it rewards the treatment of \n     discrete diseases and injuries rather than keeping the \n     patient alive and healthy. While we assure adequate privacy \n     protections, we need care to focus on the patient.\n       Our system rewards clinicians for providing more services \n     but not for keeping patients healthier. The structure of the \n     health care system should shift toward rewarding doctors and \n     health plans that treat patients with their long-term health \n     needs in mind and rewarding patients who make sensible \n     decisions about maintaining their own health.\n\n\n                        harnessing modernization\n\n       As paradoxical as it is that advances in medical technology \n     could potentially break our antiquated system, advances in \n     other technologies may hold the answer to saving it. Using a \n     20th-century health care system to deal with 21st-century \n     problems is nowhere more true than in the failure to use \n     information technology.\n       Ten years ago, the Internet was used primarily by academics \n     and the military. Now it is possible to imagine all of a \n     person's health files stored securely on a computer file--\n     test results, lab records, X-rays--accessible from any \n     doctor's office. It is easy to imagine, yet our medical \n     system is not there.\n       The average emergency-room doctor or nurse has minutes to \n     gather information on a patient, from past records and from \n     interviewing the patient or relatives. In the age\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\n     of P.D.A.'s, why are these professionals forced to rely on a \n     patient's memory?\n       Information technology can also be used to disseminate \n     research. A government study recently documented that it \n     takes 17 years from the time of a new medical discovery to \n     the time clinicians actually incorporate that discovery into \n     their practice at the bedside. Why not 17 seconds?\n       Why rely solely on the doctor's brain to store that \n     information? Computers could crunch the variables on a \n     particular patient's medical history, constantly update the \n     algorithms with the latest scientific evidence and put that \n     information at the clinician's fingertips at the point of \n     care.\n       Americans may not be getting the care they should 45 \n     percent of the time, but the tools exist to narrow that gap. \n     Research shows that when physicians receive computerized \n     reminders, statistics improve exponentially. Reminders can \n     take the form of an alert in the electronic health record \n     that the hospitalized patient has not had a pneumonia vaccine \n     or as computerized questions to remind a doctor of the \n     conditions that must be fulfilled before surgery is \n     considered appropriate.\n       Newt Gingrich and I have disagreed on many issues, \n     including health care, but I agree with some of the proposals \n     he outlines in his book ``Saving Lives and Saving Money,'' \n     which support taking advantage of technological changes to \n     create a more modern and efficient health care system. I have \n     introduced legislation that promotes the use of information \n     technology to update our health care system and organize it \n     around the best interests of patients. Improvements in \n     technology will end the paper chase, limit errors and reduce \n     the number of malpractice suits.\n       I strongly believe that savings from information technology \n     should not just be diffused throughout the system, never to \n     be recaptured, but should be used to make substantial \n     progress toward real universal coverage. By better using \n     technology, we can lower health care costs throughout the \n     system and thereby lower the exorbitant premiums that are \n     placing a financial squeeze on businesses, individuals and \n     the government. At the same time, some of those savings \n     should be used to make substantial progress toward real \n     universal coverage. (I may have just lost Newt Gingrich.)\n\n\n         taking the broader view: public health and prevention\n\n       While we focus on empowering the individual through \n     technology, we also have to recognize the larger factors that \n     affect our health--from the environment to public health.\n       If asthma and other pulmonary disorders are the main \n     drivers of increased health spending, that argues strongly \n     that we should rethink how social and environmental factors \n     impact our collective health. Consider that over the last \n     century we have extended life expectancy by 30 years but that \n     only 8 of those years can be credited to medical \n     intervention. The rest of our gains stem from the \n     construction of water and sewer systems, draining mosquito-\n     infested swamps and addressing spoilage, quality and \n     nutrition in our food supply. Yet we continue to underinvest \n     in these important systematic measures--resulting in \n     expensive health consequences like the explosion of asthma \n     among children living in New York City or the harmful levels \n     of lead found among children drinking water from the District \n     of Columbia water system.\n       Our neglect of public health also contributes to spiraling \n     health costs. We tend to address health care--as a nation and \n     as individuals--after the sickness has taken hold, rather \n     than addressing the cause through public health. Public \n     health programs can help stop preventable disease and control \n     dangerous behaviors. Take obesity, for example. Individuals \n     should understand that they put their lives at risk with \n     unhealthy behavior. But let's face it--we live in a fast-food \n     nation, and we need to take steps, like restoring physical-\n     education programs in schools, that support the individual's \n     ability to master his or her own health. Studies conducted by \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have \n     identified ``Programs That Work,'' which should be financed. \n     It comes down to individual responsibility reinforced by \n     national policy.\n       The public health system also needs to be brought up to \n     date. The current public health tools were developed when the \n     major threats to health were infectious diseases like malaria \n     and tuberculosis. But now chronic diseases are the No. 1 \n     killer in our country. We need to be concerned not just about \n     pathogens but also about carcinogens.\n       Over the last three years, I have introduced legislation to \n     increase investment in tracking and correlating environmental \n     and health conditions. I have met with people from Long \n     Island to Fallon, Nev., who want answers about cancer \n     clusters in their communities. The data we have seen about \n     lead and mercury contamination in our food and water suggest \n     that the effects they have on the fetus and children may \n     have contributed to the increasing number of children in \n     special education with attention and learning disorders. \n     We need more research to determine once and for all if \n     increasing pollution in our communities and increasing \n     rates of learning-related disabilities are cause and \n     effect.\n       We should also be looking at sprawl--talking about the way \n     we design our neighborhoods and schools and about our \n     shrinking supply of safe, usable outdoor space--and how that \n     contributes to asthma, stress and obesity. We should follow \n     the example of the European Union and start testing the \n     chemicals we use every day and not wait until we have a rash \n     of birth defects or cancers on our hands before taking \n     action. And we should look at factors in our society that \n     lead to youth violence, substance abuse, depression and \n     suicide and ultimately require insurance and treatment for \n     mental health.\n       After Sept. 11, mental health was a significant factor in \n     the health toll on our nation's first responders. And yet our \n     mental health delivery system is underfinanced and \n     unprepared.\n       Finally, as a society, we need greater emphasis on \n     preventive care, an investment in people and their health \n     that saves us money, because when families can't get \n     preventive care, they often end up in the emergency room--\n     getting the most expensive care possible.\n\n\n                           expanding coverage\n\n       All that we have learned in the last decade confirms that \n     our goal should continue to be what every other \n     industrialized nation has achieved--health care that's always \n     there for every citizen.\n       For the first time, this year a nonpartisan group dedicated \n     to improving the nation's health, the Institute of Medicine, \n     recommended that by 2010 everyone in the United States should \n     have health insurance. Such a system would promote better \n     overall health for individuals, families, communities and our \n     nation by providing financial access for everyone to \n     necessary, appropriate and effective health services.\n       It will, as I have been known to say, take the whole \n     village to finance an affordable and accountable health \n     system. Employers and individuals would share in its \n     financing, and individuals would have to assume more \n     responsibility for improving their own health and lifestyles. \n     Private insurers and public programs would work together, \n     playing complementary roles in ensuring that all Americans \n     have the health care they need. Our society is already \n     spending $35 billion a year to treat people who have no \n     health insurance, and our economy loses $65 billion to $130 \n     billion in productivity and other costs. We are already \n     spending what it would cost if we reallocated those resources \n     and required responsibility.\n       In the post 9/11 world, there is one more reason for \n     universal coverage. The anthrax and ricin episodes, and the \n     continuing threat posed by biological, chemical and \n     radiological weapons, should make us painfully aware of the \n     shortcomings of our fragmented system of health care. Can you \n     imagine the aftermath of a bioterrorism attack, with \n     thousands of people flooding emergency rooms and bureaucrats \n     demanding proof of insurance coverage from each and every \n     one? Those without coverage might not see a doctor until they \n     had infected others.\n       Insurance should be about sharing risk and responsibility--\n     pooling resources and risk to protect ourselves from the \n     devastating cost of illness and injury. It should not be \n     about further dividing us. Competition should reward health \n     plans for quality and cost savings, not for how many bad \n     risks they can exclude--especially as we enter the genomic \n     age, when all of us could have uninsurable risks written into \n     our genes.\n       So achieving comprehensive health care reform is no simple \n     feat, as I learned a decade ago. None of these ideas mean \n     anything if the political will to ensure that they happen \n     doesn't exist.\n       Some people believe that the only solution to our present \n     cost explosion is to shift the cost and risk onto individuals \n     in what is called ``consumer driven'' health care. Each \n     consumer would have an individual health care account and \n     would monitor his or her own spending. But instead of putting \n     consumers in the driver's seat, it actually leaves consumers \n     at the mercy of a broken market. This system shifts the \n     costs, the risks and the burdens of disease onto the \n     individuals who have the misfortune of being sick. Think \n     about the times you have been sick or injured--were you able \n     under those circumstances to negotiate for the best price or \n     shop for the best care? And instead of giving individuals, \n     providers and payers incentives for better care, this cost-\n     shifting approach actually causes individuals to delay or \n     skip needed services, resulting in worse health and more \n     expensive health needs later on.\n       Meanwhile, proposals like those for individual health \n     insurance tax credits, without reforms for the individual \n     insurance market, leave individuals in the lurch as well. We \n     know that asthmatics can have their entire respiratory \n     systems excluded from coverage. Individual insurance \n     companies can increase your premium or limit coverage for \n     factors like age, previous medical history or even flat feet. \n     Those in the individual market cannot pool their risk with \n     colleagues or other members of the group. The coverage you \n     can get and the price you pay for it will reflect individual \n     risk, and you simply don't receive many of the benefits of \n     what we consider traditional insurance when people pool \n     risks. So the proposal to give individuals tax credits to buy \n     coverage in the individual market, without any rules of fair \n     play, won't provide much help for Americans who need health \n     care. In the same way, the recent Medicare bill, which seeks \n     to privatize Medicare benefits, long a government guarantee, \n     threatens to leave the ``bad risks'' without any affordable \n     coverage. With the new genetic information at our disposal, \n     that could\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\n     mean any one of us could one day be denied health insurance.\n       When many of those who opposed the Health Security Act look \n     back, they are still proud of their achievement in blocking \n     our reform plan. The focus of that proposal was to cover \n     everybody by enabling the healthier to pool the ``risk'' with \n     others. The plan was to redirect what we currently pay for \n     uninsured care into expanding health coverage.\n       We could make cosmetic changes to the system we currently \n     have, but that would simply take what is already a Rube \n     Goldberg contraption and make it larger and even more \n     unwieldy. We could go the route many have advocated, putting \n     the burden almost entirely on individuals, thereby creating a \n     veritable nationwide health care casino in which you win or \n     lose should illness strike you or someone in your family. Or \n     we could decide to develop a new social contract for a new \n     century premised on joint responsibility to prevent disease \n     and provide those who need care access to it. This would not \n     let us as individuals off the hook. In fact, joint \n     responsibility demands accountability from patients, \n     employers, payers and society as a whole.\n       What will we say about ourselves 10 years from today? If we \n     finally act to reform what we know needs to change, we may \n     take credit in building a health care system that covers \n     everyone and improves the quality of all our lives. But if we \n     continue to dither and disagree, divided by ideology and \n     frozen into inaction by competing special interests, then we \n     will share in the blame for the collapse of health care in \n     America, where rising costs break the back of our economy and \n     leave too many people without the medical attention they \n     need.\n       The nexus of globalization, the revolution in medical \n     technology and the seismic pressures imposed by the \n     contradictions in our current health care system will force \n     radical changes whether we choose them or not. We can do \n     nothing, we can take incremental steps--or we can implement \n     wide-ranging reform.\n       To me, the case for action is clear. And as we work to \n     develop long-term solutions, we can take steps now to help \n     address the immediate problems we face. As Senator John Kerry \n     has proposed, we should cover everyone living in poverty, and \n     all children; allow people to buy into the federal employee \n     health benefits program; and also help employers by \n     reinsuring high-cost claims while assuming more of the costs \n     from hard-pressed state and local governments.\n       We can pass real privacy legislation that will ensure that \n     Americans continue to feel secure in the trust they place in \n     others for their most intimate medical information. And we \n     can realize the promise of savings through information \n     technology and disease management by passing quality health \n     legislation now.\n       If we do not fix the problems of the present, we are doomed \n     to live with the consequences in the future. As someone who \n     tried to promote comprehensive health care reform a decade \n     ago and decided to push for incremental changes in the years \n     since, I still believe America needs sensible, wide-ranging \n     reform that leads to quality health care coverage available \n     to all Americans at an affordable cost.\n       The present system is unsustainable. The only question is \n     whether we will master the change or it will master us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4092-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4092-S4093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        pfc chance phelps, usmc\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise today to express our Nation's \ndeepest thanks and gratitude to a special young man and his family. \nDuring this past recess, I attended funeral services in Dubois, WY for \nMarine PFC Chance Phelps. On April 9, 2004, Private First Class Phelps \ndied in the line of duty while serving his country in the war on \nterrorism. He was shot and killed while fighting insurgents in the town \nof Ramadi, Iraq, west of Baghdad.\n  Private First Class Phelps was a member of the 3rd Battalion, 11th \nMarine Regiment, 1st Marine Division. He spent the early years of his \nlife in Dubois, WY before moving to Colorado. He enjoyed the outdoors, \nhunting and fishing, and was an outstanding athlete. He was good \nnatured, and loved his family and his country. Private First Class \nChance had a profound sense of duty that led him to join the United \nStates Marine Corps. He felt deeply compelled to serve and defend his \ncountry following the terrorist attacks of September 11.\n  It is because of people like Chance Phelps that we continue to live \nsafe and secure. America's men and women who answer the call of service \nand wear our Nation's uniform deserve respect and recognition for the \nenormous burden that they willingly bear. Our people put everything on \nthe line everyday, and because of these folks, our Nation remains free \nand strong in the face of danger.\n  The motto of the Marine Corps is ``Semper Fidelis.'' It means \n``Always Faithful.'' Through his selfless and courageous sacrifice, PFC \nChance Phelps lived up to these words with great honor.\n  Private First Class Phelps is survived by his mother Gretchen, his \nfather John, his sister Kelley, and his brothers of the United States \nMarine Corps. We say goodbye to a son, a brother, a Marine, and an \nAmerican. Our Nation pays its deepest respect to PFC Chance Phelps for \nhis courage, his love of country and his sacrifice, so that we may \nremain free. He was a hero in life and he remains a hero in death. All \nof Wyoming, and indeed the entire Nation are proud of him.\n  So, one Marine to another, Private First Class Phelps, Semper Fi.\n\n\n                           SP4 DENNIS MORGAN\n\n   Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to SP4 \nDennis Morgan, a member of the South Dakota National Guard, who died on \nApril 15, 2004, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n   Specialist Morgan was a member of the 153rd Engineer Batallion, \nwhich is based in Wagner, SD. He was helping clear mines and explosives \nwhen a roadside bomb went off, killing him.\n   Answering America's call to the military, Specialist Morgan joined \nthe National Guard immediately after graduating from Winner High School \nin 2000. He joined, along with his best friend from high school, \nMichael Lee. Their bond was special and they did everything together. \nMichael's father, Melvin, said of Dennis, ``He was often at our place, \nworking on cars with Michael, and here for dinners.''\n   After high school, Morgan moved back to his original hometown of \nValentine, NE, where he sometimes worked as an auto mechanic. Shortly \nbefore leaving for Iraq, he married his girlfriend, Cathy.\n   Specialist Morgan is the first member of the South Dakota National \nGuard to be killed in combat since World War II. Company A, which \nincludes members from Wagner and Winner, was assigned to the 1st Marine \nExpedition Headquarters. Their Company is responsible for defusing \nroadside explosives. ``They were very proud of their mission, and they \nstill are, because those explosive devices are what are killing \neverybody,'' said Roger Anderson, information officer was the South \nDakota Army National Guard.\n   Specialist Morgan served our country and died as a hero, fighting \nfor it. He served as a model of loyalty and dedication in the \npreservation of freedom. The thoughts and prayers of my family, as well \nas our country's, are with his family during this time of mourning. Our \nthoughts continue to be with all those families who have children, \nspouses, fathers, and other loved ones serving overseas.\n   Specialist Morgan led a full life, committed to his family, his \nNation, and his community. It was his incredible dedication to helping \nothers that will serve as his greatest legacy. Our Nation is a far \nbetter place because of Specialist Morgan's contributions, and, while \nhis family, friends, and Nation will miss him very much, the best way \nto honor his life is to remember his commitment to service and his \nfamily.\n   I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the \nfriends and family of Specialist Morgan, I know that he will always be \nmissed, but his service to our Nation will never be forgotten.\n\n\n                          Pfc Deryk L. Hallal\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from \nIndianapolis, IN. PFC Deryk L. Hallal, 24 years old, died in the al-\nAnbar province, just west of Baghdad on April 6, 2004. He was struck by \ngunfire during an attack.\n  Deryk graduated from North Central High School in 1998 and studied \ncomputer programming at the Professional Careers Institute before \njoining the Marines last year, just months after the conflict in Iraq \nbegan. He was a rifleman assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 4th Marine \nRegiment, based at Camp Pendleton, CA. According to his mother, he was \nfulfilling the duty he felt compelled to do after the events of \nSeptember 11. With his entire life before him, Deryk chose to risk \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  Deryk was the 27th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\nyoung soldier leaves behind his father, Jeff; his mother, Pam; and four \nyounger siblings. May Deryk's siblings grow up knowing that their \nbrother gave his life so that young Iraqis will some day know the \nfreedom they enjoy.\n  Today, I join Deryk's family, his friends, and the entire \nIndianapolis community in mourning his death. While we struggle to bear \nour sorrow over his death, we can also take pride in the example he \nset, bravely fighting to make the world a safer place. It is his \ncourage and strength of character that people will remember when they \nthink of Deryk, a memory that will burn brightly during these \ncontinuing days of conflict and grief.\n  When looking back on the life of her late son, Deryk's mother, Pam, \ntold the Indianapolis Star that her son ``was a big jokester, he would \nlight up the room.'' Deryk was known for his wonderful sense of humor, \nhis big heart and his love of sports. His father, Jeff, said Deryk \ndreamed of one day becoming a sports announcer. Today and always, Deryk \nwill be remembered by family members, friends and fellow Hoosiers as a \ntrue American hero and we honor the sacrifice he made while dutifully \nserving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring Deryk's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg:\n\n       We cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow \n     this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled \n     here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or \n     detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \n     say here, but it can never forget what they did here.\n\n  This statement is just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, \nas I am certain that the impact of Deryk's actions will live on far \nlonger than any record of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Deryk L. Hallal in the \nofficial Record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like Deryk's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God \nbless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4093-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, yesterday was Yom HaShoah, Holocaust \nRemembrance Day. Holocaust Remembrance Day is the day that has been set \naside for remembering the victims of the Holocaust and for \ncontemplating what can happen to civilized people when bigotry, hatred, \nand indifference reign.\n  Between 1938 and 1945, the Nazis murdered over 11 million people \nthroughout Europe, 6 million of them Jewish. On Holocaust Remembrance \nDay, we remember those who gave their lives because of their heritage, \ntradition, and beliefs. While the Jews of Europe were defenseless \nagainst the Nazi regime, many held on to their faith up until the last \nmoments of their lives. Every year, on the Holocaust Remembrance Day, \nwe remember those who sanctified the name of God in the death camps, \nthe ghettos, and elsewhere.\n  Holocaust Remembrance Day occurs on the 27th day of the Jewish \ncalendar's month of Nissan. This year, that was yesterday. When it \nfalls on a weekend, it is commemorated on the following Monday. The \ndate also marks the anniversary of the heroic Warsaw Ghetto uprising of \n1943, which occurred 61 years ago to the day--April 19, 1943.\n  The Holocaust is not merely a story of destruction and loss. It is a \nremarkable story of the human spirit--of the life that flourished \nbefore the Holocaust, struggled during its darkest hours, and \nultimately prevailed as the survivors and their progeny struggled to \nrebuild. Indeed, Holocaust Remembrance Day occurs just eight days \nbefore Israel's Independence Day. Today, in Israel, a morning siren \nsounds, stopping all activity--and people stand in honor of those who \ndied. Indeed, people of all faiths around the world hold memorials and \nvigils, often lighting candles in honor of the Holocaust victims. Many \nhold name-reading ceremonies to memorialize those who perished.\n  It has been over 50 years since the last concentration camp was \nliberated and many of the Holocaust survivors are now succumbing to \nnatural causes. It is our obligation to share their stories to ensure \nthat this horrible tragedy never repeats itself. We must honor the \nlives of those who lived on and those who did not survive the Nazis and \ntheir murderous cohorts.\n  There are literally hundreds of excellent movies and documentaries on \nthe events before, during, and after the Holocaust. They cover every \npossible topic from deepest tragedies to the pinnacle of one of the \ngreatest forces of all--the human spirit. These films vary from \nHollywood to amateur documentaries, and include the Shoah Foundation's \nvaliant efforts to record living survivors. All should bear witness, so \nthat this kind of inhumanity will never happen again. I also recommend \nvisiting the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum here in Washington. It is a \nunique treasure that serves as a soulful reminder of the events of \nWorld War II.\n  Finally, seek out those with personal or family knowledge of this \nenormous tragedy. Nothing can replace the power of the first person \naccounts from a survivor, child of a survivor, liberator of the camps, \nor member of the resistance. Their stories teach us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4093-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4093-S4094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      RECOGNITION OF CALIFORNIA PHYSICIAN PHILIP C. HOPEWELL, M.D.\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize \nPhilip C. Hopewell, M.D., of San Francisco, CA. A pioneer in pulmonary \nmedicine, Dr. Hopewell is being awarded the Edward Livingston Trudeau \nMedal in recognition of his lifelong contributions to the prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatment of lung disease. Dr. Hopewell has dedicated \nover 30 years researching national and international tuberculosis \ncontrol.\n  Dr. Hopewell's commitment to pulmonary disease serves as an example \nfor all working to preserve the health of this Nation and the world. \nFrom the early 1970s, Dr. Hopewell has been concerned with those living \nwith tuberculosis. Dr. Hopewell began his career as a consultant in \ntuberculosis control to the Nigerian government in the war-affected \nareas of eastern Nigeria. Later, his interest in tuberculosis control \nin developing countries was fostered by his work in the Pan-American \nHealth Organization in 1980-1981 and with the Stop TB Partnership, \nbased at the World Health Organization in Geneva in 2003.\n  Not only has Dr. Hopewell helped countless tuberculosis patients \naround the globe, he has been instrumental in addressing the problem \nhere at home. Dr. Hopewell has been on the faculty at UCSF, based at \nSan Francisco General, since 1973, where he served as chief of the \nDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine from 1989 to 1998 and \nAssociate Dean 1998 to 2004. Today, Dr. Hopewell continues to practice \nclinical pulmonary and critical care medicine at San Francisco General \nHospital, serving as an attending physician on the pulmonary \nconsultation service and in the medical intensive care unit.\n  In addition to his clinical work, Dr. Hopewell spends a great deal of \nhis time as a researcher. Dr. Hopewell's research has enabled more \nspecific targeting of control interventions and has helped contribute \nto a nearly 60 percent reduction in the number of new cases of \ntuberculosis in San Francisco in the past decade. In 1981, Dr Hopewell \nbecame involved in the San Francisco tuberculosis control program \nthrough the Department of Public Health. From this association, the \nFrances J. Curry National Tuberculosis Center, directed by Dr. Hopewell \nwas formed. The Curry Center is one of three CDC-funded model centers \nin the country and provides important opportunities for training and \nresearch in many aspects of tuberculosis and tuberculosis control.\n  Today, I acknowledge Dr. Hopewell for his lifelong accomplishments in \ntuberculosis research and tuberculosis control. I also acknowledge Dr. \nHopewell's numerous leadership positions in pulmonary medicine. He \nserved on the\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\nNational Advisory Council of the National Institutes of Allergy and \nInfectious Disease, was president of the California Thoracic Society, \nthe North American Region of the International Union against \nTuberculosis and Lung Disease, and the American Thoracic Society.\n  I am pleased to take this opportunity to recognize Dr. Hopewell for \nhis service to the medical community and to our Nation and to \ncongratulate him on being selected to receive the American Lung \nAssociation's Edward Livingston Trudeau Medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4094-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JOHN ROBERT PERRY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Madam President, today I wish to recognize the \nrecent achievement of the University of Denver Hockey Team. On April \n10, 2004, on the frigid ice of a Boston arena, two champion caliber \nteams faced one another in what will go down in history as one of the \nmost exciting nights in college sports history. On this particular \nevening the University of Denver Pioneers came out on top, defeating \nthe Black Bears of Maine and winning the Men's NCAA Division One \nChampionship.\n  The University of Denver has a distinguished history of athletic \nexcellence. While this is the university's sixth national title for \nhockey, it is the first since 1969.\n  The title game itself was decided by the narrowest of margins, a one-\ngoal-to-none victory for DU. Pioneer forward Gabe Gauthier scored the \ngames only goal on an assist from forward Connor James. Among its many \noutstanding scholar athletes the University of Denver can boast of \nsenior goalie Adam Berkhoel, MVP of the Frozen Four championship round \nand one of college hockey's brightest stars. These outstanding \nindividual efforts can not eclipse the most distinct aspect of the \ntitle game, the perfect team play exhibited by the Pioneers. Denver \nspent most of the last 2 minutes of the game down two players and \nfighting off an attack by six Maine players with only three defenders \nbetween the Black Bears and the Pioneer goalie. Never have 2 minutes of \nhockey seemed longer; never have 2 minutes of hockey ended more \nsweetly.\n  At the helm of the University of Denver hockey team is coach George \nGwozdecky. Coach Gwozdecky came to DU in 1994 and has compiled an \nimpressive record of 196-140-26 with the Pioneers. This year Coach \nGwozdecky was named runner-up Division One Coach of the Year, an honor \nI know he shares with his dedicated staff.\n  Today I share my congratulations with the entire University of Denver \ncommunity. Such an outstanding and rare achievement as a national title \nreflects the hard work and dedication of many people. Congratulations \nto all the DU Pioneers. Congratulations to Chancellor Daniel Ritchie, \nProvost Bob Coombe, President Mark Holtzman, Director of Athletics \nDianne Murphy, Coach Gwozdecky and his staff, and especially the \nPioneer players, students and fans. You have made us all very \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4094-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETERANS' UPWARD BOUND ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

A bill to authorize and facilitate hydroelectric power \nlicensing of the Tapoco Project; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I rise to speak about an issue that \nconcerns the Senator from North Carolina and her constituents. I know \nof her love for the Great Smoky Mountains and her concern for the \noutdoors, and while most of what I am about to say affects eastern \nTennessee and the Great Smoky Mountains, anything that affects eastern \nTennessee and the Great Smoky Mountains has something to do with \nwestern North Carolina and the Great Smoky Mountains. This is some good \nnews for the outdoors men and women and all of the people who love the \nmountains, the valleys, and the rivers of east Tennessee and western \nNorth Carolina.\n  The legislation I have introduced will save thousands of good-paying \njobs at the Aluminum Company of America plants in Blount County, which \nis my hometown, and at the same time provide recreational opportunities \non thousands of acres of ALCOA mountain land for canoeists, hikers, and \nfisher men and women. Of importance to all of us who enjoy the outdoors \nin east Tennessee and North Carolina, this agreement should help to \ncreate fuller lake reservoirs during the summer recreation season.\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\n  This bill I have introduced today is necessary because since 1913, a \nlittle more than 90 years, the Aluminum Company of America has operated \ndams high on the Little Tennessee River adjacent to what is now the \nGreat Smoky Mountain National Park near the border of Tennessee and \nNorth Carolina. These dams were built before either the Tennessee \nValley Authority or the Great Smoky Mountain National Park were \ncreated. These four dams provide half of the electric power ALCOA uses \nto operate its plants in the valley below the mountains in Blount \nCounty, TN. ALCOA's license to operate these four dams expires next \nyear. The company has applied to the Federal Electric Regulatory \nCommission for a 40-year license renewal.\n  ALCOA's license renewal application has created a lot of interest in \nthe Tennessee Valley, and for two reasons. The first reason involves \nthe economic well-being of thousands of current and retired ALCOA \nworkers in the communities in which they live. The second reason is the \napplication has attracted broad attention from conservation \norganizations because of the opportunity to create recreational \nopportunity on land ALCOA owns in the Little Tennessee River watershed \nadjacent to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Some of this ALCOA \nland is actually within the legislation boundaries of the park.\n  On this chart the darker area is the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark. This is a unique park created in the mid-1930s and given by the \npeople of North Carolina and Tennessee to the United States. It is the \nonly national park in our system that was given to the Government and \nnot bought by the Government. It has 500,000 acres, more or less, and \nit is visited each year by about 10 million Americans. It is by far the \nmost visited national park in America. Yellowstone National Park, as an \nexample, has about 3 million visitors a year.\n\n  This is the Little Tennessee River. It was the center of the Cherokee \ncivilization when the European pioneers came. This is the river on \nwhich Alcoa began to build dams nearly a century ago.\n  Around these four dams on the river is the land we are talking about. \nThis is approximately 10,000 acres that lie between the Great Smokey \nMountain National Park and between the Cherokee National Forest and the \nJoyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness Area. This is Tennessee. This is \nNorth Carolina. The Tennessee/North Carolina border runs right across \nthe top of those 6,000-foot mountains. One of the most beautiful areas \nin America with virgin timber is right here in the Joyce Kilmer-\nSlickrock Creek Wilderness Area just across the line from Tennessee. So \nwe are talking in my remarks and in this legislation about 10,000 acres \nthat lie between the Great Smokies and the Cherokee National Forest.\n  One may wonder, just listening to this, what does that have to do \nwith the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Under our rules, Alcoa \nnow has to apply for a 40-year renewal to operate these four dams. The \nconservation organizations in the area and the neighboring communities \nbegan a discussion with Alcoa 7 years ago about what would happen when \nthat application renewal came up. That 7 years of discussion between \nthe Aluminum Company of America, the neighboring regions, and the \nvarious conservation organizations have come up with a settlement \nagreement on which people have worked long and hard. Basically it does \nthis. Alcoa will basically swap or exchange this land here in exchange \nfor community and conservation support for the license renewal.\n  We are going to hold a hearing on this whole subject on April 27 in \nthe Senate Energy Committee. I look forward to working with our \nchairman, Senator Domenici, and with the chairman of the National Park \nSubcommittee, Senator Thomas, on that day.\n  We hear a lot about obstinate companies that are not interested in \nthe environment. We hear a lot about conservation organizations that \nwill not be reasonable. Here is a good story. Here is a textbook \nexample of how a major American company can work with communities and \nconservation organizations to help Americans keep a high standard of \nliving as well as to conserve the environment. Once approved, I expect \nit to become a model for many other companies, communities, and \nconservation groups.\n  I see on the floor now the Senator from Georgia, who spent a fair \namount of his younger life in Tennessee, probably in these same \nmountains. He, as I, and the Senator from North Carolina, have visited \nand hiked in and enjoyed these mountains as thousands do. Let me say \nfirst a word about the jobs involved and then a word about the \nrecreational opportunities.\n  On the jobs, looking back those 90 years, this is the story. In 1913 \na group of men from Pittsburgh came quietly to Maryville, TN, to meet \nwith the mayor. The businessmen were looking for a location for an \naluminum smelter. They came to Maryville because alumina is extracted \nfrom bauxite ore in an electrolysis process requiring huge amounts of \nelectricity, and the opportunity for producing huge amounts of \nelectricity existed better in the Tennessee Valley than in almost any \nother part of the United States.\n\n  The Great Smoky Mountains rise to more than 6,600 feet above the \nvalley in which Maryville is situated, and the rainfall in those \nmountains is more than 80 inches a year, one of the highest in America. \nSo that combination, heavy rainfall and fast-running water, created a \nformula for making cheap hydroelectric power, so Alcoa built four dams \nalong the Little Tennessee River: Calderwood, Cheoah, Chilhowee, and \nFontana. Half of the electricity for the Alcoa operations in east \nTennessee comes from those four dams. The rest of Alcoa's power is \npurchased from the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n  Here is what happened to the far-sighted mayor who visited with those \nAlcoa executives in 1913 and approved the location of that aluminum \nsmelter in the Tennessee Valley. He was literally tarred and feathered \nand run out of town because the mountain people did not want to be \ndisturbed by what they were afraid was about to come and disturb their \nlifestyle. What came was the largest aluminum smelter in the world, \nwhich, when combined with a fabricating plant and a rolling mill, \nemployed as many as 14,000 during World War II. The Alcoa plants made \nthe metal that helped win the war.\n  Meanwhile, the Alcoa jobs, those 14,000 jobs since 1913 until today, \ntransformed one of the poorer parts of America. When Alcoa came to \nAppalachia, family incomes of these families of east Tennessee were \nabout one-third of the national average. I know about this. Our family \nhas been in that part of Tennessee for seven generations. But the \nAluminum Company of America began to pay steelworker wages to these \n14,000 families and those wages were national wages. So suddenly men \nand women from all over east Tennessee, and I imagine some from North \nCarolina, were driving dozens of miles to get one of those Alcoa jobs \nthat brought with it good income, good health care, and a retirement \nincome.\n  Some of those who went to work there included many African Americans \nwho had been brought to Tennessee from Alabama to help build the \nplants. The changes that those Alcoa jobs brought to Blount County and \nto the surrounding counties is proof positive of what three generations \nof good jobs can do: good housing, low crime, strong families, some of \nthe best public schools anywhere in America, almost nobody rich but \nalmost everybody with a good job.\n  Today, there are 2,000 Alcoa jobs in east Tennessee. That means $140 \nmillion in salaries and benefits. It means $\\1/2\\ million a year in \nAlcoa Foundation education scholarships to children of those employees. \nIt means $230 million each year in purchased goods and services; $7 \nmillion in State and local taxes--a total of $377 million a year just \nto Tennessee.\n  I must confess a personal interest in this story. I grew up hearing \nabout Charles Martin Hall and the discovery of Aluminum. My father went \nto work for Alcoa in 1941, the year after I was born. The job the plant \nmanager, Mr. Granville Swaney, offered to him as a safety engineer paid \ntwice what my father was being paid as principal at West Side \nElementary School, and one of those Alcoa Foundation scholarships went \nto me in 1958, making it possible for me to attend Vanderbilt \nUniversity, something I never could have afforded to do otherwise.\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\n  So you can see why I believe, as well as I am sure almost all \nTennesseans believe, it is critically important to renew this \nhydroelectric license for another 40 years and keep these good jobs in \nthe Tennessee Valley. Without these four dams providing low-cost \nreliable power, these jobs would be gone overnight, probably to Alcoa \nplants in Quebec or Iceland where the hydroelectric power is plentiful \nand cheap.\n  The second reason and the final reason this settlement agreement has \nattracted such widespread interest is because of the recreation \nopportunities it will provide.\n  Tapoco is the name of the Alcoa subsidiary that owns the four dams I \ndescribed along this Little Tennessee River. The acres contained within \nthe Tapoco project are sandwiched between nearly 10,000 acres of \nnonproject lands owned by Alcoa. These nonproject lands are the 10,000 \nacres in green here. This is in the area I mentioned of the Great \nSmokies, the Cherokee National Forest, the Nantahala National Forest, \nthe Citico Creek, and Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness Areas.\n  A critical requirement in obtaining this 40-year license renewal is \nthis settlement agreement negotiated by and with a large group of \ninterested relicensing stakeholders. These stakeholders include the \nNational Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the eastern \nband of Cherokees, State agencies representing Tennessee and North \nCarolina, numerous nongovernmental organizations, local government, \nhomeowners associations, and individual citizens.\n  They began to discuss all of this 7 years ago. It has taken all of \nthat time to work this out.\n  In order to make this effective, however, Congress must authorize the \nland exchanges in the settlement agreement. The terms and conditions \nunder the settlement agreement will then become terms and conditions \nunder Alcoa's hydroelectric license.\n  In order for the Federal Electric Regulatory Commission to have legal \nauthority to put the settlement agreement terms and conditions in the \nlicense, legislation from Congress is required prior to the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission making a relicensing decision in August of \n2004.\n  Much of the settlement agreement is focused on the transfer of land \ninterests between the Great Smoky Mountains, the U.S. Forest Service, \nand Alcoa.\n  Let me see if I can describe it simply.\n  The first part of the land swap is between the Great Smokies National \nPark and Alcoa. The Great Smokies will transfer 100 acres of flood \nareas of land in exchange for 186 acres of biologically sensitive \nacreage that Alcoa owns.\n  All of us growing up always heard about people from Florida coming up \nand wanting to buy land and we would sell them land that was flooded, \nor they would sell us land that was flooded. But basically, flooded \nland--100 acres--is being swapped for 186 acres of land that is a \nbiologically diverse area, and this will go into the Great Smoky \nMountain National Park.\n  In fact, it was already within the legislative boundaries. But I \nsuppose the park ran out of money back in the 1930s and couldn't buy \nit.\n  The second component is a big tract of land--6,000 acres between the \nSmokies and the Cherokee National Forest.\n  After a complicated set of arrangements, what can happen is this:\n  It involves the Nature Conservancy, but this legislation authorizes \nthe Secretary of the Interior to purchase this land at a reasonable \nvalue from the Nature Conservancy after Alcoa gives it to the Nature \nConservancy.\n  The long and short of it will be that after 3 years, hopefully the \nGreat Smokies will be 6,000 acres larger and immediately people who \nlive in this region will be able to enjoy this 6,000 acres.\n  There is one other part to this. There is a 4,000-acre tract over \nhere. The Nature Conservancy will own this under the agreement, but it \nwill also be open to outdoor recreation, to hunters, and to fishermen.\n  All of this is part of Alcoa's relicensing agreement. The people who \nwork here get the jobs. Everybody who lives here gets to enjoy a \nnational park with 6,000 more acres and an area that includes 4,000 \nmore acres.\n  That is the legislation I have introduced today. The legislation will \nallow the settlement agreement worked on for 7 years to be implemented \nand for Alcoa's relicensing process at the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to proceed.\n\n  Alcoa, American Rivers, Blount County, city of Alcoa, city of \nMaryville, eastern band of Cherokee Indians, Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park--I say particularly the Nature Conservancy and the \nNational Parks Conservation Association--thank you for your hard work.\n  Also, North Carolina Department of Environment and Conservation, \nNorth Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, Tennessee Clean Water \nNetwork, and various other organizations I want to mention have also \nbeen a part of this effort.\n  It gives me a great deal of personal pleasure to be able to come to \nthe floor and compliment the hard work of others over the last 7 years.\n  The hard work of the Aluminum Company of America, the creativeness \nand reasonableness of the conservation organizations and communities \nwill result in 2,000 good jobs being saved and all of us being able to \nenjoy up to 10,000 more acres adjacent to the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I overheard my good friend from east \nTennessee as he spoke about life in the Great Smoky Mountains and the \nbill that he is presenting today. Knowing his passion for east \nTennessee--not just east Tennessee but the whole State of Tennessee and \nthat whole region--gives all of us great reason to examine exactly what \nhe is proposing because I know what he is doing is not just right for \nthat part of the country but for the country as a whole from a \npreservation and protection standpoint.\n  It is kind of interesting as I sat there and listened to him talk \nabout the number of agencies and entities he has brought together in \nthis one proposal and has everybody in the core. The Senator, \nobviously, has done an awful lot of work over the last year and a half \nthat he served in the Senate to bring this coalition together in \nsupport of that project.\n  I wish to take the opportunity as somebody who spent a large part of \nmy life in the mountains of east Tennessee to commend the Senator. I \nappreciate all of his hard work, his dedication, and the proposal he \ncame up with relative to the Alcoa project.\n  I told him I feel better now about buying all of that aluminum foil \nover the years because I know it went to send him to Vanderbilt. What a \ngreat asset he is to Vanderbilt and to the University of Tennessee and \nnow to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4099-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 340--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n   PRESIDENT SHOULD DESIGNATE SEPTEMBER 26, 2004, AS ``NATIONAL GOOD \n                             NEIGHBOR DAY''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself and Mr. Burns) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, \nthe morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be \napproved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day, and the Senate then begin a period of morning \nbusiness for up to 60 minutes, with the Democratic leader or his \ndesignee in control of the first 30 minutes and the majority leader or \nhis designee in control of the final 30 minutes. I further ask consent \nthat the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. for the weekly \nparty luncheons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4100-5", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Tomorrow, following morning business, the majority \nleader will seek consent to begin consideration of calendar No. 472, S. \n2290, the asbestos litigation bill. If we are unable to begin \nconsideration of that measure, the majority leader is expected to move \nto proceed to the bill. Additional Senators have indicated their desire \nto speak on the bill during tomorrow's session. Unfortunately, if we \nare unable to begin consideration of the asbestos bill, we will be \nunable to begin the amendment process. Therefore, it appears unlikely \nthat any rollcall votes will occur tomorrow. Members will be notified \nwhen the first vote is scheduled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/19/senate-section/article/S4100-6", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
