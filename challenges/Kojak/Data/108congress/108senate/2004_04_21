Today the Republican side will control the first 30 \nminutes, to be followed by 30 minutes under the control of the other \nside of the aisle.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume the motion to \nproceed to the asbestos bill. During the last 2 days Senators came to \nthe floor and engaged in debate on the asbestos issue. I appreciate \nthat. However, we should now proceed to the bill itself in order to \nwork through various issues.\n  Last night, in order to move forward with the bill, I filed a cloture \nmotion on the motion to proceed. That cloture vote will occur tomorrow. \nAgain, this procedural vote is to allow us to begin the process of \ndeliberating and deciding on the issues surrounding the issue of \nasbestos. It is a beginning of the process. Therefore, I hope cloture \nwill indeed be invoked tomorrow morning.\n  In addition, Senators Kyl and Feinstein have been discussing the \nvictims' rights constitutional amendment which is on the calendar. My \nhope is to consider that legislation following the asbestos bill. There \nwas an objection to beginning that bill as well, and it became \nnecessary to file a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to that \njoint resolution. Depending on the outcome of the asbestos cloture \nvote, the cloture vote on the victims' rights amendment may also occur \ntomorrow.\n  On both of these matters, the Senate should be able to deliberate on \nthe underlying issues, and ultimately the Senate should work its will \non each of these bills. We will continue to press for consideration of \nthe asbestos legislation and the victims' rights amendment this week in \norder for the Senate to ultimately vote on these two important pieces \nof legislation.\n  The leadership, Republican and Democratic, will continue to discuss \namong themselves the asbestos bill and the best way to proceed over the \nnext several days.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4171-6", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will take my leader time to comment on \nthe privilege I had last week of spending some time with hundreds of \nSouth Dakota Guard members and their families.\n  I wanted to say a few words today about the selfless and courageous \nsacrifice of the South Dakota Guard and, indeed, all of our soldiers \nwho are placing their lives on the line so that the\n\n[[Page S4172]]\n\nchildren of Iraq can inherit a nation safer, stronger, and freer than \nthat of their parents.\n  Too often, the contributions of our Guard members and reservists have \ngone unrecognized. But today, the brace soldiers in our Guard and \nReserve have become indispensable to protecting our national security.\n  With the end of the Cold War and the decision to draw down active \nduty forces, the Nation has dramatically increased its reliance on \nreservists. Guard and Reserve soldiers have been called up to active \nduty more frequently, and have been taken away from their families and \ncommunities for longer periods of time, than perhaps at any other time \nin our history. As a result, the line between active and reserve duty \nhas become blurred.\n  The service of the South Dakota National Guard and Reserve provides a \nperfect illustration. Two-thirds of South Dakota's National Guard \nmembers have been called up since September 11. On a per capita basis, \nSouth Dakota has had more of its Guard members activated than any other \nState. These call-ups have fallen heavily on South Dakota's Army Guard \nunits. According to Governor Michael Rounds, nearly 8 of every 10 South \nDakota Army Guard members have already been called up for active duty.\n  The South Dakota National Guard has six units and 1,200 soldiers in \nthe Iraq theater, including the 740th Transportation Company, the 842nd \nEngineer Company, the 2nd Battalion of the 147th Field Artillery, the \n153rd Engineer Battalion, the 1742nd Transportation Company, and the \n216th Engineer Detachment. These soldiers have the gratitude and \nadmiration of our State and our Nation.\n  Late last week, we were reminded of the dangers they face each and \nevery day. As I noted on the floor Monday, Army Specialist Dennis \nMorgan, a member of the South Dakota National Guard, was one of the 12 \nAmerican soldiers killed in Iraq this past weekend. Specialist Morgan \nwas the sixth South Dakota soldier to die in this war, and the first \nmember of the South Dakota National Guard. While South Dakotans' \nthoughts and prayers are with Specialist Morgan's family and, indeed, \nthe families of all of those who have lost loved ones in Iraq, we also \npray for the safety of the soldiers who remain in Iraq.\n\n  Two South Dakota units have received the most public attention as of \nlate--the 740th Transportation Company of Milbank and Brookings and the \n842nd Engineer Company of Spearfish, Belle Fourche, and Sturgis.\n  Unfortunately for the soldiers of these units and their families, the \nreason these units are in the news is not a happy one. Last week, \nnearly 300 soldiers from the 740th Transportation Company and the 842nd \nEngineer Company learned that they would not be coming home when they \ncomplete their year-long tour of duty.\n  According to Jay Brozik, husband of 1LT Sally Brozik who serves in \nthe 740th, members of this unit had been informed they would be heading \nhome soon. Their personal belongings had been packed for the trip home. \nThe troops had completed the medical briefing required prior to leaving \nthe Iraq theater. Their equipment had been transferred to a replacement \nunit. Their families were eagerly awaiting a joyous return.\n  All that came to a crashing halt late last week, when the Department \nof Defense announced that the tours of duty for this unit had been \nextended at least three months longer than promised.\n  The story is similar for the 842nd Engineering Company and about \n20,000 other active and reserve troops who were in formed that the \nadministration had broken its commitment of one-year, ``boots on the \nground'' in Iraq.\n  Although I am confident all involved will continue to serve their \ncountry in the same exemplary fashion they have to date, the \nadministration's decision was difficult to bear for the soldiers and \nfamilies involved. In the words of Spearfish Mayor Jerry Krambeck, ``I \ndon't know what I can say without putting tears in my eyes. All I can \ndo is continue as we are and continue to support the families even more \nat this point.''\n  Jay Brozick said, ``I was thinking my wife would be back for our \nson's birthday, May 4. Now it's changed everything.'' And Ryan Lovrien \nspoke of his girlfriend, SGT April Semmler of the 740th: ``[April] had \nmentioned hoping after a year to be home and spend time with the family \nin the summertime and just be out of there. Now they're going to do \nthree or four months.''\n\n  Mr. President, the cost of failure in Iraq is beyond comprehension. \nGiven the stakes involved for the people of Iraq, the region, and the \nworld, we have no choice but to maintain our commitment and do all we \ncan to bring about a safe, secure, and democratic Iraq. But we do face \na choice about how we fulfill this commitment.\n  I urge the President to redouble his efforts to expand the \ninternational presence on the ground. We have the finest forces in the \nworld. Breaking our commitment to these forces is not only unfair, it \nis shortsighted. Already we see soldiers re-enlisting at lower rates \nthan in the past. Considering that the demands placed on our already \noverextended forces are unlikely to fall in the future, failure to at \nleast sustain current force levels would undermine our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, I know the Senate joins me in commending the service \nof the men and women in the South Dakota Guard and indeed all of our \ntroops involved in the current conflict in Iraq. I particularly want to \nexpress my appreciation for the sacrifices made by the troops of the \n740th and the 842nd and their families. They came when they were \ncalled, performed as requested, and, under any circumstances, will \ncontinue to perform magnificently.\n  But the burden should be shared--so that we can sustain our current \nforces and give those who've already sacrificed so much a well-deserved \nrest.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4172-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in October of 2001, the Senate passed \nthe PATRIOT Act by a near unanimous vote of 98 to 1. The PATRIOT Act \nhas been a vital tool in our ongoing efforts to prevent future attacks \nof terrorism against Americans at home. Terrorist cells across the \ncountry have been broken up from Buffalo, to Detroit, to Seattle, to \nPortland. Over 300 criminal charges have been brought. Over 515 \nindividuals linked to the 9/11 investigation have been deported. \nHundreds more suspected terrorists have been identified and tracked \nthroughout our country. It is no wonder, then, that the biggest hero to \nemerge from the hearings before the 9/11 Commission has been the \nPATRIOT Act. Witnesses from both the Clinton and Bush administrations, \nand from both political parties, have praised its efficacy in fighting \nthe war on terror.\n  Unfortunately, we are in the middle of an election year and some \nWashington politicians would rather demagog the PATRIOT Act and the \nAttorney General for his use of it. For example, the junior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts voted for the act. But since becoming his party's \npresumptive nominee, he has taken an entirely different\n\n[[Page S4173]]\n\ntack. For example, last month, he said: It is time to end the era of \nJohn Ashcroft. That starts with replacing the PATRIOT Act with a new \nlaw that protects our people and our liberties at the same time.\n  It is quite puzzling how Senator Kerry and his Democratic colleagues \nwho voted for the PATRIOT Act can now do an about-face and raise such \nserious questions about its effects on civil liberties. It is even more \npuzzling to make such charges in light of how instrumental the PATRIOT \nAct has been in safeguarding Americans, and in the absence of evidence \nthat the PATRIOT Act is being misused.\n  Sixteen key provisions of the act will expire on December 31 of next \nyear. It is crucial that law enforcement not be deprived of these \ntools. While I cannot prevent election year politics, I can try to \ndisabuse my colleagues of erroneous assumptions about some of these \nprovisions.\n\n  Let's take a look at section 201 of the act. That section allows law \nenforcement to use existing electronic surveillance authorities to \ninvestigate certain crimes that terrorists are likely to commit.\n  Now, the myth about section 201 is as follows: Some contend that the \nGovernment already has the authority to investigate cases of suspected \nterrorism and, therefore, section 201 is completely overkill. But the \nfact is, before section 201 of the PATRIOT Act, law enforcement had the \nauthority to conduct some electronic surveillance when investigating \nordinary nonterrorism crimes. But law enforcement could not use \nwiretaps to investigate all of the crimes that terrorists will commit.\n  Now, as an illustration of this odd dichotomy, law enforcement could \nuse wiretaps to investigate mail fraud but not for chemical weapons \noffenses or cases involving the use of a dirty bomb or cases involving \nkilling Americans abroad or cases of terrorism financing. Let's go over \nthat one more time. Law enforcement could use wiretaps to investigate \nmail fraud but not for chemical weapons offenses or offenses related to \ndirty bombs, killing Americans overseas, or terrorism financing. That \nis an absurd position for the law to be in.\n  So it seems to me that if law enforcement can use a wiretap to bust \nup a failed mail-in sweepstakes ring, it should be able to use wiretaps \nto stop the use of a dirty bomb.\n  Let's make one final point about section 201. To obtain a wiretap \nunder this section, all the preexisting safeguards for wiretaps must be \ncomplied with, including establishing probable cause before an \nimpartial Federal judge and getting that judge to sign off on the use \nof a wiretap.\n  Another section that has been misunderstood is section 206. This \nprovision allows roving wiretaps in national security investigations. \nBut it only allows them when the FISA court finds that a suspect may \nthwart surveillance. In a roving wiretap, the tap attaches to a suspect \nrather than to a device so that the suspect cannot defeat surveillance \nsimply by changing cell phones, for example. The myth is that section \n206 is a broad expansion of power without privacy protections.\n  But the facts are that those assertions are incorrect. For over a \nquarter of a century, law enforcement has used roving wiretaps to solve \nordinary crimes such as drug offenses. How can that be terribly \nexpansive, to allow in national security matters what has been \noccurring in ordinary criminal matters for 25 years?\n\n  Second, as I said, a roving wiretap can only be obtained after a \ncourt finds that a suspect might thwart surveillance. A number of \ncourts, including at least three circuit courts, have ruled that roving \nwiretaps are perfectly consistent--perfectly consistent--with the \nfourth amendment. So it is pretty clear that privacy protections are \nnot being eviscerated.\n  In sum, we should renew the parts of the PATRIOT Act that will \nexpire. We should not take away from law enforcement needed weapons in \nthe war against terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4173-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4173-S4175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE 9/11 COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of observations \nrelated to the proceedings of the 9/11 Commission, which have been in \nthe news recently.\n  Specifically, I am troubled by the partisanship that some \nCommissioners have displayed, such as by cross-examining public \nofficials as if they were common criminals.\n  I am not the only one who is troubled by the proceedings. Former \nNational Security Adviser under President Clinton, Tony Lake, has said \nthat the hearings are ``a sad spectacle that has become so partisan.'' \nThat is the National Security Adviser under President Clinton.\n  Max Holland, a former fellow at the University of Virginia who is \nwriting a history of the Warren Commission, notes that, ``in some \nrespects,'' the proceedings of the Commission are ``definitely a new \nlow.'' He added that ``this is a commission charged with establishing \nfacts and the truth rather than posturing for political gain. But some \nof the hearings amounted to lecturing and posturing.''\n  Still others, such as Professor Juliette Kayyem of the Harvard's \nKennedy School of Government who served on a congressional terrorism \npanel to investigate the 1998 African embassy bombings, have questioned \nwhy 9/11 Commission members have granted so many interviews. She notes \nthat ``they have become too public'' and that ``tempts Commissioners \ninto making assessments and conclusions prematurely,'' she suggests.\n  My understanding of the 9/11 Commission was that it was to \nimpartially determine the facts and make nonpartisan recommendations on \nhow to move forward. I am trying to be fairminded and positive about \nthis, and I hope the Commission holds to its mission. I think it has \nstrayed somewhat off into the political arena. It has received, I \nthink, justified criticism for so doing. They still have an opportunity \nto move back in the direction they know and we know they should go and \nproduce a report that we will all feel will pass the smell test and \nstick to the goal we all thought the 9/11 Commission had in the first \nplace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico. Does the \nSenator yield time to himself under the standing order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not hear the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator yield time under the \nexisting order for allocation of time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I understood I was going to speak next. How much \ntime do I have?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There are 20 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I followed with interest the media comments and \npartisan criticism of the President in light of testimony from a \nvariety of individuals before the 9/11 Commission. I find the criticism \nalmost laughable, in some cases. Here is what I gather is the essence \nof the criticism prior to the attacks on 9/11:\n  One, President Bush didn't care about terrorism, didn't care about it \nenough, but if he did, he didn't want to know about it.\n  Second, President Bush didn't know about terrorism, but if he knew, \nhe didn't know enough to do anything.\n  Third, President Bush didn't do anything about terrorism, but if he \ndid, it wasn't enough.\n  Finally, President Bush and the agencies of Government knew about the \npending attacks on September 11, 2001, but didn't do anything about it.\n  Or President Bush and the agencies of Government didn't know in \nadvance about terrorism plans for September 11, but they should have.\n  Just laying out this summary of the charges shows the contradictory, \nalmost ludicrous nature of these attacks. How outrageously partisan \nthis all has become.\n  Let me talk a minute about the way I see it.\n  First, let's for a minute assume that 9/11 did not occur. Remember, I \nam going to talk for a minute about the President, America, and the \nCongress as if 9/11 did not occur.\n  Mr. President, 9/11 did not occur, but the President got a report \nfrom the CIA, FBI, NSA, and others, telling him al-Qaida was getting \nanxious, they were a little bit worried about things; the group is \nmoving around a little bit too much; they may be thinking about \nattacking America. But no 9/11 has\n\n[[Page S4174]]\n\never occurred for my hypothesis about how I see it.\n  The President says: In light of this report, we better get ready and \nwe better take this issue to the American people. So the President gets \nready, and he makes a speech to the American people. There has been no \n9/11, so he cannot talk about that.\n  He gets up and says: Things are a little dangerous. Al-Qaida is \nmoving around too much. I am a little worried about America, so I think \nwe ought to do something about it.\n  No 9/11 has ever occurred.\n  The President says to the American people: I want to set up a \ndepartment, and I want 45,000 people hired so we can check on everybody \nwho gets on an airplane in the United States.\n  Mr. President, 45,000 people and everybody who gets on an airplane in \nAmerica is going to be checked is the first request.\n  The second request: The PATRIOT Act--which has been discussed this \nmorning--I need that, I want that, says the President.\n  Third, I need a homeland security agency. It will be big because this \nis a big problem, says he; $26 billion will be put into one agency so \nthey can work on homeland security.\n  Can we imagine the President of the United States taking that to the \nAmerican people if we did not have 9/11? I can imagine it. In fact, I \ncould ask the American people, What do you think would have happened? \nYou know what they would say? Nothing would have happened. They would \nhave laughed at the President. They would have said: Who does he think \nhe is. He wants to search everybody who is getting on an airplane? He \nwants this new extraordinary power, some say, under the PATRIOT Act. He \nwants this new department.\n  Do you know what we would have said in the Senate: You will never get \nthat, Mr. President. Who do you think you are, a dictator? You want to \ncheck everybody who gets on an airplane in the United States? Never \nheard of such a thing. That is the truth of the matter. That is what \nwould have happened. He would have gotten nothing. I just do not \nbelieve that this Congress, especially with the attitude I am seeing \nnow--which is totally obstructionist, a minority but a large minority \nis trying to stop everything--can you imagine what they would have done \nif the President of the United States, without 9/11, would have \nrequested all these items? I cannot.\n  The point I am trying to make is, it is rather absurd to talk about \nwhich week did the President know, how much did he know, should he have \nknown more; if he knew more, shouldn't he have done more? I have \nalready gone through those, but I go through them again because, as a \nmatter of fact, had he known a little more, had he known it sooner, had \nhe had more reports from the CIA, nothing would have happened in terms \nof changing our laws.\n  I am going to carp on one of them. Can you imagine Congress giving \nthe President of the United States the authority to check everybody who \ngets on an airplane in the United States because he had some reports \nshowing that al-Qaida was dangerous, al-Qaida might be looking at some \nactivity in the United States? Of course not. Anybody who believes we \nwould have done that for this President or any President is just not \nfacing reality.\n  As a matter of fact, it is my honest belief that if we did not have \n9/11, we would have passed none--not one or two--none of the \nextraordinary measures that were passed because of 9/11.\n  It seems to me that for people to now run around and wonder and \nspeculate about whether the President knew enough, whether he should \nhave known more because if he did he could have gotten all these things \nthat we are talking about, that is an absolute absurdity.\n  Remember, we had a Senator from the State of Georgia. Remember what \nhe did on the Senate floor? He resisted homeland security. He resisted \nit on the basis that he was not sure whether they should put unions in \nas a mandatory notion with reference to those people who were going to \nbe part of this new agency of our Government. He lost an election on \nthe basis that he favored unions over the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We then got a sufficient vote to pass it. It was that tough, \neven after 9/11.\n  I close by repeating that this Senator does not believe it is \npossible that we would have passed this legislation that everybody is \nsaying the President should have worked on, he should have done more \non, he should have worked on this, he should have gotten America more \nprepared, when as a matter of fact this Senate would probably have done \nnothing had we not had 9/11.\n  So is it not ludicrous, is it not rather outrageous that we are \nspending time trying to figure out if he knew, when did he know, he \nshould have known more, when the facts are that it would not have made \nany difference because we would not have done anything? We would not \nhave done anything unless and until al-Qaida had attacked the United \nStates.\n  If anybody would like to argue that point, I would be delighted. Does \nanybody believe we would have said we are going to check every American \nwho gets on an airplane if we had not had 9/11? Imagine what they would \nhave called the President. They would have called him every name under \nthe Sun and probably would have ended up asking, Who does he think he \nis, a dictator? He wants to take over the airlines and inspect every \nAmerican? Americans would be saying to their Congressmen, Do not let \nhim do that. It is crazy that they are going to search us before we get \non an airplane.\n  The point is, there is no question that we acted after 9/11. The \nPresident acted after 9/11. Whether he did something before 9/11 or not \nseems to me to border--as a question, it seems to be one that we know \nthe answer to. Even if he knew more, even if he knew sooner, we would \nhave done nothing.\n  So why is so much being made about that period of time and talking \nabout the 1 or 2 weeks and was there a breakdown in communication or \nnot? Look, we all understand we were not on a war footing. We did not \nget there until we had been attacked. I do not think America would have \ngotten ready before the attacks. Maybe after this al-Qaida attack we \nmight, but, frankly, I believe any President, and in particular this \none, would have been attacked viciously had he been talking about \nsearching every citizen, every person, who was planning to go on an \nairplane, or if he would have said, I want to amend the rules and I \nwant to call it the PATRIOT Act and we are going to have a lot more \nauthority to track people, to listen to their conversations, and do the \nkinds of things the PATRIOT Act provides.\n  So it seems to me we ought to get on with the report and a study that \nsays how were we deficient--not whether this President knew, when did \nhe know, what did he do--with reference to our laws, our rules, and our \nability to do something about a terrorist attack.\n  I am sorry to say we did what we did only because we got attacked. \nBut we would not have done it otherwise. Whatever the President knew or \ndid not know or whenever he knew it, we would not have responded with \nthe kinds of things we ultimately responded with. Some of them took a \nlittle longer than one might expect, but nonetheless the truth of the \nmatter is we do not need a group of partisans to take over that \nCommission that was appointed in honesty and with earnest intentions. \nWe do not need a commission spending all of its time trying to get to \nthe President politically about what he did or did not do, when he did \nit, when he should have, when if we looked inward we would say, Well, \nCongress most probably would have done nothing had we not had 9/11.\n  I hope the Commission thinks about that when they are writing their \nreport. I hope they think about the reality of preparing ourselves for \nterrorism. I believe, as I have said this morning, we would have done \nnothing had we not had 9/11. I do not think any President would have \nsucceeded in getting anything done if we did not have 9/11.\n\n  It would be interesting for the Commission to look at the matter that \nway, to look at it from the standpoint of what would have happened, \nwhat could we have done, what is the reality of getting anything done \nprior to 9/11 actually happening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the majority's time is \nreserved.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S4175]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator's very \neloquent and well-prepared speech of the problems that occurred prior \nto 9/11. We all understand and know how bad they were.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4175-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4175-S4178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise to speak about an issue that has been with us \nfor a long time and for which we have had responsibility and have done \na pretty good job at making sure everything would turn out all right. I \nwant to talk about clean air, the environment, and areas where we have \nmade tremendous progress.\n  As we mark Earth Day tomorrow, rather than celebrating the \nenvironmental legacy, I am afraid we are fighting harder than ever to \nprotect our progress. Since the day he came into office, President Bush \nhas worked to gut more than 34 years of hard work by weakening many of \nour Nation's standing environmental laws, some of which were signed \ninto law by his father.\n  Air pollution is causing 70,000 premature deaths a year in the United \nStates. Yet this Bush administration has proposed one of the biggest \nrollbacks of the Clean Air Act in history. Science tells us more than \n600,000 women and children are at risk from mercury contamination. Yet \nthis Bush administration has proposed to violate a legal requirement to \nreduce mercury emissions from powerplants.\n  As we approach another summer, 40 percent of the U.S. rivers and \nlakes remain too polluted for fishing or swimming. In spite of this \nfact this Bush administration has proposed fewer bodies of water to be \nprotected by the Clean Air Act. Toxic waste sites continue to be added \nto the Superfund while the Bush administration continues to cut funding \nfor the program and refuses to reauthorize the ``polluter pays'' law.\n\n  The Earth continues to warm and this Bush administration refuses to \nact to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. This Bush administration \nhas a growing credibility gap, maybe even a credibility chasm, on \nenvironmental policy. The President has lost the trust of the American \npeople when it comes to the environment.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I believe we have an obligation to maintain and enforce the \nenvironmental laws already on the books and also to strengthen them. \nUnfortunately, our President is moving us backward instead of leading \nus forward. I hope we can once again celebrate Earth Day by showing \nmore respect for our environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am proud to be here with my friend and \ncolleague Senator Jeffords, who is the ranking member on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee on which I serve. His leadership \nhas been extraordinary on a whole range of issues, as has been his \ndedication to the environment, to protecting people and their \nenvironment.\n  When we hear protection of the environment, some people think of \nwildlife, which is true, and fisheries, which is true, and forests. It \nis all true. It is all about preserving these things--first of all, \nbecause they are God's gift to us and that is our moral obligation, but \nit also protects the people of our country because we know when species \nget endangered, we know when oceans get polluted, we know when we lose \nthe wetlands, we know when the air is smoggy, it hurts the people we \nrepresent--particularly the children, who are the most vulnerable, the \npeople who are ill, and the elderly.\n  If we take our position seriously, what could be more fundamental \nthan protecting our people? Protecting the environment is protecting \nour people. It is what we must do. It is the moral thing to do.\n  I say to my friend Senator Jeffords--and I see my colleague Senator \nReid of Nevada has come to the floor. I serve with both of them on that \ncommittee. It is a joy to be on that committee--we have a lot of work \nto do. We know Earth Day is a time for us to reflect on what our work \nshould be. Gaylord Nelson and Denis Hayes founded Earth Day in 1970 to \nensure environmental protection would be a major national issue. It has \nbeen. Tomorrow is the 34th anniversary of Earth Day.\n  One thing I find when I go home is people are so--I don't like to use \nthis word, but it is true--they are disgusted with partisanship. They \nhave had it with partisanship. They want us to work together. On what \nbetter issue could we work together than a clean and healthy \nenvironment? Whether you are a Democrat or Republican or whatever, you \nstill have to breathe the air; you still have to drink the water; you \nstill want to take your family to the beach or to the park. It is our \njob to protect the environment so you can do that.\n\n  We know this issue has been very much a bipartisan issue. When I \nthink back, what comes to mind is President Nixon founded the EPA. We \nlook at each President and we see progress has been made across party \nlines. Yet with this Presidency--and I think Senator Jeffords has \ntouched on it and it has to be very painful for him to touch on it--we \nsee a reversal of years of bipartisan progress. I want to get into \nthat.\n  In today's paper there is a big story. The U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy has given its preliminary report on the state of our oceans. \nHappily, they gave us a blueprint for a new, comprehensive, national \nocean policy. This happens to be a Presidentially-appointed commission \ncomposed of academics, naval officers, and members of the business \ncommunity. This group, appointed by our President, is telling us our \noceans are in crisis and we need to take action now if we are to \nreverse declines. The Commission stated we need to start taking an \necosystem-based management approach to protect our oceans and marine \nspecies. That means we need to look at the whole environment of the \nocean and not take small steps, but make sure we have policies that \nprotect the entire ocean.\n  We need to improve the governance of our oceans by strengthening and \ncoordinating decisionmaking. The Commission highlighted the need for \ngreater Federal investment in ocean research and exploration for better \nscientific information.\n  I am someone who has worked for a long time to stop oil drilling off \nthe coast of California because that is a precious environment we must \nprotect, and it is an economic asset as it is. I am someone who wrote \nthe tuna labeling bill which turned out, happily, to save tens of \nthousands of dolphins every year. I so welcome this report. I call on \nthe President to embrace the findings of this report. I call on the \nPresident to work with us and let us know how he wants to implement \nthis report.\n  I hope I am wrong in what I am about to say, but given the history of \nthis administration I am very worried we will not hear much from the \nPresident about steps he is going to take with us to invest in our \nenvironment, to make sure America is the model for the world when it \ncomes to protecting its natural resources.\n  Half a billion people participate in Earth Day campaigns every year, \nhalf a billion people across this world. I urge the President to take a \nlook at this report, to step out on Earth Day and say I embrace this \nand we are going to work together to protect the oceans. While he is at \nit, I think Earth Day would be a perfect day for him to say he has seen \nthe light and he is going to reverse all of the environmental rollbacks \nhe is perpetrating on the American people.\n  I have a scroll I cannot bring into the Senate Chamber because there \nare rules against bringing the scroll in. When I unroll that scroll--\nand it goes out 30 feet--we see the more than 350 laws and regulations \nthat have been rolled back unilaterally by this administration. No one \nhas been immune from these attacks: not children with asthma, not \ncommunities faced with toxic waste sites, not parents who worry about \nwhat comes out of their faucets.\n  I couldn't possibly go through every rollback. I don't have enough \ntime in the day. But what I want to give a sense of is what these \nrollbacks look like when they are written down, so I do have a whole \nseries of charts. It is very hard to read, I know. Each one has a date. \nIt starts January 20, 2001,\n  When the White House Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, issued the memo to \nall Federal agencies ordering the 60-day suspension of all rules \nfinalized by the Clinton administration, including numerous important \nregulations to protect the environment and public\n\n[[Page S4176]]\n\nhealth, that is how they started. It was barely a day that they were in \noffice. It started then--unrelenting--the same day the administration \nheld up rules announced by the EPA to minimize raw sewage discharges \nand to require those discharges be placed in the public record so that \nthe public was notified.\n  To give you a sense of it, last year alone there were 40,000 \ndischarges of untreated sewage carrying bacteria, viruses, and fecal \nmatter into basements, streets, playgrounds, and waterways across the \ncountry.\n  My God, who would ever want to stop a rule that said you need to \nnotify the public and minimize raw sewage into people's basements?\n  Earth Day is coming. What are we doing here?\n  That is just the first two on the list.\n  On February 12, just a couple weeks after he was inaugurated, the \nDepartment of Energy delayed implementation of a new energy-efficient \nstandard for residential and commercial appliances and equipment.\n  Again, I come from a State that has an electricity crisis. The best \nway to deal with it is to make sure we conserve as much as we can. Why \nwould anyone think it is in the public interest not to move ahead with \nthose standards?\n  This goes on. Here I go. I just landed on this one, August 8, 2001: \nIn a reversal of President Bush's Earth Day pledge to preserve \nwetlands, the Corps of Engineers proposed relaxing a series of rules \ndesigned to protect streams and other wetlands. The Forest Service \ngranted authority to review road building and timber sale prices, \nremoving protections for the most pristine and largest roadless \nnational forests.\n  We have national forests. We protected them. And the administration \nwants to go and build roads in these most precious areas.\n  It goes on. December 2001, Interior Secretary Norton reverses her \nagency's denial of a Canadian company's proposal to locate a major open \npit gold mine in an area of the Southern California desert that is of \ngreat cultural and religious importance. Former Interior Secretary \nBabbitt denied it because of the devastating impact it would have had \non the resources of this site.\n  Wasn't that a cyanide mine? They used cyanide on a beautiful precious \narea that is a religious holy site.\n  My eyes are just landing on different items here.\n  December 14, right before Christmas, 2001, the Department of Energy \nsays the Government no longer must prove the Yucca Mountain's \nunderground rock formations would leak radioactive contamination into \nthe environment.\n  Can you imagine dumping radioactive waste and not making sure that it \nwouldn't leak into the environment? What are they doing over there? It \nis shocking, absolutely shocking.\n  This upcoming Earth Day is a chance for the President to embrace his \nown ocean commission's recommendations and then to step to the plate \nand reverse some of these.\n  Here are some more: January 2002 through May 2002. President Bush \nreleases the fiscal year 2003 Federal budget that eliminates the EPA's \nbudget for graduate student research in the environmental sciences. \nFunding for the EPA's Star Grant Program, which provides highly \nmotivated doctoral students with 3 years of funding to do environmental \nresearch, amounts to a little more than one-tenth of 1 percent of the \nEPA's budget.\n\n  Here is a program where young people who are dedicated to the \nenvironment can continue their education. Oh, no. This is something \nthat is going to be cut from the budget.\n  May 10, 2002, EPA documents reveal that the Federal Office of Surface \nMining is pushing to halt reforms that would ensure coal companies have \nplans to restore mining development before they can obtain mountain top \nremoval permits.\n  Here is a coal mine that wants to go on the top of the mountain. And \nwe always said you have to have a plan for how you are going to restore \nthe mountaintop. They say it is OK; go ahead, destroy the mountains; we \nreally do not care.\n  How could people understand all of this that is going on?\n  I am just picking a few.\n  Let us look at another chart. All of this is on the scroll.\n  The Bush anti-environmental record, May 2002 through August 2002: \nThis is something Senator Jeffords talked about.\n  An Assistant Secretary at the Commerce Department testified that the \nBush administration needs between 2 and 5 years to develop a national \nstrategy to minimize global warming, and they will seek volunteer \nreductions instead of mandatory emission reductions.\n  The announcement came despite recent civilian employee reports \nconfirming what most scientists have long believed--greenhouse gases \ngenerated by human activity are a major cause of climate change.\n  The Commerce Department says, Well, even though the scientists say \nthis is global warming--and we have had hearings that show that slopes \nwhere people go skiing may not be there in the near future--they are \njust going to take their time about it and they are not going to \nrequire companies to clean up their act. They are going to use \nvoluntary methods. This is just one more example. It goes on and on.\n  Here is August 2002 through December 2002. Can you imagine all of \nthese rollbacks by one administration? It is shocking. Any one of \nthese, I say, deserve days of discussions because of their \nramifications.\n  Here is one, September 7, 2002: An investigation reveals that under \nthe Bush administration the number of EPA personnel assigned to enforce \nair quality laws has fallen by 12 percent, the lowest level on record. \nIn addition, the number of EPA civil enforcement employees also has \nbeen cut in the past year by 5.7 percent.\n  What does that mean? It means the people who are enforcing the laws \nwe pass are being laid off or transferred out. The polluters understand \nit. They are not dumb; they know. If they are not being watched, they \nare not going to live up to their obligations.\n  It is a reversal of years of bipartisan progress. That is what hurts \nso much.\n  As I listened to my friend, Senator Jeffords, who made a very \nheartfelt decision to become an independent, one of the reasons he \ndecided was the environment and that he was perplexed and discouraged \nand dismayed at what had happened to his party--his former party. I \nunderstand why he is perplexed.\n  We just looked at some of these. Let us go ahead. This doesn't stop. \nIt goes on and on.\n  Here is 2002 through July 2003. The administration has reversed a \nFederal policy that protects public lands while Federal land managers \nare assessing possible designations of wilderness areas.\n  Let me explain that. In the past, if someplace is under consideration \nfor wilderness designation, you don't go in there with mining companies \nand drills. You don't go in there and destroy it while the land is \nunder consideration for wilderness designation. Once you destroy the \nwilderness, this pristine gift from God, it is gone. Never before have \nwe seen where you go in there and disturb these beautiful areas. But \nthat is what they do.\n\n  Here is one, June 6, clean water: The EPA has racked up an abysmal \nrecord of enforcing Federal water pollution standards, according to its \nown study. In the broadest effort to date to document the failure of \nthe EPA and State to enforce the 30-year-old Clean Water Act, the \nAgency's Office of Enforcement and Compliance found that at one time \nroughly 25 percent of all large industrial plants and water treatment \nfacilities were in violation of Federal law, and in all but a handful \nof cases EPA failed to take action against the polluters.\n  The Clean Water Act is 30 years old, and now we are not enforcing it. \nThe first Clean Water Act was passed under Harry Truman. It has been \namended since then.\n  We have the Clean Water Act and they decided not to enforce it.\n  Here is one, March 19, 2004: The Federal Government has issued its \nfirst-ever warning that certain people should limit their consumption \nof canned albacore white tuna due to a risk of mercury poisoning. Under \nnew guidelines issued by the U.S. FDA and EPA, pregnant and nursing \nwomen and young children should eat no more than 6 ounces of white tuna \nper week. According to experts on the FDA advisory panel, the \nrecommendations do\n\n[[Page S4177]]\n\nnot reflect the groups' view that children and pregnant women should \ncompletely eliminate albacore tuna from their diets and eat \nsignificantly less chunk light tuna than the Government suggests.\n  Vas Aposhian, a toxicology professor at the University of Arizona, \nresigned from the panel after the FDA did not heed its warnings.\n  Mercury is a serious problem, and Senator Jeffords has been a leader \non that. Even though we know how harmful it is, they have even tried to \ndownplay the impact of mercury on women and children.\n  This will complete more than 350 rollbacks. This is where we are as \nwe approach this Earth Day.\n  I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for illuminating, pointing out all \nof the problems created by this administration. As we go forward, the \nchallenge we now have is to make sure no more occur.\n  Many Members on both sides of the aisle are deeply concerned about \nwhat is happening to our environment on this Earth Day. We know that \nall Members have to continue to alert this Nation of what the policies \nare doing to this Nation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for his comments. He is right.\n  My goodness, at the minimum, we should do no harm. In other words, \nlet's do no harm. We should do a lot more. We should clean up. We \nshould do better. We should set ourselves a standard of achievement on \nthe environment so that areas get cleaner and the water gets purer. At \nthe minimum, we have to stop bad things from happening.\n  As we look at more than 350 rollbacks made by this administration, \ngoing around the Congress, going through the executive branch by \nExecutive order, and rules and interpretations, I tell you who has been \nprotecting the people. The only way the people have been protected from \nsome of these things is the courts. We are winning some of these \nbattles in the courts.\n\n  Speaking of the courts, we are still fighting with the Bush-Cheney \nadministration over the Vice President's desire to keep secret who sat \nin on his meetings as he put together the energy policies for this \ncountry which, as my friend knows, very much weigh heavily on the state \nof the environment, particularly the quality of the air.\n  I will be calling on the Vice President, and I might as well start \nnow, to cease and desist in these lawsuits and turn over the records of \nwho was in those meetings. Why should the Vice President not want to \nreveal this? Instead, it has taken years and thousands of hours of \nattorneys' time that the taxpayers are paying for, to keep all this \nsecret.\n  I say to my friend, this is an open government, by and for the \npeople. I don't see any reason why the Vice President needs to keep all \nof this secret. That is another issue on which we will be working.\n  I wish to talk about the Superfund. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and fifteen seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will conclude, and I assume my friend would like to \nspeak again.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would like to add that we have both witnessed all \nthis. I don't know how the Senator feels, but I feel perhaps I have not \ndone as much as I could have, as much as I would like to do.\n  We have to work together to make sure this terrible onslaught of \ndestroying our environmental laws stops. And I know the Senator joins \nme in that pledge. And that we will do what we can to not get weaker \nbut hopefully get stronger.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, those words mean a lot to me. With \nall the other issues we face, and we face some very harsh issues, not \nthe least of which is that this month alone I have lost 45 people in \nIraq who either were from California or based in California--that \nweighs heavy on my heart--we have to do it all. There are no excuses.\n  This is only one environment. It is hard to bring it back when you \ndestroy it.\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Would that be 5 minutes for each side?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, despite all of our other pressures, we have to \nbecome tougher, stronger. We have to do everything we can.\n  I try to give out the Toxic Trophy Awards every time one of these \nthings happens to try to draw attention to what is going on.\n  I return to my Earth Day comments and the Superfund Program. One in \nevery four Americans, 70 million people, including 10 million children, \nlives within 4 miles of a Superfund site as we sit here today.\n  During its tenure in office, this administration has cut cleanups of \nthose sites from 87 per year to 40 per year while refusing to fully \nfund the program.\n  Superfund is experiencing a funding shortfall of up to $800 million. \nThis President Bush is the first President in history to oppose the \n``polluter pays'' fee. His dad supported it, Ronald Reagan supported \nit, and Bill Clinton supported it. This was a consensus until now.\n  What does it mean when you do not have the polluter fee? It means the \ntaxpayers, not the polluters, pay for the cleanup.\n  I will show how many Superfund sites we have in the United States: \n1,239. As this chart shows, the sites are in almost every single \nState. Maybe a State or two escapes, but not many.\n\n  In 1995, polluters contributed 82 percent to the Superfund trust \nfund. As of October 1, 2003, the trust fund had no money collected from \npolluters. This means we will never be able to clean up the most \nhazardous wastesites. Do you know what has happened to this budget. \nWhen the keys were handed over in the Oval Office from Bill Clinton to \nGeorge Bush, he had a surplus as far as the eye could see. It has been \nreckless over there. We now have deficits as far as the eye can see. It \nis a very anxious time in our country. Is this the time to now say to \npolluters, ``Don't worry, you don't need to pay a fee. We have enough \nmoney in the tax coffers to cover your problems?''\n  We all love to tell people, ``You don't have to pay taxes.'' That is \nthe greatest thing for any of us to do. But of all the times to tell \npolluters, ``You don't have to clean up your room anymore,'' this is \nnot the time.\n  My mother taught me: If you make a mess, you clean it up. I find \nmyself quoting my mother more and more the older I get. She said other \nthings like: Don't go where you're not wanted. She said a lot of smart \nthings to me that I hold close to my heart. One thing is: Clean up your \nmess. She was talking about me when I was a kid in my room. I am \ntalking about polluters, the messes they have made.\n  So where are we now? We are in a situation where we have reduced the \ncleanups. Let's look at it graphically on this chart. Through 2005, we \nare going to see 40, if we are lucky--and no money. And when Bill \nClinton took office, the cleanups increased. But George Bush has \nradically decreased the pace of cleanup from former administrations, \nthat is for sure. He has not gotten back to this level as shown on the \nchart.\n  But look at where we are now. Whether you look at the Superfund \nsites, whether you look at air pollution, whether you look at safe \ndrinking water, whether you look at mercury, whether you look at global \nwarming, whether you look at deep cuts in enforcement, whether you look \nat perchlorate, which they refuse to set a standard for, whether you \nlook at the changes of the Sierra Nevada framework, we are hurting the \nenvironment and the people of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield the floor and hope all of us can \nwork together on this Earth Day to change things around here.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair notify this Senator as to how\n\n[[Page S4178]]\n\nmuch time is left on both sides for morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Democratic side, the time has expired. \nOn the Republican side, the time is 5 minutes 45 seconds, and counting.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Chair, I will just wait until we get to the \nmotion to proceed. I assume, because I certainly cannot yield back the \nRepublican time. It is my understanding the Presiding Officer wishes to \nspeak at some time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer was going to speak if \nsomebody was going to relieve him.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to relieve the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I appreciate the offer, but I will continue to \npreside until our time runs out.\n  Mr. REID. I will just let the time wind down then, and we will get to \nthe bill in 5 minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President. I understand the \ntime would run evenly, but if we have no time left, it would just run; \nis that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I withhold that. Probably it would be best \nto ask unanimous consent that the Republican time be reserved and I be \nallowed to speak for whatever time I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If the majority wants more time, consent could be easily \nobtained.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4178-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4178-S4181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GASOLINE PRICES\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to talk about gasoline prices in the \ncountry and in Nevada. This is a terribly difficult situation. It is a \nstory about the wild west, but it is not about Wild Bill Hickock or \ncowboys or mining or claim jumping. It is about gasoline. Some refer to \nit as black oil.\n  This chart illustrates how the gasoline prices in Nevada have \nskyrocketed. The prices are as of April 5. Prices now are at least 5 \ncents higher. I was in Nevada last week. Gas prices were approaching \n$2.50 a gallon in some locations. This has been a burden on the people \nof Nevada and visitors who come there. The average price on January 5 \nof this year in Nevada was $1.64 a gallon, which was pretty high \ncompared to the rest of the country. But now it is much higher. This \nchart, as I have indicated, is as of April 5. We have had an increase \nin the State of Nevada of about 50 cents a gallon. We can't keep up \nwith the increases in the price with our charts.\n  This is outrageous. Let me put it into perspective. In a truly \nbipartisan spirit, the Senate passed a $318 billion highway bill. The \nbill would create at least 1 million jobs, rebuild and improve our \ntransportation system, and provide a tremendous boost to the economy. \nIn the House of Representatives, Chairman Young proposed a highway bill \nwith a price tag of $375 billion. The White House opposes Chairman \nYoung's proposal to add 5 cents in taxes to a gallon of gasoline and to \nindex future tax increases to inflation.\n  Meanwhile, the oil companies have gouged--I use that word purposely--\nconsumers by 10 times the amount of what Chairman Young proposed for an \nincrease in the tax, a half dollar a gallon.\n  This is ironic. The President doesn't want Americans to pay more at \nthe pump, does he? There is no way the administration can shake the \nmantle they have assumed of being close to the oil industry. Both the \nVice President and the President have been in the oil business. We have \nbeen litigating for 3 years whether the Vice President has to disclose \nwho he met with, when he met with them, and what he talked about; that \nis, the oil companies. He has fought this every step of the way. He has \nfought it through the court system. It is still going on.\n  Then there is the fact the President won't call upon Saudi Arabia to \nincrease their supply unless, according to Bob Woodward and his book, \nthe President makes a deal with Prince Bandar to do this in September \nwhen it would have more of an impact on the elections. Time will only \ntell. I would hope if they have made an arrangement with the Saudis, \nthey will start doing it now rather than wait until September.\n  Nevada gets all of its gasoline from California, so any problem with \nsupply in California is a problem for Nevada. There has been a lot of \ntalk and a lot written about the tight California gasoline market, \nwhere prices are typically 20 to 30 cents above the national average. \nWe hear about the lack of refineries. We hear about boutique fuels and \nreduced inventories contributing to higher prices. I am sure each one \nof these has some bearing on higher prices. All of these things I have \ntalked about need to be addressed.\n  I met with the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. There are \nreports there are as many as 300 separate boutique fuels. He thinks \nthere are around 100. But there are lots of them, and that could be a \nproblem. We realize the need to reduce the number of specialty fuels.\n  We also hear about supply and demand. One thing I have been pushing \nis something the first President Bush did and President Clinton did, \nand that is to release oil out of our petroleum reserve to bring up the \nsupply to reduce prices. I know the law of supply and demand cost \nNevada ratepayers nearly $1 billion during the western electricity \ncrisis 3 years ago. While Enron was reaping windfall profits--and there \nmust be a better name for that than windfall profits; it was even \nbigger than windfall profits--it told consumers it was all a matter of \nsupply and demand. But, of course, it turned out Enron was really \nmanipulating the supply. So it wasn't supply and demand.\n\n  Based on this bitter experience which is still being litigated in the \ncourts, I was concerned Nevadans might be getting ripped off again when \ngasoline prices went through the roof this year. I asked the Federal \nTrade Commission, along with Senator Ensign, to investigate these wild \nprice increases, particularly with an eye toward any possible \nmanipulation in gasoline markets. I needed to assure the citizens of \nNevada that gasoline markets were operating fairly and not being \nmanipulated to maximize the profits of oil companies.\n  It is easy for domestic oil companies to boost their profits by \nsqueezing the supply of gasoline. A combination of refinery capacity \nreductions and corporate mergers has concentrated control of prices in \nonly a handful of companies. Again, this chart shows how prices have \nrisen steadily in Nevada since the first of the year.\n  A major spike occurred in February 18, due to a power outage at the \nTesoro refinery in northern California that supplies 20 percent of the \nrefined gasoline to that region. In a matter of days, prices in Nevada \ntopped $2 a gallon. The refinery came back on line only a week later, \nand the supply was restored. But as the chart shows, prices at the pump \ndidn't recover. They had a power outage that slowed that refinery for a \nweek. Prices skyrocketed. The refinery came back on line. Prices stayed \nhigh. Actually, they went higher. Prices at the pump didn't recover. \nFamilies were still paying an extra half dollar a gallon every time \nthey filled their tanks.\n  So in case anyone is worried about the impact of a refinery shutdown \nat Tesoro, they can rest easy. Refiner margins of profits were 70 cents \nhigher a share this quarter; 60 percent higher than analysts had \nexpected. The stock at Tesoro is at a 52-week high.\n  Let me show another chart, the price of a gallon of gasoline in \nNevada. Here is where we arrived at $1.64. The bottom number is \nimportant: Crude oil price, 77 cents; refiner margin, that is cost plus \nprofits, at a quarter; dealer margin, 10 cents; taxes, 52 cents. That \nis the way it is. There's ample profit for the oil companies at $1.64. \nAnything above that is just additional profit.\n  In order to understand what drove gasoline prices in Nevada to record \nhighs and why they stayed high even after California refineries \ntemporarily reduced their wholesale price, we need to understand what \ngoes into the price we pay at the pump for a gallon of fuel. As \nindicated, this chart shows the price of a gallon of gasoline has four \nmain components: cost of crude oil; refiner's margin, which is cost \nplus profits; the dealer's margin, which is cost plus profit; and fuel \ntaxes, both Federal and State. We must pay attention to the word \n``profits.'' It figures big in this discussion.\n  The chart shows the typical numbers we have come to expect in the \nNevada\n\n[[Page S4179]]\n\ngasoline market. Crude oil, let's say 77 cents, or $32.34 a \nbarrel; refinery margin, 25 cents; dealer margin, 10 cents; and taxes, \n52 cents. These are prices we might expect, but they are already too \nhigh because of the extremely high price of crude oil.\n\n  Nevada's gas prices are the third highest in the Nation behind Hawaii \nand California. I am sure we are gaining on them. So these are locked \nin prices.\n  Let's go to chart 3, which shows that the latest Nevada gas price \nincreases are not caused by taxes or crude oil costs. Taxes are \nconstant. Crude oil varies only by a small margin. Crude oil used in \nCalifornia refineries is 64 percent from the Alaska North Slope. The \nmajority of our oil doesn't come from Saudi Arabia. So if you look at \nthe contribution of taxes and crude oil to the price of a gallon of \ngasoline in Nevada during the first 3 months of the year, taxes are \nconstant at 52 cents a gallon, so that does not contribute to a 46-cent \nincrease since the first of the year.\n  According to data supplied by the California Energy Commission, the \nprice of crude oil acquired by California refineries varied by only 8 \ncents over the first 3 months of the year, from 78 cents to 86 cents a \ngallon. That is equivalent to crude oil prices varying by about $3 per \nbarrel.\n  The reason that price doesn't vary much is the California refineries \nget 64 percent of their crude oil from the Alaska North Slope and the \nCalifornia fields. So they don't feel the full impact of the more \nvolatile OPEC or west Texas intermediate crude markets.\n  There is no doubt that the price of crude oil has contributed to \nhigher gasoline prices in Nevada and throughout the country in the last \nfew years. However, it is not the reason why west coast gas prices have \nskyrocketed in the first 3 months of the year.\n  If we subtract the 8-cent increase that can be attributed to crude \noil, we still have to explain a 38-cent increase in the price of gas. \nThe number I use is smaller than what the real price is in Nevada. \nThese are as of April 5. As I have indicated, they are at least a \nnickel higher now. That leaves us with dealer and refinery margins, or \nwhat is referred to as the domestic ``spread.''\n  (Mr. Ensign assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. I also alert the Presiding Officer that prior to the \nSenator from Nevada becoming the Presiding Officer, I mentioned his \nname regarding a meeting we had with the Chairman of the FTC.\n  I would like to go down to chart 4. It is easy to determine refiner \nmargins, which is simply refiner costs plus profits. You simply take \nthe published spot or wholesale price of gasoline and subtract the \nprice of crude oil. I have chosen the spot price in Los Angeles because \nL.A. supplies the Las Vegas market.\n  Bear in mind that the cost of refining oil into gasoline will vary by \nonly a few cents. Like taxes, it is pretty much a fixed cost. \nConsequently, any increase in the refiner margin is actually an \nincrease in profits.\n  The April 5 Oil Price Information Newsletter, a publisher of industry \ndata, says California fuel blends averaged $10.80 a barrel over crude \nduring the decade.\n  That is a historical refiner margin of 26 cents for every gallon of \ngas.\n  So this chart shows that the refiner profits have recently peaked \nnearly 50 cents above that historical level.\n  These estimates are conservative. They are actually lower than the \nestimates of the California Energy Commission.\n  Can you imagine these profits? Take the normal profit that a refiner \nmakes on a gallon of gas; now add another half dollar to every single \ngallon. Nevadans use 2.3 million gallons of fuel a day. Area-wise, it \nis a very big State. Many people have to drive long distances to get to \ntheir jobs--I will read letters indicating that is the case--or they \ntake their kids to school.\n\n  When you figure the refiners are making an extra 50 cents of profit \non every gallon of gasoline purchased in Nevada, Nevadans alone are \npaying an extra $1.15 million every single day, or almost $35 million a \nmonth--$35 million a month just in the State of Nevada. If \n``outrageous'' is not a strong enough term, I don't know what term to \nuse. If this isn't price gouging, it doesn't exist anyplace in the \nworld.\n  I am for free markets. But it is not a free, competitive market when \nrefiners can exercise this degree of control and manipulation over the \nsupply and the cost of something that is not a luxury but a necessity \non which every family must depend.\n  People have to put fuel in their vehicles. They have no choice. Is \nthe California-Nevada gasoline market truly competitive when the \nwholesale price of refined gasoline is largely controlled by what a few \nrefiners are willing to sell for and what the markets are forced to \npay?\n  It looks to me as if the market has been manipulated and consumers \nhave been gouged. If you think the worst is over, think again. The spot \nand refiner profits increased again in early April.\n  Mr. President, my information, from which I prepared these remarks, \nand this chart, go back to April 5. It is now the 21st and prices are \nhigher. I returned, as I have indicated earlier, from Nevada and prices \nthere are approaching $2.50 a gallon for some fuels.\n  Let me go to another chart. This will detail and outline refiner \nprofits. I believe this chart will clearly show that refiner profits \ndrove gas prices in Nevada to $2 a gallon. On this chart, I am simply \nadding the refiner margin data. It is clear that prices in Nevada were \ndriven to $2 a gallon on a wave of refiner profits. Keep in mind, $2 a \ngallon doesn't do the trick anymore. If this chart were as of today, we \nwould be up here, the next line on the chart. But we will use this \nchart for illustrative purposes.\n  It wasn't taxes; those don't change. It wasn't the cost of crude; \nthat only went up 8 cents a gallon. It had to be refiner profits. There \nis nothing left.\n  There is the one last question to be answered: Why have prices \nremained high, even as refiner profits returned to more normal levels \nduring the first couple weeks of March? Refiner profits dropped a full \n30 cents. Why no relief at the pump?\n  That brings us to the dealer margin, the fourth and final component \nthat determines the price of gasoline.\n  This last chart I wish to talk about shows that dealer profits added \nto refiner profits led to a sustained $2.10 per gallon at Nevada pumps. \nAgain, dealer profits added to refiner profits led to a sustained $2.10 \nper gallon at Nevada pumps. The historic margin is 35 cents. Again, I \nrepeat, they are even higher now by as much as 4 or 5 cents a gallon \nthan they were before. So it is very clear what this shows. Dealer \nmargin is the cost to acquire, store, and sell gasoline, plus profits. \nThis chart shows that dealer margin takes a beating when the refiner \nrapidly increases spot or the wholesale price of gasoline. The dealer \nneeds to pay up front to acquire fuel before the gasoline makes it to \nthe marketplace.\n  Once this gasoline is distributed, dealer profits increase \ndramatically and sustain the price of gasoline at the pump. During \nMarch, dealer profits rose to 35 to 40 cents a gallon in Nevada. That \nis two or three times the historic levels of 10 to 15 cents a gallon.\n  The combined total of refiner and dealer profits has kept the price \nof gasoline in Nevada at an astronomical level.\n  If the wholesale price stays down long enough, the hope is that both \ndealer and refiner profits will retreat to more normal levels. That is \nnot the case, unfortunately.\n  Refiner profits are spiking again, and we can expect another round of \nsustained high gas prices.\n  Make no mistake, this is a win-win deal for refiners and dealers. In \nthe gasoline business, they say prices shoot up like a rocket and float \ndown like a feather. This is the dynamic that keeps the price of \ngasoline high, and enables refiners and dealers to gouge consumers.\n  Let me show you what is on the next chart. I want to be able to show \nthat Nevada gasoline prices are clearly driven by refiner and dealer \nprofits.\n  This bar chart summarizes the four components of the price of \ngasoline in Nevada during the first 3 months of the year--a gallon of \ngasoline would be more specific. It shows that dealer and refiner \nprofits increased the price of gasoline in Nevada from $1.64 to $2.10 \nper gallon since the first of the year.\n  With the recent increase in the spot price in early April, we can \nexpect a new round of increases in refiner and dealer profits. The \nroller coaster ride\n\n[[Page S4180]]\n\nof gas prices is becoming a ratchet, moving ever higher, threatening \nthe fragile budgets of working families.\n  We picked out a few letters I received in my office. I will read only \na few of them. Here is one:\n\n       I filled up my gas tank today and prices were $2.18 per \n     gallon for the mid-grade fuel. This is just not acceptable \n     any longer. I am a single 58 year old female who is working \n     for ridiculously low wages at UNLV and living on extremely \n     limited budget. Between the cost of medications, heat, \n     communications, and other living expenses, now I can't afford \n     to even get to work. Please, please, please do something to \n     stop this now. A constituent from Las Vegas.\n\n  I am going to read part of another letter, but it is sad, to say the \nleast:\n\n       Senator Reid: I have had to cut my grocery budget by $100 \n     per month, and we're already eating cereal for dinner, 28 \n     cent macaroni and cheese, and hot dogs. We also eat hamburger \n     when we can afford it. It cuts into the lunches I have to \n     provide for my children since no school lunch program exists \n     at Virginia City, and I need to insure that my daughter has a \n     decent lunch . . . in her lunch pail.\n\n  This is the same person:\n\n       There is something very wrong with our system when our \n     President fails to act on behalf of the American people. \n     Protecting us against terrorism is only part of the job. When \n     he fails to act changing the entire American way of freedom, \n     choice, and an affordable living, then he's not doing his \n     job. Somebody needs to get off their duff and do something \n     about the gas prices, production, and our being held hostage \n     by OPEC and the Oil Companies. . . .Do something to help us, \n     so that single parents like me don't have to put our \n     children's lives and futures at risk by having to move closer \n     to our jobs and all because of gas prices.\n\n  This is signed by a constituent from Dayton, NV.\n  Another letter:\n\n       This is about gas prices. Is there anyway that you can work \n     a little faster on this? My husband works at Primm, and it \n     costs us now $100 a week in gas. We were trying to save $20 a \n     week since he got a pay raise. We have a family of 5 and he \n     is the only worker. We are in debt because they don't give a \n     lot in pay raises, and when they do, it seems like the phone \n     company, electric, gas, and anyone else says ``we need extra \n     money.'' You give them all that they need, but the poor \n     people trying to make it on 1 income or even 2 are getting \n     screwed. We watch every penny and it seems to be gone. We are \n     having to make a hard choice of what not to buy at the store. \n     We already don't go out to the movies or anywhere else. I can \n     see why President Bush doesn't do anything about the gas \n     prices, since he has an interest in his cut. Thank you for \n     your time. A constituent from Las Vegas.\n\n  Another constituent from Las Vegas:\n\n       Thank you so much for looking into the gas price increase. \n     This has been a very big concern for my husband and myself. \n     We are a large family and my husband works out at one of the \n     state prisons. This means a 120 mile round trip every day. . \n     . .If gas prices increase like they are this is going to hurt \n     our family a great deal. It in turn could hurt our state as \n     he is a 13 year state employee, this could mean looking for \n     another job in town. I do hope and pray you are able to help \n     our state with this crisis.\n\n  Another letter:\n\n       Dear Senator Reid: I currently reside in Las Vegas, NV. I \n     am disabled and live on a fixed income. I am writing you \n     today outraged by the ever growing cost of living we face \n     here in Las Vegas. Every day the price of gasoline continues \n     to rise, while large oil companies like Exxon Mobile and \n     Chevron Texaco are recording breaking profits, I hate to \n     say on the backs of the average citizens in this country. \n     I have heard all of the stories of fuel shortage due to \n     the harsh winter in the eastern United States, the \n     blockage of shipping lanes, and the list could go on and \n     on with excuses. This still does not explain these record \n     profits. No other segment in our economy, especially the \n     small businessmen, experience this rate of profit. Costs \n     continue to rise from gasoline, to utility cost, to \n     grocery bills, while incomes are not rising. The middle \n     class is slowly being eroded with all these rising costs.\n\n  Signed by a constituent from Las Vegas.\n  This is a small smattering of the letters we have received. I have \nasked, along with the junior Senator from Nevada, the Federal Trade \nCommission to look into possible market manipulation and price gouging. \nAfter 5 weeks, the FTC responded to us by saying prices in Nevada were \n``unusually high'' and above predicted norms. An informal FTC \ninvestigation is still looking into the cause of the price spike, but \nthey are having a hard time showing collusion and market manipulation.\n  I do not need an investigation to tell me big oil profits have soared \nat the expense of working families. We all understand the forces of \nsupply and demand, but in the gasoline market, control of the supply is \nconcentrated in a handful of oil companies and dealers. Seven oil \ncompanies control 94 percent of California's gasoline production, so \nthey can push prices up faster and keep them higher than they would be \nin a competitive market.\n  These markets are not competitive because they provide no incentive \nto refiners to maintain adequate supplies and physical infrastructure. \nEvery accident, power outage, pipeline break in the market triggers a \nprice shock, and profits mount.\n  The structure of this industry allows price manipulation at the pump. \nThese charts show how refiners and dealers manipulate markets to \nsustain high, exorbitant gas prices. If this is not anticompetitive, it \nis certainly anticonsumer. The profits of oil companies are at record \nlevels. I am sure this makes their shareholders happy.\n  The FTC has been AWOL, like FERC was a couple years ago during the \nelectricity crisis when consumers were ripped off. As a nation, we need \nto demand both the supply and demand of this equation to promote a \ntruly competitive market.\n  On the demand side, we have to increase the fuel efficiency of cars. \nThat is very long term. We need to promote public transit. That is long \nterm. But in the short term, we need to have this administration weigh \nin against the OPEC nations and do what they can do to have the OPEC \nnations produce more oil. They have turned the spigots down. They have \ndone it openly. I hope the reports in the Woodward book are false. I \nhope the President would not enter into a deal with Prince Bandar in \nsaying we are going to increase the supply of oil in the fall. I hope \nthat is absolutely false. But I do say the President has to exert more \npressure on our so-called allies to produce more oil. That is short \nterm.\n  What also needs to be done on a short-term basis is we need to start \nreleasing oil from our oil reserves. As I stated before, it was done by \nthe first President Bush and it was done by President Clinton. This \nPresident needs to do the same.\n  In the long term, we need to increase the use of alternative fuels \nand renewable energy resources, but we must also provide for true \ncompetition in the oil and gas markets.\n  Oil companies have little incentive to build or improve their \ninfrastructure and increase their inventories. They can simply dominate \ntight markets where any disruption allows their profits to soar.\n  Through use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or some other \nmechanism, oil companies should be required to maintain adequate stocks \nof crude and refined product to prevent price spirals.\n  At the very least, we should not be filling the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve when markets are not able to meet consumer demand at reasonable \nprice levels. Any rapid price increase should draw immediate and \nintense public scrutiny and trigger investigations.\n  Energy in America is essential to the well-being of our Nation and \nits citizens. This is part of our Nation's security, to have adequate \nenergy. Remember, the United States of America, even counting what may \nbe in ANWR, would only have 3 percent--in fact, it is less than 3 \npercent--of the oil reserves of the world. We cannot produce our way \nout of our problems. Ninety-seven percent of the oil in the world is \nsomeplace other than the United States.\n  The citizens of the State of Nevada have been rocked with a one-two \npunch over the last couple of years by manipulation of the electricity \nmarket and now the gasoline market.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \ncourtesy and his previous offer to let me speak. I am glad to have this \nopportunity to talk about a number of things that have come up today. \nWe have talked a little bit about the war in Iraq. We have talked a \nlittle bit about the environment because Earth Day is tomorrow. We have \ntalked a little bit about overtime and we have talked a lot about \nenergy. I am going to cover those topics as well as some other things \nthat need to be known.\n  I am going to start with the war in Iraq because last week I had the \nopportunity to go with Senator Sessions and Senator Chambliss to visit \nNATO and then to go into Germany and to visit with some of the troops \nthat have been wounded in Iraq. Some of them have been wounded very \nseverely. In fact, those who are not severely wounded do not leave \nIraq. There are hospitals in Iraq that take care of them and then get \nthem back into the fray. Those who have been injured worse are flown to \nLandstuhl Hospital in Germany where they are stabilized, treated, and \nthen sent back to the United States for more treatment.\n  The three of us had an opportunity to visit that hospital. We split \nup into three groups so we could talk to more of the soldiers. We \nthought we would be able to perhaps pump them up a little bit after \nwhat they had been through. Quite the reverse happened. They pumped us \nup. It was a tremendous experience.\n  These people, men and women, to a person said: We are making a \ndifference in Iraq. We know the people over there, we know our job, we \nare doing our job, the people are responding to what we are doing, and \nwe are making a difference.\n\n  The other side is so worried that they are bringing in people to take \nus on. Every one of them wanted to be patched up as fast as possible \nand go back to help their buddies. They knew what the job was. They \nknew the people there. It was tremendously inspirational.\n  The next day we went to an Army training base that a lot of U.S. \nsoldiers in the past had been assigned to and are still assigned to, \nbut they have been moved to Iraq. They have been assigned to Iraq and \nthey had just been on another overseas assignment, had been back about \n8 months and were assigned to Iraq. Some of the spouses there had had \nhusbands extended in Iraq. We wanted to find out what they were \nfeeling, what they were thinking. It was a chance to visit with them, \nand so we did.\n  Again, we were the ones who were encouraged. I remember one of the \nspouses explaining that part of the job of a soldier is to watch the \nback of his buddy, and when some of the troops are pulled out \nprematurely there is nobody to watch somebody's back. Then the lady \nsaid: If my husband was the one who had to stay and somebody got pulled \nout, I would not be able to take it. So if my husband is the one who \nhas to stay to protect somebody else, that is their job. That is what I \nwant him to do. That is what he needs to do. That is what will make the \ndifference.\n  What I noticed at both of those meetings was that other countries of \nthe world say the reason we are the most powerful country in the world \nis because of the money we spend on being powerful. Some people would \nsay it is because of the technology we have developed that makes us \nmore equipped with more advanced things than any other country in the \nworld. Both of those play a small role, but what makes the difference \nbetween the United States and the other countries is the people of this \ncountry, the young men and women who are serving in our Armed Forces--\ntheir dedication, their innovation, their ability to think, their \nability to react, and their patriotism.\n  Then we have another secret weapon, and that secret weapon is the \nspouses and the families who are praying for and supporting the troops. \nThat is a force other countries cannot reckon with, and we should be so \nappreciative.\n  I want to mention one other thing that might seem unusual. When we \nwere meeting with one of the generals, the general prayed. Now, I am \nnot sure that is acceptable under the Constitution as it might be \ninterpreted by some judges, but he prayed. He knows that will make a \ndifference.\n  One of the things that occurred to me while he was doing that is we \noften almost always remember to pray for our troops, but I think we \nprobably ought to be praying for the opposition as well. We ought to be \npraying for the opposition to soften their hearts, for the opposition \nto realize what is happening in the world and the role they are \nplaying. Praying can make a difference, and it is up to all of us to \ntry that, with faith, and see if it will not support these admirable \ntroops, their spouses, and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4181-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4181-S4182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I will switch to another topic now. Tomorrow is Earth Day \nand all of us are concerned about the future of the Earth. We are \nconcerned about the environment, and we are concerned about the \nactivities that happen in that environment. Earlier there was a comment \nabout wilderness areas and how wilderness study areas can be violated.\n  I need to address this wilderness study issue because Wyoming is the \nonly State in the Nation that negotiated its wilderness areas years \nago. We wanted to get that figured out. We wanted to protect vast \nareas, and we did. There is always the recommendation that there be \nadditional wilderness study areas, and we do not have any problem with \nthat, with a small caveat, and that is that the wilderness study areas \nare often areas that are being used as part of the economy of our \nState. They are already areas that have had development.\n  Do my colleagues know what happens when they go into a wilderness \nstudy area. They go into an indefinite period of being studied with \nnothing being allowed to happen on that land. The things that were \nalready happening cannot continue. It moves back to a primitive state, \nwith no activity, for an indefinite period of time.\n  There are some wilderness impact study areas that have been looked at \nfor 20 years. Do my colleagues not think a decision ought to be able to \nbe made in less than 20 years? There might even be some out there that \nare longer than that.\n  The fear of people whose economy relies on an area that they have \nalready been using is it will be designated a wilderness impact study \narea and they will lose their right to use it for what they have been \nearning their living at, for years, while it is not being studied. That \nis a crime.\n  Another problem we have is it is a big country and things tend to be \none size fits all. For instance, I just saw an ad in the paper asking \npeople to send money to help preserve wolves. It was a glorious ad. \nThat is what ads are. They are to sell people on doing things. But they \nonly tell one side of the story, and I hope before people send their \nmoney they will check with areas that are being impacted by a wolf \npopulation. It has a little bit to do with our Endangered Species Act.\n  The Endangered Species Act is a Federal policy. It has to be. This is \na vast country and we try to save things all over--and we need to. But \nit is an unfunded mandate for States, for counties, for towns, and \nparticularly for individuals. That is against the law, to put unfunded \nmandates on the States, the counties, and the people, but we do it with \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Right now, Wyoming's wolf program costs about $1.2 million a year. \nThat is coming out of the Wyoming pocket; that is not coming out of the \nFederal pocket. There are county expenses involved in it that are not \nbeing paid for by the Federal Government. There are individuals who can \nno longer use their land, they can't make the living on their land they \nwere making because of a Federal policy. Do we pay them anything for \nthat? No, we don't. We should. There are definitely laws about\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\ntakings, but the Endangered Species Act has not adjusted to that.\n  Just today, in the Wyoming media, there was an article about the \nfailure of the Feds to list the Colorado River cutthroat trout. So far \nnone of the cutthroat trout has been listed as endangered. We have been \ndoing a job in Wyoming of replacing them in traditional streams where \nthey have been. In fact, in Saratoga, WY, we killed off a huge brook \ntrout population and replaced it with cutthroat trout which were the \nnative trout of that area. The people were a little disturbed to find \nout that the Colorado cutthroat doesn't grow as big as the brook trout \nwhich they were used to fishing. The whole stream was poisoned out and \nthese other fish were put in, and they were prohibited from using any \nfish in this river for a number of years. Most of the people I know do \ncatch-and-release fishing, but there can be fish killed doing that. \nUnder the Endangered Species Act, that would result in Federal action \nagainst the fisherman.\n  I am hoping the fishermen of the country are paying attention, as \nthey are talking about listing some of these endangered species. The \nfishermen of this country have been doing a marvelous job of making \nsure species are preserved.\n  I will tell you an interesting little story. There is a fish hatchery \nnear Saratoga. It doesn't have brook trout or Colorado cutthroat trout \nin it; it has lake trout in it. How did they come to get in the lake \ntrout business in Wyoming? A number of years ago, some lake trout were \ncaught out of the Great Lakes. They were transported by rail to \nMontana. They were backpacked into Yellowstone and planted in a lake \nthere and they grew well. Eventually the lake trout in the Great Lakes \nhad a problem. They died off. Where did they go to replace them? We \nbuilt a hatchery in southern Wyoming. We caught lake trout out of \nYellowstone Park, put them in this hatchery, raised them to maturity \nand got eggs, grew some of those, took some back in the form of eggs \nand planted them in the Great Lakes. So the loop of preservation was \nprovided by the State of Wyoming.\n  That is the way species have to be provided for, not by prohibiting \nand stopping, through regulation, people from being able to use what \nthey have traditionally used. The fishermen are some of the people who \nare working to overcome this.\n  There is a little animal called the black-footed ferret. It was \nextinct. You would think that was supposed to mean there weren't any \naround. They found some in Wyoming. A little while after they \ndiscovered this animal still existed, they found out that a number of \nthem were being wiped out by a plague. The State of Wyoming went in and \ntrapped all of the rest of the black-footed ferret, and the State of \nWyoming built a special facility to raise them and try to get as much \ncross development as possible. Today the black-footed ferret has been \nplanted back in rural areas of the western United States. It has made a \nhuge difference. But that was all done at Wyoming expense; that was not \ndone at Federal expense. Something needs to be done about the \nEndangered Species Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4182-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4182-S4183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about energy. We \nhave regulated ourselves out of business. We have regulated ourselves \nto higher prices. We have regulated ourselves so the source of our oil \nis in the Middle East.\n  In 1973 we had a crisis. Senator Hansen was the Senator from Wyoming \nwho held this seat. I had him speak to a Wyoming Jaycees session about \nwhat was happening when we got cut off from oil in the Middle East. \nBeginning then, Senators were saying we needed to do something so we \nwould never have an oil crisis again, that we could not be dependent on \nthe Middle East.\n  I think we were at 35 percent use from the Middle East at that time. \nWe are now at 60 percent use from the Middle East. They hold us in the \npalm of their hand for our money. Our money is sponsoring whatever \nhappens in the Middle East. They don't base the price on true supply \nand demand. They control the price.\n  I once got to meet the fellow who determined how many barrels they \nought to ship, to raise the price or lower the price. Lower the price, \nyou say? Yes, lower the price. If you lower the price drastically you \ncan drive production in the United States out of business. They have \ndone it twice. They have driven it out of business. What happens when \nthe price shoots back up and we buy more oil from them? The U.S. \nproduction cannot recover because the people who used to be in that \nbusiness had to find other work. Finding trained people in that \nbusiness, to do what they had been doing, is impossible. That is how \nthe Middle East has manipulated us twice that I know of. I think they \ndo it, on a much more minute basis, on a regular basis now.\n  Earlier there were some numbers over there on a chart. It showed 77 \ncents as the cost of a gallon of crude oil. Then it showed manufacture, \nand it showed the filling station--manufacture at 25 cents, filling \nstation at 10 cents, and Federal taxes at 52 cents, which came to \n$1.64, which was listed as the fair price for a gallon of gas.\n  I love to get into the numbers because I am the only accountant in \nthe Senate. That is based, I guess, on 42 gallons of oil to the barrel. \nBut 42 gallons at the current price would be 88 cents a gallon, not 77 \ncents a gallon. But that is based on the whole 42 gallons being able to \nbe made into gasoline when in fact you end up with 19.4 gallons--yes, \nless than half of what was in that barrel actually is able to go into \nyour car gas tank. So instead of 88 cents--well, there are byproducts \nthey get to sell, too, and that is how they are able to hold it down, I \nguess.\n  I want to comment a little bit on the 25 cents, the 25 cents that \ngoes to the refiner. The 25 cents that goes to the refiner is not \nprofit. Boy, I bet they wish it were. The 10 cents that goes to the \nfilling station is not profit. That is the difference between what they \nbuy it for and what they sell it for. All of them have to provide \nemployees, they have to provide facilities, and they have to pay taxes. \nSo there are a lot of costs that go into it.\n  Particularly with the refinery again, we need to have regulations to \nmake sure we keep our environment clean, but we have to be sure what we \nare doing is what really needs to be done. Nobody is building a \nrefinery in this country anymore--nobody. In fact, we are reducing the \nnumber of refineries, which means we are reducing our capacity to \nprovide what needs to be provided, and at the same time we are saying \nthere have to be a whole bunch of different kinds of gasoline.\n  These gasolines are going to be designed which means they are more \ncomplicated for particular parts of the country. If you keep doing \nthat, you keep driving up the price. That is part of the 25 cents that \nthe refiner has to use. The more you increase the cost and reduce that \n25 cents, the less gas you are going to have in this country.\n  I was out in California a while ago. The Senator from California was \nmaking some of these speeches.\n  I have to say I don't think you have seen anything in the way of an \nenergy crisis yet, unless we can do something with an energy bill.\n  I was out in California. As you go from Las Vegas, you will see this \nreal dark cloud that appears. That is coming from California. When I \nwas there, I found that they have a pooling lane for high-occupancy \nvehicles. You need two people in the car to be a high-occupancy \nvehicle. I have never driven on a wide road like that in Wyoming, but \nout there they have five and six lanes. One of those lanes is saved for \npeople who carpool. I think it was rush hour. I can tell you that the \nother five lanes were jammed with traffic. They weren't going anywhere. \nMy wife and I in our car constituted the two and we could use the \npooling lane. We just zipped right through. It was absolutely amazing.\n  But I thought I must be seeing half of California's population \nstalled, creating pollution and not carpooling like they are suggesting \nthe rest of us ought to do.\n  There are some things that can be done, which need to be done and \nhopefully will be done.\n  But you haven't seen anything in the way of energy prices, if we \ndon't get a national energy policy and don't get some reliability as to \nwhat we have in the United States.\n  We have been touting natural gas as clean fuel, and it is. But there \nis only\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\none State that has an increase in the amount of natural gas it is \nproducing. That is Wyoming. The rest of them are declining.\n  Let us see what happens if the use slows up and the supply goes down. \nOh, the price goes up. You could be seeing the lowest prices in energy \nthat you are ever going to see if we could use some of that U.S. \ningenuity and figure out ways to make hydrogen out of the coal or other \nthings. But I do have a lot of faith in U.S. ingenuity, provided we \ndon't regulate them out of business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4183-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                OVERTIME\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

We don't see much of that in the \nGovernment, but the Department of Labor, under Secretary Chao, took a \nlook at what people have been saying and made corrections in the rule \nbefore the final rule was published.\n  She raised the amount to the maximum. We had already raised the \namount on the minimum. She made sure that first responders would not \nlose overtime; that nurses would not lose overtime; and that veterans \ntrained and going into the job force would not lose overtime.\n  I commend her for reading those 80,000 letters. I commend her and the \nDepartment for taking the corrective action. Doing the process makes a \ndifference. She did the process and she made sure they responded.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to inform the Senate of an \nundertaking that has, in my view, not received adequate attention in \nthe press or by the American public. This undertaking has required \ntremendous planning, and has been on a massive scale.\n   As the news from Iraq dominates our attention, an important and \nnotable success story has gone largely unnoticed. I refer to the \nmassive troop rotation in the Iraq theater that is now nearing \ncompletion by our Armed Forces. This is the largest U.S. troop rotation \nsince World War II--more than 250,000 U.S. service members have been \ninvolved.\n   Planning for this rotation of forces in Iraq has been underway for \nmany months. The meticulous quality of that planning, the absolute \nattention to detail by thousands of military planners, logisticians, \nand transportation specialists has resulted in a near flawless rotation \nof forces.\n   Consider for a moment the sheer size of the logistics effort \ninvolved in rotation over a quarter million combat troops, in \nmobilizing them, in transporting them by sea or air, supplying them, \nand in simply keeping them sheltered and fed. And now, consider doing \nall of that in a place that is nearly half a world away, and at the \nsame time, continuing the pace of military operations and combat in \nIraq, without skipping a beat.\n   New units began flowing into the region in December of last year, \nand to date, over 95 percent of the service members deploying to Iraq \nhave arrived in the region.\n   I would like the Senate to consider some of the facts and figures \nfor the deployment and redeployment, or return, of forces in that area.\n   Over 900,000 short tons of equipment and supplies have been shipped \nto support operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Over fifty-seven sealift ships have sailed, delivering more than \n426,000 short tons into theater, and 13 ships have returned 88,000 \nshort tons back stateside.\n  Nearly 3,000 airlift missions have been completed, and over 63,000 \nflight hours.\n  Ninety-seven thousand soldiers scheduled for redeployment have \nreturned home from Iraq.\n  Over 91,000 reserve component soldiers were mobilized for Operation \nIraqi Freedom 1, and over 54,000 for Operation Iraqi Freedom 2.\n  Last month I was privileged to travel to the Central Command Theater \nto see first hand the magnitude of this effort. I traveled with my good \nfriends the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and John Warner, \nand the senior Senator from South Carolina, Fritz Hollings. We saw our \nforces in Baghdad and in Balad, Iraq and traveled into Afghanistan to \nvisit our forces there.\n  I simply cannot say how absolutely impressed we were with the \nfighting spirit and combat power displayed by these young Americans.\n  We spent some time with the 1st Armored Division in Baghdad, and MG \nMartin Dempsey's absolutely impressive forces. General Dempsey's forces \nare providing stability and security in a dangerous part of Baghdad. \nThey know they have an important mission. You could see the dedication \nand courage in each of their faces. They know why they are there.\n  We also spent some time with Joint Task Force 180, in Baghram, \nAfghanistan. MG Lloyd Austin, a really impressive commander of the 10th \nMountain Division. His soldiers are pursuing Taliban and al-Qaida \nremnants in the mountains of Afghanistan. His forces, too, are \nremarkably bright and dedicated young men and women. Spending time with \nthem was inspiring to us all.\n  We had planned to visit the 1st Battalion of the 501st Parachute \nInfantry Regiment from Alaska. They are deployed to Khost, Aghnanistan, \nin the rough mountains near the Pakistan border.\n  Unfortunately, an aircraft malfunction required that we change \nplanes, and that delay meant we were unable to make that stop to see \nthose Alaskan forces. We are terribly proud of them and all of the \nforces there around the country in that area.\n  My friends and I also went to Kuwait and saw forces moving into and \nout of Iraq. Kuwait is where much of the logistics operation for the \ntroop rotation is based. The level of this effort is nothing short of \nremarkable to see.\n  In Kuwait, we visited with troops from the 4th Infantry Division, the \ndivision that captured Saddam Hussein, as they were moving home and \npreparing their gear for return. We visited with these troops at the \n``wash rack'' where each vehicle is cleaned from top to bottom before \nreturning home so there is no contamination from the wartime area.\n  It takes nearly 8 hours to fully clean a vehicle of all the dirt, \nsand and wear that accumulate. Dozens of these wash racks were \noperating day and night, \n24/7, until every last piece of gear is cleaned and ready to return \nhome.\n  Many of the division's vehicles were staged and lined up, ready to \nreturn home. That was truly a sight to see--rows of rows and rows of \nall types of military vehicles, scores of vehicles. I saw the \nremarkable size and scope of our logistics effort to rotate these \nforces in Iraq, and the magnitude of that effort is simply amazing.\n  General Robert Barrow, a former commandant of the Marine Corps, in \n1980 said: ``Amateurs talk about tactics, but professionals study \nlogistics.'' That statement has again been proven true by the nearly \nflawless rotation of U.S. forces in and out of Iraq. That rotation is \nnow nearly complete, and it is a remarkable achievement. This massive \nmovement of forces and equipment, the largest since World War II, has \nlargely gone unreported and little noticed by the American people. \nHowever, it is a true success story and one that needs to be told, and \nneeds to be told on the floor of the Senate.\n  This rotation of forces is an absolute testament to the will, \ndedication and commitment of our men and women in uniform. They are to \nbe commended for what they do for all Americans, and once again, they \nhave made us proud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I join the senior Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, in his excellent statement congratulating our\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nmilitary, our troops; specifically, the men and women who serve in Iraq \nand the extraordinary job they are doing there. This incredible \nrotation the Senator reflected on, the logistics being an exercise of \nextreme complexity, was accomplished with great professionalism.\n  His knowledge of this is unique and special, and we turn to him in \nthe Senate about military affairs. I join in the acknowledgment of what \nthe men and women of our services have done in this area. I thank the \nSenator for bringing it to our attention.\n  I rise briefly, however, to address the new regulations proposed \nrelative to white-collar overtime issues presented by the Department of \nLabor. We, as a Senate, have for literally months been hearing from the \nother side of the aisle that they wanted to stop the procedure of \nregulatory activity in this area; they wanted to foreshorten the proper \nand appropriate approach to governance; that is, to issue proposed \nregulations and take information and comment on the regulations and \nbring forward any sort of clarification of the law in the area of \novertime activity, of which the law has been on the books for 50 years.\n  Unfortunately, it has become confused and arcane in many ways. In \nfact, the law as presently structured was put together in a time when \nthis country had people who were called straw bosses, leg men, and \nkeypunch operators, things which no longer are relevant. Yet the law \nstill has these categories of individuals and their rating systems are \naffecting how overtime is paid.\n  It has become a fertile ground, regrettably, because of this \nconfusion. Because it is a law that has not been adequately reformed \nand kept up to date, it is a fertile ground for lawsuits.\n  The United States Bar Weekly, a lawyers' weekly USA newspaper \nheadline, summed up the salaries in the workplace across America by \nsaying in a headline: ``Boom In Overtime Suits, A Danger For Employers \nBut A `Gold Mine' For Plaintiffs' Lawyers.''\n  Unfortunately, that is all we have gotten from the regulation in the \nlast 2 years--lawsuits. We do not have a more efficient marketplace, or \npeople who deserve overtime getting overtime. We have not had a settled \nissue as to who has a right to overtime.\n  Secretary Chao said we should do something about this proposal. \nSecretary Chao stepped forward and said this is an issue, a problem, we \nneed to do something about. She put forth proposed regulations which I, \nas chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction, said there are some \nissues. We have questions. Let's look at them. That is why those \nproposed regulations received 80,000 comments. The Department has been \nreviewing those.\n  Again and again people have come to the Senate from the other side of \nthe aisle and used the excuse of trying to foreshorten and stop and \nundermine the process of regulatory reform and the comment period as a \nmeans to try to stop other legislation. How many pieces of legislation \nhave been held up interminably, and some simply not passed, because the \nother side of the aisle says we cannot have the proposed regulations \nout there; we have to stay with the law as it is.\n\n  Now it has shown the folks were absolutely wrong. The folks came to \nthe Senate and tried to use this proposed regulation as a stalking-\nhorse to obstruct other legislation on the floor. It was a stalking-\nhorse because the Department of Labor has come forward now with a new \nset of regulations which have grown out of and evolved out of the work \nthat was done as a result of reviewing and listening to the input from \nthe 80,000 comments.\n  The final set of regulations has some extremely good proposals. It \nguarantees 6.7 million Americans who today are not guaranteed overtime \nwill receive overtime. People up to $23,000 of income will receive \novertime. That is up from the present threshold today of $8,000. That \nmeans 6.7 million people who today are in a gray area are no longer in \na gray area and they will get overtime.\n  In addition, it makes unalterably clear this overtime regulation \napplies to white-collar areas. That was never an area for concern. \nPeople were concerned. The Department has made it clear the overtime of \ngroups such as first responders, nurses, veterans coming back from \nserving overseas, licensed practical nurses, and registered nurses \nwould be protected.\n  That was never the intent of the original regulations, I don't think. \nBut clearly, it is definitively addressed in this final rule.\n  Furthermore, the people whose overtime may be at risk have to have an \nearning that exceeds $100,000, and they have to be in a white-collar \nactivity, not a blue collar. If a blue-collar person happens to make \nmore than $100,000, their overtime stays in place. The overtime of a \nwhite-collar person making more than $100,000 may be impacted by this. \nThe Department estimates that is less than 120,000 people who may be \nimpacted by that part of the regulation.\n  In this final regulation, 6.7 million in the gray area will get \novertime who are not getting it. They may be getting it, but they do \nnot know they have a right. And people who are concerned about \novertime, working blue-collar jobs, or working in areas such as law \nenforcement and firefighting or nursing, will absolutely be assured of \ntheir overtime rights, although they probably were.\n  It means the business community, especially small businesses, will \nhave a clear understanding of who has the right to overtime and who \ndoes not have a right to overtime--not clear, but a clearer \nunderstanding of who does and does not have a right to overtime. That \nmeans instead of ending up with small businesses especially having to \nspend a lot of money defending lawsuits which are arbitrary in many \ncases and which are class action in other cases, they will be able to \nspend their money on creating new jobs.\n  Instead of having a litigious atmosphere out there, we will have an \natmosphere where people can understand what their responsibilities are \nto pay people. Those people who are receiving this overtime will \nbenefit significantly from this clarity, and other folks who will be \ngetting jobs as a result of businesses having money to invest, rather \nthan having to pay lawyers to defend these lawsuits. It is a step in \nthe right direction.\n  I believe that opposition today, should it still continue, can only \nbe defined as political. We know that opposition, in light of these \nregulations coming out in final form, was probably highly political \nbefore, but clearly in light of the definitiveness and the \nconstructiveness of the changes which have come forward with the final \nregulations, any additional opposition is partisan, political, and \ndriven by an election year attitude, or it is simply a desire to be a \nstalking-horse to promote lawsuits versus promoting efficient use of \nresources in our society, especially by small businesses.\n  I congratulate the Department of Labor for doing the job which they \nare paid to do, which is to try to make our laws more understandable \nand constructive. As a result, they have made a very strong step \nforward to assisting people in getting overtime who may not be getting \nit today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4184-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 2290, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (S. 2290) to create a fair \n     and efficient system to resolve claims of victims for bodily \n     injury caused by asbestos exposure, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, this is one of the most important bills \nin many decades because this bill will determine whether or not 8,400-\nplus companies go into bankruptcy, with a loss of jobs, pensions, and \nopportunities for people all over this country--and all because of an \nout-of-whack tort system that has been manipulated by some veracious \nlawyers who should know better but who are too addicted to being able \nto milk the system for billions and billions of dollars, $20 billion \nthus far in legal fees and transaction costs.\n\n[[Page S4185]]\n\n  Opponents of this bill continue to assert that the fund is nothing \nmore than a bailout of corporate America because it is not big enough. \nThere is one word for that: baloney. This charge, which the personal \ninjury lawyers keep repeating in television and print ads, completely \nbaffles me. Let me explain why.\n  Currently, estimates of what the existing tort system will pay to \nplaintiffs in the future range from $61 billion to $92 billion. That is \ncurrently. This is what the independent actuaries say is the amount of \nmoney the victims will actually receive under the current system.\n  Let me just point to this chart: the asbestos victims' compensation \nin billions of dollars. Under the tort system--the current out-of-whack \ntort system--you have three colors on the chart: dark blue, kind of \nlight blue, and yellow. The light blue illustrates the fees we pay to \nthe defense lawyers in these cases. The dark blue happens to consist of \nthe fees we pay to the trial lawyers--in other words, the plaintiffs' \nlawyer.\n  Between them, as you can see on that Tillinghast account, shown at \nthe top, you have $69 billion. How much goes to the victims? It is $61 \nbillion--if it is there, if these companies do not go bankrupt. Take \nthe Milliman one, shown down below: $61 billion to the personal injury \nlawyers, $42 billion to the defense lawyers. That is $103 billion. Only \n$92 billion goes to the victims. That is assuming these 8,400 companies \nhave not gone into bankruptcy. We have already had 70 companies go into \nbankruptcy.\n  But look what happens under the FAIR Act. The attorneys would still \nget a whopping $2.5 billion for what really amounts to rolling-off-a-\nlog type of a lawsuit because it would not take all the efforts they \nwould have to put in to make cases otherwise in court. They would get \n$2.5 billion. But $111.5 billion would go to the victims. It is pretty \nhard to say that is not a fair deal or that it is a bailout of \ncorporate America.\n  Now, our bill, in comparison to the $61 billion to $92 billion of \nthose two actuary accounts that will go to the plaintiffs, gets them \n$111.5 billion, which is a lot more than either of those estimates \nwere. This goes to the pockets of the injured persons.\n\n  So where does the rest of the expected cost of the tort system go? \nUnder the current system, it is going to lawyers. It is going to \nlawyers' fees and other litigation costs, with personal injury lawyers \nalone expected to garner $40 billion of these future expenses. In \naddition, 80 percent or more of claims filed in recent years are from \nindividuals who do not have a medically cognizable injury and are not \nimpaired in their daily routine. Let me put that in lay terms. They do \nnot have any injury that can be shown by the current medical analysis \nwe have in existence today, and it is the best in the history of the \nworld.\n  Indeed, one scholar estimated that meritless claims--claims without \nany merit at all--based on questionable ``diagnoses'' for mass \nscreenings have accounted for $28.5 billion in costs already. As a \nresult, the truly ill get even less than the $61 billion to $92 billion \nestimate that is suggested by these two studies.\n  Measured against the existing system, with all of its inequities and \nhigh transaction costs, the FAIR Act will deliver far more directly to \nvictims. Up to $124 billion will be available to compensate those who \nare sick from asbestos while still providing medical monitoring for \nthose at risk but not yet impaired--in other words, not yet sick, and \nwho may never get sick. This is a simplified, no-fault, nonadversarial \nsystem which will not require forking over 40 percent to 60 percent to \nany professional.\n  No matter how you look at it, victims get far more compensation under \nthis bill--and in a far more timely manner--than in the current system. \nThis alone indicates that the fund is big enough.\n  But let's look at it from another angle. Are the aggregate fund \ncontributions by companies and insurers expected to be less than they \nare paying in the current system? According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the answer is no. CBO estimates that defendants will have about \nthe same expenses in the current system for the next 5 years. This is \non page 20 of the CBO's October 2, 2003, cost estimate for this fund. \nOn the same page, CBO estimates, for the bill as reported from \ncommittee, that insurers would actually pay more to the fund in this \nsame period than they would under the current system.\n  Keep in mind, the current system is gouging billions of dollars for \nnonsick claimants. Look, this fund, No. 1, calls for about as much \nmoney as companies are paying now; No. 2, shifts this money to the \ntruly sick; and No. 3, reduces the transaction costs so more funds are \navailable to compensate injured parties. In other words, we help those \nwho deserve to be helped, where under the current system there are a \nlot of people sopping up the funds that are there who are not even \nsick, who have not suffered from sickness, and may never suffer from \nsickness.\n  This is a bailout? Give me a break. The chief benefit contributors \nget out of this deal is one thing, and that is predictability. They \nknow what their payments will be from year to year, and that is it.\n  I was told if I was able to get $108 billion a number of Democrats \nwould gladly sponsor and support this bill. I had indications from the \nunion movement: But, boy, if you got $108 billion on the table, we will \nbe there. They did not think we could get it done. But we did.\n\n  Now, despite all of these things I have been talking about, we have \nheard the argument that the money is not enough since S. 1125 was first \nintroduced in May of 2003 when industry agreed to a $94 billion fund. \nBefore introducing S. 1125, I had heard from the other side of the \naisle that $94 billion was not sufficient but that $108 billion might \nbe enough, as I have just said. I worked hard to get the business \ncommunity to commit to this funding, and, in the end, the Judiciary \nCommittee added a provision that would simply require $14 billion in \nadditional funds in order to reach this goal. The funds, however, were \nnot guaranteed in the committee-reported bill, as are those under S. \n2290.\n  During the committee process, this $14 billion was added to the \nsubstantial contributions required from both defendants and insurers. \nWhen S. 1125 was reported out of committee, therefore, it provided for \n$104 billion in mandatory funding from defendant companies and \ninsurers, plus an estimated $4 billion from bankruptcy trusts. The $108 \nbillion was there.\n  The committee voted by a 14-3 margin that the claim values which \nadded up to $108 billion--those values--were fair--14 to 3, with a \nnumber of Democrats voting with us. Not a single Democrat voted against \nthese claim values. The only ones who did were 3 Republicans, and they \nthought it was too much.\n  Now we are hearing that the total just is not high enough. If the \nvalues were good enough for every Democrat before, why not now? I just \ndo not get it.\n  By the way, let's go back just a step or two here. As shown on this \nchart, we are getting far more money to the sick and needy than the two \nexpert actuarial firms say will go to the sick and needy--far more \nmoney. Those who make arguments to the contrary are not being fair.\n\n  Later in the committee markup, to ensure the risk of insufficient \nfunding would not fall on claimants, an amendment was offered by \nSenators Kohl and Feinstein to provide a huge amount of open-ended, \ncontingent funding that could be available to pay claims, up to an \nadditional $31 billion over a nearly 20-year period. The number $31 \nbillion was not in the amendment, nor was the number $45 billion, which \nsome claim it was. The amendment simply called for maintaining the \ncontributions at the same level if such funds were needed to maintain \nsolvency, and this flat line happened to add up to $31 billion, since \nwe had already added $14 billion to the base funding. This meant when \nthe contingent funding was added to the $108 billion of mandatory \nfunding, up to $139 billion could come into the fund and ultimately out \nto the people.\n  Democrats and labor unions falsely continue to cite the $153 billion \nnumber whenever they can. I challenge any of them to show me that \nnumber in S. 1125, the committee-reported bill. Moreover, the $139 \nbillion was not hard money that would be going to claimants. That is a \nfact. It was not hard\n\n[[Page S4186]]\n\nmoney that would be going to claimants. The fund under S. 2290 would \nreach this same and substantial level of funding.\n  Further rendering this $139 billion obsolete is the fact a sunset \nprovision was added later in the markup. This provided an ultimate \nsafeguard, in the eyes of those who filed it, for fund solvency. Still \nfurther, we added in S. 2290 a measure which renders the contingent \nfunding amendment from the markup totally unnecessary--the ability for \nthe fund to borrow against 7 years of future revenue. With this \nprovision, the Feinstein-Kohl contingent funding measure is no longer \nneeded. Thus the whole premise for arguing more money is needed because \nthe committee bill had more money is literally destroyed. The \nFeinstein-Kohl amendment created what amounts to a rhetorical problem \non the total value of claims for some Democrats and some labor unions. \nBut it is only that, a rhetorical problem.\n  Claims values adding to $108 billion were good enough for almost all \nthe Democrats at the markup, and there is no reason the current $114 \nbillion now should be inadequate.\n  Finally, I will give another indication of why those who now argue \n$114 billion is not enough are being unfair, if not somewhat \ndisingenuous. Back on April 24, 2003, the AFL-CIO asked an investment \nbanking firm to run a financial model with certain claims values. How \nmuch did this model, which they shared with Republicans during \nnegotiations, add up to? Believe it or not, under the base case, it \nadded to $121 billion. You heard that correctly, $121 billion. We offer \na fund with a base of $114 billion in guaranteed money with a $10 \nbillion contingency, 7 times the borrowing authority, and a sunset back \nto the tort system, and there is no deal yet?\n  I said earlier, I don't get it. But I suspect the reason we are \nseeing retrenchment and revisionism is that--and there is simply no \ndelicate way to say this so I will be blunt--when personal injury \nlawyers put the screws on Democrats and labor unions, they are trying \nto stop this good bill at all costs. It is pretty apparent if you look \nat the flagrantly misleading ads they put on television, all paid for \nby the victims, by the way, through these exorbitant fees and \ntransaction costs.\n\n  I will tell you one thing, they don't want to kill the golden goose \nthat asbestos litigation is for them. They are only too happy to \ncollect the golden eggs, even though the people who are truly sick, \ntruly injured, will not get the money in many cases. In the end \nimposing financial obligations on the business community that are much \nmore than they would have to pay under the broken litigation system to \ncompensate victims would only risk bankrupting even more businesses and \nlosing more jobs and pensions. Already, as I have mentioned, more than \n70 companies have gone bankrupt due to asbestos litigation, and as many \nas 60,000 American jobs have been lost. It is estimated if this keeps \ngoing and we don't do what we should do here on this floor, there could \nbe as many as a half million jobs lost. I believe that is a low, \nconservative figure.\n  If most of these companies go into bankruptcy, I can't begin to tell \nyou what a detriment it will be to our country, let alone the sick and \nneedy who really deserve the moneys.\n  Rather than rely on their own numbers or provide a reasonable \nalternative, opponents of the bill falsely contend S. 1125 had provided \n$153 billion and, therefore, S. 2290 does not provide enough funding. \nOf course, litigating these cases in Federal court may be a big risk to \nsome personal injury lawyers who have successfully manipulated some \noutlier State courts to create a system of jackpot justice.\n  In reality, the Feinstein-Kohl amendment in committee, which \nintroduced the open-ended contingency funding, was designed to ensure \nthe fund established under the act did not become another Manville \ntrust, placing the risk of insufficient funding on future victims and \nleaving them with only pennies on the dollar. That is a risk which \nvictims will not face under S. 2290.\n  If, despite paying significantly more money than the current tort \nsystem, the fund is unable at any point to pay full value; that is, 100 \npercent on eligible claims, then the fund will sunset and the tort \nsystem will reopen in Federal courts to compensate for future victims. \nThere will be no risk to the victims.\n  We can't forget this bill is about the victims, not overinflated \nestimates of a broken tort system that diverts much-needed resources to \nunimpaired claimants and reduces awards significantly to pay attorney's \nfees and other transaction costs that do not directly benefit \nclaimants. By any objective standard, this fund is more than adequately \nfunded.\n  Although we are being met with obstacles in getting to the substance \nof the legislation, I am heartened by something. There has been \nsignificant bipartisan support for passage of a legislative solution to \nthe asbestos litigation crisis throughout the session. In fact, calls \nfor Senate action have been occurring for several years.\n  For example, when the esteemed ranking member was chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, my good friend Senator Leahy stated:\n\n     . . . Congress can provide a secure, fair and efficient means \n     of compensating victims. I believe it is in the national \n     interest to encourage fair and expeditious settlement between \n     companies and asbestos victims.\n\n  Those were Senator Leahy's remarks in the September 25, 2002, U.S. \nSenate Judiciary Committee hearing on asbestos litigation.\n\n  Senator Leahy echoed his sentiments last year during a hearing I \nchaired, when he said:\n\n       These bankruptcies create a lose-lose situation. Asbestos \n     victims deserving fair compensation do not receive it and \n     bankrupt companies cannot create new jobs nor invest in our \n     economy . . . If we work in good faith toward a bipartisan \n     asbestos solution, we can meet the challenge created by \n     [asbestos] litigation. I agree with the Supreme Court's \n     conclusion that the number of claims defies ``customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation.''\n\n  That was Senator Leahy's statement on March 5, 2003 in the committee \nhearing which was entitled, ``It is time for Congress to act.''\n  Other Members have made clear they share his opinions. For example, \nlast May, nearly a year ago, Senator Dodd made the following \nobservation:\n\n       [W]e are working very hard to come up with a compromise \n     proposal on the asbestos issue. And we've taken major steps \n     in that direction, working with organized labor, with the \n     insurance industry, with the insured, and many others who \n     have a stakeholding in the outcome of this particular avenue. \n     It's a critically important effort.\n\n  That statement was made on May 3, 2003. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd, reinforced those statements later when \nhe noted on March 4, 2004, when referring to the asbestos problem:\n\n       This is a matter that does cry out for a solution.\n\n  As work progressed on bipartisan legislation establishing a privately \nfunded national trust fund, support for the concept grew. In a July \n2003 letter to Senators Frist and Daschle, Senators Dorgan, Breaux, \nNelson, Baucus, Kohl, Miller, Lincoln, Levin, Stabenow, and Carper \nstated:\n\n       The asbestos litigation crisis is real and urgently \n     requires a legislative solution. . . . An administrative \n     trust fund is the right approach and represents a good \n     foundation for a solid legislative solution. . . . A \n     legislative solution to the asbestos crisis is a crucial \n     goal. . . . We believe that the groundwork has been laid by \n     the Committee leadership to provide a real solution to this \n     ongoing problem.\n\n  That was a July 11, 2003, letter to Senators Frist and Daschle.\n  In fact, when the legislation was originally introduced, Senator \nNelson stated:\n\n       This will protect victims, save jobs, and force companies \n     to pay their fair share. This is a good start to solving a \n     big problem.\n\n  That was a press release on May 23, 2003. I have appreciated Senator \nNelson's support over the last year. I don't know whether they can pull \nhim back on this cloture vote on Thursday. But if they do, it would \nshow this is becoming a political exercise to the detriment of these \nworkers, to the detriment of these unions, to the detriment of the \ninsurance companies, and to the detriment of these companies.\n  As last year progressed and fears grew that the legislative effort \nmight fall victim to election year politics, calls for action \nintensified. For example, Senator Dorgan wrote the following in another \nletter to Senators Frist and Daschle:\n\n       We must complete asbestos reform before this session. I \n     think it would be a serious\n\n[[Page S4187]]\n\n     mistake--for victims, for the economy, and for the Senate--if \n     we adjourned without enacting asbestos legislation. \n     Certainly, a compromise must meet the needs of all the \n     stakeholders. . . . We must seize this opportunity to solve a \n     major public policy challenge for our Nation.\n\n  That was written on October 29, 2003, in a letter to Senators Frist \nand Daschle. Yet, as you know, we were unable to get this up and get it \npassed last year. I agree with the Senator; it needed to be passed last \nyear. To allow us to go past this year would be almost criminal.\n  His opinions were echoed by Senator Baucus, who wrote:\n\n       After all the hard work that has been put into this bill \n     over the past several years, particularly this year, it would \n     be a shame to let it go to waste. It would also have serious \n     implications for the economy and for victims if we let this \n     historic opportunity pass us by. . . . From what I \n     understand, we are very close. . . . I urge you both to do \n     everything in your power to bring both sides together for a \n     swift resolution of this longstanding debate.\n\n  That was before we have gone way beyond last year's bill, and we have \ngiven well over 50 amendments to Democrats to achieve this bill.\n  That was a November 5, 2003 letter.\n  On the same day, Senator Levin also sent a letter to Senators Frist \nand Daschle expressing his own concerns about the importance of the \nSenate taking action:\n\n       I would like to again stress the importance of addressing \n     the issue of asbestos reform before we adjourn this session \n     of Congress. . . . [T]he Senate is in jeopardy of missing a \n     historic opportunity to pass asbestos legislation with strong \n     bipartisan support. It is obvious to anyone . . . that the \n     system is broken and needs to be repaired.\n\n  That letter was dated November 5, 2003.\n  These were all written during the last year's session of Congress.\n  A week later, Senator Stabenow gave the following advice to Senators \nFrist and Daschle in a letter:\n\n       I believe that we have an historic opportunity right now to \n     pass asbestos reform legislation with strong bipartisan \n     support. . . . The current system has a devastating impact on \n     victims and their families, who have to continue to wait \n     while the judicial system wades through their claims, and on \n     companies, many who have had to file for bankruptcy because \n     of asbestos lawsuits. I urge you both to continue to work on \n     a bipartisan solution to this national problem.\n\n  That was in a November 13, 2003, letter.\n  Senator Leahy made the following statement on the floor a few days \nlater:\n\n       . . . [W]e have come to a complete accord on the idea that \n     the fairest, most efficient way to provide compensation for \n     asbestos victims is through the creation of a national fund \n     that will apply agreed-upon medical criteria in evaluating \n     patients' injuries . . . an effective and efficient means to \n     end the asbestos litigation crisis within reach, and we must \n     grasp it.\n\n  That was a floor statement made on November 22 of last year. \nUnfortunately, time ran out before consensus could be reached.\n  At the urging of members on both sides of the aisle, Senator Frist \nannounced in December his intention to accommodate Democratic requests \nfor more time, and he announced he would delay floor consideration \nuntil this spring. This year, as negotiations continued in various \nsettings, a call for action has continued. For example, on March 4, \nSenator Dodd noted the crisis in asbestos litigation is ``a matter that \ndoes cry out for a solution.'' That was on March 4 in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  A few days later, Senator Reid acknowledged ``we have to do something \nabout asbestos litigation.'' That was in the March 9 Congressional \nRecord.\n  It would be impossible to argue there is an absence of bipartisan \ninterest in fixing the asbestos litigation crisis. Nothing has changed \nsince the Democratic leadership council made the following observation \nin 2002:\n\n       This is one issue where the fight is not simply a part of \n     the age-old struggle between companies seeking to avoid \n     financial responsibilities for misdeeds and trial attorneys \n     seeking to punish them while rewarding their clients and \n     themselves. We agree with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader \n     Ginsburg, who argued in an earlier case that the goal should \n     be to provide secure, fair, and efficient means of \n     compensating victims of asbestos exposure. We concur with the \n     view of the AFL-CIO that the current system is unfair and \n     unpredictable. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Pat \n     Leahy's decision to hold a fair and balanced hearing on the \n     asbestos litigation crisis should signal the beginning of a \n     bipartisan effort to create certainty in the system and get \n     help to victims without spurring new waves of bankruptcies.\n\n  That was in the New Democratic Daily on September 18, 2002, a year \nand a half ago.\n  These are some of the Democratic calls for reforms on this chart. I \nhave on this particular chart quotes by Senators Dorgan, Breaux, \nNelson, Baucus, Kohl, Miller, Lincoln, Levin, Stabenow, and Carper. In \na letter, they said:\n\n       The asbestos litigation crisis is real and urgently \n     requires a legislative solution.\n\n  On March 4, Senator Dodd said:\n\n       This is a matter that does cry out for a solution.\n\n  Senator Dorgan wrote on October 29 a letter to the leaders:\n\n       We must complete asbestos reform before this session.\n\n  Senator Stabenow wrote on November 13:\n\n       I believe that we have an historic opportunity right now to \n     pass asbestos reform legislation with strong bipartisan \n     support.\n\n  Senator Leahy, on November 22, 2003, said:\n\n       An effective and efficient means to end the asbestos \n     litigation crisis is within reach, and we must grasp it.\n\n  Some of the statements I have quoted from my Democratic colleagues \nare listed on that chart. When viewing just a segment of these quotes, \nI think it is clear the need for reform is universally understood. The \nissues that must be addressed are clear. The time has come to act. We \nhave worked our guts out to try to accommodate our friends on the other \nside. All we hear is: more money, more money, more money. It is as \nthough these 8,400 companies have an unlimited supply of money to be \ngiven. In many cases, those companies are dramatically mistreated by \nthis whole system. In many cases, they should never have had to pay a \ndime. I will cite one of the larger insurance companies in this \ncountry. They never, ever insured for asbestos or asbestosis, or any \nproblem or malady that comes from asbestos; they never had anything to \ndo with asbestos, other than they had their medical team do a medical \nanalysis and concluded mesothelioma probably comes from exposure to \nasbestos. That was a service to society, not anything that should cause \nliability. Because of that, this company has been joined in over 60,000 \ncases, every one of which they can win and should win. The last one \nthey tried, they did win, but it cost them $2 million for attorneys' \nfees alone.\n  That is money that could have gone to the victims, and just to get \nsome finality to this situation, just to solve this problem, that \ncompany is willing to pay out what amounts to millions of dollars that \nthey do not owe just to get this over with. There is a raft of \ncompanies that are in the lawsuits that fit that category.\n  Where is the justice on the other side? I admit, you want to fight \nfor your constituencies--the personal injury lawyers and the unions--\nbut you also have constituencies, my friends on the other side, in \nthese businesses that are going to go bankrupt and insurance companies \nthat also are going to go bankrupt and the economy that is going to be \ntremendously hurt by this situation if we do not resolve this problem. \nWe have a whopping amount of money to resolve these problems.\n  The issues that must be addressed are clear. The time has come to \nact. The asbestos litigation crisis is a national nightmare, and the \nfailure of Congress to fix it would be a legislative disgrace.\n  I would like to show some charts with other calls for reform from \nlabor unions and the media. Let me go into some of those.\n  Organized labor calls for reform. This is a statement of Jonathan \nHiatt, general counsel with the AFL-CIO. This was made before the \nJudiciary Committee on January 25, 2002:\n\n       Uncertainty for workers and their families is growing as \n     they lose health insurance and see their companies file for \n     bankruptcy protection.\n\n  Mr. Hiatt is a very bright and noble attorney in many respects, and I \nhave a lot of respect for him. What has the AFL-CIO done? We reached \n$108 billion which I had indications they would accept, but now we are \nas high as $124 billion. Where are they?\n  Take AFL-CIO Principles on Asbestos Compensation which was stated on \nAugust 7, 2002:\n\n\n[[Page S4188]]\n\n\n       [U]nder current law and legal processes, many asbestos \n     victims are not being treated fairly.\n\n  In other words, the system is broken. Here we have a chance of \nchanging the system. This is the art of the doable. And where are the \ntrade unions? They are the ones that are losing the jobs. They are the \nones that are primarily losing health care benefits. They are the ones \nthat are losing their pensions from these companies that are going \nbankrupt. Where are they? Why aren't they demanding that our friends on \nthe other side do something about this, other than scream for more \nmoney all the time. Stones can only give so much blood, and, of course, \nthere is a certain irony in that statement.\n  Let's take the United Steelworkers of America, local 12773:\n\n       We really believe this needs to be resolved now.\n\n  Or take the Paper, Allied-Industrial Chemical, Energy Workers \nInternational Union, local 2-0891:\n\n       . . . we might not have another chance for some time.\n\n  They might not have jobs in the future because of this dragging of \nthe feet we are getting from the other side on this matter.\n  Or take the United Steelworkers of America, local 7110:\n\n       It is too important to let pass by.\n\n  These sum it up. Let's take media calls for reform just so people \nunderstand.\n  The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, September 25, 2003:\n       There is an elephant to be moved, and this is the best \n     chance in years. The time for Congress to act is now.\n\n  The Detroit News, April 4, 2004:\n\n       The bill makes economic sense for companies and would \n     ensure significant payments to employees who develop serious \n     illness. It's a humane solution and ought to be adopted.\n\n  That is the Detroit News, a heavily industrialized city. They \nunderstand this. Why the slowdown?\n  Take the Chicago Times, on June 16, 2004:\n\n       It is ludicrous to keep litigating for the benefit of the \n     litigators, when what is needed is a claims system for the \n     benefit of the victims.\n\n  That is what this bill does. It is a claims system for the benefit of \nthe victims.\n  There is a whopping amount of money that will go to the victims, not \nto attorneys, although the attorneys still will get $2.5 billion of it, \nwhich is a lot of money.\n  Take the Washington Times on September 24, 2003:\n\n     . . . current legislation to control asbestos-related \n     lawsuits is one of the best ways Congress can protect jobs.\n\n  The current legislation.\n  Or take the Capital Times & Wisconsin State Journal on May 13, 2003:\n\n       An asbestos trust fund is a good idea. It should become \n     law.\n       Fund Could End Asbestos Legal Battles.\n\n  That is what this bill can do. Why don't we have more help from the \nother side?\n  None of these papers, with the possible exception of Washington \nTimes, one would call moderate to conservative. Most are more liberal \npapers.\n  The Chicago Times, June 16, 2003:\n\n       The proposal . . . would get compensation to genuine \n     victims and get hundreds of thousands of cases out of the \n     regular court system.\n\n  That is one of the points I have not emphasized up to now. As a \nformer trial lawyer, I have to tell you, our courts are clogged with \nall kinds of frivolous suits, all kinds of frivolous cases. I am not \ntalking about these cases necessarily, but all kinds of them. Then you \nadd these hundreds of thousands of cases, and one can see why justice \nis not being obtained, especially for those who are sick and needy.\n  I notice that my colleague from Washington is in the Chamber. I thank \nher and her staff for their good-faith efforts in working with us to \nreach consensus on an appropriate asbestos ban. I am pleased that we, \nincluding Senators Feinstein and Kohl, were able to reach bipartisan \nconsensus on this very important issue. It is important.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately following \nthe remarks of the distinguished Senator from Washington, the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, be recognized to give \nhis remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during \ntoday's session of the Senate Senator Harkin be recognized for up to 15 \nminutes as in morning business; Senator Byrd for up to 40 minutes as in \nmorning business; and Senator Inhofe for up to 30 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to share my serious \nconcerns with the asbestos liability bill now before the Senate. As my \ncolleagues know, this is not just another bill for me. This is \nsomething I spent years learning about, educating my colleagues about, \nand writing legislation to address.\n  In fact, my work on asbestos started 3 years ago this very month when \nI asked the Senate HELP Committee to hold a hearing on asbestos \nexposure in the workplace.\n  I started this as a very lonely battle with my good friend, Senator \nPaul Wellstone. We held press conferences, and it seemed like no one \ncame. Senator Baucus and Senator Cantwell were with us, but it was a \nvery lonely fight.\n  That is why today it is so great to watch my colleagues, such as \nSenator Daschle, Senator Reid, Senator Dayton, and Senator Leahy moving \nthis discussion to such a productive level. They have taken the time to \nlisten to the victims, and I think if everyone did, we would have a \nmuch more balanced bill in front of us today.\n  I am pleased that after working all these years with the victims, \nfamily members, and doctors, the full Senate is now engaged in a debate \nabout asbestos. I am also pleased that many of the issues I have been \nfighting for have been included in this legislation. This bill does \ninclude a modified ban on asbestos, similar to the original ban that I \nfirst introduced 2 years ago. That is an important acknowledgment of \nwhat I told the Judiciary Committee did last June:\n\n       If Congress is going to prevent any future lawsuits, then \n     Congress must try to prevent any more asbestos casualties, by \n     banning the use of asbestos.\n  So I am pleased by some of the progress in this bill, but I am also \ndeeply disturbed by what this bill will do to people whose lives have \nbeen torn apart by asbestos, to future victims, to family members, and \nto average Americans who are being exposed to deadly asbestos every day \nwithout even knowing it. After listening to the victims, hearing their \nstories, looking them in the eye, there is no way I could vote for this \ninadequate and unbalanced bill today.\n  As I have learned about asbestos over the past 3 years, I have been \ntroubled by the duplicity of some of the companies, by the negligence \nof our own Government, and by the absolute horror that asbestos \ninflicts on people. Throughout this process, I have also been touched \nby the commitment and the optimism of victims. Some of them realize it \nis too late for them, but they want to make sure no other American goes \nthrough the horror they have experienced.\n  After working with them, I know I am not just standing on the Senate \nfloor as a single Senator. I am standing here on behalf of all of the \npeople I have been honored to meet and stand with over the past 3 \nyears.\n  I am standing here on behalf of people like Brian Harvey, Gayla \nBenefield, Bret Williams, Ralph Busch, Marv Sather, and George \nBiekkola.\n  They were all exposed to asbestos through no fault of their own.\n  I am standing here on behalf of the family members of asbestos \nvictims, people like Sue Vento, the wife of the late Congressman Bruce \nVento of Minnesota; Sue Harvey, and LTC James Zumwalt, the son of Navy \nhero Elmo Zumwalt.\n  I am standing here on behalf of doctors who have labored to save \ntheir patients against a merciless killer, doctors like Michael Harbut, \nAlan Whitehouse, and Harvey Pass who not only provided medical care but \nworked to raise awareness and call for needed research.\n  I am standing here on behalf of public health leaders like Dr. \nRichard Lemen, a former Assistant Surgeon General of the United States; \nDr. Phil Landrigan, and people like Andrew\n\n[[Page S4189]]\n\nSchneider and Barry Castleman who have worked to warn the public about \nthese dangers.\n  I am standing here on behalf of researchers and advocates, people \nlike Chris Hahn of the Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation and \nadvocates at the Environmental Working Group.\n  All of these people have stood with me at press conferences and have \ntestified before Senate hearings, calling for us to help the victims \nand to ban asbestos. We have a real obligation to them.\n  I am standing on the Senate floor today to make sure the Senate does \nright by people who have been wronged.\n  Let me share one of their voices with my colleagues. In July 2001, \nthe HELP Committee held that hearing that I requested on workplace \nsafety and asbestos exposure. One of the witnesses was Mr. George \nBiekkola of Michigan, a World War II veteran and a community leader who \nhelped bring a hockey rink to the children of his community.\n  Those of us who were at that hearing 3 years ago will never forget \nwhat he said. He broke down several times as he read his statement, but \nhis message was clear. He told us he had spent 30 years working at the \nCleveland Cliff Iron Company in Michigan. He operated a hard rock drill \nand was exposed to asbestos dust. He was forced to retire at the age of \n60 because asbestos had scarred his lungs and reduced his lung capacity \nby one-third. At that hearing, he told us:\n\n       I thought I'd be spending my retirement traveling out West \n     with my wife, hunting deer up in the mountains. But today I \n     can't.\n\n  He said he could not exert himself because his heart was weak and \nthat he had to be careful because a simple case of pneumonia could kill \nhim. He told us:\n\n       This isn't how I thought I'd be spending my retirement, but \n     when I think about the other guys I worked with--I guess I \n     came out lucky.\n\n  He said:\n\n       I'm here today to tell you my story so that maybe someone \n     else working in a mine or a brake shop or a factory won't \n     lose the things I have lost.\n\n  He concluded his statement with these words:\n\n       Senators, please make sure that what happened to me won't \n     happen to anyone else. . . . Workers like me are counting on \n     you to protect us. Please don't let us down.\n\n  I am sad to report that George Biekkola died 2 weeks ago today from \nasbestosis and mesothelioma. Until the end, he was looking out for \nother victims. In fact, at his funeral last Saturday his family \ndisplayed a photograph of him testifying at that Senate hearing.\n  George is not with us today, but his words ring as loudly now as they \ndid 3 years ago: Senators, do not let us down.\n  That is why I have been working on asbestos for the last 3 years and \nthat is why I cannot support this inadequate bill. After all the things \nthat Americans like George Biekkola have been through, after all they \nhave lost, after all their families have lost, after all they have done \nto protect others, I will not let them down, and that is why I cannot \nsupport this bill.\n  Before I turn to the specifics, I want to put this discussion in \ncontext. For decades we have been pumping this poison into Americans, \non purpose and by accident. It has wrecked lives, families, and \nfortunes, and it has been a problem for many businesses. Asbestos is \neverywhere, and it is killing us. We have to stop putting this killer \nin products. We have to stop importing products that contain asbestos. \nWe have to figure out a way to make whole everyone who has been \naffected by this epidemic, and we need to do it in a balanced way that \ngives certainty and equity to both victims and to companies.\n  This process has been an education for me because like many Americans \nI thought asbestos had been banned a very long time ago. In 1989, the \nEPA did try to ban asbestos, but that effort was overturned in a \nlawsuit from the asbestos industry. Ten years later, in 1999, reporter \nAndrew Schneider and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer published articles \nabout a disturbing trend in a small mining town of Libby, MT. Residents \nthere are suffering from extraordinarily high rates of asbestos-related \ndisease. At many plants where vermiculite from Libby was processed and \nthen shipped, waste rock left over from the expansion process was given \naway for free. I learned that people used this free waste rock in their \nyards, in their driveways, and in their gardens.\n  This picture that I have with me today is Justin and Tim Jorgensen. \nThey are climbing on waste rock that was given out by Western Minerals, \nInc., in St. Paul, MN, some time in the 1970s. According to W.R. Grace \nrecords, this rock they are playing on contained between 2 and 10 \npercent temuline asbestos. This rock produced airborne asbestos \nconcentrations 135 times higher than OSHA's current standards for \nworkers.\n  We need to do right by Justin and Tim, and those are the people I \nthink about when I look at this bill.\n  I learned, in fact, that our country is far behind others. The United \nStates remains the only industrialized country besides Canada that has \nnot yet banned asbestos. More than 30 million pounds of asbestos are \nstill today right now consumed in the United States each year. I \nlearned that asbestos is still found today in over 3,000 common \nproducts in the United States, including baby powder, cosmetics, brake \npads, pipes, hairdryers, ceiling tiles and vinyl flooring.\n  It is still legal in 2004 to construct buildings with asbestos cement \nshingles and to treat them with asbestos roof coatings. It is still \nlegal today to construct new water systems using asbestos cement pipes \nimported from other countries. It is still legal today for cars and \ntrucks to be made and serviced with asbestos brake pads and linings. \nWorkers in this country are still being exposed to dangerous levels of \nasbestos. According to OSHA, an estimated 1.3 million employees in \nconstruction and general industry face significant asbestos exposure on \nthe job today. Asbestos, in fact, has taken a particularly large toll \non the people of my State.\n\n  According to a recent report by the Environmental Working Group, King \nCounty has the fourth highest number of deaths related to asbestos in \nthe country. Three other counties, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish, all \nrank in the top 100 for asbestos-related deaths. Overall, Washington \nState ranks eighth in asbestos-related deaths nationwide. Just last \nweek in Spokane, WA, our State department of health announced that 100 \nformer workers at a vermiculite factory likely inhaled deadly asbestos \nfibers and should seek advice from their doctors. They also warned that \nchildren and spouses who lived with those workers could become ill from \nparticles that were carried home with the loved ones on their clothing, \non their hair, and their skin.\n  Given the known dangers of this mineral, we should all be asking why \nare we still using it? Why are we still adding it to products on \npurpose where there are perfectly acceptable substitutes? Americans in \nevery walk of life and in every corner of this country have been \nexposed, and we have to protect them. That is why I have worked to do a \nseries of things over the past few years.\n  On June 18 of 2002 I introduced the Ban Asbestos in America Act. I \nreintroduced that bill again last May as S. 1115.\n  I do thank all the Senators who have cosponsored my bill: Senators \nBaucus, Boxer, Cantwell, Daschle, Dayton, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, \nHollings, Jeffords, Lautenberg, Leahy, and Reid.\n  I have pushed the EPA to warn homeowners about the dangers of \nZonolite insulation, which today is in the attics of as many as 35 \nmillion homes, schools, and businesses.\n  I have urged the EPA to warn brake mechanics about the deadly \nasbestos dust they are exposed to on the job today.\n  I have asked OSHA to increase its efforts to enforce existing \nregulations that attempt to protect automobile brake mechanics.\n  I have shared my concern with legislators in Canada, the country that \nis the largest source of America's asbestos imports.\n  I testified at a hearing on Libby, MT, and I testified before the \nJudiciary Committee last July.\n  Asbestos liability is a real problem. It is a problem for victims, \nand it is a problem for companies. We need a balanced solution.\n  Unfortunately, the bill that is before us today falls short in six \nways. First\n\n[[Page S4190]]\n\nof all, it is unfair to victims because the awards are too small, even \nsmaller than many would get if they were allowed a day in court.\n  Second, it could lock future victims out of getting help because the \ntrust fund is inadequate.\n  Third, it keeps Americans in the dark about the dangers of asbestos. \nIt does not include the education campaign that we know is needed and \nthat I have been pushing for over the past 3 years.\n  Fourth, it falls short on research, tracking, and treatment for \nasbestos diseases.\n  Fifth, it makes family members jump through too many restrictive \nhurdles.\n  And sixth, it allows insurance companies to place liens on the awards \nfamily members receive, unfairly reducing the award they deserve, and \ntreating them much differently than other Federal compensation \nprograms.\n  Let me take a few minutes to discuss each of those in detail. First \nof all, as I said, the awards are too small. Many people who had their \nlives torn apart by asbestos will actually do worse under this bill \nthan they would in court. For example, awards for lung cancer victims \nwho have more than 15 years of exposure to asbestos are limited to \n$25,000 to $75,000, even though most of those victims will die within a \nyear.\n  Victims with asbestosis who have lost 20 percent to 40 percent of \ntheir breathing capacity, many of whom will be disabled for life, will \nreceive only $85,000. That is far less than their lost wages and \nmedical costs. This bill gives them less than they deserve. At the same \ntime, it blocks the courthouse door to victims who have staggering \nmedical bills, lost wages, and other damages. I do not see how Congress \ncan leave asbestos victims worse off than they are today, but that is \nwhat this bill will do.\n\n  Second, the trust fund is too small to compensate all the victims, \nbut that is just one of the problems with this trust fund. I believe a \nsuccessful trust fund will provide fair and adequate compensation to \nall victims and would bring reasonable financial certainty to defendant \ncompanies and insurers. To do that, the trust fund must include four \nthings: Fair award values, appropriate medical criteria, adequate \nfunding, and fast processing.\n  The system for processing claims must allow victims to get prompt \npayments, without the complications, time, and expense of a traditional \nlawsuit. Unfortunately, the trust fund in this bill falls far short of \nwhat is needed. I have already discussed how the award values are \nunfair.\n  In addition, the trust fund is not adequately funded. In fact, the \ntrust fund in this bill has been slashed dramatically from the original \nHatch legislation. In the Judiciary Committee's bill the trust fund was \n$153 billion. But in this bill we are being asked to vote on the trust \nfund has been slashed by over $40 billion.\n  Now, the trust fund didn't shrink on its own. It was reduced after \nclosed-door negotiations that included only one side, the defendant \ncompanies and the insurance industry. It was not based on the actual \nneeds of victims. Instead, it was based on what the insurers and \nbusinesses were willing to pay. This one-sided agreement reduced the \nfunding provided in S. 1125 by more than $40 billion.\n  Making matters worse, an additional $10 billion in contingent funds \ndoes not become available for 24 years. The Senate should not adopt a \npolicy of adjusting award values just to meet an arbitrary and \nartificial limit reached in a back room with only one side present.\n  Not only was this figure arrived at in an unfair way, but it is clear \nit is not enough to meet the needs of current and future asbestos \nvictims.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the cost of this bill \nat $134 billion. This bill provides only $109 billion. So there is a \nsignificant shortfall already. But there is very good reason to believe \nthis shortfall will be even larger. Recent claims in the Manville trust \nshow much higher than expected claims for many asbestos diseases. Those \nclaims also show that recent mortality and morbidity data increase the \nlikelihood that the number of asbestos-related diseases and related \nclaims will exceed current estimates.\n  If this fund becomes insolvent it will leave victims without the help \nthey deserve and without the help they need. Because of that \npossibility, last year Senators inserted a number of protections during \nthe Judiciary Committee markup. Tragically, very tragically, the bill \nbefore us today throws away all of those carefully crafted bipartisan \nprotections.\n  For example, we had protections for victims in case the trust fund \nbecame insolvent. Those protections in the Biden amendment were \nstripped from this bill.\n  We had protections that guaranteed that asbestos victims would \npreserve their legal rights until the trust fund is operational. That \nis important because if this bill becomes law, it will end up in court \nand there will be no mechanism for victims and their families to get \nhelp while this law is tied up in court. We solved that problem with \nthe Feinstein amendment, but again those protections were stripped from \nthis bill.\n  So overall this trust fund is inadequate. If we are going to lock the \ncourthouse doors to victims, we have to be 100 percent certain the \ntrust fund will have enough money to cover all of the 600,000 current \nclaims and the thousands more that may be found later. This is \nespecially important because asbestos diseases have a very long latency \nperiod, often decades long, making it hard for us to predict today who \nwill need help in the future. If we pass this inadequate trust fund, my \nconstituents and hundreds of thousands of Americans will be left out in \nthe cold with only the fading memories of their loved ones to carry \nthem through this tragic ordeal.\n  My third concern with this bill is it keeps Americans in the dark \nabout the dangers of asbestos exposure. This bill completely drops the \neducation campaign that was in both of my asbestos bills. One of the \nreasons why asbestos takes such a deadly toll is because people are \nunaware that they're being exposed to it.\n\n  Ralph Busch, a constituent of mine, exposed himself and his wife to \nasbestos when he renovated his home. He never knew about the dangers \nuntil he happened to read a story in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. \nToday, his dream house is abandoned, his credit is ruined, and his \nhealth is a constant worry. Ralph Busch didn't do anything wrong. He \ncouldn't have known about the danger of Zonolite insulation. There is \nno way that Ralph Busch could have known that by buying and renovating \nan old house he would eventually expose his family to dangerous levels \nof asbestos.\n  We must make sure others do know about this public health risk by \nproviding additional resources to educate the American public about the \ndangers of worksite and home exposures to products that contain \nasbestos.\n  We must also provide safety information to homeowners on what they \ncan do to prevent asbestos exposures at home, particularly in the attic \nand basement.\n  In addition to homeowners, many workers are exposed to asbestos on \nthe job. Often they are not aware of the danger, and they don't have \nthe protective equipment they need.\n  I am heartened to hear that EPA, ATSDR and NIOSH are now proactively \nreaching out to consumers and workers to warn them to stay away from \nvermiculite attic insulation. But, I am very concerned that the EPA, \nprodded by a request from the law firm of the former acting agency \nadministrator, is considering revising its ``Guidance for Preventing \nAsbestos Disease Among Auto Mechanics'' to convey the false impression \nthat brake repair work is no longer a risk.\n  Clearly, any effort by the EPA to downplay these risks flies in the \nface of current congressional intent regarding the inherent health \nproblems with exposure to asbestos in the workplace. I sincerely hope \nthat EPA will not bow to the pressure of the industry and in fact \nstrengthen its guidance for brake mechanics.\n  My fourth concern is that this bill does not do enough for research, \ntracking and treatment.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch for including some modest resources in \nhis latest version of the bill--which should be used to establish \nmesothelioma research and treatment centers around the country. \nYesterday I was pleased to hear Senator Hatch say that he would be \nwilling to explore additional funding for asbestos research and \ntreatment\n\n[[Page S4191]]\n\ncenters. These centers will be critical as the medical community works \nto develop new treatments and protocols for the variety of deadly \ncancers and diseases that exposure to asbestos brings to workers and \ntheir families.\n  Unfortunately, not included in S. 2290 are the resources needed to \ntrack the victims of mesothelioma and other asbestos causing cancers, \nand to conduct additional research about the harmful effects of this \ndeadly material.\n  These are areas that doctors and other experts have told me time and \nagain we must invest in. I heard from some of those doctors last month \nat a press conference I held, which Senator Reid and Senator Dayton \nattended. At the press conference, Dr. Bret Williams of North Carolina \nsaid, ``As a doctor, a cancer patient, a husband and father, I am \nasking my government to take a stand. Fix the problem. Give us hope. \nFund a mesothelioma research program. Please invest in a cure.''\n  A surgeon from Detroit, Dr. Harvey Pass, told us that progress on \nasbestos diseases requires funding, and he said that funding, ``remains \nabsolutely insufficient to set up the type of collaborative approaches \nthat already exist with lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, \nand colon cancer.''\n  The fourth problem with this bill is its inadequate support for \nresearch, tracking and treatment of asbestos diseases.\n  My fifth concern with this bill is the way it treats family members. \nUnder this bill, family members of victims will be forced to jump \nthrough an additional series of hoops, reducing the likelihood they \nwill ever receive an award.\n  Let us remember that these family members have lost loved ones. In \nmany cases they are vulnerable themselves because they came into \ncontact with asbestos fibers through a family member. Take the case of \nSusan Lawes. Her father was a pipe fitter and was exposed to asbestos \non the job. When he came home from work, asbestos fibers were still on \nhis clothes. He would walk through the door after the end of a long day \nand give his daughter a hug. Last month, Susan was diagnosed with an \nasbestos disease. As she told me,'' I am literally dying because I \nhugged my dad.''\n  Susan and many people like her are not treated fairly under this \nbill. The children and the spouses of workers should not have to prove \nfive years of exposure to asbestos from their husbands and fathers as \nthey would under this bill. They also should not be forced to appear \nbefore a special Physicians Review Board in order to determine their \nmedical condition and whether they are eligible for a compensatory \naward.\n  It is the same for people in Spokane, WA. Spokane is one of the 22 \nsites that EPA has determined is still contaminated. Why are we forcing \nthese innocent victims of take-home asbestos exposure to jump through \nextraordinary hoops to determine their eligibility of an award?\n  My fifth concern is the unfair way this bill treats family members--\nmaking them jump through hurdles that reduce the chance they will ever \nget the help they need.\n  Finally, this bill allows insurance companies to reduce any awards \nthat victims actually receive--something that is not found in similar \nfederal plans.\n  This bill allows insurance companies to place liens on the awards \nthat victims and family members receive.\n  I find it unconscionable that health insurance companies and other \nentities can recoup their costs by placing liens on the awards family \nmembers receive in compensation for their loss of a father, a husband, \na son or a daughter.\n  These workers were often the only breadwinners in their households, \nbut this bill tells their surviving family members that they can be \nsued by their health insurance provider for a substantial part of an \naward--an award that as I've shown may already be inadequate.\n  What is especially disturbing is other federal compensation programs \ndo not allow this type of action, but for some reason, asbestos victims \nare being given fewer protections. For example, the awards provided to \nvictims in federal compensation programs like the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness \nCompensation Program Act and the Ricky Ray Hemophiliac Relief Fund Act \nare not subject to liens by workers compensation insurers. I don't know \nwhy the authors want to treat asbestos victims differently, but I do \nknow that it is not fair, and it's one of the reasons why I can't \nsupport this bill.\n  In the end, this bill falls far short of what victims deserve. The \nawards are too small. The trust fund is inadequate. It fails to educate \nAmericans about the dangers of asbestos. It falls short on research, \ntracking and treatment for asbestos diseases. It puts unfair burdens on \nfamily members, and it allows insurance companies to reduce a victim's \naward.\n  I have been fighting on this for years, and it makes no sense that we \ncould squander this moment with a bill that is so inadequate. George \nand Gayla and Ralph and Marv and Bret and Brian deserve so much better, \nand I will continue to fight for them.\n  Regardless of what happens with this bill, the one thing we must do \nis ban asbestos, and I assure my colleagues that I will keep fighting \nfor that. I do want to pass a law. We need a real solution. I don't \nwant companies going bankrupt. I don't want victims going without the \nhelp they need. I still think we can do it, and I will continue to \nfight for a balanced and fair bill that will do right by victims across \nthe country. We have an obligation to them and their families. I have \nbeen fighting for them for the last 3 years. No matter what happens \nthis week, I am not going to stop now.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I preface my remarks by saying my \nthoughts are with the victims of asbestos exposure, those families that \nhave lost loved ones, and those that have to live with the debilitating \nillness caused by asbestos. They are at the forefront of my mind and in \nmy heart as I discuss this issue of asbestos liability.\n  I want to be sure the legislation we pass today will ensure that \nthose truly sick individuals are allowed fair and just compensation. \nWithout the passage of this legislation, they will not be compensated. \nAs hundreds of companies will cascade into bankruptcy, we will lose \nthousands of good-paying jobs and see the pensions of thousands of \nretirees evaporate.\n  Most people would agree that the issue of asbestos litigation and its \naftermath is presenting a crisis in our country. With roughly 70 \ncompanies already in bankruptcy and a slew of bankruptcies soon to \nfollow, the U.S. Supreme Court had it right when they called this an \nelephantine mess.\n  People need to understand this mess has far-reaching effects and \nripples and they are being felt way beyond corporate boardrooms. They \nare being felt intensely by middle America, people from States such as \nOhio, in the form of job loss. We have lost over 2.7 million \nmanufacturing jobs in the United States. In my State alone, in July, \nthere were 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2000, but by October 2003 \nthat fell to 840,000, 17.6 percent of our State's manufacturing \nemployment, a loss of more than 1 out of every 6 Ohio factory jobs. \nThese numbers represent a crisis for Ohio's economy. Already, roughly \n70 companies have been forced into bankruptcy with between 52,000 and \n60,000 jobs lost as a result.\n  Shattered families and communities. The statistics are only the \nbeginning as thousands of jobs were subsequently lost in industries \ndependent on those bankrupt firms. In fact, a recent study by Financial \nInstitutions for Asbestos Reform and conducted by Navigant Consulting \ndetails the hidden cost of this crisis and shows how passage of Federal \nasbestos legislation would provide a tremendous boost to the economy \nand create jobs. Dr. William Kerr, author of the study, said the \nfailure to enact legislation would reduce economic growth by $2.4 \nbillion per year. Failure to enact legislation could reduce economic \ngrowth by $2.4 billion per year, costing more than 30,000 jobs \nannually. Extended over a 27-year frame, as contemplated, this means \nthe loss of more than 800,000 jobs and $64 billion in economic growth.\n  Another study, entitled The Secondary Impacts of Asbestos \nLiabilities, conducted by NERA Economic Consulting for the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, shows how asbestos lawsuits\n\n[[Page S4192]]\n\ncan cause secondary harm to businesses, governments, communities, and \nindividuals. The study found the ripple effects of plant closures and \nmass layoffs, such as causing local real estate values to fall, per \ncapita income to decline, and tax coffers to dwindle. The study \nestimates the total cost to taxpayers of unemployment insurance \nbenefits to displaced workers for asbestos-related bankruptcies at $80 \nmillion. The study put the indirect cost of the company closing due to \nasbestos liability at as much as $2.1 billion. If nothing is done to \nresolve what has been described as the elephantine mess of asbestos \nlitigation, scores, if not hundreds, of additional businesses will be \nforced into bankruptcies and tens of thousands of additional workers \nwill find themselves unemployed. Retiree and workers who spent decades \nworking for retirement will see their life savings vanish.\n\n  This crisis can really be felt in my home State of Ohio. In fact, \nOhio is the fifth biggest State in the country in terms of asbestos \nclaims hanging around our court. In Cuyahoga County, more than 41,000 \nasbestos cases have swamped the court system. At least 20 large Ohio \ncompanies, representing more than 80,000 employees, are the targets of \nasbestos litigation. Of course, over the past few years the circle of \nliability has expanded to pull in more and more solvent companies, many \nof which never manufactured or installed asbestos.\n  There are numerous examples of Ohio companies negatively impacted by \nthis crisis. Take the case of Federal Mogul, a company that employs \nover 1,200 in six cities through my State. Employees held 16 percent of \nthe company stock. That stock lost 99 percent of its value. Current \nemployees and also retirees feel the effects of the bankruptcies. Many \nretirees depend on company stock and dividends for income, and as this \nvalue heads south, retirees feel it immediately.\n  Another company which does a lot for the Toledo area is Owens \nCorning. As Governor, I worked hard to get Owens Corning to put the new \ncorporate headquarters in downtown Toledo to help facilitate the city \nof Toledo renaissance. Owens Corning, unfortunately, went bankrupt in \n2000. In the 2 years preceding this bankruptcy, the stock lost 97 \npercent of its value. Fourteen percent of the stock was owned by \ncompany employees.\n  Another Ohio company spoke with me off the record about its growing \nasbestos liability. When this company announced it had limited asbestos \nliability, the stock dropped by about 20 percent and its debt rating \nwas lowered. This began a chain-reaction ripple effect that included \nthe loss of over 100 jobs, the sale of assets, a 50-percent cut in \ncapital investments, and a huge cut in the amount of contributions to \nthe surrounding community.\n  As a former mayor, I know firsthand the impact of what happens when \ncompanies go bankrupt. Many of us forget that these companies make a \nsignificant contribution to the tax revenues of the cities in which \nthey are located, including their philanthropic contributions, such as \nUnited Way, arts, education, health care, and many other forms of \ncommunity involvement. As I have said before, companies such as this \none make up the backbone of the Ohio economy. They do not want to shirk \ntheir responsibility to those victims who will become sick truly \nbecause of asbestos exposure; they want to know that they are not \ncompensating those individuals who are unimpaired.\n  Ohio feels the crisis most acutely. It has so impacted my State of \nOhio that the State legislature has decided to act where the Federal \nlegislature has failed to do so. On December 11, 2003, the Ohio House \nof Representatives approved a bill to make Ohio the first in the Nation \nto block suits by people exposed to potentially deadly asbestos but who \nhave yet to fall ill. The bill would adopt State medical standards for \nsuch litigation, allowing lawsuits to be filed by those who have yet to \ndevelop cancer or suffer measurable loss of lung function to be placed \non hold until they do actually develop the symptoms.\n\n  I applaud the State of Ohio for recognizing the true magnitude of the \nthreat to Ohio citizens and for not waiting for Washington to act. With \nthe passage of this bill, Ohioans who are sick from asbestos exposure \nwill go to the top of the court dockets where they belong. Finite \nresources will be available for those who need compensation most. The \npeople who are now sick will be able to file claims.\n  Now, if we could only get something done here. I have been working on \nthis issue since I was elected to the Senate, and I have been a \ncosponsor to several pieces of legislation, including the Asbestos Tax \nFairness Act and both versions of the Fairness in Asbestos Injury \nResolution Act. I have testified twice before the Judiciary Committee \non the need for this legislation. I have lobbied my colleagues in the \nadministration on the need to see this bill passed.\n  If we want to get something done, we need to do it now. Now is the \ntime. We passed the FAIR Act out of the Judiciary Committee last summer \nand have spent the time between then and now negotiating to try to find \na solution that everyone can support. That is almost a year that we \nhave been negotiating back and forth trying to figure out something we \nthink will be fair to everyone. The time has come for action. We cannot \nafford any more delays. The ever rising tide of corporate bankruptcies \naffect victims' compensation so that the truly sick asbestos victims in \ntoo many cases and more and more frequently only receive pennies on the \ndollar. In addition, employees of bankrupt companies suffer as they \nwatch their jobs disappear and their pensions in 401(k) plans decrease \ndramatically. Again, we have to do something now, not later. Passage of \nthis legislation will get us well on our way. And we have never come \ncloser to resolving the asbestos litigation crisis than this \nlegislation.\n\n  This bill provides for a privately funded, no-fault, national \nasbestos victims compensation fund that will replace the broken tort \nsystem and ensure that individuals who are truly sick receive \ncompensation quickly, fairly, and efficiently. It retains the \nbipartisan agreement on medical criteria that was approved unanimously \nby the Judiciary Committee. These criteria form the basis of a no-fault \nvictims' compensation fund that will stop the flow of resources to the \nunimpaired and ensure that the truly ill will be paid quickly and \nfairly.\n  The bill contains many improvements made to its predecessor and \nreflects the product of the last several months of extensive \nnegotiations by the stakeholders in this debate--all of the \nstakeholders.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on this very important piece \nof legislation.\n  On a broader scale, the litigation crisis in this country is like a \ntornado ripping its way through our economy. The American Tort Reform \nAssociation published a study in 2002 on the impact of litigation in \nOhio and found that it costs every Ohioan $636 per year--that is every \nOhioan, all 11.5 million. That is $636 a head. A large part of it is \ndue to the issue that we have before us today, asbestos. We need to \nmove immediately on this issue.\n  In my opinion, passing responsible asbestos reform legislation to \nensure that the truly injured receive fair and just compensation, and \nto prevent more companies from sliding into bankruptcy, will do far \nmore for Ohio's economy than many other stimulus proposals we have been \ntalking about on the floor of the Senate or in our respective \ncommittees.\n  The consequences of inaction are grave. As previously mentioned, a \nlarge swath of corporate America is at risk, jeopardizing the jobs of \nthousands of employees, impoverishing retirees, and shattering families \nand communities. America's clear national interest lies in making sure \nasbestos funds are available for those who become sick and lifting an \nominous cloud of litigation from our troubled economy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             False Advertisement By Special Interest Groups\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have to admit that I do not read the New \nYork\n\n[[Page S4193]]\n\nTimes cover to cover each day. But from time to time, items in that \npaper do catch my attention. For instance, when a group runs a full-\npage advertisement, one cannot help but at least glance at the ad.\n  A couple weeks ago, one such advertisement caught my attention. It \nwas a full-page advertisement placed in the New York Times by two \nspecial interest groups: the Natural Resources Defense Council and \nMoveon.org. These two special interest groups are especially vocal and \ndevoted solely to disparaging the environmental record of the Bush \nadministration.\n  I have an enlarged version of that advertisement that ran in the New \nYork Times. It is chart 1. As you can see, it states, in large print: \n``First Arsenic, Now Mercury.'' It has pictures of President Bush \nalongside a powerplant billowing with smoke. The ad makes such claims \nas: the President's policies are the source for mercury contamination \nin fish and that the President is simply following the wishes of \nindustry contributors. The ad makes direct statements such as: ``So why \nis President Bush trying to weaken controls on mercury pollution?''\n  I am chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, so this \nad was of particular interest to me for at least a couple reasons. To \nanyone reading this advertisement, the reader would naturally assume \nthere must be some already existing controls on mercury emissions from \npowerplants because the ad explicitly claims that President Bush is \ntrying to weaken those controls.\n  How can you weaken controls if there are no controls to start with? \nSo it is assuming there are controls existing. This claim is completely \nfalse. I believe this chart demonstrates that. The NRDC's lobbying \nclaim is that the President is weakening controls on mercury emissions \nfrom powerplants. The facts, however, are very different.\n  On December 15, 2003, this President proposed the first ever controls \non mercury emissions from utilities. Now, keep in mind, there were no \ncontrols before, none whatsoever. How can you weaken controls if there \nare no controls there?\n  The Clinton administration had 8 years to propose such controls and \ndid not. In nearly 3,000 days as EPA Administrator, how many mercury \nregulations on powerplants did former EPA Administrator Carol Browner \nissue? Zero. Instead, in the last month of the eighth year of the \nClinton administration, Carol Browner deftly handed a regulatory lemon \nto the Bush administration that she was unwilling to impose during the \nClinton administration. What a courageous move.\n  I am very proud that President Bush and his EPA Administrator, Mike \nLeavitt, have shown leadership where President Clinton and Carol \nBrowner fumbled and failed. In fact, Administrator Leavitt testified \nbefore the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air in a \nhearing on April 1, 2004. In questioning, the Administrator ably drew \nthe line between fact and fiction regarding the President's proposals \nregulating mercury from powerplants. I want to read to you one of his \nquotes. The Administrator explained:\n\n       One fiction is that the EPA does not view mercury as a \n     toxin. The fact is mercury is a toxin and it needs to be \n     reduced. Another fiction is that somehow the agency is \n     seeking the Administration to roll back standards. The fact \n     is there has never been a standard, this will be the first \n     time that we will have regulated mercury from power plants in \n     our Nation's history and we want to do it right.\n\n  Now, that is what Administrator Leavitt said, reemphasizing there has \nbeen no regulation on mercury.\n  Why shouldn't we propose the right mercury rule based on sound \nscience? There are no existing control standards for utility mercury \nemissions, so how can President Bush weaken a control standard for \nmercury that does not exist? That simply does not make sense.\n  The NRDC has been a prominent national special interest group for \nmany years. So why would the NRDC run such an ad that is completely \nfalse? I believe the answer to that question leads me to the second \nreason this ad was of particular interest to me.\n  I had this advertisement enlarged to highlight one particular part of \nit. Keep in mind, this was a full-page ad that cost, as I understand \nit, around $110,000 for 1 day.\n  This is what was on the bottom, if you will notice the perforated \nblock at the end of the full-page ad circled in red. I especially \nwanted to highlight this portion of the ad pictured on the chart \nbecause this block is the reason why this ad ran. This perforated block \nis a contribution form. The contribution form states:\n\n       Yes, I want to join the Natural Resources Defense Council \n     and help thwart President Bush's plan to weaken controls on \n     toxic mercury.\n\n  This is the most important part:\n\n       Here is my tax deductible gift of $ [blank].\n\n  The form further states to ``make your check payable to the NRDC and \nmail it to the NRDC mercury campaign.''\n  I believe it is bad enough to run a false advertisement, but to \nsolicit charitable contributions based on that false advertisement is \nespecially troubling. The New York Times is widely distributed in my \nhome State of Oklahoma, as it is throughout the rest of the country. It \nwould be very disturbing to learn that based on a false ad, people are \nscared into contributing.\n  For the past several years, my State of Oklahoma has been rated in \nthe top 25 percent of States for charitable contributions per gross \nincome. It would greatly trouble me if even one of these contributors \nwas misled by any charitable solicitation.\n  The Council for Better Business Bureaus, a national organization, \ncompiles a Wise Giving Alliance report authorizing a seal of approval \nto charities that meet the organization's standards. One of the \nstandards the council has established to measure charities deals with \nsolicitations by those charities. Part C of those standards states the \nfollowing:\n\n       1. Solicitations and informational materials, distributed \n     by any means, shall be accurate, truthful and not misleading, \n     both in whole and in part.\n       2. Soliciting organizations shall substantiate on request \n     that solicitations and informational materials, distributed \n     by any means, are accurate, truthful and not misleading in \n     whole or in part.\n\n  The NRDC, describing itself as a charity, should substantiate this \nfalse advertisement. The President has proposed the first controls on \nmercury emissions from powerplants, the first ever. The Better Business \nBureau should hold the NRDC accountable for their purposefully \nmisleading statements. However, NRDC's irresponsibility is sanctionable \nin other manners as well.\n  Solicitations by charitable organizations are regulated in part by \nFederal statutes and case law. However, the solicitation of charitable \ncontributions is mainly regulated by individual State law, and \nviolations of solicitation statutes can be prosecuted under state law. \nSolicitation by charitable organizations is strictly regulated against \nfraud and misleading advertisement under the Oklahoma statutes. \nOklahoma State law reads in relevant part:\n\n       Any person [or organization] who attempts to solicit any \n     contribution as a charitable organization by means of \n     knowingly false or misleading advertisement shall lose its \n     status as a tax exempt organization and upon conviction be \n     guilty of a felony.\n\n  This criminal liability extends to all officers and agents of the \ncharity involved in the solicitation. We take this very seriously in \nOklahoma. At least 40 other States have just as strict statutes against \nsoliciting contributions by misleading advertising.\n\n  Arguably this ad by NRDC may be unlawful in as many as 40 other \nStates that also have charitable solicitation statutes. This \nadvertisement by the NRDC and MoveOn.org explicitly states the \nPresident is weakening mercury standards while they are trying to \nswindle contributions from people all across the country who may see \nthis advertisement. I don't know what else this ad represents, but \nspecifically NRDC, which describes itself as a charitable organization \non its Web site, soliciting contributions by making knowingly false \nstatements to cheat people out of contributions--in Oklahoma, that \ncould make you a felon.\n  The most shocking part of this is not even that NRDC is running a \ncompletely false ad or NRDC is running a completely false ad simply to \nfleece people for contributions; the most shocking part is the American \ntaxpayer subsidizes the NRDC hundreds of thousands of dollars each year \nto conduct this type of activity. Public IRS\n\n[[Page S4194]]\n\nrecords for the last several years demonstrate NRDC regularly receives \nthousands of Federal grant dollars each year. In 2002, the NRDC \nreceived more than a half million dollars in government grants. In \n2003, the NRDC was additionally awarded more than half a million \ndollars again in government grants. The cycle continues year after year \nafter year.\n  The Environment and Public Works Committee has oversight jurisdiction \nover several Federal agencies. I believe my committee has the \nobligation to ensure Federal funds allocated to these agencies are used \nresponsibly.\n  One agency in particular under the jurisdiction of the committee I \nchair, the Committee on the Environment and Public Works, is the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The committee has the responsibility \nto assure American taxpayers their money is going toward accomplishing \nthe EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment.\n  On March 3, my committee held its first hearing into the matter in \nwhich EPA allocates grants each year. The EPA is a granting agency, \nallocating more than half of its $8 billion annual budget in grants to \nState, local, tribal governments, educational institutions, nonprofit \norganizations, and a variety of other recipients. I announced at the \nhearing the committee was going to take its oversight responsibilities \nseriously in regard to grants management, and I intend to take this \nresponsibility seriously until real changes are made in grants \nmanagement.\n  The committee heard testimony of problems with grants management. I \nam confident we will begin to make real changes with the leadership of \nthe Bush administration and Administrator Leavitt.\n  However, the NRDC, for example, has made it a matter of doing \nbusiness to apply for Federal grant awards that I believe help \nsubsidize it to run ads such as this one. It costs more than $110,000 a \nday to run a full-page ad in the New York Times. The NRDC and \nMoveOn.org are spending thousands of dollars to purposely misrepresent \nthe Bush environmental record and scare people into contributing based \non those false representations.\n  I am announcing that I am sending letters today to the two largest \njudicial jurisdictions in Oklahoma and requesting those district \nattorneys to investigate the legality of this advertisement in \nOklahoma. I am also sending a letter to the Better Business Bureau \nrequesting that organization to more carefully consider this false \nadvertisement in their rating of the NRDC in awarding their Wise Giving \nAlliance seal and ask that it formally request NRDC to substantiate its \nbaseless claim.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all three letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         U.S. Senate, Committee on\n\n\n                                 Environment and Public Works,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2004.\n     Hon. Tim Harris,\n     District Attorney, Tulsa County Courthouse,\n     Tulsa, OK.\n       Dear Tim: I am writing to bring to your attention an \n     advertisement that ran in the New York Times on March 26, \n     2004. A copy of this advertisement is attached to this \n     letter. I wanted to highlight issues of concern to me in this \n     advertisement. The New York Times is widely distributed in \n     Tulsa, Oklahoma, throughout Oklahoma, and the rest of the \n     country. This advertisement makes claims that due to \n     President Bush's policies concerning environmental protection \n     specifically concerned regulations on mercury emissions from \n     public utilities, more toxic mercury will be emitted into the \n     air. It pictures President Bush next to a picture of a power \n     plant billowing with smoke, and specifically solicits \n     contributions to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a IRS \n     designated 501(c)(3) organization, to ``help thwart President \n     Bush's plan to weaken controls on toxic mercury.''\n       As you are aware, I am Chairman of the U.S. Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works, so this \n     advertisement was of particular interest to me. One of the \n     issues before this Congress is regulation emissions from \n     power plants. President Bush has proposed the first controls \n     on toxic mercury emissions from utilities. Currently there \n     are no existing controls on mercury emissions from utilities. \n     The Clinton Administration had eight years to propose such \n     controls and did not. I believe NRDC's claim that President \n     Bush is trying to weaken control on mercury pollution is \n     completely false and simply an effort to raise contributions.\n       It is irresponsible enough that NRDC runs false \n     advertising, however, it is also attempting to solicit \n     contributions as a 501(c)(3) and self-described charitable \n     organization.\n       I understand that there are federal statues governing \n     charitable solicitations, but I also know that Oklahoma state \n     statutes address perceived false solicitation by a charitable \n     organization under The Oklahoma Solicitation of Charitable \n     Contributions Act (18 Okl.St.Ann. Sec. 552.1 et seq). What I \n     find particularly interesting is the penalties section of the \n     Act stating the following:\n       ``Any person who solicits or attempts to solicit any \n     contribution as a charitable organization or for a charitable \n     purpose by means of knowingly false or misleading \n     representation, advertisement or promise or any person \n     violating the provisions of this act, including the filing of \n     false information hereunder, shall lose its status as a tax-\n     exempt organization, and shall be taxed in the same manner \n     and at the same rate as any other corporation, and shall upon \n     conviction be guilty of a felony punishable by a fine not to \n     exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment in \n     the State Penitentiary for not more than two (2) years, or by \n     both such fine and imprisonment, and every officer or agent \n     of a charitable organization who authorizes or conducts \n     illegal solicitations shall be jointly and severally liable \n     for such fine.'' (18 Okl.St.Ann. Sec. 552.18).\n       I know that your office is continually engaged in \n     prosecuting hundreds of felony cases each year with \n     tremendous success. As a resident of your jurisdiction, I \n     appreciate the work of your office. Any attention that your \n     office could provide to this matter would be greatly \n     appreciated. I intend to highlight the irresponsible \n     activities, like the enclosed advertisement, by groups like \n     NRDC that the federal government subsidizes with hundreds of \n     thousands of taxpayer dollars in grants and other financial \n     assistance each year.\n       Thank you again for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Inhofe,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   First Arsenic Now Mercury--George Bush's EPA and the Politics of \n                               Pollution\n\n       America learned this week that tuna, and many other fish, \n     can contain harmful levels of toxic mercury. Forty-five \n     states already post warnings of mercury contamination in \n     their lakes and streams. So why is President Bush trying to \n     weaken controls on mercury pollution?\n       It's deja vu all over again. Early in his presidency, \n     George Bush tried to allow more arsenic in drinking water. \n     Now, he wants the EPA to let coal-fired power plants treat \n     their mercury pollution as ``non-hazardous'' even though \n     mercury threatens pregnant women and children.\n       The Bush administration's ploy would allow coal-fired power \n     plants to put more mercury into the air, where it rains down \n     on lakes and oceans, is swallowed by fish, and could wind up \n     on your plate. Exposure to mercury can cause learning \n     disabilities and neurological damage in kids and the \n     developing fetus.\n       Guess who is praising this scheme? Coal power companies, \n     who are big mercury polluters and big political contributors, \n     too.\n\n\n                        the mercury money trail\n\n       The big mercury polluters and their trade associations are \n     aggressive political players in Washington. Their executives \n     and PACs are also generous political donors. It's no surprise \n     that the Bush administration is following the industry's \n     script for weakening mercury regulations.\n       Last time around, President Bush had to back down on \n     arsenic in the face of a massive outcry from people across \n     the political spectrum.\n       Let's make history repeat itself.\n       Tell President Bush to get serious about reducing mercury \n     pollution. Our kids deserve no less. Let the Bush \n     administration and the EPA hear your voice about its proposed \n     mercury rule.

Wes Lane,\n     District Attorney, Oklahoma County Courthouse, Oklahoma City, \n         OK.\n       Dear West: I am writing to bring to your attention an \n     advertisement that ran in the New York Times on March 26, \n     2004. A copy of this advertisement is attached to this \n     letter. I wanted to highlight issues of concern to me in this \n     advertisement. The New York Times is widely distributed in \n     Oklahoma City, throughout Oklahoma, and the rest of the \n     country. This advertisement makes claims that due to \n     President Bush's policies concerning environmental protection \n     specifically concerning regulations on mercury emissions from \n     public utilities, more toxic mercury will be emitted into the \n     air. It pictures President Bush next to a picture of a power \n     plant billowing with smoke, and specifically solicits \n     contributions to the Natural Resources Defense Council, a IRS \n     designated 501(c)(3) organization, to ``help thwart President \n     Bush's plan to weaken controls on toxic mercury.''\n       As you are aware, I am Chairman of the U.S. Senate \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works, so this \n     advertisement was of particular interest to me. One of the \n     being considered before this Congress is regulation on \n     emissions from power plants. President Bush has proposed the \n     first controls on toxic\n\n[[Page S4195]]\n\n     mercury emissions from utilities. Currently there are no \n     existing controls on mercury emissions from public utilities. \n     The Clinton Administration had eight years to propose such \n     controls and did not. I believe NRDC's claim that President \n     Bush is trying to weaken control on mercury pollution is \n     completely false and simply an effort to raise contributions.\n       It is irresponsible enough that NRDC runs false \n     advertising, however, it is also attempting to solicit \n     contributions as a 501(c)(3) organization and self-described \n     charitable organization.\n       I understand that there are federal statutes governing \n     charitable solicitations, but I also know that Oklahoma state \n     statues address perceived false solicitation by a charitable \n     organization under The Oklahoma Solicitation of Charitable \n     Contributions Act (18 Okl.St.Ann. Sec. 552.1 et seq). What I \n     find particularly interesting is the penalties section of the \n     Act stating the following:\n       Any person who solicits or attempts to solicit any \n     contribution as a charitable organization or for a charitable \n     purpose by means of knowingly false or misleading \n     representation, advertisement or promise or any person \n     violating the provisions of this act, including the filing of \n     false information hereunder, shall lose its status as a tax-\n     exempt organization, and shall be taxed in the same manner \n     and at the same rate as any other corporation, and shall upon \n     conviction be guilty of a felony punishable by a fine not to \n     exceed One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment in \n     the State Penitentiary for not more than two (2) years, or by \n     both such fine and imprisonment, and every officer or agent \n     of a charitable organization who authorizes or conducts \n     illegal solicitations shall be jointly and severally liable \n     for such fine.'' (18 Okl.St.Ann. Sec. 552.18).\n       I know that your office is continually engaged in \n     prosecuting hundreds of felony cases each year with \n     tremendous success. Any attention that your office could \n     provide to this matter would be greatly appreciated. I intend \n     to highlight the irresponsible activities, like the enclosed \n     advertisement, by groups like NRDC that the federal \n     government subsidizes with hundreds of thousands of taxpayer \n     dollars by way of grants and other financial assistance each \n     year.\n       Thank you again for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M.

A copy of this advertisement is attached to this \n     letter. I wanted to highlight issues of concern to me in this \n     advertisement. The New York Times is widely distributed \n     throughout the country. This advertisement makes claims that \n     due to President Bush's policies concerning environmental \n     protection specifically concerning regulations on mercury \n     emissions from public utilities, more toxic mercury will be \n     emitted into the air. It pictures President Bush next to a \n     picture of a power plant billowing with smoke, and \n     specifically solicits contributions to the Natural Resources \n     Defense Council, a IRS designated 501(c)(3) organization, to \n     ``help thwart President Bush's plan to weaken controls on \n     toxic mercury.''\n        As Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment \n     and Public Works, this advertisement was of particular \n     interest to me. One of the issues considered before the \n     Congress is multi-emissions legislation. On December 15, \n     2003, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first \n     controls on toxic mercury emissions from power plants. \n     Currently there are no existing controls on mercury emissions \n     from public utilities. I believe NRDC's claim that President \n     Bush is trying to weaken controls on mercury pollution is \n     completely false and simply an effort to raise contributions.\n        It is irresponsible enough that NRDC runs false \n     advertising, however, it is also attempting to solicit \n     contributions as a 501(c)(3) organization and self-described \n     charitable organization.\n        I understand that the council for Better Business Bureaus \n     rates charities by its Wise Giving Alliance standards \n     requiring that solicitations be ``accurate, truthful, and not \n     misleading in whole and in part'' and that charities be \n     required to substantiate all claims. I request that the \n     Council require the NRDC to substantiate its claims and \n     consider this false advertisement in future ratings of this \n     charity.\n        Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Inhofe,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. A couple years ago, I read a series of articles in the \nSacramento Bee highlighting the facade of many environmental groups. \nThe article made the point that today's environmental groups, like \nNRDC, are more about their own prosperity than environmental \nprotection. I still have those articles in my office. I thought one \nparticular quote was especially fitting.\n  The author wrote of environmental groups:\n\n       Competition for money and members is keen. Litigation is \n     blood sport. Crises, real or not, is a commodity, and slogans \n     and sound bites masquerade as scientific fact.\n\n  That quote was written in 2001. It is still more true today in 2004. \nBut it is not something new. That quote captures the way NRDC and its \ncohorts have been doing business for years. They should be responsible. \nThey should be truthful. This type of activity goes beyond what the \nNRDC does with Federal tax dollars, but I intend to explore what NRDC \nand groups like it are also publishing and the extent of the rampant \nfalse claims made by these groups the American taxpayers help to fund \neach year.\n  We are not going to allow this to continue. They are getting into the \ntypes of discretionary grants we are dealing with through the EPA and \nother agencies. It is shameful that it is going on. We are now in a \nposition, with the committee I chair, to do something about it. We \nintend to do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, might I inquire as to how much time I \nwould have to speak on the floor now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIowa has been allotted 15 minutes to speak in morning business.\n\n\n                   Refocusing Our Health Care System\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, last week the Labor, Health, and Human \nServices Subcommittee of Appropriations held a hearing in my State of \nIowa. I wanted to learn more about the medical and financial \nramifications of chronic conditions such as obesity, tobacco use, \nmental illness, and lack of physical activity. I come away from that \nhearing and other hearings that we have had in Washington, and others \nwe have had going back probably over a dozen years, even more convinced \nthat we need to refocus our health care system toward wellness and \nprevention. I am convinced now more than ever that we really do not \nhave a health care system in America. We have a ``sick care system'' in \nAmerica. I will say more about that in a moment.\n  At the hearing and at others before that, we heard the familiar \nlitany of grim statistics associated with these chronic conditions. But \nwe also heard from Iowans, students and adults, who are taking matters \ninto their own hands, doing innovative things to promote wellness and \nhealthier living in their communities.\n  In the United States we spend in excess of $1.5 trillion a year on \nhealth care. Fully 75 percent of that total is accounted for by chronic \ndiseases, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes. What these diseases \nhave in common is, in so many cases, they are preventable. In the \nUnited States we fail to make an up-front investment in prevention, so \nwe end up spending hundreds of billions on hospitalization, treatment, \nand disability.\n  This is foolish, and clearly is unsustainable. We need a new paradigm \nin American health care. We need a prevention paradigm. As I said, \nright now we have a sick care system in the United States. If you get \nsick, one way or another you get care, either through health insurance \nor through Medicaid, Medicare, or something like that. Of course we \nknow we have 43 million uninsured who do not have access, even, many \ntimes, to our sick care system. But what we need is a genuine health \ncare system, a system focused on wellness and prevention, a system \nfocused on keeping you healthy in the first place.\n  Consider the cost of major chronic diseases, diseases that in many \ncases are preventable. The annual costs for cardiovascular disease are \nabout $352 billion; for obesity, $117 billion a year; for diabetes, \n$132 billion a year; for smoking, more than $75 billion a year; and for \nuntreated mental illness, $79 billion a year. Indeed, major depression \nis the leading cause of disability in the United States.\n\n[[Page S4196]]\n\n  If I bought a new car and I drove that car off the lot and I never \nmaintained it, I never checked the oil, I never changed the oil, I \nnever checked the transmission fluid, never got it tuned up, I just \ndrove it, you would think I was crazy, not to mention grossly \nirresponsible. The commonsense principle with an automobile is: Pay a \nlittle now, keep it maintained, or you are going to pay a whole lot \nlater for a new engine.\n  It is the same with our national health priorities. Right now our \nsystem is in a downward spiral. We are not paying a little now so we \nare paying a whole lot later. If we are serious about bringing down \nhealth care costs, we must get people access to preventive care. We \nmust give people the tools they need to stay healthy. We must build \nincentives throughout the entire society, incentives for prevention and \nwellness. This will take a sustained commitment from government, \nschools, communities, employers, health officials, and of course the \nfood industries. But this can have a huge payoff for individuals and \nfamilies, for employers, for society, and for the economy at large.\n\n  One condition in particular is fast becoming our Nation's leading \npublic health threat: being overweight and obesity. Several weeks ago a \nnew study came out that confirms what many of us already know. Obesity, \nunhealthy diets, and lack of physical activity have made us a nation at \nrisk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did a study that \ndetermined that poor diet and lack of physical activity are now the \nsecond leading cause of death in the United States, contributing to at \nleast 400,000 deaths annually.\n  I think this chart shows the startling statistics very clearly. This \nis from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The actual \ncause of death in the United States in 1990 from tobacco was 400,000. \nBy the year 2000 the cause of death by tobacco was 435,000. But look at \nthis. Poor diet and physical inactivity, in 1990: 300,000 deaths; by \n2000, 400,000 deaths. So while the cause of death from tobacco use had \ngone up less than 10 percent in 10 years, the cause of death from poor \ndiet, obesity, and physical inactivity went up 33 percent in one \ndecade. It is now the second leading cause of death in the United \nStates.\n  One of the authors of this study was the Director of the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, Dr. Julie Gerberding. The media and the \nAmerican public increasingly recognize this growing crisis. Seemingly \nevery day I open the paper and read about the public health impacts of \nchronic disease. A recent cover of the Economist magazine hit the nail \non the head. If we don't act now and act aggressively, the progress we \nhave made in promoting health and fighting disease, all of the public \nhealth gains we have made in the last couple of hundred years, will be \ntotally wiped away.\n  I thought this illustration from the Economist showed the progress of \nhumankind as we became more and more like modern man--and then here we \nare, descending into obesity and overweight. That was the cover of the \nEconomist last December entitled ``The Shape of Things to Come.'' Of \ncourse, here he is, drinking his supersized soft drink, walking down \nthe road to chronic illness and disease.\n  In 1990, 1997, and 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention did a State-by-State obesity prevalence study. I am going to \nshow three charts which are startling in how they depict what is \nhappening just in the last 14 years in the United States. The first \nchart I will put up is obesity in the United States among adults in \n1990. In 1990, the dark shaded areas here are obesity rates between 10 \npercent and 14 percent. The light blue areas are States where we have \nless than 10 percent incidence of obesity. For the white States we just \ndidn't have data. But as you can see, in 1990 no State had a prevalence \nof obesity over 15 percent--not one. All of the States were less than \n15 percent or less than 10 percent. That was in 1990.\n  Now let's take a look at 1997. By 1997, here we have some orange \nStates coming up now which we didn't see in 1990. The orange States \nmean that the prevalence of obesity is over 15 percent. Now we have \nthese States with a prevalence of obesity over 15 percent. Remember all \nthose blue States that were less than 15 percent? It is now 15 to 20 \npercent. So all of the dark areas are now over 15 percent. And only a \nfew States here are from 10 percent to 15 percent, but no State has an \nincidence of less than 10 percent now. That is just in less than 7 \nyears. That is 1997. Keep in mind now we have these three States, and \nthe majority of the States now are between 15 and 20 percent.\n  Let's take a look at what happened in 2002. Here is the real shocker. \nLook at all the orange States. These are the States now where the \nincidence of obesity is 20 percent to 24 percent. Now we have three red \nStates where the incidence is over 25 percent. We have a few States \nhere below 20 percent. Now we have no States less than 15 percent.\n  If I could have the first chart of 1990, I want to show the \ncomparison. Here we have in 1990 no States with an incidence of obesity \nof over 15 percent. By 2002, according to the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, three States are over 25 percent, the vast \nmajority of States are over 20 percent, and the rest of the country \nover 15 percent. In 1990, we didn't have one State that fit the pattern \nwe see in the United States now. That is what has happened in 14 years. \nNow we see even some States exceeding 25 percent. We see the trend.\n  Actually, the story is even worse than this. The data on these charts \nis based on self-reported weight, which tends to be significantly \nunderstated, as you might imagine. As catastrophic as this chart of \n2002 appears, it actually understates the extent of the obesity \nepidemic. If you use reported data rather than self-reported, obesity \nrates are much higher. In fact, using this scientific approach, we \nlearned that almost two out of every three Americans are either \noverweight or obese. Think about that. Right now, only one in three \nAmericans is within their weight range for their height.\n  Obesity takes a terrible toll on a person's health. It can lead to \ndiabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and numerous \nother chronic diseases. Incredibly, obesity causes more chronic \nconditions than either smoking or alcoholism.\n  This is what this chart shows. This is again from the Centers for \nDisease Control. We have a higher incidence of the number of chronic \nconditions associated with health behavior. The No. 1 incidence of \nchronic condition is aging. The older you get, the more liable you are \nto get a chronic condition. Aging from 30 to 50 has the highest \nincidence of a chronic disease. Second only to that is obesity, and it \nis almost the same. Being obese is like aging from 30 to 50. If you are \n30 years old and you are obese, you might as well be 50 years old in \nterms of susceptibility to a chronic disease.\n  Here is smoking. It is down here quite a ways. Just being overweight \nis down here. Drinking, past smoker, and obesity. In fact, right now \nobesity is, as I said, the second largest killer of people in this \ncountry.\n  Thus far, Congress has not been willing to adequately take on the \nchallenge of obesity and the challenge of encouraging healthy choices \nand lifestyles. It is time for the Senate to lead in a new direction by \nencouraging wellness and prevention.\n  To that end, I am currently working with others on several \ninitiatives to create a healthier workplace and a healthier environment \nfor our Senate family. In March, I sent a letter to the Senate Rules \nCommittee to request that signs be placed next to elevator buttons and \nat the entrances to stairwells and at the base of escalators \nencouraging people to use the stairs. Just the other day, I heard \nsomeone on the elevator say they wanted to use the stairs, but they \ndidn't because they couldn't find them.\n  The other day I happened to visit Secretary Thompson down at HHS. \nThey have signs right there by the elevators and the doors encouraging \npeople to take a flight of stairs rather than riding the elevator.\n  I have also been in discussions with the Senate cafeteria on the \nmatter of food labeling. To their credit, they already have food \nlabeling available on their Web site. But I would like to see the \nSenate cafeteria go the next step by including nutrition information on \nmenus or handouts that customers can pick up when they enter one of the \nSenate restaurants. If Ruby Tuesday's can do it and put all of the \ninformation\n\n[[Page S4197]]\n\non their menus, why can't we in the Senate cafeterias?\n\n  I have also developed what I called the ``Harkin Health Challenge'' \nto promote wellness for my staff here and back in Iowa. This is a \ncomprehensive workplace wellness program that addresses stress \nmanagement, nutrition, physical, wellness screenings, and, of course, \nsmoking cessation.\n  Some believe there should be no role for the government in curbing \nobesity. Some believe this is a matter of personal responsibility. I \ndon't agree. We can take steps to encourage and facilitate healthy \nlifestyles. We can make sure ordinary Americans have the tools and \ninformation they need to make informed healthy choices and be more \nresponsible for their own health.\n  We are about to pass a highway bill of approximately $300 billion for \nhighways, roads, and bridges. We tried to get an attachment to that \nbill to promote bike paths along our highways. I saw a figure the other \nday about how much less young people ride bikes today than they did 15 \nor 20 years ago. Ask yourselves as you drive down one of our busy \nthoroughfares or streets: Would you ride a bike down there during rush \nhour traffic? Of course not. You look to the side and there are no bike \npaths. There are no walkways for people to have access. We have streets \nnow that do not even have sidewalks by them, let alone a bike path. I \nthink when we invest taxpayers' money to build highways, roads, and \nbridges, we ought to mandate that, as a part of that, there ought to be \nan access for bike and/or walking paths next to those streets.\n  I have already introduced legislation that would require menu \nlabeling in chain restaurants, but I can already hear objections that \nthis will be too expensive. It will be a burden on businesses, for \nexample, to put all of their information on menus. I mentioned that \nRuby Tuesday's already announced plans to implement food labeling in \nits restaurants. Clearly they don't consider this to be too expensive. \nThey made a hardheaded corporate decision that it was both doable and \ngood for business.\n  I remember the same objections which were raised when Congress first \npassed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act to require labeling of \nretail foods and packaged foods. But lo and behold, years later, the \nsky has not fallen. To the contrary, consumers like labeling. When they \ngo into the grocery store, they pick up boxes, cans, and packages and \nthey read the nutrition labeling. They rely on those labels to help \nthem make informed healthy choices.\n  Consumers say they want nutrition information available when they \nmake menu selections at restaurants. Yet, while they have access to \nexcellent nutrition information at supermarkets when they go to buy \npackaged foods, when they go to a restaurant, consumers have to resort \nto guessing and estimating.\n  What about our special responsibility to the children? The food \nindustry spends more than $12 billion a year bombarding our kids with \nadvertisements through television, movies, magazines, and the Internet. \nI don't have to tell you that they are not advertising broccoli and \napples and orange juice. The majority of these ads are for candy and \nfast food--foods that are higher in sugar, salt, fat, and calories.\n  Today, specialty marketing firms have made a science out of \ninfluencing children to buy a particular candy or to go to a particular \nfast-food restaurant. Yes, parents have a responsibility to shield \ntheir kids from harmful influences of all kinds. But what about \ncorporate responsibility? What about corporate ethics? What about our \nGovernment's responsibility to make sure our children have a healthy \nenvironment?\n  Children, especially those under 8 years of age, don't always have \nthe ability to distinguish fact from fiction. The number of TV ads that \nkids see over the course of their childhood has doubled from 20,000 to \n40,000; meanwhile, the percentage of children who are overweight or \nobese has also doubled. The percentage of overweight or obese teens \nhas, in fact, tripled. The United States right now has a higher \npercentage of overweight teens than any other industrialized country.\n  We also need to take steps to reduce the junk food that our children \nare getting at schools. The GAO found that 43 percent of elementary \nschools, 74 percent of middle schools, and 98 percent of high schools \nhave vending machines, school snack bars, or other food sources outside \nof the school lunch and school breakfast programs. We know that when \nkids have access to vending machines and snack bars and a la carte \nlines at school, bad things happen. Kids' consumption of milk, fruits, \nand vegetables goes down, and their intake of sodas and fried foods \nskyrockets. This is one more area where Congress has a responsibility \nto intervene to protect our children.\n\n  I had this brought home to me the other day when it was pointed out \nthat a 20-ounce size soft drink--Coke, Pepsi, all the soft drinks--has \nthe equivalent of 15 teaspoons of sugar. I ask: As a parent, would you \nsend your kid to school during the day and say, Here are 15 teaspoons \nof sugar, please eat this. No parent would want to do that. Yet when \nthat kid goes to school and buys a 20-ounce soft drink, that is exactly \nwhat they are getting. And they will probably have two of them during \nthe day. That is 30 teaspoons of sugar in 1 day.\n  Go home, take 15 teaspoons of sugar, put it in a cup and see if you \nwould like to eat that. Or do 30 teaspoons, the equivalent of what a \nlot of kids are drinking today. No wonder obesity among teenagers has \ntripled. No wonder our teenagers in this country are more obese than \nteenagers in any other industrialized country in the world.\n  We have a responsibility; parents have a responsibility; schools have \na responsibility. But it is Congress that funds the school lunch and \nschool breakfast programs and the nutrition programs. This year we will \nreauthorize the nutrition program, school lunches and school \nbreakfasts. We will reauthorize that this year.\n  What will we do as Senators and Congressmen to help promote healthier \neating and healthier lifestyle choices among our kids in school? Do we \nhave a responsibility? You bet we do. I hope we will step up to that \nresponsibility when the nutrition reauthorization bill comes through \nthe committee to the Senate.\n  In the coming months, I will be announcing a package of bills and \ninitiatives focusing on wellness, focusing on preventing chronic \ndiseases. The emphasis will be on nutrition, physical activity, mental \nhealth, tobacco cessation. It will stress prevention, consumer \nawareness, responsible marketing practices, and wellness programs in \nschools, communities, and the workplace.\n  We face an obesity epidemic. We face an explosion of largely \npreventable chronic diseases. We face health care costs and health \ninsurance premiums that are skyrocketing. All of these things are \nrelated. We have to meet our responsibilities. We as Senators must set \na good example: Walk more, use the stairs more, have information on all \nof our menus in all of our Senate cafeterias so we know exactly how \nmuch trans fats, calories, sodium we are getting with each meal \nordered, and also to do what we can in our official capacity to help \nsupport wellness and to support healthy lifestyles among our kids in \nschool and at daycare centers. That is where it starts. If we can get \nthe kids and teach them healthier lifestyles, healthier eating choices \nearly on, chances are that is what they will follow when they grow \nolder.\n  It seems to me the golden rule of holes is this: When you are in a \nhole and you find it is getting up to your shoulders or up to your \nhead, stop digging. We have dug one whopper of a hole in health care in \nthis country by failing to emphasize prevention and wellness. It is \ntime to stop digging. It is time to focus our attention on healthy \nlifestyle, prevention, wellness, providing incentives for businesses.\n  I hear about tax incentives for business to do this, and that we need \nmore tax incentives for businesses to provide wellness and prevention \nprograms at the worksite for people who work in small and large \nbusinesses. We need to provide the kind of support for our public \nschools to provide better choices for our kids, also.\n  I thank the indulgence of the Chair. I wanted to take this time to \ntalk about this and to alert my fellow Senators that I will be \nintroducing a package of wellness bills and I have been working with \nthe majority leader, a doctor, Senator Frist, on some of\n\n[[Page S4198]]\n\nthese items, especially about getting signs posted about trying to use \nthe stairs more often, about getting Senators wearing pedometers and \ndoing more walking, for us to set a good example for the rest of the \ncountry.\n  I am hopeful we can also use the nutrition reauthorization bill this \nyear to make some changes in how we approach how kids eat and what they \neat at school and what is available to them in terms of vending \nmachines, soft drinks, sugar, salt, that type of thing, and to get them \neating healthier at an early age.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  iraq\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it is the poet T.S. Eliot who reminds us, as \nif we needed to be reminded, that ``April is the cruelest month.'' How \nprescient his words ring this April 2004, as we reflect upon the \ndeepening crisis and the steadily mounting death toll in Iraq. This \nApril, this month in which millions of Americans marked the holiest \nseason of the Judeo-Christian calendar, has been an unholy nightmare \nfor American military forces and American policy in Iraq.\n  April 2004, 11 months after the President proclaimed the end of major \ncombat operations in Iraq, has proved to be the deadliest month for \nAmerican forces in Iraq since the onset of the war more than a year \nago. Major combat operations may have ended--let me repeat that: major \ncombat operations may have ended--as President Bush asserted nearly 1 \nyear ago, but major combat casualties have not. The ``Mission \nAccomplished'' banner under which President Bush spoke so confidently \non May 1, 2003, has come back to haunt us and to taunt us many times \nover.\n  In the weeks and months leading up to the war, Americans were assured \nby President Bush and his cadre of top advisers--most particularly Vice \nPresident Richard Cheney--that we would be greeted as liberators in \nIraq, our path to victory strewn with cheers and flowers. Those \nflowers, it now appears, are less like rose petals tossed at the feet \nof liberators and more like Eliot's mournful April lilacs--``Lilacs out \nof the deadland, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Dull roots with \nspring rain.''\n  April--April--has indeed become the cruelest month. Memory and desire \ncannot supplant reality in Iraq. More than 100 American military \npersonnel have been killed in Iraq so far this month, the highest \nnumber of deaths in a single month since the beginning of the war. In \nall, more than 700 American military members have died in Iraq since \nthe beginning of combat. Today, more than 1 year after the fall of \nBaghdad, America's military forces are being greeted in too many \nquarters of Iraq, not with flowers--not with flowers, not with \nflowers--but with gunfire, not with cheers but with jeers, nor as \nliberators but as occupiers--occupiers--oppressors.\n  In the harsh glare of hindsight, it is now clear that the President's \npreconceived notions of the war and the aftermath of the war in Iraq \nwere profoundly flawed. Even the President's Secretary of Defense--one \nof the supreme architects of the war in Iraq--has been forced to admit \nthat the battle has not gone according to the plan, that the level of \ncasualties, continuing so long after the fall of Baghdad, was neither \nanticipated nor planned for before the invasion.\n  And yet President Bush refuses to admit any flaws in his grand \nstrategy to invade Iraq to overthrow the regime of Saddam Hussein \nwithout giving adequate consideration to the potential perils awaiting \nAmerica in the seething streets and towns of post-war Iraq. Despite the \nfact that debate over the war in Iraq rages worldwide, despite the fact \nthat the American occupation is reeling from unexpected opposition from \nthe very people it was intended to liberate, still the President is \nhard pressed under questioning to come up with any mistakes that he \nmight have made in dealing with Iraq. What a sad, sad commentary.\n  In his press conference last week, President Bush acknowledged \n``tough weeks'' in Iraq, but he clung to his oft-repeated assertion \nthat Iraq is mostly stable, and shrugged off the violence of recent \nweeks as the work of a small faction of fanatical ``thugs'' and \nterrorists bent on imposing their will over the popular will of Iraq.\n  In this assessment, I hope and pray that the President is right.\n  For the sake of America's military families, for the sake of the \nmothers and fathers, for the sake of the wives and children who have \nhad to bear the burden of the increased violence in Iraq, I hope the \nPresident is right.\n  I hope that Iraq achieves stability and security soon. For while Iraq \nand the world may indeed be better off with Saddam Hussein behind bars, \nalas--alas--I do not believe that an Iraq in turmoil is either a boon \nto the Middle East or an asset to the security of the United States.\n  Instead of reflecting candidly on the current challenges in Iraq, \nPresident Bush would prefer to focus on his grandiose, grandiloquent \nvision for reforming the Middle East. In this he speaks in ideological, \nalmost messianic, cadences as he paints a picture of Iraq as a central \nfront not just in the war on terror but also in a battle of Biblical \nproportions pitting ``good'' against ``evil.''\n  President Bush is a man of absolutes. Either we stay the course in \nIraq or we cut and run. Those are the two choices: stay the course or \ncut and run. Either we fight terrorists on the streets of Iraq or we \nfight them on the streets of New York or Washington, DC. Either we \nsupport President Bush's policies absolutely or we give aid and comfort \nto the enemy. Those are the two choices. Do you believe it? I don't.\n\n  No, no, no, a thousand times no. Either-or propositions like those \ninvoked by the President to describe the war in Iraq are nothing more \nthan politically inspired slogans like last year's ill-advised \n``Mission Accomplished'' banner, designed to whip up emotions while \nmasking the complexity of national security considerations.\n  Fighting in the streets of Iraq has not prevented terrorists from \nstriking in Saudi Arabia or Bali or Madrid. Are you with me? And there \nis no guarantee--none--that it will prevent them from striking again in \nthe United States. Just this week, Homeland Security Secretary Tom \nRidge disclosed the formation of a Federal task force to respond to \nheightened threats that al-Qaida will strike again in the United \nStates, sometime before the November election. Significant events, \nincluding the dedication of the World War II Memorial in Washington and \nthe political conventions in New York and Boston, are among those \nviewed as prime targets for a new al-Qaida offensive.\n  This is the sobering reality. Osama bin Laden remains at large, and \nhis minions appear to be multiplying, not diminishing. That is \nsobering. That ought to curl your hair.\n  If anything, the war in Iraq has served as a rallying cry for anti-\nAmerican and antidemocratic extremists in the Middle East and beyond. \nSadly, given the distraction from the war on terror that the war in \nIraq has proved itself to be, the capture or killing of Osama bin \nLaden, when and if it comes, is likely to be an anticlimactic footnote \nto a widening and ever more deadly surge in independent national \nterrorism. Mark my words.\n  Despite the often invoked and patently misleading conclusion drawn by \nthe Bush administration, cutting and running is not the only \nalternative to staying the course in Iraq, especially when that course \nis fraught with disaster. Altering a flawed and dangerous course of \naction, seeking meaningful support from the international community, is \nanother alternative, one that this President is loathe to acknowledge \nbut evidently more than willing to embrace in the face of the calamity \nthat has befallen his own roadmap for Iraq.\n  For months, I and others have implored the President to return to the \nUnited Nations and to seek a greater role for the U.N. in the \noccupation, administration, and reconstruction of Iraq. Hear me. Hear \nme. Long before the war, we begged--didn't we? Yes--we begged the \nPresident to seek the support of the United Nations Security Council \nbefore invading Iraq. Were our pleas heeded? No. Our pleas fell upon \ndeaf ears.\n\n[[Page S4199]]\n\n  This administration was confident that it could go it alone. And it \nsaid so, did it not? Yes. It said: If you don't do it, we will. This \nadministration was confident it could go it alone with only a \nthreadbare coalition of the willing to paper over its unilateral \naction. How hollow that confidence now rings. In the face of disaster, \nin the face of mounting doubts among members of the coalition, the \nPresident has now been forced to seek shelter--Help me, Cassius, or I \nsink--under the wings of the United Nations. The Iraqis have rejected \nevery plan for transition of power put forward by the President's \nCoalition Provisional Authority. Our only hope left is that they will \nembrace a plan put forward by the United Nations, the very body the \nUnited States spurned when the President chose to invade Iraq without \nthe support of the U.N. Security Council. Irony scarcely begins to \ndescribe the current state of affairs.\n  The fact is, while espousing hard-line rhetoric and ironclad resolve, \nthis administration has ducked and bobbed and weaved at every \nopportunity. In the administration's ever-shifting explanation for the \nwar in Iraq, the face of our enemy has ricocheted over the past 12 \nmonths from Saddam Hussein and his Republican Guard to disgruntled \nBaathist dead-enders to foreign terrorists taking advantage of the \nunrest in Iraq to pursue their agenda of jihad to today's vague \nassortment of thugs and fanatics opposed to democracy for Iraq.\n  We hear the refrain. We hear the refrain: Stay the course. Stay the \ncourse. Stay the course. Well, exactly what course is it we are \nsupposed to be staying in Iraq? Is it to furnish more boys as cannon \nfodder? What is meant by stay the course? Is it to furnish more of our \nyoung men and women as cannon fodder to die in the streets of Iraq? Is \nthat what is meant when we hear the refrain: We shall stay the course, \nwe must stay the course?\n  The President failed to explain what that is supposed to mean to the \nAmerican people at his press conference. How did we get from protecting \nthe United States from the threat of weapons of mass destruction to the \nvague notion of fighting extremists opposed to democracy in Iraq? The \nPresident failed to explain that fact as well. Where were those \nextremists before the invasion? Why is it that they are emerging in \nforce only now, a full year after the fall of Baghdad? Could it be that \nthis administration has created America's own worst nightmare because \nof its colossal arrogance, its clumsy mistakes, and its painful \nmisjudgments on virtually every aspect of the war in Iraq?\n\n  These are not the questions of an unpatriotic or reckless opposition. \nWhere are the voices today in this Senate? It is not unpatriotic to ask \nquestions. It is not unpatriotic to voice opposition to the policies of \nthis administration. These are not questions intended to demoralize \nAmerica or to hearten our enemies. Rather, these are the questions that \na free and open society--the kind of society that the President \nenvisions for Iraq--is expected to pose of its leaders. These are the \nkind of questions that a democratic nation's leader is beholden to \nanswer. Dogmatic admonitions and grandiose allusions will not suffice. \nIn a democratic society, the people demand and the people deserve the \nsimple and unvarnished truth. So do the people's representatives in \nGovernment. They, too, demand, they are entitled to, and they deserve \nthe simple and unvarnished truth. Congress also demands and deserves \nthe simple and unvarnished truth from the executive branch.\n  This is a coequal branch of Government, Mr. Bush. As a coequal branch \nof Government, as the body in which the Constitution vests the power of \nthe purse, Congress requires the truth from the President, from the \nexecutive branch, from the Pentagon, from the Defense Department, from \nthe State Department, from the White House. This is what makes recent \nallegations in Bob Woodward's new book regarding the redirection of \nappropriated funds into clandestine appropriations for the war on Iraq \nso disturbing, and the American people ought to be disturbed. The \nAmerican people ought to ask questions, and their representatives in \nthis body ought to ask questions. If the President, as alleged in this \nbook, made the decision to wage war against Iraq and secretly spent \nappropriated funds to prepare for that war without prior consultation \nwith Congress, then the letter of the law, the intent of the law, the \nspirit of the law, and the constitutional power of the purse have been \nsubverted This would be not only a very grave breach of trust on the \npart of the executive branch, on the part of the administration, but \nalso a very grave abuse of power.\n  Mr. President, I hope with all my heart that Iraq will emerge from \nthe current chaos to become a free and democratic nation. I hope with \nall my heart that the sacrifices that America's military forces have \nendured in Iraq will be validated by reality, and not justified merely \non the basis of wishful thinking. The path forward is not yet clear, \nbut this I know: President Bush led America into a preemptive war that \nwas neither dictated by circumstances nor driven by events. President \nBush led America into a war of choice, a war that might well have been \navoided with patience and prudence. Would that we could read that \n``April is the cruelest month'' without reflecting on the cruel and \nterrible toll that the war on Iraq has taken on America's men and women \nin uniform in Iraq during this bloody and sorrowful month of April.\n  It is said in the King James version of the Holy Bible that of those \nto whom much is given, much is required. Mr. President, much is \nrequired of this administration and this President with regard to Iraq. \nThe American people expect answers, the American people expect a \njudicious strategy, and the American people expect a well-thought-out \nmilitary and diplomatic campaign. On all fronts, the American people \nhave been let down. A President who wages war and manages the aftermath \nof war by the seat of his pants is not what the American people either \nexpect or deserve. I fear that is what they are seeing in Iraq.\n  This President, having blundered into this war in Iraq, does not have \nmuch time left to get the stabilization of Iraq right. We have spent \nour blood and treasure in Iraq, and it is now time--past time--to \naggressively explore ways in which the burden on Americans can be \nmitigated. It is time to abandon the go-it-alone attitude, the go-it-\nalone, cocky, arrogant attitude established by this President.\n  It is time--long past time--for the President to admit to mistakes \nmade, to forsake his divisive either/or rhetoric, and to seek a way out \nof the deepening morass of Iraq with the full partnership of the United \nNations, the region, and the international community.\n  President Bush needs to drop all pretensions that the war in Iraq and \nthe battle for stability are going according to plan. Only by accepting \nthe fact that a bold new direction is needed to untangle the mess in \nIraq can this President extricate the United States from what is fast \nbecoming a quagmire. It is time for the President to set aside his \npride and to convene an international summit on the future of Iraq, \ncomposed of representatives of the Iraqi people, their Arab neighbors, \nNATO, and the United Nations. Then and only then will the Iraqi people \nbe in a position to chart their own future with the help of the \ninternational community. Then and only then will the United States be \nable to relinquish ownership of the tiger that it now holds by the \ntail.\n  America must alter its course in Iraq to deal with the volatile \nvacuum left by the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime. America must be \nprepared to fight terrorism wherever it rears its ugly head and not be \nlulled into the false belief that attacking terrorists overseas will \nstop them from attacking America on its homefront. Above all, Americans \nmust never be cowed into believing that questions are somehow \n``unpatriotic'' or that Presidents, even wartime Presidents, are ever \nabove answering them. And finally, Americans must remember that in this \ncountry there are no kings.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4200]]\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about S. 2290, the \npending bill on asbestos legislation before the Senate. Like many of my \ncolleagues before me, I also want to express great frustration because \nit does not seem as though we are moving the ball down the field on \nsomething that I think a lot of us believe is a very important issue. \nIt is one that demands to be addressed and looks for a legislative \nsolution that we are all trying to find.\n  Among the many issues that I hear about from my constituents, this is \none that very frequently shows up in our discussions and at townhall \nmeetings. A lot of people have suffered devastating injuries after \nexposure to asbestos. Families have lost loved ones. It is a real deal \nin people's lives.\n  I have heard from companies, CEOs, and people who are trying to \nmanage their company's liabilities, and it is a real problem. Insurance \ncompanies, many of which are headquartered in my State, have spoken \nabout this issue and my old industry, the financial industry, is \nconcerned about the penalties and its implications in the capital \nmarkets that are imposing very severe costs on defending companies and \ninsurers because of the crisis. This is something that we ought to \naddress.\n  Unfortunately, our current system is not working, and that is a \nreality for those who need it. It is not working for the defendant \ncompanies that want certainty for their business planning. It is not \nworking for insurance companies that face accelerating claims, and it \nis certainly not working for asbestos victims. We need to make sure \nthose who are truly injured receive the compensation they deserve in a \ntimely fashion and on a basis that is fair to all involved. It needs to \nbe done. We need to address it.\n  Decades of asbestos use and a coverup of its health effects have \nresulted in a massive occupational and environmental health crisis. By \nthe way, we are still having exposure developed by a lot of the imports \nthat we are now receiving into our Nation, where some of those who \nmanufacture abroad are not dealing with the issues we have begun to \ndeal with. It is a real killer, a silent killer, physically but also \nemotionally debilitating to many people across America.\n  Medical costs associated with asbestos-related diseases are \nastronomical. They are off the charts. It is not a matter of millions. \nIt is billions and it is an annual affair and it cries out to be \naddressed.\n  Hundreds of thousands of workers and their family members have \nsuffered and died from asbestos-related cancer and lung diseases. I \nthink the number is about 10,000 die each year. Approximately 24 \nmillion have been exposed. In my home State of New Jersey, which is an \nold manufacturing State, 2,700 people have been killed by asbestos \nsince 1979, and two of our counties in New Jersey are in the top 10 in \nthe Nation in those asbestos-related deaths. That is Camden and \nSomerset Counties. So this is a real deal for us. We would like to see \nthis addressed.\n  We cannot ignore the tragedy of these asbestos deaths and injuries. \nWe can and we should be able to come up with a workable solution. As I \nsaid, like many of my colleagues, I would like to see a national trust \nfund to compensate victims through a no-fault system, ensuring that \nthose who are most injured receive a just award as quickly as possible. \nIt should not be going on for 5 or 10 years. I hope we can agree that \nwe need to focus on paying those who are truly sick and that we must \npay those people fairly.\n\n  That is why I was pleased last year when the Judiciary Committee held \nbipartisan hearings on the issue, had bipartisan negotiations, and \nseemed to be making progress towards arriving at a fair and balanced \nsolution. Unfortunately, last year the Judiciary Committee reported out \na bill that did not have broad bipartisan support and was not, in my \nview at least, balanced in its approach to the issue.\n  The bill before us has gotten worse. Good amendments that were added \nin committee have been dropped, and the size of the fund, frankly, is \nat the low end of anyone's expectations of what is appropriate.\n  I will take a few moments to discuss what I see are some of the most \nglaring flaws in the bill that we are debating and reasons, at least \nright now as it stands, I cannot support it. First, the size of the \nfund is quite simply out of touch with reality. I hear estimates of \nanywhere from $100 billion to $300 billion as the cost of settlement \nthat people would expect for the probability of the associated problems \nwith asbestos, and we have picked the low end of that number as the \nbasis on which we are going to deal with it. The bill that was reported \nout of committee would have had $153 billion, and we have come up with \n$109 billion, absolutely at the very low end of any of the national \nestimates, any of the academic estimates of objective outside \nobservers. We are starting at the wrong place in the negotiation.\n  In addition to the anemic overall funding, the bill has other \nweaknesses. For example, the Hatch substitute deprives victims of \nexposure adequate compensation. Awards just remain far too low for many \nvictims with serious diseases that are an outgrowth of this. Funding \nwould not pay for victims' medical bills, let alone compensate their \nfamilies for any type of hardships.\n  To give an example, a worker with 15 years of asbestos exposure and \nlung cancer would be guaranteed only $25,000 in compensation. I do not \nsee how that relates to the risk of life that individuals would be \ntaking in that context.\n  In another example, victims with asbestos who lose 20 to 40 percent \nof breathing capacity or are disabled from work will receive only \n$85,000 for lost wages and medical costs. These numbers do not fit the \ncircumstance. Now, $25,000 barely gets a family of four above the \npoverty line, and we are talking about $25,000 and $85,000 in lost \nwages and medical costs that accrue to those things. We are not in the \nright ballpark.\n  The pending bill also guts a Biden amendment adopted in the committee \nwith strong bipartisan support to protect victims' rights in the event \nof fund insolvency. It would allow that once the fund was insolvent, if \nthat $109 billion was not enough, then bring claims back into State \ncourt. That was overwhelmingly supported in committee.\n  Given the low level of funding in this bill, insolvency obviously is \na problem. I believe it is unfair to ask the victims to give up their \nrights to enter into a fund without knowing that fund would have \nsufficient assets to cover the claims, and where do they go in those \ncircumstances. So it is another major problem.\n  The pending bill would also treat victims with pending claims \nunfairly. This one is really hard to swallow. It would wipe out the \nclaims of more than 300,000 people who have claims pending in the \ncurrent system, even those who have already received jury awards.\n  We are looking back into history and changing history. I don't \nunderstand why, when we have had a judicial process, we have come to a \nconclusion or we are even in the process of that, we want to stop, \nstart all over and move people into another system. It does not strike \nme as consistent with a commonsense sense of fairness. If you have an \naward, it ought to go through.\n  In addition, the bill significantly weakens key provisions that would \nprotect victims without an effective remedy during the transition to a \nnew system. The bill also lacks transparency with regard to companies \nand insurers and how they are going to contribute to the fund and in \nwhat amounts, which makes it difficult to determine whether companies \nare paying their fair share.\n  By the way, there is a lot of hooting and hollering among the \ninsurance companies. A lot of them oppose this because they don't know \nwhat their deal will be. There is no certainty here, either for the \nvictims or for a lot of the people who are going to participate here in \nfunding this trust fund. That doesn't make sense and I think it is a \nreal problem that also needs to be addressed. We need to amend it.\n  It also contains a windfall for certain companies. While we are \ntaking it away from some folks, we are certainly giving it to others. \nIt contains this windfall with regard to Halliburton, which has an \nestimated $4.8 billion in asbestos liability, but would only have to \npay $1.2 billion under the Hatch-Frist bill. Why them? Why are they \ngetting such a break, particularly after a judgment has already gone \nthrough? It is sort of the reciprocal or the reverse of what we already \nwere talking\n\n[[Page S4201]]\n\nabout with a lot of individuals. They are going to get slammed and \nsomebody here is going to get the advantage. They are going to apply it \nin a way that is very uneven and lacking in balance. That should be \naddressed.\n  This is not a fair and balanced approach to this problem. It is not \nfair to the injured victims or the families of those who died, and it \nis not fair to companies that want relief from the growing problem, and \nit doesn't provide for the certainty and planning I think corporate \nAmerica is looking for.\n  Let me take a moment to discuss what I think is also a misleading \nclaim by supporters of the bill. This one is actually hard to \nunderstand, how this gets any circulation at all. Unfortunately, this \nadministration, as a lot of us have talked about on other occasions, \nhas been weak in the record of creating jobs. I don't have to go \nthrough the litany of 2 million lost jobs, 8.4 million unemployed \nAmericans, 2.6 million private sector jobs lost. That was the only \nperiod of time, actually, since the Depression an administration has \nmore than likely overseen a period of decline in job growth in the \ncountry. But somehow we have decided this is a jobs bill; somehow this \nis going to create jobs.\n  There are those who will argue many of the asbestos companies have \nbeen forced into bankruptcy and that cost has seriously damaged the \nAmerican economy, particularly as it relates to jobs. The facts don't \nmeet the description. This is sometimes a fact-free arena. We make \nassertions and do not necessarily follow through. But if anybody does \nany serious analysis of what goes on in these companies that have gone \nthrough these reorganizations under chapter 11 protection, they will \nknow they have been able to use this device as a means to manage \nthrough their obligations and they are able to pay out some of their \nresponsibilities but it has kept their companies going. The truth is, \nthey have not gone out of business, many of them--most of them. Some \nare doing better than ever.\n\n  Let's take Halliburton, since I mentioned it once before. Halliburton \nhas agreed to compensate the innocent victims and companies poisoned \nwith a settlement of more than $4 billion. That is, of course, unless \nwe pass this legislation, then only $1.2 billion. In order to pursue \nthis settlement Halliburton has agreed to put two of its companies into \nchapter 11 temporarily until a court approves a trust arrangement to \ncompensate asbestos victims.\n  Meanwhile, Halliburton on its own Web site is telling its customers \nthat it:\n\n     . . . will continue in business and will continue to provide \n     all the excellent services our customers expect from us. In \n     other words, outside the asbestos and silica settlement, it \n     will be business as usual.\n\n  In what kind of shape are these companies that have chosen chapter 11 \nreorganization? The answer can be found in a new analysis conducted by \nProfessor George Benston of Emory of the seven largest asbestos \ncompanies that sought chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization protection \nin 2000 and 2001. This is a real study by someone trying to bring an \nobjective perspective. Professor Benston studied the asbestos companies \nand compared them to companies in their business that did not declare \nbankruptcy reorganization in order to determine how successful their \noperations would be under the supervision of the bankruptcy court. He \nconcluded:\n\n       On the whole, they essentially have increased or stabilized \n     their sales, assets, employment, and profitability, and have \n     projected increases. It is fair to say they are viable and \n     likely to be increasingly successful companies that should \n     generate funds to exit bankruptcy significantly stronger than \n     when they went in.\n\n  We are doing this because this is a jobs bill, when it is fair to say \nthey have increased or stabilized their sales, assets, employment, and \nprofitability, and have projected increases. Somehow or another, \nobjective evidence doesn't seem to match with the claims. This is \nhardly a jobs bill. The argument falls apart on the surface of it, as \nfar as I can tell.\n  So while I am sympathetic to the corporations that generally want to \nfulfill their obligations with respect to asbestos victims and \ncertainly I have an appreciation for their desire for serious financial \nplanning, if this asbestos bill is the best we can do, the \nadministration can do, the leadership--Senator Frist and Senator \nHatch--can do to create jobs in our country and address this problem, \nthen I think we have a lot higher objectives for which we need to set \nour standards.\n  That is why I think we ought to have a full debate. We ought to have \na lot of votes on amendments that will actually address a number of \nthese problems we talked about. I hope we can get back to those \nbipartisan negotiations, away from this floor, where we can talk about \nthe size of the trust fund, we can talk about some of this ex post \nfacto analysis about who is benefiting and who is not; where we can \nmake sure the general awards to victims are actually higher and there \nis some serious backstop if the fund doesn't actually have the \nresources to be able to deal with these issues.\n\n  We sure the heck ought to stop talking about this in a context that \nmakes no sense in economic reality, that this is a jobs bill. I go back \nto this. This is one of those things I think Americans across the board \nwant to see Congress act on. This is not something that has a \nRepublican or Democratic label. We want to find a resolution. I want to \nfind a resolution. We have to do that in a fair and balanced manner. I \nthought the Judiciary Committee made a lot of progress on this on the \nbill they reported out. That is not what we are working on.\n  I don't understand why we don't turn the clock back just a little bit \nand get on with some of the hard work that was done when we came up \nwith some of these bipartisan approaches to deal with this very thorny \nissue. On the basis of offering a helping hand to many victims and \ntheir families, for companies that need to have stability in their \nbalance sheet and the ability to make plans for the future, to reduce \nthe caseload we have in our court system, there are a lot of reasons we \nought to be moving in this area. We are not pulling together, sitting \ndown and negotiating a transaction formulation of legislation that \nmakes sense for everybody.\n  Everyone is going to have to give a little bit, but this is something \nthat could be done if we wanted to go to work to make it happen. The \nwill is there. Certainly the demand is there. I think there is a lot of \nground for positive, constructive dialog.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity \nto speak today regarding the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution \nAct. As debate draws to a close on the motion to proceed to \nconsideration of this bill, I take a few minutes to express my \nappreciation to those who have worked so hard over the past several \nyears to find a solution to what has become an enormous--and continues \nto grow every day--problem. I offer my views as to how this process can \nbe revived and lead to a satisfactory resolution yet this year.\n  First, a bit of history will be helpful. Soon after I arrived in the \nSenate in 2001, I approached then-Chairman Leahy of the Judiciary \nCommittee and indicated to him that I thought legislation was necessary \nto come up with a solution to compensate asbestos victims; if we worked \non it in an appropriate fashion, it could be passed. I knew the process \nwould be long and difficult, but I thought it was worth pursuing. If we \ndid not begin, we would never conclude that solution. Senator Leahy \nvery graciously agreed and held hearings to explore the feasibility of \nthis approach.\n  Following the elections of 2002, Chairman Hatch continued those \nefforts and began formulating a legislative proposal. I agreed to \ncosponsor that legislation, not because I supported everything in the \nbill, but because I believed it would provide an incentive for those \nwith a major stake in the resolution of this issue to begin discussions \naimed at solutions.\n  That strategy worked. Discussions began, the major issues were \nframed, the Judiciary Committee held 4 long\n\n[[Page S4202]]\n\ndays of markup, and a bill was reported out. However, there were \nproblems with the bill. Still, the process was moving forward. \nSometimes it felt like one step forward, two steps backward. But \nstakeholders continued to negotiate.\n  Senator Specter, to his credit, brought the parties together and \nworked on the array of issues other than values and dollar amounts. \nThat process was also extremely helpful in bringing us to the point \nwhere we are today.\n  The majority leader has now incorporated a number of the elements of \nthe Specter-Judge Becker negotiations into the bill before the Senate. \nUnfortunately, the bill before the Senate is not complete. It still \nlacks a consensus among the major stakeholders. That is why I have \nchosen not to cosponsor this substitute amendment when I was asked to \ndo so. It simply, in my judgment, is not ready. Several major issues \nhave not been resolved. I don't believe this is a bill that can be \nwritten on the floor of the Senate.\n  I do believe a solution can still be achieved yet this year if the \nleaders will make a renewed commitment to continue the process. With a \nvery limited time agreement, no more than 2 or 3 weeks at the most, and \nwith active involvement by leadership, I believe we can reach a \nsolution. It may inevitably be a solution that is least objectionable, \nbut at the very least we can arrive at a solution that almost every \nstakeholder can accept.\n  As a matter of information, a constituent of mine by the name of \nWarren Buffett--some of you may have heard of him--expressed to me his \nview that there probably is not anything more important that the \nCongress can do for the economy than to resolve this issue which \ncontinues to overhang our economy. The economic impact is important.\n  Of course, the most compelling reason to find a solution is not \nsimply to provide certainty to the economy; it is, in fact, to provide \nrelief to the many victims of the debilitating and deadly illnesses \ncaused by asbestos.\n  I know my colleagues understand the scope of the problem before the \nSenate. The suffering of the victims and their families has been \nbrought home to each of us. We all have many examples of those \nunfortunate victims and their situations. But I would like to \npersonalize it for my colleagues.\n\n  When I served as Governor, I had the pleasure of appointing an Omaha \nattorney by the name of Mike Amdor to the Nebraska District Court \nbench. Mike Amdor was a very good friend. I had known him and his \nfamily for years. His father had gone to law school with my late \nfather-in-law. I knew his mother when she was alive and worked with his \nfather in the insurance business.\n  I appointed him to the Nebraska District Court bench. He was a bright \nand vibrant lawyer, and he came to be a trusted and respected jurist. \nBut more important, he was a consummate family man, a devoted husband, \na father of five young children.\n  In late 1999, he began to experience serious health problems and was \nsoon diagnosed with mesothelioma. Despite a courageous and painful \nfight with the disease--and it looked at times as though he might be \nable to beat the odds and survive--he, unfortunately, passed away on \nNovember 28, 2002. Mike had been exposed to asbestos as a young man \nworking his way through college and law school. We all know that \nvirtually the only cause of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos.\n  Mike's family pursued legal action against those responsible for his \nexposure and obtained a series of settlements totaling $655,000. \nHowever, to date, his widow and five children have realized a total of \n$56,463.76 on those judgments. Fifty-six thousand dollars and change: \nless than 10 cents on the dollar because the defendants were bankrupt. \nUnder the terms of the trust fund legislation, which we are debating \nand working to achieve, his widow and family could receive $1 million.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter which I received yesterday from Judge Mike Amdor's widow.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Omaha, NE\n\n                                                   April 20, 2004.\n     Re Mike Amdor and the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution \n         Act of 2003, The FAIR Act, (S. 1125) Renumbered S. 2290.\n\n     Senator Ben Nelson,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nelson: I am writing to thank you for \n     sponsoring the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act of \n     2003. Your continued support of this legislation is very \n     important. As the spouse of a victim of asbestos I have a \n     personal interest in the success of this bill. There are many \n     others in the same situation and our numbers will continue to \n     grow because the onset of many of the effects of asbestos \n     exposure are not seen for many years.\n       You are familiar with the illness and death of my husband, \n     Michael Amdor. Please allow me to give you a short history of \n     his exposure to asbestos and the subsequent deadly illness he \n     suffered.\n       After finishing high school Mike worked at Physician's \n     Mutual Insurance during the summer of 1965. He worked in the \n     mailroom while an elevator was being installed through the \n     existing walls of the building. At this time there were no \n     existing requirements to contain the asbestos being disturbed \n     or removed during renovation of existing buildings. In 1971 \n     Mike worked for Northwestern Bell, now Qwest, in downtown \n     Omaha, NE. He was a computer operator and his job did not \n     involve using asbestos products. However, the building was \n     being remodeled during the time he was employed there. The \n     crews doing the remodeling during the daytime wore some \n     protective equipment because of the known presence of \n     asbestos in the area being remodeled. The overnight computer \n     staff were neither warned of the asbestos nor given any \n     protection from the particles that were in the air and on the \n     surfaces of the tables in their lunchroom.\n       Fast forward to the fall of 1999. Mike and I had been \n     married almost 30 years. We were raising five children, Erin, \n     then 20, Diane, 16, Sara, 15, John, 12, and Bennett 10. Mike \n     was a District Court Judge, and deeply honored that you had \n     seen fit to appoint him while you were Governor. As the \n     holidays began, Mike noticed a sudden weight gain and \n     enlargement of his abdomen. After Christmas it became so \n     uncomfortable that he went to see our family doctor on \n     December 30, 1999. The doctor was very alarmed by Mike's \n     appearance and arranged for him to be admitted to Immanuel \n     Hospital the next day.\n       Following 3 weeks of tests by several doctors, we received \n     the diagnosis of Perotoneal Mesothelioma. The prognosis was \n     devastating, a 50 percent chance of living another 6 months \n     and 18 months as the most optimistic life expectancy. Mike \n     began chemotherapy at the University of Nebraska Medical \n     Center and we searched for information on this disease. \n     Virtually all of the information we could find indicated \n     that the only cause of Mesothelioma is the exposure to \n     asbestos and that the time between exposure and illness \n     could be 30 years or longer.\n       After 6 months of chemotherapy, Mike was stable and we \n     dared to hope that he would make a complete recovery despite \n     the dire descriptions we were able to find about this \n     disease. In June of 2001 the tumors began to grow and Mike \n     again needed to undergo chemotherapy. This time he did not \n     respond to the treatments. We sought other options and Mike \n     entered a Clinical Trial at the National Cancer Institute \n     (NCI) located in Bethesda MD. He underwent 12 hours of \n     surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy in December of 2001. \n     After a week in intensive care he began to improve. We were \n     able to return to Omaha on December 31, 2001. He had been \n     fighting this disease for 2 years and once again we hoped for \n     a reprieve from the death sentence he had been given.\n       Sadly that was not to be. In August of 2002 the disease \n     again began to progress. Mike underwent weekly procedures to \n     drain the fluid accumulating in his abdomen and then his \n     lungs. Additional attempts with chemotherapy were \n     unsuccessful. Even after he needed supplemental oxygen to \n     assist his breathing he continued to work at the Court House \n     nearly every day.\n       Mike died on November 28, 2002. Nothing will make up for \n     the loss of his presence in our lives. He had so many things \n     left undone. Our children had to see the suffering and death \n     of the most important man in their lives. Only Erin is \n     through school and living on her own. Diane is a sophomore at \n     Duquesne University. Sarah is a freshman at Creighton \n     University. John and Bennett are students at Creighton Prep. \n     I have lost the love of my life. Few people are lucky enough \n     to know the joy we found in each other. And few can \n     understand the loss of such a special person. One of the \n     first things I ever heard Mike say was my name. His final \n     word, spoken with his final breath, was my name.\n       Mike worked at the Court House until 2 days before his \n     death. He knew he was very close to the end of his time on \n     earth. He continued to provide justice to others even though \n     he knew there would be no justice for him in this world. The \n     Congress alone now has the ability to provide some measure of \n     justice to the victims of asbestos by providing equitable \n     financial settlements to them and their families.\n       I trust you will also support efforts to prevent future \n     exposure to asbestos by supporting the passage of legislation \n     to prohibit the use of this deadly material anywhere in the \n     United States. These measures are needed to insure that no \n     new victims are exposed to the cause of such deadly diseases.\n       As he continued to work and receive treatment, Mike \n     contacted an attorney familiar with asbestos cases. Michael \n     J. Lehan represented Mike and now myself in efforts to\n\n[[Page S4203]]\n\n     seek some compensation for his illness and death resulting \n     from asbestos exposure.\n       Mr. Lehan filed a Workers Compensation claim with Qwest and \n     Physician's Mutual Insurance Company because Mike believed he \n     had been exposed at both work sites. Before a formal hearing \n     could be held, Qwest accepted his claim and began paying \n     Mike's medical bills. After his death I began receiving a \n     death benefit under this claim.\n       In addition to the Workers Compensation claim, Mr. Lehan \n     filed several lawsuits against companies that manufactured or \n     provided asbestos materials that Mike thought he might have \n     been exposed to. As a result of these suits, we received \n     several settlements, which were subject to attorney's fees \n     and expenses. The first Settlement was from Owens-\n     Illinois Inc., for $20,000.00. We received $11,633.34. In \n     March of 2001 Celotex Corporation offered a settlement of \n     $8,500.00. We received $4,266.00. Eagle Picher Industries \n     Trust offered a settlement of $6,500.00. This company has \n     filed bankruptcy and there was very little money for \n     asbestos claimants. After attorney fees and expenses we \n     received $3,333.33. Another company in bankruptcy, H.K. \n     Porter made a settlement of $20,000.00. Because of the \n     limited assets of the trust the payment value was $920.00, \n     and we received $563.00.\n       In March of 2002 AcandS, Inc. made a settlement offer of \n     $600,000. However, they have filed for bankruptcy and they \n     are unlikely to pay anymore than the $58,584.00 first payment \n     they made before filing. We received $36,628.09 from this \n     settlement. Mr. Lehan has told me that it is unlikely that \n     much more will be paid of this settlement.\n       The FAIR Act with the proposed amendments offered after S. \n     1125 was reported out of Committee last July would assure \n     compensation for Mesothelioma victims such as Mike and at \n     this time offers the only hope for any meaningful \n     compensation for the loss we have suffered.\n       Many of the companies directly responsible for the asbestos \n     exposure of Mike and millions of others have either filed for \n     bankruptcy or found other ways to shelter themselves from \n     responsibility to their victims. The FAIR Act would provide \n     compensation for many families and avoid the abuse that \n     sometimes takes place in our current tort system. Exposure to \n     asbestos in and of itself will not always result in illness. \n     When it does there should be resources available to the \n     victims and their families.\n       Thank you for taking the time to read this lengthy letter. \n     Mike was such a just man and had great faith in our systems \n     of law. No amount of monetary compensation can replace the \n     loss of Mike and the many thousands of other Mesothelioma \n     victims, he believed that there would be a way for the system \n     to insure that his family and others would at least have some \n     measure of financial security provided by those most \n     responsible for the continued use of asbestos.\n       Please let me know if there is any way that I could assist \n     you in seeing this important legislation enacted into law.\n           Gratefully,\n                                                Cathleen C. Amdor.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, it is imperative we get this \nresolved. This legislation, unfortunately, is not complete. But it \ncould be completed, and completed relatively quickly, with the right \napproach. And the right approach is to put the stakeholders in a room, \nwith guidance from the leadership on both sides of the aisle, with a \nfirm deadline, and with a firm charge to come to a resolution. It can \nbe done, and, moreover, it should be done.\n  The judge's case is a tragedy, but it does not stand alone, \nunfortunately. There are hundreds, yet thousands, of cases similar to \nMike and Cathy Amdor's. There will be future victims who will not \nreceive compensation because there will not be anybody left to collect \nfrom. I am committed to the trust fund approach because I believe it \nrepresents the best opportunity for those who are sick, and those who \nwill become sick, to obtain reasonable compensation for their \nsuffering. I remain optimistic that it can be done if we demonstrate \nthe resolve, the determination, to put politics aside and get it done.\n  We are now on the threshold of floor action on the bill. I urge the \nleadership to renew their commitment to a process which I and others on \nboth sides of the aisle believe can still work. Fair treatment for \nthousands of asbestos victims is at stake, and we have come too far to \nquit now. We must make the final push to reach consensus.\n  Again, I commend the hundreds of people who have spent thousands of \nhours working towards a solution. Those who have struggled with this \nissue have worked in good faith, determined to find the mechanism to \ncompensate those victims and those who will in the future fall victim \nto asbestos. I still believe we can do this, and I know with absolute \ncertainty, though, that we must.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to address the body \ntoday. I hope my colleagues will join together in asking our leaders to \nwork together to come up with a solution that will meet the needs and \nwill meet the opportunities that this legislation represents. But I \nthink it has to be other legislation. This legislation is not yet ready \nto be passed. But with a very brief period of intense negotiation and \nworking, with the support of the leaders, I do believe it can be. In \nthe final analysis, it must be.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the asbestos bill. I say to my good friend from \nNebraska, with whom I agree on so many issues, and work so very closely \nwith, I think this bill is ready because it is a bill we have been \nnegotiating for months and months and months, and a bill on which great \ncompromises have been made on both sides of the issue. I do think it is \ntime we invoke cloture, that we bring this bill to the floor, and that \nit be open for whatever amendments may be necessary by those who \ndisagree with it, but let's have a vote on it.\n  Asbestos-related bankruptcies have inflicted a staggering toll on the \nAmerican workforce. Companies that have declared bankruptcy because of \nasbestos-related litigation employed more than 200,000 workers before \ntheir bankruptcies. So far, asbestos-related bankruptcies have led to \nthe direct loss of as many as 60,000 jobs, while each displaced worker \nwill lose an average of $25,000 to $50,000 in wages over his or her \ncareer. For example, when Federal Mogul declared bankruptcy in 2001, \nemployees reportedly lost more than $800 million in their 401(k) plans.\n  The AFL-CIO has testified before Congress that:\n\n       Uncertainty for workers and their families is growing as \n     they lose health insurance and see their companies file for \n     bankruptcy protection.\n\n  There is no question that the escalating claims and costs are a \nthreat to workers' jobs and retirement savings. The AFL-CIO further \ntestified that ``the tort system is damaging business far more than it \nis compensating victims'' when it comes to asbestos-related cases.\n  One economic study found that, considering the multiplying effect of \nprivate investment, failure to enact asbestos legislation could reduce \neconomic growth by $2.4 billion per year, costing more than 30,000 jobs \nannually. Extended over a 27-year timeframe--which is the timeframe of \nthis bill--this would translate into the loss of more than 800,000 jobs \nand $64 billion in economic growth. Another study concluded that \n423,000 new jobs will not be created due to asbestos litigation, and \n$33 billion in capital investment will not now be made, unless we bring \nthis bill to the floor and pass this asbestos litigation bill.\n  Asbestos-related bankruptcies threaten American workers' jobs, \nincomes, job-related benefits, and retirement savings. To date, \napproximately 70 or more companies--35 since the year 2000--have been \ndriven into bankruptcy as a result of asbestos litigation. Forty-seven \nStates have had at least one asbestos-related bankruptcy.\n  How does this translate into lost jobs? As I have already said, these \nbankruptcies have led to the direct loss of at least 60,000 jobs. Many \nof the affected companies are highly unionized. If this direct impact \nis not bad enough, we have plenty of additional collateral damage from \nthese lost jobs. It is estimated that for every 10 jobs lost as a \ndirect result of an asbestos-related bankruptcy, an additional 8 jobs \nare lost. Each worker who has lost a job as a result of bankruptcy will \nlose an estimated $25,000 to $50,000 in wages because of periods of \nunemployment and/or lower wages in subsequent employment. Moreover, \neach worker loses, on average, at least 25 percent of the value of \ntheir 401(k) retirement account as a result of their company's \nbankruptcy.\n  While we are on the subject of retirement savings, asbestos-related \nbankruptcies have an adverse impact on the retirement savings of \nmillions of Americans. We have already seen how badly these \nbankruptcies impact the retirement savings of individual investors. We \nhave seen the devastation to employees of bankrupt companies whose \n401(k) retirement accounts hold\n\n[[Page S4204]]\n\ntheir employers' stock. And we have seen the damage to those whose \npension funds have invested in companies driven into bankruptcy as a \nresult of asbestos-related cases.\n  All one has to do is look at a couple of examples to get a sense of \nthe dramatic negative impact that asbestos-related bankruptcies have \nhad and will continue to have on retirement savings.\n  Owens Corning stock, 14 percent of which was owned by its employees \nin their 401(k) accounts, lost 96 percent of its value, dropping from \n$1.8 billion to $75 million in the 2 years before its bankruptcy filing \nin October of 2000.\n  Then there is the example of Federal Mogul. At the time of Federal \nMogul's bankruptcy in October 2001, 22,000 of its employees owned 16 \npercent of the company's stock, stock that lost 99 percent of its value \nor more than $70 million. Between January 1999 and the time of its \nbankruptcy, Federal Mogul's market capitalization dropped from $4 \nbillion to only $49 million. And by the way, Federal Mogul never, ever \nproduced asbestos. It simply acquired a company with asbestos \nliability. Federal Mogul's stock, which once traded for more than $70 a \nshare, now sells for pennies. Company retirees who once had secure \nretirement nest eggs must now work minimum wage jobs to survive.\n  One Federal Mogul retiree told the Detroit News he managed to salvage \nmost of his retirement savings by selling the company's shares before \nthe bottom fell out. But unfortunately, his 82-year-old former \ncolleague was not as fortunate. Because he held on to his Federal Mogul \nstock, his $1 million retirement plan evaporated to $22,000. As a \nresult, this individual now works as a greeter at a Wal-Mart store--a \nvery credible job, but he didn't take the job because he wanted to meet \npeople. He simply needed to eat.\n  The runaway asbestos litigation crisis must be brought to an end. The \neconomic data we have seen is troubling because it shows that asbestos \nlitigation creates job losses. American workers and retirees cannot \nafford to continue shouldering the weight of Congress's failure to act. \nIn fact, we create a class of economic victims by our inaction as \ncompanies go into bankruptcy and people lose their jobs.\n  What I find truly ironic is my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who have repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting \nAmerican jobs want to block us from considering a bill that squarely \naddresses this very objective. If protecting American jobs is a \npriority, then I strongly urge my Democratic colleagues to rethink \ntheir position on the Frist-Hatch-Miller asbestos bill or at least vote \nfor cloture on Thursday so we can get an up-or-down vote on the merits \nof the bill and in the process we can consider what amendments they \nthink might be proper.\n  I have not been one to pound on my former colleagues in the trial \nbar. During my 26 years of practicing law, I engaged in plaintiffs' \nwork as well as defense work, and they are very noble parts of our \ngreat legal profession. This bill is not directed at trial lawyers, as \nsome have indicated. This bill is directed at two different segments of \nour society and our economy. First of all, at those companies who are \nnow struggling because of the asbestos-related cases facing them; they \nare facing bankruptcy if we don't act. We are going to continue to see \nthe loss of jobs directly attributable to the failure on the part of \nthis body to act. The second class of folks this bill is directed to \nare the victims. Under this bill, the way it is crafted, these victims \ndon't have to file a lawsuit. They don't have to go through the long, \ndrawn-out discovery process that is a necessary part of every lawsuit. \nThey don't have to go through a trial by jury and let a jury of their \npeers determine what their compensation ought to be. They are \ncompensated directly and immediately when their injury is brought \nforward.\n  The fund we establish is a fund that is going to be here forever and \never. We started out with a demand, as the Presiding Officer knows, \nsince he is also a member of the Judiciary Committee, from the folks on \nthe other side of this bill, that we have a trust fund that has $107 \nbillion in it. We resisted that early on. We started out with about an \n$86 billion proposal. That $86 billion steadily grew until we not only \ngot to $107 billion, we exceeded $107 billion. The trust fund that is \nset forth in this bill before the Senate today is set at $114 billion. \nIn addition, we have a 10-percent overage fund that can come into play \nif need be, if that $114 billion is exhausted.\n  Beyond that, even if all of that money is exhausted in asbestos-\nrelated claims, anyone who has a true asbestos-related injury can then \ngo back to the process that is now in force, the legal system we have. \nSo nobody stands to lose in the process. The American worker stands to \ngain. The injured asbestos victims stand to gain by the passage of this \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues on Thursday to join those of us who are strong \nsupporters of the legislation and vote to invoke cloture. Let's bring \nthe bill to the floor. Let's debate it. And then let's have an up-or-\ndown vote on the bill. Let's compensate those victims who so badly need \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes. I would like to speak about my trip to \nIraq and Afghanistan and welcome home the Bravo Company of Fort Carson, \nCO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Thanking the Men and Women in Uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to share my thoughts with my \ncolleagues about the courageous heroism being shown by our men and \nwomen in uniform deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  On the second day of my visit to Iraq and Afghanistan last month, I \nhad the opportunity to meet with a staff sergeant who was a reservist \nfrom Denver, CO. Before Operation Iraqi Freedom, he had a great family \nlife, good-paying job, and much happiness in his life. Yet when \nPresident Bush ordered our men and women in uniform to prepare and \neventually rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein, the staff sergeant's unit, the \n324th Tactical PsyOps Company, was mobilized and deployed to Iraq.\n  When I met with this brave soldier, his unit had been deployed for \nover a year in Iraq and was expected to spend at least another 3 months \nin the country. Yet to my surprise, this staff sergeant did not \ncomplain about the lengthy deployment, nor did he complain about \nmissing his family or express any worry about losing his job. Instead, \nhe spoke of the importance of his mission and how much of a difference \nhe and the rest of our forces were making in Iraq. He said the United \nStates did the right thing in liberating Iraq from Saddam's tyranny, \nand not a day goes by when at least one Iraqi doesn't thank him \npersonally for freeing their country.\n  His only request was for me to contact his wife and thank her for \nsupporting him, a great sacrifice, over these many months. This was the \nleast I could do to repay him for his brave service to our Nation.\n  During that conversation, I could not have been more proud of or more \nthankful for our men and women in uniform. Many of these soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines are in their early 20s, and some have \nnever been outside the United States. Others have seen combat before \nand are struggling with the long deployment away from their families. \nBut every soldier I spoke with made it clear they are dedicated to \ntheir mission and committed to defeating extremists that seek to return \nthat land to a rein of terror.\n  I am especially proud of those Coloradans who have confronted our \nenemies in Iraq and Afghanistan. For example, the Third Armored Cavalry \nRegiment from Fort Carson, CO returned after being deployed in one of \nthe most hostile areas of Iraq for over a year. They fought multiple \nbattles with extremists and overcame numerous hardships during the \ncourse of their assignment. I commend the Third ACR for their service \nand welcome them home.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the 10th Special Forces Group, also \nstationed at Fort Carson, for their ongoing contributions to Operation \nIraqi Freedom. Units from the 10th Special Forces Group continue to \nserve in Iraq and continue to make me and the rest of Colorado very \nproud.\n  As we in Colorado celebrate the return of thousands of troops, we \nshould\n\n[[Page S4205]]\n\nnot forget those who lost their lives on the battlefield. More than 50 \nmen who were either from or stationed in Colorado have made the \nultimate sacrifice. The families who have lost loved ones deserve \nspecial honor. Our thoughts and prayers have been with them as we all \nremember the sacrifices their sons and daughters have made for the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n  This past weekend, I had the opportunity to welcome home the Bravo \nCompany of the 244th Engineering Battalion. Bravo Company is stationed \nin Fort Collins, CO, and the community's response to these men and \nwomen returning was truly heartening.\n  Equally as encouraging were the remarks shared to me from the members \nof the Bravo Company. These professional soldiers want to succeed in \nIraq, their morale is high, and are proud of the time they devoted to \nthe reconstruction of Iraq.\n  The Bravo Company's mission in Iraq was to help provide \ninfrastructure. This consisted of things such as sanitation facilities, \nelectric utilities, water utilities, as well as highways. They also \nhelped in other ways with construction of hospitals and schools during \ntheir deployment. They shared their feelings with me that they felt \nthey were really serving a need there. They were proud of their \nopportunity to serve over in Iraq. Obviously, they were glad to return \nhome, but many of them were very, very happy about having an \nopportunity to serve the country in a valuable way.\n  The point of emphasis shared with me by these soldiers is that it is \nimperative the American people continue to stand firmly behind our \ntroops deployed overseas. This is not the time for grandstanding by \ndrawing parallels between this military action and the Vietnam War. In \nfact, those distortions run counter to the strong support that the \nAmerican public still has for completing the job in Iraq.\n  This is not an issue of people not supporting our Armed Forces, \nbecause I know that every Member in this body supports our troops, \nregardless of personal beliefs about the rationale for Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. The issue is our support to stay the course for a struggling \ndemocracy; one that can bring freedom not only to the Iraqis, but \nperhaps to the Middle East. The United States will be defined by our \nresponse to the terrorists and despots that want to see Iraq return to \nchaos and dictatorship.\n  The efforts of units like Colorado's 3rd Armored Calvary Regiment, \nthe 10th Special Forces Group, and 244th Engineering Battalion have \nhelped to spread freedom and democracy to Iraq after decades of terror. \nA free Iraq is a historic opportunity to change the world.\n  By demonstrating our commitment to not only rid Iraq of terrorists \nbut also improve the lives of ordinary Iraqis, we show the world that \nAmerica is still the torchbearer for liberty. Our soldiers understand \nthe challenges, and they want Americans to help them face the challenge \nand support their efforts.\n  Meeting these men and women reminded me of a statement that Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Myers, told the Armed Services \nCommittee last year. He said that we would win in Iraq as long as we \nhave the continuing will of the American people. I believe that \nAmericans still have the will to win, especially the men and women in \nuniform who I have met.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for allowing me the time to praise some of \nmy brave fellow Coloradans. I will continue to spread the word from the \nsoldiers that while even in the gravest of situations, they understand \nthe importance of what the United States is trying to accomplish in \nIraq.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Iraq and Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there has been some discussion on the \nfloor, as there should be, about the very serious situations, \nchallenging situations that our Nation and other nations fighting \nagainst terrorism and for freedom are facing now in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  In the company of the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. \nStevens, and the senior Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, I \nvisited those two countries just four weeks ago. Senator Hollings, \nSenator Stevens, and I had an opportunity to discuss with the heads of \nstate and government and our military leaders the situation, and we \nalso visited with our troops. We visited Jordan. We visited Iraq. We \nvisited Kuwait. We visited, of course, Pakistan. We went into \nAfghanistan, and we came back through Paris where we had, I thought, a \nvery interesting and lengthy opportunity to discuss our views with \nPresident Chirac of France.\n  Today I would like to discuss some of these issues that were \ndiscussed on the floor today. I do so by expressing that the past few \nweeks have been particularly challenging for the citizens of the United \nStates of America and, indeed, the citizens of other coalition \ncountries fighting bravely with us in those theaters of war, namely, \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  We are ever mindful the risks our troops face every day and the \nsacrifices made by the families and the communities that support them \nas those who have been removed from power seek to delay their \ninevitable defeat as terrorists lash out against the loss of yet \nanother haven, both in Afghanistan and in Iraq, where terrorism has \nbeen spawned to spread worldwide.\n  We mourn every loss of life of these brave men and women in uniform \nand salute those who serve and their families for their bravery, their \ncommitment, and their sacrifice. We are at a critical juncture for the \ncoalition operations in both of these theaters. The brilliant military \nvictories achieved by our forces, together with coalition partners, \nhave presented an opportunity to fully defeat violence and terror in \nboth Iraq and Afghanistan, nations whose previous rulers had \nperpetrated violence and terror on their own populations, neighbors, \nand, indeed, the world.\n  The cycle of violence that has gripped this part of the world must \nend if we are to win the global war on terrorism and to make America \nand the world a safer place. Deviation from our current course will \nonly embolden--embolden--those who are intent on causing instability \nand anarchy in these regions of the world.\n  We have achieved extraordinary success in a relatively short period \nof time. In Iraq, Saddam Hussein and the threat he posed are gone, and \nnow he, I think, to the credit of the Iraqi people, is likely to face a \ncourt of law and be judged by his own peers for his frightful \nadministration over a period of over 30 years in that country and the \nhardships he imposed.\n  We must continue, however, to send a strong message of resolve to the \npeople of Iraq, to our troops, to our coalition partners, and to the \nrest of the world that we, the United States of America, will stay the \ncourse and get the job done. As President Bush stated last week:\n\n       Now is the time and Iraq is the place in which the enemies \n     of the civilized world are testing the will of the civilized \n     world. We must not waiver.\n\n  I take great encouragement by listening to that strong statement. I \nhave supported the President throughout these operations. As I said, I \nrecently visited both of those areas, and I have done it three or four \nother times. It has been an opportunity for me, as chairman of our \nArmed Services Committee, to follow these operations very carefully.\n  President Bush has set a course that calls for the return of \npolitical sovereignty to the Iraqis on June 30. It is critical that we \nend our status as an occupying power and give the Iraqis an increased \nstake in what happens in their nation.\n  I would like to pause on that point. Yesterday, in the course of our \nseries of hearings before the Armed Services Committee, at which time \nwe had the benefit of the testimony of the Deputy Secretary of Defense, \nMr. Wolfowitz, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Under \nSecretary of State for Political Affairs, Ambassador Gross, I raised a \nquestion about the use of the term ``sovereignty.'' I have watched\n\n[[Page S4206]]\n\ncarefully as all those in positions of authority have begun to discuss \nwhat takes place on the 30th of June.\n  It has been referred to, and I do not say this out of disrespect but \njust factually, somewhat loosely. People have said we are going to \nconvey sovereignty, as I have just read from these remarks. Others say \nit is a conveyance of power to a new Iraqi interim form of government. \nI shall address that later.\n  In the hearing yesterday, through questioning by myself and other \ncolleagues, it was clearly established that the security of Iraq must \nbe maintained by the coalition forces until such time as the Iraqis can \nput in place, whether it is police, a national guard, an army, or a \ncombination of all of those forces, a force such that we can turn over \nto them completely the operations that must take place to repel the \ninsurgents and otherwise maintain security in that country.\n  The question is, Since that must be maintained and the document that \nthe Iraqi Governing Council and the Coalition Provisional Authority put \ntogether--the Transitional Administrative Law--specifically states that \nthe Iraqi security forces, as they come along, will be under the \nunified command of a U.S. led multinational force that is authorized by \nUN Security Council Resolution 1511. This resolution goes into some \ndetail with regard to how the security will continue to be maintained \nunder the auspices of the coalition military leadership. The security \nwill still emanate from the President of the United States, the Prime \nMinister of Great Britain, and others who are now directing, through \ntheir military commanders, the security operation in Iraq. Those forces \nare going to stay.\n  If we look at the pure definition of ``sovereignty,'' one must say: \nWait a minute. The very heart of being a sovereign nation is providing \nsecurity of one's borders, of one's internal situation, and security \nagainst anyone attacking one's nation. That is the very heart of what I \nbelieve is sovereignty. But that authority simply does not pass, as I \nsaid, because of the Transitional Administrative Law and related orders \nenacted by the Iraqi Governing Council and the Coalition Provisional \nAuthority, which are the current authority in Iraq, and by United \nNations Security Council Resolution 1511. So I think as we use the term \n``sovereignty'' with reference to what passes on June 30, we should be \nvery careful to say limited sovereignty passes.\n  A great deal of responsibility will be transferred to this new \nentity, but the security function is going to remain under the control \nof those I have just described until such time--presumably with the \ncombined judgment of the coalition forces and the governing body of \nIraq--there is a sequential series of governing bodies that take place, \nand until that time we are going to be very active in continuing to \nsupport a security framework so that government can work.\n  Again, I return to the date of June 30. This date was endorsed by the \nU.N. special representative, Mr. Brahimi. Mr. Brahimi and the U.N. are \nplaying an important and growing role in this transition of the \ngovernment and will continue to play a critical role, hopefully, in \nhelping Iraq on its path to democracy.\n  The President's appointment earlier this week of the trusted \ninternational statesman and current U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., John \nNegroponte, as the first U.S. Ambassador to a free and democratic Iraq \nis another important step in the process. I have known Mr. Negroponte \nfor a number of years, and I have the highest regard for his \nprofessional capabilities and his character.\n  Continued U.S. commitment to the June 30 transition date is of \nenormous importance to the Iraqi people and to the region, for it will \nbe the day Iraq takes its place in the community of free nations and \nthe day Iraqis assume responsibility for their future. A free, \ndemocratic Iraq means defeat for the forces of terrorism and \ninstability in Iraq.\n  Clearly, the recent surge of violence in Iraq is related to the \nimminent transfer of sovereignty. Those who fear democracy are trying \nto delay its arrival. Those who incite terror realize their days are \nnumbered. Opponents of a free and democratic Iraq are desperate and \nwill become even more desperate, we all fear--at least I do, and I \nthink some others--in the weeks to come until June 30.\n\n  It is my hope, but I certainly do not want to raise expectations, but \nI do have a hope that once the realization, after June 30, settles in \namong the Iraqi people that at long last the first of a series of steps \nto give them total sovereignty is occurring, that 80 to 90 percent of \nIraqi citizens want this program to succeed and the coalition forces to \nfinish their work. Those people will help us in establishing a greater \ndegree of security in Iraq.\n  We must be prepared, however, for such violence as does continue to \noccur between now and June 30 and afterwards. There is not going to be \na cliff, an abrupt drop-off. It is likely to continue for a period of \ntime, but our coalition forces are resolute to maintain that security.\n  Some greater detail was shared with this body by the Deputy Secretary \nof Defense and the Under Secretary of State yesterday during our \nhearing outlining these first steps towards democracy, including: \nformation of an Iraqi Interim Government, with the assistance of the \nU.N., and extensive consultation with the Iraqi people, to accept \nlimited sovereignty on June 30, 2004; the organization of elections for \na representative national assembly and transitional government, to be \nheld no later than January 31, 2005; the drafting and ratification of a \nconstitution by October 2005; and, elections and formation of a \nconstitutional Iraqi government by the end of December 2005. During \nthis interim and transitional period, considerable effort will be made \nby U.S. and coalition forces to select, train, equip and mentor the \nvarious components of the Iraqi security forces, so as to be able to \nassume increasing responsibility for the internal security and external \ndefense of Iraq.\n  This is a good plan--a realistic plan--that has received the support \nof Ambassador Brahimi, the special representative of the U.N. Secretary \nGeneral, Kofi Annan. This plan, and what additional support may be \nrequired from the U.N., are the subject of ongoing discussions at the \nU.N.\n  Lasting peace and security in Iraq and Afghanistan will be achieved \nwhen we establish the conditions for democratic, economically viable \nnations. The first steps to democracy have been taken and new \ngovernments are, or soon will be, preparing to assume the \nresponsibilities and challenges of freedom and democracy. These new \ngovernments will need the continued support and commitment of the \nCongress, the American people, and the international community. Their \nsuccess will stand as a beacon of hope to others in the region and \naround the world, and as a harbinger of defeat for the forces of \nviolence and terror.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us believe that the current system \nfor compensating asbestos victims is not working well and that \nlegislation creating a fairer, more effective process is needed. \nHowever, this bill, S. 2290, is not that legislation. In its current \nform, it does not create a system which will fairly and reliably \ncompensate seriously ill victims of asbestos exposure.\n  This is not a balanced approach to the asbestos problem which comes \nfrom negotiations between business and labor. The bill reads as if it \nwas dictated by the defendants solely for the benefit of the \ndefendants. In fact, there have been no serious negotiations for months \non the central issues fair levels of compensation for seriously ill \nworkers, and adequate funding for the asbestos trust to make sure that \ninjured workers actually receive what they are promised.\n  The only issue on which any progress has been made is the \nadministrative structure of the compensation program. Senator Specter \ndeserves great credit for convening a series of discussions on this \ntopic involving both labor and business. However, as long as the \ncompensation values are unreasonably low and the amount of money in the\n\n[[Page S4207]]\n\ntrust is grossly inadequate, improving the way in which that money is \ndistributed to individual victims cannot make an otherwise bad bill \nacceptable.\n  Since the Judiciary Committee voted out a bill in July, the process \nhas moved backward, not forward. While I had serious objections to the \ncommittee-passed bill, the Frist bill is much worse. It reduces the \nfunding level of the asbestos trust by more than $40 billion dollars--\n$153 billion in the committee bill versus $109 billion in the Frist \nbill. They stripped out the major improvements we made in committee the \ntwo Feinstein amendments and the Biden amendment. They made a mockery \nof the committee process.\n  The bill before us does not reflect what is necessary to compensate \nthe enormous number of workers who suffer from asbestos-induced \ndisease, it reflects only what the companies who made them sick are \nwilling to pay.\n  The Republican sponsors of this bill are insisting on compensation \nlevels which are far below what these seriously ill workers deserve, \nand less than what they are receiving, on average, under current law. \nThese are people whose health has been destroyed and, in many cases, \nwhose lives have been substantially shortened, by asbestos induced \ndisease. Shortchanging them would be extraordinarily cruel.\n  There is also no adequate guarantee in the legislation that \nsufficient funds will be available to fully pay all injured workers who \nare eligible to collect, even at the low levels of compensation in the \nbill. For injured workers and their families, this proposal is clearly \nworse than the current system.\n  The real crisis which confronts us is not an asbestos litigation \ncrisis, it is an asbestos-induced disease crisis. Asbestos is the most \nlethal substance ever widely used in the workplace. Between 1940 and \n1980, there were 27.5 million workers in this country who were exposed \nto asbestos on the job, and nearly 19 million of them had high levels \nof exposure over long periods of time. That exposure changed many of \ntheir lives. Each year, more than 10,000 of them die from lung cancer \nand other diseases caused by asbestos. Each year, hundreds of thousands \nof them suffer from lung conditions which make breathing so difficult \nthat they cannot engage in the routine activities of daily life. Even \nmore have become unemployable due to their medical condition. And, \nbecause of the long latency period of these diseases, all of them live \nwith fear of a premature death due to asbestos-induced disease. These \nare the real victims. They deserve to be the first and foremost focus \nof our concern.\n  All too often, the tragedy these workers and their families are \nenduring becomes lost in a complex debate about the economic impact of \nasbestos litigation. We cannot allow that to happen. The litigation did \nnot create these costs. Exposure to asbestos created them. They are the \ncosts of medical care, the lost wages of incapacitated workers, and the \ncost of providing for the families of workers who died years before \ntheir time. Those costs are real. No legislative proposal can make them \ndisappear. All legislation can do is shift those costs from one party \nto another.\n  Any proposal which would have the effect of shifting more of the \nfinancial burden onto the backs of injured workers is unacceptable to \nme, and I would hope that it would be unacceptable to every one of us. \nThe key test of any legislative proposal on asbestos claims is whether, \nby reducing transaction costs, it will put more money into the pockets \nof seriously injured workers and their families than they are receiving \nunder the current system. That should be our goal.\n  I believe that a properly designed trust fund to compensate workers \nsuffering with asbestos-induced disease can move us toward that goal. \nTo do so, it must use inclusive medical criteria which cover all \nworkers who have sustained real injuries, it must provide fair levels \nof compensation for all workers who have been injured, and it must \nguarantee that all injured workers who qualify will receive full \ncompensation on a timely basis. At best, this legislation satisfies \nonly one of these three criteria.\n  Any proposal which would merely create one new large underfunded \ntrust in place of the many smaller underfunded bankruptcy trusts which \nexist today is unacceptable. Injured workers need certainty even more \nthan businesses and insurers.\n  One basic test of fairness is how a compensation system treats the \nmost seriously injured victims. S. 2290 fails this test miserably. \nThose who meet the medical criteria for the most serious illnesses \nwould still not be fairly compensated.\n  Mesothelioma is a horrible disease which is usually fatal. There is \nno question that it is caused by asbestos exposure. In the current \nsystem, mesothelioma victims often receive multi-million dollar \nsettlements. This bill will limit them to much less.\n  The gravest injustice done by the bill is to lung cancer victims. We \nall understand how devastating lung cancer can be. The issue with lung \ncancer is causation. If a worker had substantial asbestos exposure and \nwas a non-smoker, his primary lung cancer was almost certainly caused \nby asbestos. Yet the bill would pay these victims as little as \n$225,000. In many instances, that will not even cover their medical \nexpenses. They are currently receiving much higher judgments in the \ncourts, and fairness requires far more compensation for their life \nthreatening diseases than this bill offers.\n  If the worker smoked--and unfortunately most of these workers did--\nthe combination of tobacco and asbestos exposure dramatically increases \nthe likelihood of contracting lung cancer.\n  Workers who smoke and have been exposed to asbestos are over four \ntimes more likely to get lung cancer than smokers with no asbestos \nexposure. Asbestos is clearly a major contributor to their lung \ncancers. Yet, this bill would give them next to nothing. Under the \nterms of this bill, they would receive between $25,000 to $75,000. That \nis outrageous. These victims, who must have at least 15 weighted years \nof asbestos exposure, deserve much more--they deserve a level of \ncompensation that reflects the reality of their conditions and their \nfamilies' needs.\n  Even when the worker's lungs show specific evidence of asbestos \ndisease, raising the probability that the asbestos exposure \nsignificantly contributed to the lung cancer to a virtual certainty, \nthe legislation would pay them as little as $150,000. That is \nincredibly low. These lung cancer victims have literally had their \nlives shattered by asbestos. They must be fairly compensated in any \nlegitimate national trust proposal. They are not in the Frist proposal.\n  To make matters even worse, the legislation would actually allow \nworkers' compensation and health insurance companies to seek \nreimbursement out of the meager amounts these seriously ill workers \nreceive from the asbestos trust. Thus, the worker and his family may \nliterally end up with nothing despite his undeniable injuries. At the \nvery least, the bill should protect the compensation paid to a worker \nby the trust from subrogation claims.\n  Proponents of this bill argue that in the tort system too much money \nis going to victims who are not really impaired and not enough is going \nto those who are truly sick. But their self-proclaimed concern for the \ntruly sick certainly is not reflected in this bill. Lung cancer victims \nare ``truly sick'' by anyone's definition. In fact, a large percentage \nof them will have their lives cut short by this disease. Yet even in \nthese cases, the most compelling cases, S. 2290 provides grossly \ninadequate compensation. I am deeply troubled by the way this \nlegislation treats even the sickest of the sick.\n  Not only does this bill not provide adequate levels of compensation, \nbut it does not even contain sufficient funding to pay the compensation \nlevels contained in the bill. According to a CBO analysis, it is \nunderfunded by over $25 billion dollars. CBO's cost estimate is $140 \nbillion.\n  Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this bill will raise even the \n$109 billion which the sponsors say is necessary. The bill establishes \ncontribution tiers for defendant corporations of various sizes and \nasbestos histories. However, the Senate has no hard information about \nthe number of companies which will fall in each tier. Thus, the \naggregate amount which will be raised to fund the asbestos trust is \nhighly speculative. Under the proposed funding plan--some \ncorporations--such as Halliburton and WR Grace--can escape \naccountability for their wrong-doing by paying only a small percentage \nof\n\n[[Page S4208]]\n\nthe amounts they are currently responsible to pay. As long as companies \nsuch as Halliburton and Grace are permitted to pay billions of dollars \nless than their fair share, it will be extremely difficult--if not \nimpossible--to fund the trust at a level sufficient to fairly \ncompensate those who have been poisoned by asbestos.\n  Similarly, the manner of determining the amount that individual \ninsurers and reinsurers will contribute to the trust is also \nquestionable. It appears to unfairly benefit some companies at the \nexpense of others. The way it has been structured, it may actually \ncreate unintended legal obstacles to the expeditious payment of \nbillions of dollars into the trust by reinsurers with the largest \nasbestos exposure.\n  These funding concerns seriously jeopardize the financial viability \nof the trust and its capacity to compensate injured workers in the \nmanner promised. In fact, there is no guarantee that the dollars will \nbe there to fully pay all eligible victims what the legislation \npromises they will receive.\n  If the asbestos trust does become insolvent, workers will have to \nwait years before they can return to the tort system. Under the Biden \namendment adopted by the Judiciary Committee, if the trust was unable \nto fully pay claims in a timely manner, injured workers would \nimmediately regain their right to seek compensation in the courts.\n  Unfortunately, that right--so essential to fundamental fairness--has \nbeen removed in the Frist bill. Victims will have to wait as long as 7 \nyears after the trust becomes insolvent before they can take their \nclaim to court. Many of them will be dead by then. And, if they do \nreturn to court, the workers will not have the same rights that they do \ntoday. Under the Frist bill, seriously ill workers can find themselves \nin an intolerable legal limbo through no fault of their own. All of us \nshould find that unacceptable.\n  The danger that the asbestos trust, as structured in this \nlegislation, will be unable to meet its financial obligations to the \nvictims is very real. There is a serious risk of a substantial \nshortfall in the early years, when nearly 300,000 pending cases will be \ntransferred to the newly created national trust for payment. The trust \nmay not have the resources to pay those claims in a timely manner. \nPayments to critically ill people may be delayed for years, and the \ntrust itself may become insolvent.\n  The best way to reduce the enormous financial burden on the trust in \nthe early years would be to leave many of those pending cases in the \ntort system, especially cases which were close to resolution. That \nwould be fair to the parties in those cases and it would greatly \nimprove the financial viability of the trust. Unfortunately, the Frist \nbill would do just the opposite. It fails to respect stare decisis even \nin cases where substantial judicial determinations have already been \nmade. In many cases, it would actually abrogate jury verdicts and \nexisting settlements, requiring the injured workers to start from \nscratch. That is terribly unfair. It will also greatly increase the \nburden on the asbestos trust.\n  Unfortunately, there is so much wrong with this legislation that I \ncould literally discuss the shortfalls for hours. However, that would \nserve no purpose. Clearly, the issues are too complex and too \ninterrelated to fix in a few days on the Senate floor. For that reason, \nthe Senate should reject the motion to proceed to S. 2209 and send the \nparties back to the drawing board. The only way to produce an \nacceptable bill is to seriously address the legitimate concerns of \ninjured workers as well as the concerns of the corporate defendants.\n  The Frist bill clearly fails that test. It is not a bill which \nreduces the high transaction costs in the current system, and thus puts \nmore money in the pockets of injured workers while reducing the costs \nto businesses and their insurers. That would be a real solution.\n  It is a bill which merely shifts more of the financial burden of \nasbestos-induced disease to the injured workers by unfairly and \narbitrarily limiting the liability of defendants. Sick workers would \nreceive lower levels of compensation than they receive on average in \nthe current system, and payment of even those lower levels of \ncompensation would not be guaranteed. That is no solution at all.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, I be permitted to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to proceed \nto S. 2290.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I want to take a few minutes and talk \nabout an issue off the pending matter, if I may, before the Senate. \nWhile it may not be germane to the subject matter before the Senate, \nthe matter I want to talk about is extremely germane to the American \npublic and what they are interested in. That is education. I \nparticularly want to focus for a few minutes on higher education.\n  We are now coming into the months of April and May when students will \nbe wrapping up their academic year and taking exams. Those who are in \ntheir last year will be graduating and going out into the private \nsector or graduate school.\n  As we focus on graduation and the termination of an academic year, I \nthink it is important to take stock of the financial availability of \nmost students to access higher education in this country, and what we \nare doing about it as we conclude this academic year. It is also \nimportant to ask what will be available next year to students who are \neither starting higher education or are continuing their higher \neducation.\n  What are the economic challenges these individuals and their families \nface as it relates to affording college? I want to spend a couple of \nminutes describing what the present situation is as it relates to \ncollege cost, how important it is to have access to college, and where \nwe are today in our ability to try to make college more accessible and \nmore affordable.\n  In the 21st century we must have the best educated and best prepared \ngeneration of Americans we have ever produced if we are going to be \nhighly competitive in a global marketplace and have a growing and \nexpanding economy to produce goods and services of increasing value; \nthat is, more technology and more sophistication to offer the 95 \npercent of the population which lives outside the United States all \nover this globe.\n  We have seen tuition and fees at public colleges and universities go \nup 26 percent over the last 38 months. Since President Bush took office \non January 20 of 2001, tuition and fees at public colleges and \nuniversities has gone up more than 25 percent--close to 26 percent in \n38 months.\n  Last year alone, on average, tuition at a public university rose 14 \npercent, and over 10 percent in my own State of Connecticut. The \naverage total cost of attending a public 4-year college is now over \n$9,000, and for private colleges the average cost is $24,000.\n  As tuition rates increase, so does the portion of a family's income \nneeded to pay tuition. On average, 29 percent of a family's income goes \ntoward public university tuition and 41 percent goes toward private \nuniversity tuition. Just think about that: almost 30 percent of a \nfamily's income paying a public college tuition and more than 40 \npercent to go to a private university or college. In comparison, a \nfamily's mortgage payment represents 32 percent of annual income. \nEducation is now eating up more of a family budget than a home \nmortgage--the largest single investment most families ever make is \nowning their own home.\n  It is estimated that approximately 200,000 college-ready high school \ngraduates will not pursue higher education this year because they do \nnot have the resources to do it and don't have access to the various \nprograms that may provide them some assistance.\n  Apart from initial affordability, students also often graduate with \nhuge\n\n[[Page S4209]]\n\namounts of debt. In Connecticut, the average student graduates in 4 \nyears $15,000 in debt. The numbers are rather clear.\n  We are seeing a tremendous economic burden growing with each and \nevery passing year, for families and individuals who wish to go on and \nget that absolutely critical higher education they need and we need \nthem to have.\n\n  Pell grants are such a great cornerstone of the Federal financial aid \nsystem, but they are shrinking in value. Pell grants originally covered \n80 percent of the cost of attending a public university. Today, at \n$4,050, they cover only 30 percent; and at a 4-year private college, 16 \npercent. Imagine that, from 80 percent down to 34 percent.\n  The maximum Pell amount remains stagnant at a time when tuition is \ngoing up, people are losing jobs and extra income, and when higher \neducation is increasingly the ticket to a better life not only for the \nstudents but for us, as well.\n  Today, the average low-income student has an annual unmet need of \nalmost $4,000 in college expenses, costs not covered by grants, loans, \nwork, or family savings. These are the students that an increase in the \nPell grant would most directly help.\n  What are we doing about this? The President's budget is clearly not \nin the best interest, at all, of serving this critical need that, by \nall accounts, we admit is necessary. I don't know of anyone who does \nnot go back to their respective States and talk about the importance of \neducation, the importance particularly of higher education, that people \nhave the ability to earn that degree.\n  I am sure every one of my colleagues has said exactly the words I am \nabout to share, or something similar: No one ought to be denied a \nhigher education because they lack the financial resources. It goes to \nthe depth of a person's drive, the depth of their character, the depth \nof their ambition. It ought not be the depth of their parents' or their \npockets that determines whether someone can have access to a higher \neducation. I am sure we all feel that way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be good enough to yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has appropriately pointed out the explosion \nof increased costs of tuition for the sons and daughters of middle-\nincome families. This is basically a middle America working-class \nfamily issue. As the Senator has pointed out so well and so eloquently, \nit is at the heart of the hopes and dreams of every family in this \ncountry.\n  I am sure the Senator would agree with me, when we talk about \neducation, we are not only talking about a better educated society; we \nare talking about individuals who are going to be the stewards of our \ndemocratic institutions and also the individuals who are going to be \nable to lead this country in terms of the international global economy \nand beyond that; individuals who are going to be able to be in the \nArmed Forces of this country.\n  The Senator is mentioning the increases in tuition. The Senator \npointed out the costs to families: in many families, the children \ncannot go to college. And if they are able to go, they experience \nincreased debt.\n  I understand the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance \nhas said as a result of the increase in tuition, there are almost \n200,000 young individuals, young men and women, sons of working class \nfamilies in this country, who effectively have been priced out of the \nopportunity to continue in higher education. And reports point out the \nenormous increase in indebtedness of even those who are going to \nschools. We know that over the last 10 years, indebtedness has actually \nalmost doubled. The average debt families have when they graduate is \nsome $17,000.\n  I am wondering if the Senator remembers that it was a few weeks ago \nthe Senate passed a $2.4 trillion budget. We had an opportunity to \nprovide a helping hand to students in this country who come from \nworking families, by increasing the Pell grants for the young people in \nthis country. It was the judgment and the decision of this body and the \nRepublican administration, the Bush administration, to effectively say \nno, we will not increase the Pell grants, in spite of the fact--I know \nthe Senator remembers this--that this President, when he ran for the \nPresidency of the United States, said in the final days of the campaign \nin the State of New Hampshire, that he was committed to increasing the \nPell grants to $5,100. He said, in the State of New Hampshire on August \nthirtieth, in the year 2000: Pell grants significantly affect the \nability of a child to stay in college or to stay in school. The future \nof a child eligible for a Pell grant will be affected by the size of \nthe Pell grant. I am going to ask Congress to bolster first year aid \nfrom $3,300 to $5,100.\n\n  Does the Senator from Connecticut remember when we had an opportunity \nto do something about helping middle-class families in this country, to \nprovide some help and assistance to them, to ease the burden of the \nincrease in tuition, whether there was any effort from the Republican \nside to increase the Pell grants to provide this important help and \nassistance to these qualified young students who are seeking to \ncontinue their education?\n  Mr. DODD. In response to my colleague, I very clearly remember \nsupporting the senior Senator from Massachusetts and his amendment that \nwould have increased the higher education budget, including, obviously, \nan increase in the Pell grants to meet exactly what the commitment of \nthe President had been on this subject matter. We were unable to get \nthat.\n  It is important to point out to people the effects. We have now had a \nfreeze in Pell grants over the last 3 years, despite the President's \ncampaign promise to raise them. I mentioned earlier that a Pell grant \nnow pays about 34 percent of the cost of public higher education. It \nwas at 80 percent when it was originally passed.\n  Let me also state what shrinking resources and rising costs have \ndone. My colleague from Massachusetts has pointed out that the average \nstudent now finishes college in excess of $17,000 debt. As a result of \nfreezing the Pell grant over the last 3 years, and the administration's \nproposal to raise freshman loan limits, we are now told that student \ndebt could increase nationally by almost $5 billion. If we take student \ndebt, that will now grow as a result of not having Pell grants trying \nto keep some pace with the increased cost of education, if students \nhave to take out more loans, we will have student debt amount to $5 \nbillion more nationally than presently is the case.\n  The President's budget also froze funding for work-study programs in \naddition to Pell grants. We watched, over the last 38 months, tuition \ncosts go up at public universities 26 percent. Costs go up and the \nPresident's budget says: No, no, I am not going to give you a nickel \nmore for Pell grants. Freeze work-study. Freeze Pell grants. Not a \npenny more for higher education despite costs going up and here is $5 \nbillion more debt to shoulder as you leave higher education to go out \nand try to get a job, get into the workforce, raise a family.\n  I don't know of anyone who believes that is a sound investment in the \n21st century. I thank my colleague for raising those points.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator agree with me that at one time we, as a \nnation, made a commitment to every child in this country that if they \nwere qualified to get into any institution of higher learning based \nupon their academic standing, a series of grants and loans would be \navailable to them so they would be able to go to the school, the \ncollege to which they were admitted?\n  We saw over the period of time going back to the 1970s, going back to \nthe time this whole program, the Pell grants and the Stafford loans \nwere established, a balance between grants and loans so young people of \ntalent could go to the schools and universities to which they were \nadmitted.\n  Now if I could direct the attention of the Senator from Connecticut, \nwhat we have seen is a complete abdication of that commitment in the \nfact of the declining purchasing power of the Pell grants, and in the \nreduction of the Work-Study Program. Fundamentally we are saying to the \nyoung people, and particularly to their parents: You are on your own. \nGo on out there and borrow, and pay a good deal for that additional $5 \nbillion you will borrow. And\n\n[[Page S4210]]\n\nthere is just going to be paying the interest and indebtedness for \nthose young people in the years ahead.\n  Would the Senator be good enough to indicate whether he agrees with \nme, that the whole pattern in the recent years under Republican \nleadership has been to reduce the purchasing power, the value of the \nPell grant, and to require the students to borrow a good deal more, \nwhich has meant an increase in indebtedness to these students? And \nwould he not agree with me, when you visit schools and colleges and you \nmeet with these young people around recess time or lunchtime, they are \ntalking about their loans rather than talking about their books?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, the Senator, again, is exactly correct. As \nI noted earlier, we are talking about families who are middle-income \nfamilies, who are lower middle-income families who are out there \nstruggling to make ends meet. As I pointed out, the increased cost of a \npublic education, as well as a private education, in 38 months has gone \nthrough the ceiling, outpacing the cost of anything else. Inflation has \nbeen relatively flat in the last number of months with the economy \nwhere it is. But yet in the midst of all that, we have seen a 26-\npercent increase in the cost of going to a private college or \nuniversity, and a 14-percent increase to go to a public institution.\n  So we have seen this tremendous increase in a family's income going \ntoward education and tuition. As I pointed out earlier, 29 percent of a \nfamily's income goes to pay for public university tuition; 41 percent \ngoes to pay for private university tuition.\n  The debt these kids are faced with, their families are faced with, is \nan additional strain on families who are already paying so much to see \nto it their kids can get the education they need. And we know so \nclearly the importance of education. You find yourself almost wondering \nwhy you have to say this. I don't know of anyone who believes that for \na single second this country's ability to maintain itself in a \nleadership position economically and politically can be sustained \nwithout the proper education. Thomas Jefferson said, 200 years ago this \nyear, in 1804, any nation that ever expects to be ignorant and free \nexpects what never was and what never possibly could be.\n  If you believe that had validity in 1804, you certainly must believe \nthat in 2004 it has even more validity, not only in terms of embracing \nand supporting our constitutional principles, but also as to the \nimportance of being able to get the education to produce the goods and \nservices of high value which 5 percent of the world's population, which \nlives in this country, will be able to market to the 95 percent of the \nworld's population which lives outside this country.\n  Anyone who believes for a single second that you can deny 200,000 \nyoung people, as you will this year--almost a quarter of a million \nyoung people--the opportunity to go on to higher education because we \ncannot come up with a few extra bucks to put into a Pell Grant Program \nor a Work-Study Program--if you think America benefits from that, then \nyou are deluding yourself. This will be the first generation where the \nolder generation is actually cutting back on its commitments in its \nattempts to provide access to higher education for people in this \ncountry.\n  I hope in the coming days as we move through the appropriations \nprocess and the like, our colleagues will find it possible to break \nthis freezing of the budgets to make it possible for students who are \ncompleting this academic year and thinking about next year, or thinking \nabout graduate school, or leaving high school and wanting to go on to \ncollege--that the Congress of the United States, the President of the \nUnited States, would stand up and say: We are going to do what we can. \nWe are going to meet that promise I made in New Hampshire in the fall \nof 2000 when I promised I would increase Pell grants to more than \n$5,000 per child. I am going to meet that promise before this term is \nover.\n\n  My hope is we will achieve that particular result.\n  I see my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, you were speaking \nabout increasing the Pell grant, which strikes a chord with me. Senator \nPell was my predecessor, the architect of this great program. I am sure \nyou are aware, but if you can confirm this awareness, the Pell Grant \nprogram has a $3.7 billion shortfall because of an increase in the \nnumber of students who have qualified for the Pell grant since our \neconomy has not produced jobs over the last several years and has been \ndead in the water until very recently. We, in our budget, included the \n$3.7 billion, but I am told this funding might be in jeopardy in the \nconference, which would be a grievous blow to the Pell Grant Program in \naddition to what you have described. Are you aware of this difficulty?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Rhode Island. He \nvery appropriately points out he succeeded Claiborne Pell, whom the \nSenator from Massachusetts and I had the great privilege of serving \nwith. The Senator from Rhode Island knows the wonderful contribution he \nmade to millions of young Americans, Americans of all ages, but \nparticularly young Americans.\n  I was not aware of what my colleague from Rhode Island told me. I \nthink that is extremely important information. I would hope, as I am \nsure he does, the conferees and the American public would let conferees \nand the leadership here in Congress know this shortfall must not be \nallowed to exist if we are going to have any hope at all of meeting \nsome of the obligations we have.\n  I might ask my colleague from Rhode Island, give us some indication \nhow that is working now. Does he believe that is going to be the case? \nAnd what would be the implications of that?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I believe the Senator has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut may yield only \nfor a question.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am responding to a question. Without \nyielding my right to the floor, I am asking my colleague from Rhode \nIsland to respond to a question.\n  Mr. REED. Will my colleague yield for another question?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. First, the Pell Grant Program is in jeopardy because of its \nlow funding levels. As you and Senator Kennedy have pointed out so \naccurately, the maximum award has not been raised, contrary to the \nPresident's promise. In addition, the $3.7 billion shortfall exists \ntoday. We have taken a step on our side to remedy the shortfall, but it \nis unclear what the other side and the conferees will do. So that is \nanother detriment to the Pell Grant Program.\n  But I will ask a final question of the Senator. The President's \nbudget not only inadequately funds the Pell Grant Program, but it \neliminates the LEAP Program--Leveraging Educational Assistance \nPartnerships--a collaboration between the State and Federal governments \nto provide need-based grants to low-income students.\n\n  The President's budget also zeroes out funds for the Perkins Loan \nCapital Contributions, which provides low-interest loans to millions of \nlow-income college students.\n  Additionally, the President's budget fails to increase funding for \nthe campus-based programs, Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants \nand Federal Work-Study, as well as the early awareness programs, TRIO \nand GEAR UP.\n  I again inquire whether the Senator is aware that in addition to the \nblows that have been taken to the Pell Grant Program, so many other \nFederal programs that aid particularly low-income Americans are not \nbeing adequately funded. I think that goes directly to your point, I \nsay to the Senator, that 200,000 young Americans with talent, ambition, \nand drive are unable to go to college because we are not providing the \nresources.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, Madam President, I am very grateful to my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island for pointing out matters I had not addressed; that \nis, these other areas of higher education.\n  This is an assault on higher education. But more importantly, it is \nan assault on young people in this country who are going to provide the \nwell-being. I always like to point out this\n\n[[Page S4211]]\n\nNation historically, even during times of our most significant crises, \nhas found a time and a place to support higher education. I have often \npointed out one of the first acts of Congress in 1789, as we were still \nstruggling to get on our feet, was the Northwest Ordinance, which set \naside lands for education. It was a rather remarkable accomplishment. \nThink of all the things the first Congress had to deal with. Education \nwas one of the top priorities on their list.\n  Then right in the middle of the Civil War--imagine the country \ndivided, wondering whether we would survive as a nation--the Congress \nof the United States passed something called the Morrill Act, which was \nthe land grant colleges. I believe the University of Rhode Island--I \nknow the University of Connecticut got started as a land grant college, \nand I know colleges all across this country got their start because of \nthe Morrill Act. Congress found the money during the great Civil War to \nfund higher education.\n  Even before the end of World War II, before the defeat of nazism and \nthe Japanese empire, the Congress passed the GI Bill. And think, if you \nwill, of the investment made in those years, coming off the war years, \nand how we have benefitted, when you consider a generation of Americans \nwhich was able to get an education and go on, and how we have been paid \nback a thousandfold by the contributions of a generation of young \nAmericans who fought in World War II, who were able to get an \neducation, and then provide the kind of innovation and creativity and \njobs and incomes that has helped us grow to the great Nation we are in \nterms of economic strength.\n  So there was the Northwest Ordinance, the Morrill Act, the GI bill, \ngenerations that understood the importance of investing in education. \nHere we are in the 21st century, we have a President that not only \ndoesn't have an idea about how to increase resources for higher \neducation, he wants to cut back on what we have. How do you explain \nthat to the American people when we are trying to increase the \nopportunities for higher education?\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, if I may ask the Senator, we have \ntalked about higher education. Does the Senator not agree with me that \nwe have seen cutbacks in support for K- 12 as well? We have seen the \nfailure of funding No Child Left Behind, which has left 4.6 million \nchildren behind. So we are leaving the children behind in higher \neducation. We are leaving them in No Child Left Behind.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Connecticut as well whether he \nis not concerned, as I am, about the failure to fund the Head Start \nProgram which reaches out and helps 4-year-olds and 5-year-olds prior \nto the time they enter kindergarten, to give them skills and help in \nbuilding confidence so they can gain knowledge and understanding in \ntheir early years in school.\n  Would the Senator not agree with me that what we are talking about is \nbasically failing almost a whole generation? There are 54 million \nelementary and secondary school students across this country, and then \nwe have the millions of children going on to college. And now we are \ntalking about the millions who are eligible for the Head Start Program, \nwho failed to receive the support they need.\n  Would the Senator agree with me that money isn't everything, but it \nis a pretty clear indication of a Nation's priorities? We make choices \nabout what the Nation's priorities are. What we are doing now, with the \nconclusion of the budget which we passed here, is failing the children \nin higher education. We have failed children with No Child Left Behind. \nWe are failing the children with the funding of the Head Start Program. \nWhat does that say about the commitment of this Nation in terms of the \nyoung people? And to their families, hard-working American families, \nwhat does that say about our willingness to reach out a helping hand to \nthese families to make sure the education system is going to be the \nbest that it can be?\n  Mr. DODD. I would say to my colleague, he has hit the nail on the \nhead in talking about elementary and secondary education, beginning \nwith, obviously, Head Start and preschool efforts. He has cited the \nnumbers, and he is absolutely correct. But more than the numbers, when \nyou start to talk about the dollar amounts, I think you can probably \nsee the eyes of even the most determined listener to glaze over. When I \ntalk about an $8.6 billion shortfall to No Child Left Behind this year \nalone, shortchanged more than $26 billion since passage, I am \ndisturbed. It is the children and the families themselves that feel the \nshortfalls. Families lacking the kinds of investments that we know make \na difference in their children's educational lives.\n  We know categorically, after more than a quarter of a century of \nwatching, the benefits of the Head Start Program. It gives them that \neven start. When they enter kindergarten or the first grade, it puts \nthem on a level playing field with other children who come from \nslightly more advantaged situations than they may have.\n  We know that getting Title I money into our school districts has made \na huge difference to schools, and certainly we need to be doing far \nbetter on special education. But to give some idea of what these \nshortfalls mean, this year alone over 7,500 school districts are going \nto see their elementary school funding cut this July. Millions of \ndisadvantaged children will be left behind because of inadequate \nresources in Title I. More than 1.3 million children won't receive \nafterschool services because of funding freezes that have occurred. \nTeacher quality, English language acquisition, impact aid, rural \neducation all have been frozen in this country despite the increasing \ndemands that have occurred.\n\n  The President's budget eliminates 38 programs in areas such as arts \neducation, school counseling, small school support, dropout prevention. \nYou don't need to tell the American public about the importance of \nthese things. They make a difference every day. The fact is that we are \njust decimating these significant efforts, many of which were achieved \nand were created through bipartisan effort and support.\n  I am deeply concerned about what is happening to these younger people \nas they enter the school system, where we want them to have an equal \nopportunity to learn, where they get uncertified teachers and old \ntextbooks, some that say today maybe one day we will land a man on the \nmoon. We actually have children using textbooks that predate 1969 when \nwe landed a man on the moon. Imagine in 2004, you discover your child \nhas a science book that says that. That happens today. Or that your \nchild walks into a biology class or chemistry class in elementary \nschool and almost 35 percent of them in poor rural districts and poor \nurban districts do not have a certified teacher who is teaching.\n  This is the United States of America. If you want us to grow and be \nstronger, you are going to have to make the investments.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for raising these issues \nabout both elementary and secondary education as well as higher \neducation. The American public needs to know this.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for a final question, I think \nthe Senator from Connecticut has the floor. Before we leave this \ndiscussion, I have heard the resolution of the Senator from \nConnecticut, his determination. I would like to ask him whether he \nintends to battle with the rest of us in the remaining days of this \nsession to try to provide that kind of help to these working families \nin these areas of education. Does he not agree with me that this ought \nto still be a priority, and that even as we are coming into the \ncritical times of the appropriations committees, we will have some \nopportunity to continue this battle and call Senators to account to \nfind out whether they believe it is the responsibility of this \ninstitution to continue to invest in the children of our country and to \ncontinue the opportunities of education, and that is the highest \npriority we have here? Do I hear from the Senator that he will join in \nthat battle and continue to fight for those children?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I commit to my colleague and to others as \nwell. This has been an ongoing effort. It will be a continuing one. \nNothing is more important. I have often said, if you can only solve one \nissue, I would choose this one. I don't think there is any more \nimportant problem to solve. Not that others are not important, but if \nwe fail to address the education question effectively, then we leave \nevery other issue in jeopardy, to chance.\n\n[[Page S4212]]\n\nThat goes to the heart of endorsing and supporting our constitutional \nprinciples, our values system, as well as our economic growth.\n  I am not minimizing other issues. I am often asked, as we all are, \nwhat is the single most important issue we have to deal with. Obviously \nissues of going to war, sending young men and women into harm's way, \namending the Constitution, confirming a justice to the Supreme Court \nare high on that list. I would place education as the No. 1 priority, a \nsubstantive issue that ought to be on every one of our lists.\n  I thank the Senator for taking a few minutes out of today to talk \nabout this. There will be other opportunities to raise these concerns \nand these questions, and I hope that before this session of Congress \nends, we will have a more effective result for the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been interested in this discussion. \nIt has nothing to do with asbestos, but nevertheless an important \ndiscussion. I have to say I have taken great interest in the education \nprocesses myself. The other side just thinks there is money growing on \ntrees. Frankly, there is never enough money to satisfy them.\n  All of us wish we could do better. I wish every school district in \nthe country would teach music because it softens kids' lives. When I \nwas a young kid, I was born on the wrong side of the tracks. I was a \ntough little kid. My mother made me learn the piano for 6 months and \nthen made me play the violin, and that made me even tougher, carrying \nthat violin to school. I have to say that softened me and gave me a \nsoft side to what some people think is a fairly tough guy. So I commend \nmy colleagues for wanting to do more. But having Democrats call for \nmore and more spending is a little bit like a glutton who has eaten \neverything on the table and now wants more.\n  There is no end of the spending that they would do, even if we do \nhave a $1.2 trillion deficit. This President has all he can handle. \nThere is no question about it. I commiserate with him. I also look at \nthe outrageous costs of some aspects of higher education brought into \ndiscussion here, what a gravy train it is for some people in many \nuniversities, and how tuition has gone up so much to pay for the gravy \ntrain. It reminds me of the trial lawyers we have been talking about \nwith respect to asbestos reform.\n  Mr. President, I wish to respond to some criticism some friends \nacross the aisle have made regarding my comments about personal injury \nlawyers. In particular, I have been criticized for repeating in public \non the floor of the Senate what many people are saying in private--that \nthere is a political tie between many of these trial lawyers and many \nof my friends across the aisle. I don't think it is news that, as a \nrule, you will find that, all things being equal, most trial lawyers \nwill likely support with their voices, and especially their wallets, \nthe Democratic Presidential nominee and other Democrats across the \naisle. They are the largest single hard money donors to the Democrats--\nthe liberal Democrats. It is hard to find any conservative Democrats, \nother than one I know of over there.\n  If I offended anybody by repeating in public a widely known dynamic, \nI guess I should apologize. I also recognize that I am unlikely to be \nthe American Trial Lawyers' man of the year awardee. I am a member of \nthat organization. I know a lot of great trial lawyers who are honest, \ndecent, and do what is right in serving the American people. They know \nthat when they are right, I am on their side. But in this case they are \nnot right--the few who are abusing the laws.\n  Seriously, if in this debate I have sometimes come down too hard on \npersonal injury lawyers, I have done so because I am concerned that \nwhat stands in the way of a much needed asbestos bill is the handful of \noverzealous, greedy personal injury lawyers--just a handful of lawyers \nin this country. I don't intend to malign personal injury lawyers as a \nclass. I believe personal injury attorneys can serve and, in \nmany cases, have served a vital function for many injured plaintiffs.\n\n  While I don't always see eye to eye with the personal injury bar, \nwhen I think they are right, I don't hesitate to say it and they know \nit. I had plenty of them thanking me for saying so when they were right \nduring the discussion over the tobacco legislation in 1998. I was \nimpressed with Richard Scruggs, or Dickie Scruggs, in the Castano group \nof trial lawyers. I think many trial attorneys played a constructive \nrole in reaching a historic compromise with the tobacco industry. I \nhelped them, and they know it. They were right and I backed them. Some \nin Congress held out for so much money that it was impossible to pass \nFederal tobacco legislation. The theme of some in Congress holding out \nfor too much money is applicable to the asbestos debate.\n  In any event, the work that a gifted group of trial lawyers did with \nMississippi Attorney General Mike Moore deserves a lot of credit. I \nsupported their efforts publicly and even provided my support for \nreasonable compensation for those attorneys. I am not afraid to speak \nup for trial attorneys when I think they are right. I irritated people \non my side who felt they should not get the compensation that I think \nthey more than earned.\n  Frankly, as a former medical malpractice defense lawyer, I liked \nnothing more than to go up against the best plaintiffs' attorneys for \nthe pure challenge of competing against the most skilled adversary. As \na plaintiffs' lawyer, I liked nothing more than having gone up against \nthe best defense lawyers in the country, having the thrill to be able \nto compete with them. In many cases, I would win against them.\n  We all have to recognize that the work of personal injury attorneys \non asbestos litigation has dated back 30 or more years. Without the \nhard work of these lawyers, it is unlikely the U.S. would have come so \nfar in responding to the dangers of asbestos. It is the success of the \ntrial attorneys that put us in the position of recommending legislation \nthat calls for a private trust fund to compensate asbestos victims \nwithout the need for each one to establish causation.\n  In short, personal injury lawyers have won the case, and they won it \nlong ago. What this legislation is trying to do is sort out who pays \nand how much, and do so in a fashion that minimizes the transaction \ncosts so that more of the money goes to the injured persons and less of \nthe money gets swallowed up in litigation, and the courts can get \nunclogged, and so that other fairly brought litigation can be heard.\n  In compensating asbestos victims, we must be mindful not to corrupt \nmore and more firms, which results in more and more job losses, and \nmore and more loss of health care, and losing more and more value in \nretirement stock portfolios, and more and more loss of pensions. That \nis what we are trying to do here.\n  All I hear is whining from the other side. We have heard a lot of \ntalk about how much the bill costs and how much it will pay out to \nvictims. We heard talk about who pays, and how much, and whether they \nare paying enough.\n  If we ever get on the bill, we will hear more talk about these \nimportant issues, as we should. I have no problem with that. But they \nare filibustering even the motion to proceed. My gosh, when are the \nAmerican people going to understand what is going on? They have \nfilibustered virtually everything that has come up this year. It is \ngoing to take a supermajority to pass the simplist of bills the way \nthey have been carrying on. It boggles my mind. But that is what is at \nstake in tomorrow's cloture vote.\n\n  Will we vote for cloture so we can talk about the issues on the bill \nitself? I hope we will proceed to the bill. But it shows the politics \nthat are being played. For my friends on the other side to come on the \nfloor and say this bill doesn't do enough, after we have given and \ngiven and given in to their suggestions time after time, or to say it \nis not procedurally proper or not written right, after 15 months of \ndedicated, hard effort--I have to say by a few Democrats, and by many \non our side--it goes beyond the pale.\n  It is true that I have irritated some personal injury lawyers in some \nof my remarks. The ones I am talking about deserve irritation. I don't \nbelieve they are honest. I believe they are exploiting a system and \ntaking moneys that should go to people who are sick. What\n\n[[Page S4213]]\n\nI am about to say may further irritate them and some of those across \nthe aisle.\n  I have some important questions to raise with respect to attorneys' \nfees. Frankly, the issue of attorneys' fees is a key issue because it \nis critical in determining how much of the funds will actually end up \nin the pockets of the injured people. As I have said, today about 60 \npercent of the funds wither away to lawyers on both sides of these \ncases. You can expect that about one-third of any recovery will go to \nthe plaintiffs' attorneys. In a no-fault, nonadversarial compensation \nsystem, there should be no place for the routine attorneys' fee level \nof one-third of the recovery.\n  Accordingly, in our bill, we employ the same fee schedule used by the \nRadiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA. In the RECA law--a bill I \nwrote and passed through this body a number of times--the lawyers' cut \nis 2 percent of the recovery in noncontested cases, and 10 percent for \ncomplicated cases. These cases are like rolling off a log if this is \npassed. Lawyers do not deserve 60 percent in defendant and plaintiff \nattorneys' fees, in addition to the transaction clause. The fee \nschedule results in the lion's share going to the injured persons and \ntheir families. This is the way it should be in the radiation exposure \ncases involving downwinders of nuclear tests, and this is the way it \nshould be for asbestos victims. This is what is in our bill. It is a \nlong settled way of solving these problems and a reasonable way that \npays the attorneys what they should be paid--actually more, in many \ninstances--but it stops the gravy train that is ripping off the sick \nand needy who have suffered from asbestos.\n  What is unknown is what our friends believe to be a fair level of \ncompensation for personal injury lawyers in this new no-fault system. I \nask today for our colleagues to come to the floor and tell us if they \nsupport or oppose our proposed attorneys' fees levels, if they believe \nour 2 percent for uncontested cases that are like rolling off a log, \nand 10 percent for those who might have some small contest, and they \nwill still be like rolling off a log compared to litigation in trial. \nIf this provision is not proper, please tell us how they would do it. \nWe have not had the slightest suggestion from them.\n  If they believe it is still appropriate to retain attorneys' fees of \n33 percent to 40 percent or higher, please explain why this is fair or \nnecessary in a no-fault, nonadversarial system that this bill would \nmake into reality. In the spirit of good faith, we agreed to move the \nprogram into the labor-friendly Department of Labor. The Secretary of \nLabor does not favor this. The White House does not favor this. I, \nfrankly, do not favor this. I am afraid that will run the program into \nthe ground because the Labor Department has been controlled by liberal \nbureaucrats for many years. But we are willing, in the interest of \ngetting this done, in the interest of helping these people, to even do \nthat.\n  Running a program to compensate workers out of the Department of \nLabor may be somewhat akin to voluntarily playing the Celtics in the \nBoston Garden. We made a genuine concession on the administrative \nprocess, as our colleagues know. We have repeatedly asked them to \nrecognize it is appropriate for them to act in a spirit of genuine \ncompromise with respect to attorneys' fees.\n  Let's face it, numbers are flying around in this debate. One way that \nthe difference between our respective proposed level of total claims \ncan be bridged is to reach agreement on the appropriate level of \ncompensation for attorneys' fees. But we cannot even get them to talk \nabout that. Even if we could, we could not talk about it because we are \non a filibuster on the motion to even proceed to the bill. Once we go \nto the bill, we would have a filibuster on that, if we can ever get to \nthat point, but at least we would be able to be on the bill.\n  We believe the RECA, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, \nexposure level of 2 percent of noncontested cases and 10 percent for \ncontested cases is both fair and reasonable because both cases will be \neasy for the plaintiffs or those who claim to be sick to get \ncompensation if they are sick.\n  What do our friends across the aisle think about this? What are they \nproposing on this important issue? I ask they be specific so we and \nother interested parties can evaluate their position on this essential \nquestion. We have only been negotiating with them for 15 solid months, \nand we still do not have their suggestions. Yet they are saying: Oh, \nthis is just too premature. That is after many of them said last year \nwe should have gotten this bill done before the end of last year's \nsession.\n  When is it going to end? When is this kind of phoniness going to end? \nA great deal of the difference in the compensation levels, in each of \nour respective levels of total compensation, in our bill it is $114 \nbillion plus a $10 billion set of contingency funds, and in one widely \ncited Democratic claim values amendment $167 billion can be bridged by \nfactoring in the share that can go to personal injury attorneys.\n  I do not want to cut them out from reasonable fees, but I do think \n$60 billion is unreasonable because that money comes out of the hides \nof the sick people. No wonder attorneys in this country are so looked \ndown upon, especially personal injury lawyers. I happen to know about \n90 percent of the ATL people are sick of this and sick of this 10 \npercent who are running wild taking advantage of the whole system and \nbasically destroying the right of individual sick people to get \nadequate compensation.\n  This bill would take care of that problem. If the Democrats are \nadvocating that the customary one-third of the award can go to the \nlawyers, then we are not that far apart as to how much money should go \nto injured workers and families. We should work together to see if we \ncan agree on a reasonable level of compensation for these attorneys. I \ncall them the Fred Barrons of this world and other personal injury \nlawyers who are bringing these suits in selected favored jurisdictions \nso they can get easier verdicts. I challenge them to come in and tell \nus what would be a reasonable level of attorneys' fees, and let's quit \nplaying the game.\n\n  This is a no-fault, nonadversarial system that does not justify the \ntype of attorneys' fees that have been ripping off the public, \nespecially the sick, the weak, the feeble, and the injured the way the \ncurrent broken tort system is. I have no doubt that public discussion \nof this issue may bring great consternation among the ranks of some of \nmy Democratic friends due to their close relationships with many in the \ntrial attorney bar. But if we are ever going to have a meaningful no-\nfault trust fund asbestos bill, we are not going to be able to \nguarantee and should not be asked to guarantee the usual one-third to \n40 percent of the take going to the plaintiffs' trial lawyers regime. \nOne-third or more going to the lawyers is simply too much, especially \nin a no-fault, nonadversarial system.\n  The unions should recognize this, and the public should recognize \nthis, but most of all these lawyers ought to recognize this and quit \nripping off the sick and the downtrodden and those who really deserve \nthese moneys.\n  The silence of my friends across the aisle on this issue, both in \nprivate and public talks, is deafening. When we did the RECA bill, I \nwas chairman of the Labor Committee. I fought that bill through for \nyears until we finally were able to get it done. All these people are \nasking for more money for education, more money for all the social \nprograms, more money for this, more money for that, and they were the \nones who were giving us a rough time. Finally, after I was reelected, \nthey then realized we better get on the ball and do something about \nthis. That is how the radiation exposure compensation law, which is now \nfollowed by countries all over the world because of what we did, is now \nlaw, compensating people, not very much for the suffering they went \nthrough, nothing like we are going to compensate from the private \nsector, no way near what we are going to compensate here.\n  The silence of my friends on the other side of the aisle, both in \nprivate and public talks, is deafening. I heard some of my colleagues, \nwho I respect, come on this floor with a straight face and say this is \nnot the right way to do it, although last year it was. They were \ntalking about this administrative approach is the right way to do it. \nWhy isn't it the right way to do it during a\n\n[[Page S4214]]\n\nPresidential election year? I ask the people out there watching and \nlistening, why is it they suddenly think this is not the right way to \ndo it when we put up even more money before, giving in on at least 53 \ndifferent amendments, have moved this into an administrative process in \nthe Department of Labor that many on our side question? Why is it that \nthey are still balking at this in this Presidential election year?\n  I think there is only one conclusion most people are drawing, and I \nhate to see that. I hate to see that. If they do not like this bill, \nthey should offer a substitute amendment. Let's have it out. Maybe they \nwill win. Maybe these 8,400 companies and 16 insurance companies will \nget clobbered even worse so they can barely survive, and some are still \ngoing to go into bankruptcy. They certainly will if some of these \npeople with their outrageous demands get their way. It is time to stop \ntalking generalities and start voting on specific amendments.\n\n  I want next to make a few remarks about the process that has been \nobserved to date and why I will be very disappointed if we are not \nallowed to proceed to the bill tomorrow after the cloture vote. Just \nthink about it; they are filibustering the motion to proceed. They \ncould have easily given in just like that and said, No, let's go to the \nbill, and we will filibuster the bill. That would be the straight up \nway of doing it. But to filibuster the motion to proceed means they \nmust be beholden to somebody to pull that kind of a procedural \nmechanism. That does not happen very often, and it should not be \nhappening here.\n  Frankly, that we are being forced to vote cloture is disturbing to me \nand should be disturbing to everyone, although I do recognize if \ncloture is not invoked, it would be pleasing to these few trial \nattorneys who are milking this system dry at the expense of those who \nare sick and afflicted and downtrodden. They will not have to see if \ntheir customary one-third or 40 percent of representation in the \nasbestos claims in the new no-fault system can be justified on the \nfloor of the Senate. That is just matter of fact and people need to \nknow it. That is why I am here on the Senate floor.\n  I rise today in response, again, to complaints that I have been \nhearing from some Members on the other side of the aisle about being \nrushed to consider a national solution to this asbestos mess. As many \nof my colleagues know, the asbestos litigation crisis is not new to \nthis body. We have been talking about the problem for the better part \nof a decade, but now that we find ourselves on the verge of considering \na proposed solution, I am puzzled to hear that the process has somehow \nbeen unfair, that we are not acting as ``proper legislators'' for \nbringing this bill to the floor under the current circumstances.\n  I think anybody with brains would find these complaints devoid of any \nmerit whatsoever, especially when viewed against the legislative \nhistory of this asbestos bill.\n  While we have tried to build consensus over the past 15 months, \nthousands of asbestos victims have gone uncompensated or left with only \npennies on the dollars they deserve. Veterans and people like those in \nLibby, MT, are left with no one to sue. More than 70 companies have \ngone bankrupt and dozens more will soon follow.\n  Since we started working on this legislation, 60,000 jobs have been \nalready lost at a cost of more than $2.2 billion in lost wages alone. \nLet me repeat these numbers so they can sink in. Sixty thousand jobs \nhave been already lost at a cost of more than $2.2 billion in lost \nwages alone, and sadly another 400,000 jobs will soon be lost. Yet we \nstill talk. There are compelling calls for action. There are empathetic \nexpressions of compassion for victims. There are meetings and letters, \npromises of solutions to come and proposals to be made, and yet for all \nof this ocean of good intentions we are all still stuck.\n  Frankly, much of the current asbestos litigation is all too \nreminiscent of the mythical Jarndyce case from the Charles Dickens \n``Bleak House.'' As my colleagues will recall, this was a case in which \nmost of the estate was swallowed up by lawyers' fees and court costs.\n  One has to ask how and why we got to this point. In September 2002, \nwhen Senator Leahy chaired the Judiciary Committee, he held a hearing \non the asbestos litigation crisis. I commend Senator Leahy for his \nefforts. The hearing was balanced. It was instructive, providing \nvaluable evidence of the dire circumstances for asbestos victims, \nemployees, companies, and insurance carriers. The judicial system and \nthe American economy at this national embarrassment was left intact. \nThat was a year and a half ago.\n  When I became chairman of the committee 4 months later, I immediately \nmade it clear that I wanted to build on that record, draft a bipartisan \nlegislative solution and pass it. Almost immediately, concerns were \nraised, warnings were issued: You are moving too fast, some said. The \nissue is not ripe, others advised. You better get it right, others \nstill warned.\n  Two months later, on March 5, 2003, I chaired another hearing. Some \nof the same witnesses from before appeared again and the testimony made \nit abundantly clear that while the problem had gotten worse, there was \nbipartisan interest in the idea of creating a national trust fund. We \nheard solutions from a variety of perspectives--from academia, from \nbusiness, from the unions, and from trial bar experts. I made clear I \nwould incorporate any constructive proposals offered. I wanted a bill \nthat would work. I wanted it to be a bipartisan bill.\n  As a result of hearing the magnitude of the asbestos problem, we \nworked toward drafting a bill that would create a national privately \nfinanced no-fault compensation fund for asbestos victims. As word \nspread about our efforts, warning flags were raised. Some in the \nminority on the other side of the aisle urged us to move slowly, not to \nrush; more time was needed; more talk was needed.\n  We finished drafting the bill and we shared it with others, both in \nthe Senate and among interested shareholders. There was real interest \nand we were given several good ideas and suggestions. Unfortunately, \nfor the first time the minority's caution chorus took voice: We're \nbeing rushed; we're being jammed.\n\n  This is the minority's caution chorus of worrisome lions. This is \nwhat we have been going through now for 15 solid months: Do not rush \nus; do not do this; do not do that; we must be cautious.\n  We were rushing them, we were jamming them; according to them; I was \nacting unfairly. All this drama was over a bill that I had not even \nintroduced.\n  I had listened for hours and hours, worked with my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle for days, weeks, and months. They asked that I delay \nintroduction. They asked that I delay introduction so they could have \nmore time to study the issue and my proposal, which I did. We had more \nmeetings, more talk. I incorporated several of their ideas into the \nbill and asked if they would cosponsor it.\n  Now I am pleased that a few did. I am forever grateful to those on \nthe Democratic side who did. There were two who did--two, after all \nthis work. Fifteen months later, we are down to one. More said that it \nwas not the right time. They were upset with the way I had shared my \ndraft legislation.\n  On May 22, 2003, Senators Nelson, Miller, DeWine, Voinovich, Allen, \nChambliss, Hagel, and I introduced S. 1125, the FAIR Act. The \nminority's caution chorus sang again. These miserable, cowardly lions \nsang again. They were being rushed. They were being jammed.\n  In truth, I introduced the bill 78 days after my hearing, 20 weeks \nafter the beginning of the session, 6 months after the hearing of 2002. \nThis was clearly no sprint.\n  On June 19, I held the first markup. Again, the minority caution \nchorus took over again and took voice. The issue was still too complex. \nThe bill was too complicated. We were not doing it right. They were \nbeing rushed. They were being jammed. They asked for more time, and \nthey were given it.\n  Unlike ever before, the committee's markup of the legislation was \nspread over 3 weeks, 3 solid weeks. We spent 4 separate days--not many \nbills take 4 days to mark up--considering changes, often working late \ninto the night. We invited experts to sit with us as we worked through \ncomplicated medical issues. This was no sprint, no rush to judgment. \nThere was no mad dash.\n\n[[Page S4215]]\n\n  Interestingly, when there was engagement from the other side, \nagreements were reached. In fact, the committee was able to resolve \nwhat at the time was supposed to be the biggest impediment to reaching \na consensus, an issue so fraught with partisan disagreement that it \ncould never be resolved.\n  In the end, we accommodated scores of concerns raised by the minority \nand found a common ground on medical criteria that everybody, Democrats \nand Republicans, agreed to. It was a major victory. This bipartisan \naccord was achieved and the committee adopted it unanimously. This was \none of the most ideologically divided committees in the Senate, some \nsay the toughest committee in the Senate with those who are the most \nideologically challenged, I should say, and I cannot disagree with \nthat.\n  The next impossible hurdle was claims values. Again, I was told there \nwas no way a group so divisive, so argumentative, so plainly \ndisagreeable as the Judiciary Committee could reach an agreement on how \nmuch to pay victims. Now, despite the dire predictions, a bipartisan \nagreement was reached again. The committee adopted the Graham-Feinstein \namendment on claims values by the whopping bipartisan vote of 14 to 3. \nNow I just want to mention to my colleagues on the other side that \nevery one of the Democrats voted for that. Three of our Republicans \nthought it was too much money and they voted against it, and they may \nnot have been wrong. The only problem is that we are way beyond that \nmoney today.\n\n  I might add that all of these negative votes were cast by Republicans \nwho thought some values were too high. As my colleagues know, we are \nmore moderate to conservative over here, and I cannot blame them for \nraising those issues.\n  On July 10, 2003, despite the constant wailing from the minority's \ncaution chorus again, we reported the bill out of committee by a vote \nof 10 yeas and 8 nays and 1 abstention. We all knew more work had to be \ndone before the legislation could be brought to the floor. We also knew \nthere would be no bill unless there was a willingness on both sides to \npass a solution to move towards the middle.\n  As summer turned to fall, there were sporadic attempts at additional \nnegotiations involving committee staff, as well as among the \nleadership. Minor matters were resolved, but there was no evidence on \nthe part of the minority's leadership of any real interest to engage in \nthe kind of meaningful effort needed to finalize a bill. Individual \nmembers of the minority were very public about their interest in \nlegislating, but those purportedly tasked with the negotiations did not \npossess the same zeal.\n  We have heard, for my whole 28 years, how much more concerned the \nother side is about people and their problems. Well, it does not take \nmuch to figure out their concern here is more about the trial lawyers \nand the personal injury lawyers who are involved, because they are sure \nnot working hard, in my eyes, or I think anybody else who looks at it \nobjectively, to find a way of helping those who are truly injured and \nhurt.\n  Now, while these efforts were making little progress, work was \nunderway on another front beginning in August. Senator Specter began an \nintriguing, arduous mediation among the major stakeholders. That means \nthe victims, the alleged victims, the trial attorneys, the personal \ninjury lawyers, the insurance companies, the companies that have been \nsued, and companies that are about to be sued. He took on this job. I \ngive him a lot of credit for it. He convinced Judge Edward Becker, \nformer Chief Judge of the Third Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, to \nplay a lead role as a negotiator, as a mediator, for which Judge Becker \nis eminently qualified. He and the judge forced the parties to spend \ndozens and dozens of hours together. We were there, so we do know.\n\n  We spent hours and hours, days, weeks, and months, arguing the \npositions and searching for a common ground. Senator Specter and Judge \nBecker should be commended for their Herculean efforts to keep the \nparties talking and, despite the objections of the representatives and \nthe personal injury lawyers, there was progress--slow, incremental, but \nprogress. The unions played a significant role. They were there \nvirtually all the time.\n  However, we have never been able to satisfy them, even though their \nworkers are the ones who are going to be hurt the most if this bill \ndoesn't pass. They are the ones who are not going to get compensated \nbecause the moneys are being sopped up by personal injury lawyers and \npeople who are not sick because these personal injury lawyers are going \nto jurisdictions that basically are out of whack, that really will not \nlook at these things in a reasonable way and who basically find for \nwhoever brings the case and find in huge amounts for people who are not \neven sick in many cases.\n  I compliment Senator Specter and Judge Becker. There has been some \nslow progress during that period of time.\n  During the fall, Senator Frist and I spent considerable time working \nwith those who would be paying for the fund to ensure its solvency. It \nwas imperative that the bill establish a steady and sufficient flow of \nmoneys without allowing the fund itself to perpetuate the same kind of \neconomic disasters caused by the tort system as a whole and by the tort \nsystem with regard to this type of case.\n  By the end of October, these issues had been completed and there was \na renewed attempt to begin negotiations with those on the other side of \nthe aisle, but every time an overture was made, the caution chorus was \nbeing rolled out: We are being rushed. We are being jammed. Every time \nit was rolled out by the other side of the aisle.\n  There was always some reservation; Things were moving too fast; There \nwere other more important issues; They hadn't been asked the right way; \nThey were being rushed; They were being jammed. The reasons changed but \nthe result was always the same--no real negotiations. In fact, to this \nday we do not have a substitute or an offer by those who are \ncomplaining on the other side--to this day. We don't even have a \nmonetary amount other than they have thrown out $170 billion, which \neverybody knows cannot be the number.\n  During my tenure in this body, I worked with my colleagues in the \nminority on a number of issues, on landmark drug legislation, the \nHatch-Waxman Act, which gave life to the generic drug industry and \nsaved consumers and our Government tens of billions of dollars since \n1984. I worked with minority Members on children's health insurance, on \nchildcare, on tax reform, job training. I have worked with them on \nissues involving crime, on legal reform, and a whole raft of other \nissues.\n\n  The Members of the minority are excellent legislators and skilled \nnegotiators. They have insightful and creative staffs. I have worked \nwith them when they wanted to pass a bill, and I know what it is like \nwhen they want to pass a bill. I have worked with them when they do \nnot, and I know what it is like when they do not. I am telling you this \nis a time when they just don't seem to want to, because there has been \nplenty of opportunity to resolve this matter.\n  It is not hard to tell the difference. When there is a genuine \ninterest in legislating, one of two things happens. A member of the \nminority leadership comes on at the outset and his or her presence and \ncommitment helps to generate sufficient pressure on both sides to move \nlegislation.\n  The second way, the minority offers their own version of the bill \nenabling both sides to sit down and work through the differences and \ncraft a compromise.\n  Here there was no move by the minority's leadership and there was \nnever, despite repeated and frequent requests, any interest by the \nminority in introducing their own solution. Instead, they chose to \nspend their time finding fault with our legislation and complaining \nabout our process.\n  Another concentrated effort to move the bill was made in November, \nlast year, and not surprisingly the caution chorus came out and began \nsinging its song again: We are being rushed; we are being jammed, even \nthough there were a number of Democrats who stood up and said they had \nto get this done before the end of this year.\n  Where are the real Democrats? That is what I would like to know. The \npressure continued, however. Interested\n\n[[Page S4216]]\n\nstakeholders would not take no for an answer. Hints were made about \nbringing the bill to the floor, even if it resulted in a filibuster. \nSuddenly the message changed. Now we were told the minority's \nleadership wanted to find a resolution, that there was bipartisan \ninterest in passing a solution. It was implied if we would just \npostpone consideration to early next year, there would be ample time to \nfinish work on this bill.\n  The majority leader agreed and on November 22, 2003, he announced he \nwould not bring up the asbestos bill prior to the end of the session. \nInstead, he would give the parties additional time to complete their \nnegotiations. But he made clear his intention of bringing the bill to \nthe floor this year.\n  His announcement was well received by the other side. I remember. As \nthis year began, it was clear from the outset that, despite the \npromises of November, little had changed; there were no real \nbreakthroughs. So, in February, the majority leader announced his \nintention to bring the bill to the floor the third week of April. But \nyet again the caution chorus rolled out its usual objections: The issue \nwas too complex; the legislation was too complicated; they were being \nrushed; they were being jammed. Indeed, we even offered to engage in \nprotracted negotiating sessions, but again the Democrats demurred.\n  In February, my staff sent an e-mail to Democratic staffers proposing \na multiday negotiation to seek a resolution of the issue. It contains \nan offer to meet during all-day sessions, ``during recess weekends, or \nweekends during session.''\n  The response from the minority was unambiguous: Don't rush us. Don't \nrush us.\n\n  Senator Specter, to his credit, kept pushing forward and, as a result \nof his efforts, the stakeholders reached agreement on what was supposed \nto be another impossible hurdle, the administrative structure, which I \nmentioned earlier.\n  The proposal was not to our liking. It would require a fundamental \nchange in our position, allowing the fund to be run out of the \nDepartment of Labor, but because organized labor signaled its strong \nsupport for this change and because we wanted to reach consensus on \nother critical issues remaining on the bill, we agreed and we agreed \ndespite the objections from many on our side of the aisle and in spite \nof the objections from the White House.\n  The minority, instead of accepting this concession, instead of \nendorsing this considerable victory for organized labor, made it clear \nthat this significant agreement meant nothing more than a chance to \nbank an advantage. They offered no alternative. They revealed no new \nproposal or compromise. In fact, it is reminiscent of the style of \nnegotiation that says: What is mine is mine; what is yours is \nnegotiable.\n  Nonetheless, additional proposals were made but there was no \ncounteroffer, none of the typical give and take that is the hallmark of \nserious negotiations in this most important legislative body in the \nworld. It was like trying to play tennis with a curtain. There is never \nany meaningful discussion of what the payers, the ones who have to pay \nthese bills, most desire and, frankly, they deserve: a fair and \npredictable payment schedule.\n  Whatever we do is going to be tough on the payers here. This bill is \nplenty tough on the payers. Don't think they are not squealing; they \nare.\n  It was now obvious even to the most optimistic Member of this Chamber \nthat it would be impossible to bring a consensus bill to the floor, one \nsupported by the leadership of both parties. We are hearing Senator \nLeahy has at last put together an alternative proposal on this national \ntrust fund. Has it been introduced? Have we even seen it? Of course \nnot. The only choice left was to bring a bill to the floor and hope \nenough Members of the minority thought the issue was of sufficient \nimportance, as they have repeatedly said, to allow the Senate to \nconsider this bill.\n  To help facilitate discussion, I introduced, with Senator Frist and \nSenator Miller from the other side of the aisle, S. 2290, a second \nversion of the bill which incorporated many significant changes that \nhave been made since the legislation was first introduced and first \nreported from the committee.\n  That is the legislation before us today. It contains the bipartisan \nagreement on medical criteria. It contains the agreement reached by the \nstakeholders on the revised administrative structure and numerous other \nchanges adopted during the Specter negotiations that have all been to \ntry to get the Democrats to move on this bill. It contains the handful \nof changes agreed to by both sides since the bill was reported out of \ncommittee. It also contains higher claims values passed by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of committee and incorporates yet another \nmonumental change and another fundamental concession to address the \ncomplaints by the minority.\n  We have included provisions in the bill to make clear that the risk \nof insolvency will not be borne by the asbestos victims; it will fall \non the defendant companies and their carriers. If there are \ninsufficient moneys, the fund will terminate and parties will return to \nthe tort system--to Federal courts. There is no point in sending it \nback to the State jurisdictions that created the asbestos crisis in the \nfirst place.\n  Here we are today. The time has come to act. The day of decision has \narrived. Unfortunately, to no one's surprise, the caution choir is on \nits feet again, or somewhat on its feet, I guess I should say: They \nneed more time; the issues are too complex; the bill is too long; they \nweren't consulted the right way; they were being rushed; they are being \njammed.\n  I was told by many at the beginning of last year that when I embarked \non this legislation the Democrats would simply run out the clock. They \nwill never let us vote on a bill that could deprive them of their huge \ncash cow.\n  First, Democrats would push into the election year, they said. Then \nthey would filibuster a motion to proceed. That is exactly what has \nhappened so far in their zeal to make sure that their hard money donors \nget their way at least this year--an election year. It is not too late \nto change that.\n  Let me just say that the caution chorus is sounding like a broken \nrecord that needs to be shut off. It has been 333 days since S. 1125 \nwas introduced.\n  A hundred years ago, it took Christopher Columbus only 222 days to \ndiscover the new world and return to Spain--one of the most remarkable \ndiscoveries in the history of the world. It took Neil Armstrong only 8 \ndays to travel to the Moon and back. Our forefathers were able to write \nthe U.S. Constitution in only 4 months. But somehow there hasn't been \nenough time for the minority to help write this bill although they have \nhad a lot of say and have had a lot of concession. We have tried to do \neverything to bring them to the table and get things done. Here we find \nourselves in a filibuster on the motion to proceed.\n  This caution chorus of cowardly lions reminds me of what is going on. \nOf course, there was one big difference. In those historical examples, \nthe players actually wanted to finish. They actually wanted to discover \nan America. They actually wanted to go to the Moon.\n  Over these 333 days, we have had numerous congressional recesses and \nholidays. Just look at this. Over 333 days, and we are now under a \nfilibuster. That comes from the Spanish word ``filibustero,'' meaning \npirating or hijacking. It is just one more obstruction. We have had \nnothing but obstruction since George Bush has become President of the \nUnited States--over and over. There have been very few bills passed, \nand the ones that have passed have had to overcome the obstructionism. \nMy goodness. There are some Democrats who have been willing to overcome \nobstruction, but on this one, it has not been brought to conclusion.\n\n  We have had one entire summer, the fall, winter, and we are quickly \nworking our way through spring. How much more time is needed to sit \ndown and get this matter resolved? The time has come for the minority \nto stand up and be counted.\n  If they are genuinely troubled by our proposal and all the agreements \nwe have reached with them, they have an obligation--indeed a \nresponsibility--to offer their own solution. The challenge is on them. \nIntroduce a bill. Make sure it strikes the same balance demanded of us. \nMake sure it is fair in the way we have tried to make it fair. Make \nsure it provides adequate moneys for asbestos\n\n[[Page S4217]]\n\nvictims. Make sure it provides compensation quickly, efficiently, and \nfairly. Make sure it does not reward the unimpaired, those who aren't \nsick. Make sure it is not hijacked and turned into a smokers' \ncompensation fund. Make sure it does not bankrupt more companies and \nthrow hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work and out of their \nhealth plans, their pensions, or wipe out their lives financially.\n  That is what is going to happen. For the life of me, I can't \nunderstand why many in the trade union movement aren't jumping on this \nbill in every way they possibly can because their employees are the \nones who are getting hurt. They will never get the money we have in \nthis bill if we don't pass a bill.\n  Make sure it doesn't stick the Federal Government with a bill at end \nof the day.\n  Now you on the other side of the aisle have claimed that the asbestos \ncrisis must be fixed. You have all agreed there is a crisis in our \ncountry. You have conceded that the tort system is broken, that we have \na historic opportunity to act. The end is within reach, and we must \ngrasp it.\n  But here we are. I think the time has come to act, to make good on \nthe promises which have been made on the other side of the aisle, to \ndemonstrate the leadership and responsibility our Nation demands when \nwe are asked to do our job to fix a national crisis. It is time to move \npast our alleged mistakes and complaints about perceived procedural \ninsensitivities.\n  It is time for the caution choir, which we have been looking at here \ntoday, to quit singing ``We are being rushed; We are being jammed.'' It \nis time for the real interests to take a stand and to do what is right.\n  It is getting late in the day to appoint another committee and \nschedule more meetings and talk. It really bothers me that they are \nfilibustering the motion to proceed, which has only been used on rare \noccasions before the last few years, before the obstructions that have \nbeen occurring on a regular basis. People in the past were willing to \ndebate these bills and were willing to try to amend them if they didn't \nlike them, willing to be legislators and not obstructionists, willing \nto do what is right for the American people.\n  We have now been on this bill 15 solid months and we still have not \nseen, other than demands during negotiations, what our friends on the \nother side must have to resolve this problem, which in many respects is \nthe most dangerous problem hanging over America today, especially for \nemployees, especially for union members, especially for those who want \nhealth care and who want their pensions to be saved, especially for \n8,400 companies on the one hand, and maybe more if these voracious \npersonal injury lawyers continue to conjoin people who really have had \nnothing to do with asbestos but have been conjoined in these actions \nwhere they are stuck with humongous defense costs and attorneys' fees \nthemselves, so the moneys that would go to the sick and the needy, \nthose who really need it, go down the drain of legal fees, clogging our \ncourts so that other legitimate cases can't be brought.\n\n  Again, I will return to that message. Why is it that we are going \nthrough this type of chorus charade? Why is it that we haven't had more \ncooperation? Why is it that we can't get them to come up with what is \nneeded to resolve this morass? Why is it during this election year?\n  All I can do is ask the question. I think anybody observing knows \nwhat the answers are. At least that is what has been alleged to me. \nThat is what has been suggested. I hope it is not true.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He has served in \nthis Senate for many years. He is himself a superb lawyer, a \nconstitutional scholar, and has been through many of these debates.\n  I remember on one night after 11 o'clock at night when the chairman \nmet with everybody who had a problem. He urged them to come forward. He \ncompromised and compromised.\n  Frankly, sometimes I think maybe the bill has gone too far--really \nseriously. We need to talk about that, offer amendments to fix it. We \nought bring the bill to the Senate floor and start to discuss that.\n  But Senator Hatch has bent over backwards to make sure this \nlegislation which is critically needed for America passes. It is \ncritically needed for people who are sick from asbestos and those who \nfear they might get sick from it. I thank the chairman for his \nleadership. I have not known any effort that I have seen in which a \nchairman has gone further to try to win the support of other members in \nthe committee and the Senators who might be dubious, to get their \nsupport. And the Senator continues to get it.\n\n  I thought we had the bill completed. I thought we had everybody \nsigned up. I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. I appreciate \nthe hard work the Senator and others have put in on this side. There \nare some on the other side who have worked hard. Particularly, I \nexpress my gratitude to Senator Miller, Senator Nelson, and Senator \nFeinstein. I understand Senators Nelson and Feinstein are probably \ngoing to vote against cloture. I don't know. I cannot speak for them. I \nhope not. They are two who have tried to work with us on this bill.\n  If that is laid down, I don't know where we will go. I am afraid an \nawful lot of people will be left high and dry while these trial \nlawyers, the personal injury lawyers, walk off with $60 billion in fees \nand costs that could go to people who are sick. I don't begrudge \nattorneys the fees they earn. We have more than made a case that the \nsystem is broken. There are a certain limited number of personal injury \nlawyers who are taking advantage of the system and doing it in ways \nthat are reprehensible.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman. I agree with his comments. I \nthank him for doing all that humanly could be done to win the support \nnecessary for this bill.\n  I had a brief period of time in which I filed plaintiffs' lawsuits \nfor individuals who had asbestos injuries. These individuals were sick; \nasbestos is a debilitating disease. They had been heavily exposed to \nasbestos. One individual worked in a submarine, where the air inside \nwas thick with asbestos fibers. He was severely debilitated as a result \nof that. I believe people who are injured ought to be compensated.\n  It was discovered that manufacturers of asbestos knew at some point \nbefore they told people who were working on it that it was dangerous. \nAnd they should have told them it was dangerous and their health was at \nrisk and they did not do so. That is the fundamental cause of the \nlitigation.\n  I filed my asbestos litigation in the 1970s. I eventually turned it \nover to a group of lawyers who were experts in this matter. They took \nthe case. I was not able to do it. They did a lot of work. They had to \nbreak down barriers, win the liability questions, and prove knowledge \non the part of the companies. They overcame legal objections such as \nwhose asbestos did you breathe.\n  Most plaintiffs' lawyers today involved in litigation are not proud \nof what has happened with asbestos. The companies have been tagged. The \ncompanies are stuck. They admit they did wrong. They are willing to \ncompensate, as they are able to compensate. There is only so much \nmoney. We are talking about billions of dollars, maybe $54 billion \nalready paid out.\n  I was there as a lawyer and earned part of a fee out of the \nlitigation. I didn't know how it would come out or what the statute of \nlimitation was. Maybe my claim has expired. But things have changed. \nThe companies are willing to pay. Some victims are sick and need \ncompensation. They need it now. They do not need to have a big chunk of \nwhat they are entitled to paid to lawyers or to experts or testing \ncompanies. They need to be paid. It is a blight on the legal system.\n  I see the distinguished assistant Democratic leader. He is a superior \nlawyer, and would do an admirable job in court, no doubt. But, these \ncases are not going to trial. It is a process. These cases are filed \nand settled, and sometimes victims are paid. Certain defendants do not \nhave money, so they cannot pay. Sixty asbestos companies are in \nbankruptcy today because they cannot pay or cannot fully pay all the \nclaims. Thousands of new claims are being filed on a regular basis.\n\n[[Page S4218]]\n\n  The new trend is that people not sick are filing. They may have been \nexposed to asbestos, and there may be some showing of asbestos in the \npleura or their lungs, but it has not had a debilitating effect or not \ncaused cancer or anything like that, and they are filing by the tens of \nthousands, saying they might get sick. But they are not sick yet.\n  What do you do? It is perfectly appropriate that this Congress act. \nWe do it with workmens' compensation. A person is injured on the job, \nthey get compensation under certain circumstances. It is a lot easier \nto get it, but it is limited and you do not have to pay so much \nexpenses and it works pretty well. That is all by regulation. We do not \nleave everything totally to juries, judges, and lawyers to settle.\n  I believe in the principle of the Congress stepping in, when \nnecessary. The fundamental reason I believe, is that, in my view, in \nthe history of the most magnificent legal system we have, the Anglo-\nAmerican heritage of law, we have ever had a system that has been as \nabused. Sixty percent of the money paid out by the defendant companies, \nover half of it, 60 percent according to testimony we had a number of \nyears ago in the Judiciary Committee, does not get to the people who \nare sick. It does not get to any plaintiff. It is eaten up by court \ncosts, lawyer fees, expert witnesses, and testing companies. That is \nnot right.\n  It is not right when the defendants themselves admit they are wrong \nand are willing to pay. In fact, they do pay and they agreed to pay and \nthey have trusts that are supposed to pay, but the trusts are getting \ndrained of money. Companies are going into bankruptcy and fewer and \nfewer victims are getting paid.\n  If we care about the rule of law, if we care about decency, \nfundamental fairness, if we respect law, if we love the law, we should \nnot allow a situation to continue where the defendant companies are \nwilling to pay, and the plaintiffs, some of them desperately need \npayment, but the plaintiff only ends up getting 40 percent of what is \npaid out. The defendant companies have to hire lawyers, too, whole law \nfirms. They file papers and disclosures and depositions and expert \nwitnesses. This is just chewing up money, money, money, money.\n  Now, if somebody has mesothelioma, a cancer that causes death, they \nought to be paid. They do not need 60 percent of what they are entitled \nto, to go to some lawyer, some defense lawyer or some expert witness or \ncourt cost. And they ought not to die before they get it.\n  Under this bill, if you file a claim and you have mesothelioma--which \nis tied directly to asbestos--it is caused very few times other than by \nasbestos, and you can demonstrate exposure to asbestos and \nmesothelioma, you get $1 million. That is what the latest figure is. \nAnd you do not need a lawyer at all. You get it now. Under the current \nsystem, they file lawsuits, months go by before anything results. The \nplaintiff wants $25 million. The defendant wants to pay $500,000.\n  They go along and along, and all the time the families are suffering, \nthe plaintiffs are suffering, and maybe even dying. That is not good. \nThen, when it is paid, finally, some of the companies do not have the \nmoney. Some insurance companies say they are not liable for this part \nof the claim, and it goes on and on and on.\n  I deeply believe we need to end this spasm. This is not good. It is \nnot something any lawyer can be proud of. In fact, I think everybody is \nembarrassed by it.\n  Let me read from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court, a \nformer member of the ACLU--one of the more liberal Justices. This is \nwhat she wrote in 1997:\n\n       The argument is sensibly made that a nationwide \n     administrative claims processing regime would provide the \n     most secure, fair and efficient means of compensating victims \n     of asbestos exposure. Congress, however, has not adopted such \n     a solution.\n\n  In 1997 she wrote that; and we have been battling this ever since. \nEvery effort has been made.\n  Now we have proposed a $100 billion fund--not millions--$100 billion, \nset aside for payment of these claims. That is apparently not \nsatisfying everyone. In Ortiz v. Fiberboard Company, in 1999, Justice \nSouter--another one of the liberal members of the Supreme Court--said:\n\n       The elephantine mass of asbestos cases defies customary \n     judicial administration and calls for national legislation. \n     To date, Congress has not responded.\n\n  We have people here who are filibustering this bill from even coming \nup, saying they are being rushed. This bill and this idea and this \nconcept of creating a nationwide claims processing regime, as Justice \nGinsburg called it, is overdue by decades. It is wrong what we are \ndoing. It is being blocked, I can only conclude, by a partisan special \ninterest effort. The only people who have an interest in continuing \nthis despicable regime are a few lawyers who are getting absolutely \nrich from it--$54 billion, and you have a 40-percent contingency fee.\n  Senator Hatch said, when this thing is over, lawyers would make $100 \nbillion. And don't think it is a lot of them. It is not a lot of them. \nIt is not the basic plaintiff bar. These lawyers have 10,000, 20,000, \n30,000 cases they are handling. It is not right. It is wrong. The \npeople who are blocking this need to be ashamed of themselves.\n  The Supreme Court Justices have called for reform. It is threatening \nour economy. They develop schemes now where companies that had even the \nmost tangential connection to asbestos are getting sued. If you can \njust ever tap them. If a company bought a company that dealt in \nasbestos, and that company had ceased dealing with asbestos for 10 \nyears, they can be bankrupted because they have become liable for the \ncompany they bought, their actions 10, 15 years before they bought it. \nDo you think that is not possible? It is possible. It is happening \nright now.\n  These companies and the insurance companies and the reinsurance \ncompanies have come together and put up $100 billion--$100 billion. All \nwe need to do is set up an administrative claims processing system \nwhere persons who are sick, who have any disability, really any health \ndefect can file a claim. Those who are not ready, those who do not have \na claim, who fear they might be sick at some time in the future, can \nfile their notice and will be given a constant monitoring of their \nhealth. If they do get sick, they can be compensated fully.\n  So we would be getting money to the people who are sick. We would be \nreducing the need for these huge, outrageous legal fees from the \nplaintiffs' lawyers. We would be eliminating all the lawyers' fees paid \nby the asbestos companies.\n  There are companies that bought asbestos companies, and people who \nsold brake shoes, and anybody who had anything to do with asbestos, who \nare being sued. Now there are 8,400 companies being sued. Most of them \nnever produced asbestos, never knew anything about asbestos, never \ndealt with asbestos. So these people are willing to put up $100 \nbillion.\n  We simply ought to be able to establish a system by which sick people \ncan be paid, and paid promptly, without these costs. If we do not, who \nis going to lose most? The plaintiffs are going to lose. These \ncompanies are going into bankruptcy. It is hurting this economy. It \nwill continue to hurt America's economy.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I appreciate the opportunity to share \nthese remarks. I think it is important. I hope the Senate will move \nforward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the majority leader \nis on his way.\n  I will withhold and ask the distinguished majority leader to do the \nclose and then allow me to finish my speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the consideration. I will move \nthrough, fairly quickly, some business that finishes up on today and \nexplains what we will be doing tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4218-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nhonor an outstanding collaboration taking place between organizations \nof the Yankton Sioux Tribe and the neighboring town of Wagner--the \nNative Family Wellness Conference. This 3-day initiative is the result \nof the tireless work and cooperation among the Boys and Girls Club of \nthe Yankton Sioux, Brave Heart Society, Canku Teca Treatment Center, \nand the Indian Health Service's Wagner Service Unit. In particular, I \nwant to commend Faith Spotted Eagle, Jenny Noteboom, and Amy Schwenk-\nDoom for their leadership in this effort.\n  As we know all too well, the lack of quality health care in Indian \nCountry is having a devastating impact on the health of far too many \nNative Americans. The availability of only ``life or limb'' treatment \nin our IHS hospitals has heightened the importance of health and \nwellness education in Native American communities, and I applaud the \ninitiative demonstrated by this collaborative in developing the Native \nFamily Wellness Conference.\n  The great leader Sitting Bull once said: ``Come, let us put our minds \ntogether and see what kind of life we can make for our children.'' The \nNative Family Wellness Conference embodies Sitting Bull's hope for the \nfuture by teaching children, both Native and non-Native, about the \nimportance of health and wellness in both their cultural heritage and \npersonal future.\n  Children and families will have the opportunity to learn about the \neffects of diet, drug abuse, and exercise on personal and family \nwellness during a series of breakout sessions on April 29 and 30. Those \nwho participate in the sessions will be invited to join a fun run/walk \nwith the Lakota Olympian Billy Mills and a concert by the band Brule of \nLower Brule.\n  Billy Mills and his organization, Running Strong for American Indian \nYouth, have dedicated almost 20 years to providing Native Americans \nwith the tools needed for survival and to build self-esteem and self-\nsufficiency. Billy Mills' participation in this conference demonstrates \nthe importance of this collaboration, and I also want to thank him for \nhis dedication and commitment to the health and well-being of Native \nAmericans.\n  In recent months, countless organizations from the Yankton Sioux \nTribe and Wagner have joined in support of the Native Family Wellness \nConference. The Bureau of Indian Affairs police department, Fort \nRandall Casino and Hotel, Indian Health Services Diabetes Project, \nNative American Community Board, Lewis and Clark Mental Health \nServices, Marty Indian School, Wagner School District, Wellmark \nFoundation, the Yankton Sioux Tribe's Business and Claims Committee, \nTribal Health Program, Healthy Start Program, Housing Authority, Tribal \nCourts, and Tribal Youth Program have also contributed their time and \ntalents to the conference. These organizations and their members are to \nbe commended for their involvement in this important event.\n  Our children are our greatest resource, and the Native Family \nWellness Conference is a great investment in the health of our future \ngenerations. That is why I am proud to honor this outstanding effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4219-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Benjamin Carman\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to LCpl \nBenjamin Robert Carman who bravely gave his life for our country in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. I offer my deepest sympathy to his parents, \nMarie and Nelson, as well as his siblings; James, Catherine, and \nAmelia. LCpl Carman was killed in action by small arms fire during \ncombat operations in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq on Tuesday, April 6, \n2004.\n  LCpl Carman is the eleventh Iowan to be killed in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. I appreciate his faithful service to our country and the \npatriotic mission that he died supporting. The attitude that Ben had \ntoward his military service was summarized by his pastor at his \nfuneral; ``Ben died because he loved freedom. He died because he loved \njustice.'' LCpl Carman was not afraid to courageously serve his country \nand accomplish his duty. As an Iowan, I am proud of this exemplary \nyoung man who will be missed by many.\n  Ben Carman graduated from Jefferson-Scranton High School in 2002 \nwhere he excelled in the industrial arts, winning first in the State on \nseveral occasions in the sheet metal category of an industrial skills \ncontest. He also participated in football and golf and was well loved \nby his classmates. Ben also loved the outdoors and his hobbies included \nfishing, hunting and camping. He was a proud Marine who proved himself \nto be a true hero and patriot. LCpl Ben Carman lived out the Marine \nmotto, Semper Fidelis, always faithful, and is a credit to his State \nand to his country. I again express my sympathy for Ben's family and my \ngratitude for his courageous service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4219-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VETERANS SHOULD RECEIVE TIMELY ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I recognize the dedication of \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America, PVA, and their support of spinal \ncord injury research. Through their Spinal Cord Research Foundation, \nPVA support has aided researchers in making huge advances in this \ncrucial field.\n  Last Friday, in conjunction with PVA Awareness Week 2004, three \nspinal cord injury researchers detailed the contributions PVA has made \ntoward improving treatment for and, hopefully, eventually ending \nparalysis. Stephen G. Waxman, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chairman of \nneurology at Yale University, discussed ``Protecting and Repairing the \nSpinal Cord: Gifts from the Molecular Revolution.'' Among other topics, \nDr. Waxman discussed how his lab had created chronic neuropathic pain \nin a rat, which the lab was then able to successfully ``turn off'' and \n``turn on'' through chemical manipulations.\n  Mindy L. Aisen, M.D., the deputy chief research and development \nofficer and rehabilitation research and development service director \nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, addressed ``Spinal Cord \nInjury Reasearch: The VA Perspective.'' She spoke about the large scope \nof VA research, which extends well beyond spinal cord dysfunction. She \nspecifically discussed the diaphragmatic pacer used by Christorpher \nReeve, which was invented at the Cleveland VA Medical Center, and she \nnoted the wound healing studies conducted by VA.\n  Alessandro Ghidini, M.D., a specialist in high-risk pregnancies and \ndirector of perinatal research for the department of obstetrics and \ngynecology at Georgetown University Medical Center, spoke about \n``Obstetrical Outcomes of Women with Spinal Cord Injury.'' Dr. Ghidini \nis just beginning a PVA research foundation grant to document the \nobstetrical experiences of 60 women with spinal cord injuries, and she \ntalked about the main concerns that arise when these two major \nconditions interact; complications from both can create a number of \nmedical emergencies that healthcare professionals and women with spinal \ncord injuries must know about in order to carefully and successfully \nmanage them.\n  These medical professionals demonstrated the great strides the PVA \nSpinal Cord Research Foundation has helped to make in alleviating the \nhardships of paralysis, and they provided a glimpse into the promising \nfuture of spinal cord injury research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4219-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4219-S4220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n   Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, this week, from April 18th to 24th, we \nare celebrating the 46th anniversary of National Library Week. As a \nstrong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and \nprotect libraries, I am pleased to have this opportunity to take a few \nmoments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our nation.\n  When the free public library came into its own in this country in the \n19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because \nof its commitment to the free and open exchange of ideas embodied in \nthe Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an integral part of \nall that our country stands for: freedom of information, an educated \ncitizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are the only \npublic agencies in which the services rendered are intended for, and \navailable to, every segment of our society.\n  It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable \nrole in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th \ncentury, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and \nwide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further \nsupplemented by traveling libraries or on-line libraries serving \noutlying districts. Libraries promote the reading of books among \nadults, adolescents, and children and provide the access and resources \nto allow citizens to obtain reliable information on a vast array of \ntopics.\n  Libraries have gained even further significance in this age of rapid \ntechnological advancement because they are called upon to provide not \nonly books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. \nIn today's society, libraries provide computer services, Internet \naccess, audio-visual materials, facilities for community lectures and \nperformances, DVDs, CD-Roms, tapes, and works of art for exhibit and \nloan to the public. In addition, special facilities libraries provide \nservices for older Americans, people with disabilities, and \nhospitalized citizens.\n  Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of \nmaterials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is \noften struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have \nnot had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the \ngreatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library \ncommunity and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities \ncontinue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library \nsystem.\n  My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a \nfull range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long \ntradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy \nhas been enhanced by the State Library Network, which provides \ninterlibrary loans to the State public, academic, special libraries, \nand school library media centers. The Network receives strong support \nfrom the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, \nthe Regional Library Resource Centers in our Western, Southern, and \nEastern Shore counties, and a Statewide database of periodicals from \nover 100 libraries.\n  The State Library Resource Center alone gives Marylanders free access \nto approximately 2 million books, over 1 million U.S. Government \ndocuments, 600,000 magazines, newspapers and books in microform, 11,000 \nperiodicals, 90,000 maps, 20,000 Maryland State documents, and 19,000 \nvideos and films.\n  The result of this unique joint State-County resource sharing is an \nextraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of \nMaryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service with \nalmost 58 percent of the State's population registered as library \npatrons. Additionally, the total holdings of catalogued and \nuncatalogued book volumes, video and audio recordings, periodicals, \nelectronic formats, and serial volumes have increased by 1.2 million \nfrom 1998 to 2002 to total almost 16.8 million library holdings.\n  I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland \nLibrary Association and others involved in the library community \nthroughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and \ncitizens throughout the Nation in this week's celebration of ``National \nLibrary Week.'' I look forward to a continued close association with \nthose who enable libraries to make their unique and vital services \navailable to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4220-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4220-S4221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHINESE COMPETITION\n\n   Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, one thing I have \nlearned in the last couple of years is that everywhere I go the \nmanufacturing community at home keeps bringing up on topic, Chinese \ncompetition. Due in large part to China's unfair trade practices; South \nCarolina alone lost 41,000 jobs in 2003. Most of these jobs were \ntextile and related industries. In the last five and a half years, \nthree million American manufacturing jobs have been lost. Since 1997, \nthe U.S. textile industry has closed more than 250 textile plants in \nthe country and more than 200,000 U.S. textile workers have lost their \njobs.\n   Why is this happening? Why are American manufacturers not able to \nkeep up with the Chinese? It is not because our workforce is \nintellectually inferior, and I don't believe our workforce is lazy. And \nit certainly isn't because we haven't invested in the most modern \nequipment.\n   It is because China cheats. China's accession agreement to enter the \nWTO consisted of numerous commitments by China to transition to a \nmarket and rules based economy. China has yet to live up to their \ncommitments. The theory of free trade is a great theory, but it only \nworks if other people buy into that theory. It is hard to have free \ntrade if you do not even believe in free speech. Through its unfair \ntrade practices, China continues to steal market share, and the U.S. \nmanufacturing industry is at serious disadvantage.\n   China's currency, the yuan or renminbi, has been tightly pegged at \n8.28 yuan to the U.S. dollar since 1994, which most economists believe \nto be a severe undervaluation of their currency. Most economists \nestimate China's currency to be undervalued by as much as 15 to 40 \npercent. This undervaluation makes China's exports less expensive for \nforeigners, while making foreign products more expensive for Chinese \nconsumers, resulting in an effective subsidization of Chinese exports \nand poses a virtual tariff on Chinese imports.\n   Consequently, since 1994, China's economy has grown dramatically, \naveraging over 8 percent per year. The U.S. trade deficit with China in \n2003 reached a record $125 billion. In 1994, when China first began to \npeg its currency to the dollar, the United States trade deficit with \nChina was $29.4 billion.\n   China has been in clear violation of International Monetary Fund, \nIMF, and world Trade Organization, WTO, commitments by maintaining an \nunfairly low exchange rate to gain a competitive advantage. IMF Article \nIV states that members should ``avoid manipulating exchange rates . . . \nin order . . . to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other \nmembers.'' The U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, a \nbipartisan commission created by Congress, found in its September 25, \n2003 hearing, that: ``China, in violation of both its IMF and WTO \nobligations, is in fact manipulating its currency for trade advantage'' \nand recommends that the Treasury Department ``immediately enter into \nformal negotiations with the Chinese government'' over its undervalued \ncurrency. The Commission further ``urges the Congressional leadership \nto use its legislative powers to force action by the U.S. and Chinese \nGovernments to address this unfair and mercantilist trade practice.''\n   At this hearing, Fred Bergsten, Ph.D., Director of International \nInstitute of Economics, testified that a revaluation of 20 to 25 \npercent of the yuan should permit other Asian currencies, including \nJapan, Taiwan, North Korea, to go up at least partway, maybe 10 percent \nor so, because with the yuan appreciating, they would be willing to \nappreciate against the dollar since it would actually create a \ndepreciation of their own currencies against the Chinese currency, \ntheir main competitor. If you put all those currency\n\n[[Page S4221]]\n\nchanges together the result would be a $50 billion reduction in the \nU.S. current account deficit, which in turn translates to about 500,000 \nhigh-paying jobs, mainly in manufacturing in this country.\n   Senator Charles Schumer and I have introduced legislation that would \nrequire China to abide by its international trade agreements and stop \nmanipulating their currency. The goal of this legislation is to remove \nChina's unfair currency advantage and the detrimental impact that it is \nhaving in the U.S. and abroad.\n   Our legislation would require the Secretary of the Treasury to \nimmediately enter into formal negotiations with China to ensure that \nChina initiates a process to adopt a market-based system of currency \nwithin 180 days of enactment of this Act. If China refuses to do so, a \n27.5 percent tariff will be imposed on all China's exports to the \nUnited States in order to reduce the export advantage provided by \nChina's unfairly and illegally valued currency. The President of the \nUnited States has the authority to remove the tariff once he certifies \nto Congress that China has moved to a market-based system of currency \nvaluation.\n   This legislation works within the framework of international trade \nlaws. Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade allows \na member of the World Trade Organization to take ``any action which is \nconsiders necessary for the protection of its essential security \ninterests,'' particularly ``in a time of war or other emergency in \ninternational relations.'' The President has stated a view that many of \nus hold, that our nation's manufacturing capability is a vital national \ninterest. I know I am not alone when I say that this national interest \nis threatened by China's unfair currency practices.\n   Something must be done to alleviate the detrimental economic impact \nChina is having on our manufacturing industry or at the very least, to \nlevel the playing field for future generations. I urge the Leadership \nto allow a vote on this important legislation. I believe it will \nreceive overwhelming bipartisan support and give the Administration one \nmore tool to get the Chinese to uphold their WTO obligations.\n   As long as we sit by and allow China to maintain its unfair trade \nadvantage, the United States will continue to hemorrhage jobs. Passing \nthis legislation is one step further to ensuring that China abides by \nthe rules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4221-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HONORING ALYSON MIKE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to \nhonor Montana's 2004 Teacher of the Year Award winner, Alyson Mike. \nAlyson overcame a lengthy list of quality teachers in Montana to secure \nthis award. It is an honor to recognize her outstanding contribution to \nMontana.\n  Alyson represents the type of teacher Montana has come to expect from \nits teaching community. She is an educator who meets the highest \nstandards of professional excellence. Alyson is a student's teacher. \nShe delivers to each and every one of her students without expectation \nof reward.\n  Alyson teaches middle school science at East Valley Middle School in \nHelena, MT, my home town. Sadly, like so many other rural communities, \nHelena has struggled economically in recent years. In this community, \nbake sales, garage sales, and silent auctions have become the norm, \nsimply to raise funds for the school. But this has not stopped Alyson \nand members of the community from making sure the students receive what \nthey need to succeed.\n  Like so many Montana teachers, Alyson takes a hands-on approach to \nensure her students have access to a variety of materials and \nequipment. In Alyson's mind, there are no limits to what her students \ncan accomplish.\n  Alyson earned her National Board Certification and has become a State \nleader in Montana's professional development. She is a leader to her \nstudents and encourages other teachers to make a difference in \nstudent's lives. Alyson's extensive background and knowledge in \nscience, proven teaching strategies, and great sense of humor make her \na Montana treasure.\n  We in Montana are very fortunate to be able to claim a teacher like \nAlyson Mike as our very own. She is a fabulous representative of the \nvery best of public education in Montana and across our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4221-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING STUDENTS REPRESENTING RHODE ISLAND IN THE ``WE THE PEOPLE: THE \n               CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION'' COMPETITION\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Mr. President, today I pay my respects to Ernie \nHartung, the 12th president of the University of Idaho, who passed away \nlast fall.\n  I felt a special kinship to President Hartung for two reasons. The \nfirst was that we both came to the university as freshmen in 1965. He \nas a freshman president and I as a freshman student. As he often said, \nhe considered himself to be a member of the class of 1969 because of \nthat freshman connection.\n  The second reason for our special kinship was that I served as \nstudent body president in 1968-69 and had a close working relationship \nwith President Hartung. He was a tireless advocate for student \ninvolvement, and the students responded by becoming strong, vocal \nsupporters of President Hartung.\n  It is unlikely that any University of Idaho president ever generated \nthe degree of grassroots student support that Ernie Hartung did. The \nbest indication of this came on March 17, 1969. The university was \nfacing a number of serious issues, and President Hartung had been \npublicly criticized by the Governor. In response, 4,500 students showed \nup at a campus rally on a cold, rainy night to voice their support for \ntheir university president. It was a remarkable showing of support for \nan extraordinary leader.\n  Ernie Hartung had a significant impact on the lives of thousands of \nIdahoans. On April 24th, 2004, the University of Idaho will be honoring \nthis leader and his contributions. I appreciate my colleagues joining \nme today while I acknowledge all that President Hartung did, not only \nfor me but for thousands of other University of Idaho alumni and \nIdahoans. While we miss him sorely, it is comforting to know that Idaho \nis a better place because of Ernie Hartung.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4221-4", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4221-S4222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL PRIMARY IMMUNE DEFICIENCY DISEASES AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing the week of April 19 as National Primary Immune \nDeficiency Diseases Awareness Week. Primary immune deficiency diseases, \nPIDD, are genetic disorders in which part of the body's immune system \nis missing or does not function properly.\n  The World Health Organization recognizes more than 150 primary immune \ndiseases, which affect as many as 50,000 people in the United States.\n\n[[Page S4222]]\n\n  Fortunately, 70 percent of PIDD patients are able to maintain their \nhealth through regular infusions of a plasma product known as \nintravenous immunoglobulin, IGIV. IGIV helps bolster the immune system \nand provides critical protection against infection and disease.\n  I want to share with my colleagues the story of one family in \nWashington State affected by PIDD, the Trump family, who have common \nvariable immune deficiency, CVID, one of the more common forms of \nprimary immune deficiency diseases. Gary Trump's first wife, Tracee, \ncarried CVID for at least 18 years prior to diagnosis. During that \ntime, she suffered repetitive infections, even life-threatening \ndisease, but was never properly diagnosed. In 1993, 8 days after the \nbirth of their second son, Christian, Tracee was struck down by viral \nencephalitis, and suffered through 4 years of pain, amnesia, and total \ndisability prior to passing away in 1997. Their first son, Darren, also \nhad numerous infections, almost from birth. Within a year of Tracee's \ndiagnosis, Darren was tested and found to have CVID. Christian, who \nnearly died of viral pneumonia at 2 months of age, was also diagnosed \nwith CVID.\n  The Trump family is not unique with the difficulty and delay in \ndiagnosis of primary immune deficiency disease. Despite the recent \nprogress in PIDD research, the average length of time between the onset \nof symptoms in a patient and a definitive diagnosis of PIDD is 9.2 \nyears. In the interim, those afflicted may suffer repeated and serious \ninfections and possibly irreversible damage to internal organs. That is \nwhy it is critical that we raise awareness about these illnesses within \nthe general public and the health care community.\n  I am proud to have the opportunity to recognize the week of April 19 \nas National Primary Immune Deficiency Diseases Awareness Week. I \nencourage my colleagues to work with us to help improve the quality of \nlife for PIDD patients and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4222-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO SISTER MARY EILEEN WILLHELM, RSM\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to give tribute to \nSister Mary Eileen Wilhelm, RSM, who has served as the chief executive \nofficer at Mercy Medical for more than 36 years. She has led Mercy \nMedical in its mission to care for the sick, the injured, and the dying \nsince she took on the role of CEO in 1967. Her passion for healthcare \nhas led her to continually do what is best for the patients, the \nresidents, and their families.\n  Since its founding in 1949 by the Sisters of Mercy, Mercy Medical has \nbeen a leader among healthcare providers in Alabama's Mobile Bay area. \nAs CEO of Mercy, Sister Mary Eileen has remained focused on continuing \nthe healing ministry of Jesus in the compassionate and excellent \ntradition of the Sisters of Mercy. This has helped Mercy grow from a \nsmall convalescent home by the bay in Daphne, into an integrated \nnetwork of healthcare options throughout southwest Alabama and \nrecognized throughout the Nation for its innovative procedures.\n  Mercy Medical works with patients of all ages, from the very young to \nthe most senior, to maximize their functional abilities and return all \npatients to their highest possible level of wellness. In addition, \nMercy Medical is renowned for its hospice services, providing quality \nliving when individuals face the end of this Earthly existence. Working \nwith physicians, interdisciplinary medical teams establish \nindividualized treatment plans which direct overall courses of \nintensive therapy, specialized clinical services and/or other patient \ncare and activities. Most importantly, the Mercy Medical team always \nministers to not only the physical needs but offers comfort and healing \nto the spirit as well.\n  Catherine McAuley, the foundress of the Sisters of Mercy, has \ninspired Sister Eileen to be strong in the face of adversity, calm in \nthe midst of crisis, and willing to take risks. This has allowed her to \nlead the Mercy Medical staff to identify and meet the healthcare needs \nof the weak and vulnerable. Additionally, due to her humility, \ntenacity, and commitment, Mercy Medical is recognized as a leader in \nthe healthcare community. One of the core values of Mercy Medical is \nthe empowerment of women, and Sister Mary Eileen, as an empowered \nwoman, has led the fight to eradicate poverty nationally by taking on \nthe cause of the poor to our Nation's capital. Indeed, her sincerity \nand power of persuasion, which I have directly felt, is remarkable. It \nis clearly a product of her selfless commitment to her vision for \nothers.\n  On behalf of the United States Senate and the people of Alabama, I \nwould like to recognize Sister Mary Eileen for giving more than 44 \nyears of love and devotion to the sick, injured, and dying. She has \nbeen truly a blessing for the people of south Alabama, and her legacy \nwill live on forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4222-2", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE 440TH BIRTHDAY OF WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE -- RECOGNIZING THE \n                  SHAKESPEARE FESTIVALS IN CALIFORNIA\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \none of the greatest writers the world has ever known: William \nShakespeare. As you may well know, this week marks the 440th birthday \nof the great author and playwright. As a foremost literary talent of \nhis and every age thereafter, his works have stood the test of time and \nare still widely celebrated over four centuries later.\n  Scholars credit William Shakespeare with authoring 37 plays and 154 \nsonnets over the course of his life. These works continue to both move \nand entertain today, as they did the people of his time. His plays can \nbe found performed daily the world round in their traditional fashion, \nand many of his works have been adapted to accommodate modern issues \nand themes. As a result, his genius and creative achievement have \ntranscended time and touched people of all generations.\n  I am proud that my State of California shares a large population who \ntake the time to celebrate the life and work of Shakespeare. California \nis home to some of the largest organizations dedicated to nourishing \ntheir communities through both artistic endeavors and educational \nprograms celebrating the Bard's work. Combined, California Shakespeare \nfestivals perform for more than 95,000 Californians annually.\n  It is my pleasure to congratulate the California Shakespeare Festival \non celebrating their 30th anniversary this year. Beginning with a few \nBerkeley residents performing ``Hamlet'' to local community members, \nthe California Shakespeare Festival has developed into a successful \nproduction company that runs four Shakespearian theaters. Through their \nArtistic Learning Initiative, the festival seeks to inspire and educate \nyoung artists of all backgrounds through the gift of Shakespeare's \nworks.\n  Since 1983, when I was mayor of San Francisco, the San Francisco \nShakespeare Festival has brought the works of Shakespeare to large and \ndiverse audiences through their Free Shakespeare in the Park program. \nIn cooperation with the Oakland-East Bay and Silicon Valley Shakespeare \nFestivals, the San Francisco Shakespeare Festival brings innovative and \ninspiring professional performances to over 50,000 each summer.\n  I also recognize the contributions of the American Friends of the \nShakespeare Birthplace Trust to bringing the legacy of William \nShakespeare to Washington, DC, with their gift of eight sculptures to \nthe Folger Shakespeare Library. Sculpted by artist Greg Wyatt, the \neight pieces are half-size replicas of the Shakespearian-inspired \nartwork in the Great Garden in Stratford-upon-Avon.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating Shakespeare's \nbirthday and the inspirational and lasting works he contributed to our \nworld. William Shakespeare's poems and plays continue to inspire \ncountless generations of young writers, further the world's love of the \nwritten word as well as performances, and reminds us all to ``be not \nafraid of greatness.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4222-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4222-S4223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:52 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n\n[[Page S4223]]\n\n\n       H.R. 1822.

A bill to modify the optional method of computing net \nearnings from self-employment; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to address an injustice in \nthe Tax Code that is threatening family farmers and other self-employed \nindividuals. A number of my constituents, primarily Wisconsin farmers, \nhave requested Congress's assistance to correct the Tax Code so they \ncan protect their families. The legislation I introduce today, the \nFarmer Tax Fairness Act of 2004, will solve the problem for today and \ninto the future.\n  Farming is vital to Wisconsin. Wisconsin's agricultural industry \nplays a large and important role in the growth and prosperity of the \nentire State. Wisconsin's status as ``America's Dairyland,'' is central \nto our State's agriculture industry. Wisconsin's dairy farmers produce \napproximately 23 billion pounds of milk and 25 percent of the country's \nbutter a year. But Wisconsin's farmers produce much more than milk; \nthey also are national leaders in the production of cheese, potatoes, \nginseng, cranberries, various processing vegetables, and many organic \nfoods. So when the hard-working farmers of Wisconsin need help, I will \ndo all I can to assist.\n  One concern of Wisconsin farmers is that the Tax Code can limit their \neligibility for social safety net programs, including old age, \nsurvivors, and disability insurance, OASDI, under Social Security and \nthe hospital insurance HI part of Medicare. There programs are paid for \nthrough payroll taxes on workers and through the self-employment tax on \nthe income of self-employed individuals. To be eligible for OSADI and \nHI benefits an individual must be fully insured and must have earned a \nminimum amount of income in the years immediately preceding the need \nfor coverage. Every year, the Social Security Administration, SSA, sets \nthe amount of earned income that individuals must pay taxes on to earn \nquarters of coverage, QCs, and maintain their benefits. An individual's \neligibility requirements depend upon the age at which death or \ndisability occurs, but for workers over 31 years of age, they must have \nearned at least 20 QCs within the past 10 years.\n  Self-employed individuals can have highly variable income, and, \nparticularly for farmers at the whim of Mother Nature, not every year \nis a good year. During lean years, individuals\n\n[[Page S4227]]\n\nmay not earn enough income to maintain adequate coverage under OASDI \nand HI. Therefore, the Tax Code provides options to allow self-employed \nindividuals to maintain eligibility for benefits. These options allow \nindividuals to choose to pay taxes based on $1,600 of earned income, \nthus allowing self-employed entrepreneurs to maintain the same Federal \nprotections even when their income varies.\n  Unfortunately, both the options for farmers and nonfarmers--Social \nSecurity Act Sec. 211(a) and I.R.C. Sec. 1402(a)--have not kept pace \nwith inflation, and they no longer provide security to families across \nthe country. Decades ago, self-employment income of $1,600 earned an \nindividual four QCs under SSA's calculations. In 2001, the amount \nneeded to earn a QC rose to $830 of earned income, so individuals \nelecting the optional methods were only able to earn one QC, making it \nmuch harder for them to remain eligible for benefits.\n  Congress's failure to address this problem threatens the ability of \nself-employed individuals to maintain eligibility for OASDI and HI. I \nhave heard from several of my constituent who want these options to be \nfixed so they can make sure their families will be taken care of in the \nevent that something unforeseen occurs.\n  Therefore, I am introducing the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2004 in \norder to provide farmers and self-employed individuals with a fair \nchoice. Under this bill, they will continue to be able to elect the \noptional method if they so choose. When individuals do elect the \noption, this legislation provides an update to the Tax Code so farmers \nand self-employed individuals can retain full eligibility for OASDI and \nHI benefits. It indexes the optional income levels to SSA's QC \ncalculations, allowing these farmers and self-employed individuals to \nclaim enough earned income to qualify for four OCs annually. By linking \nthe earned income level to SSA's requirements for QCs, the bill will \nensure that the amount of income deemed to be earned under the optional \nmethods will not need to be adjusted by Congress again.\n  In addition to providing security to self-employed individuals and \nfarmers across the country, this solution is fiscally responsible. It \nactually provides a short run increase in U.S. Treasury revenues while \nhaving negligible impact upon the Social Security trust fund in the \nlong run.\n  Let me take a moment to acknowledge the efforts of the Senator from \nIowa, Mr. Grassley, to address this problem in the 107th Congress. As \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, he included similar \nlegislative language in the chairman's mark for the Small Business and \nFarm Economic Recovery Act of 2002. The Senate Finance Committee held a \nmarkup on the legislation on September 19, 2002, but the changes to the \noptional methods did not become law.\n  When incomes fall, the Tax Code provides optional methods for \ncalculating net earnings to ensure that farmers and self-employed \nindividuals maintain eligibility for social safety net programs. Due to \ninflation, the Tax Code has not kept up and many farmers are losing \neligibility for some of Social Security's programs. Congress needs to \nprovide security to farm families and other self-employed individuals. \nI urge my colleagues to support the Farmer Tax Fairness Act of 2004.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Snowe)\n  S. 2327. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify \nthat per diem payments by the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \ncare of veterans in State homes shall not be used to offset or reduce \nother payments made to assist veterans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PER \n                   DIEM PAYMENTS TO STATE HOMES FOR VETERANS.\n\n       Section 1741 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Payments to States pursuant to this section shall not \n     be considered a liability of a third party, or otherwise be \n     utilized to offset or reduce any other payment made to assist \n     veterans.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Pryor, and Mr. Feingold.\n  S. 2328. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to the importation of prescription drugs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing bipartisan \nlegislation to allow prescription drug importation from Canada, the \nEuropean Union, and a few other countries. I am very pleased to be \njoined on this bill by Senators Snowe, Kennedy, McCain, Daschle, Lott, \nStabenow, Chafee, Johnson, Pryor, and Feingold.\n  This new bill, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act, \nis an important breakthrough for several reasons. First, it is a \nbipartisan effort, and as we all know, bipartisanship is the best way \nto get things done in Congress today or any day. Second, this bill \naddresses the safety issues that have been raised by some and makes \ncertification by the Health and Human Services Secretary unnecessary. \nTherefore, it would take effect immediately and provide consumers with \nthe urgent help they need accessing more affordable medicines.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will take up and pass this legislation \non an expedited basis because American consumers, especially senior \ncitizens, State and local governments, and businesses large and small \nare desperate for action by Congress to give them relief from high drug \nprices. It has been well documented that Americans are charged the \nhighest prices in the world for the exact same medicines that consumers \nin other major industrialized countries buy at a fraction of the price.\n  For example, Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering medicine that is the \ntop-selling drug in the United States, is made in the same plant and \nput in the same bottle. One bottle is shipped to American pharmacies, \nand the other to Canadian Pharmacies. Both are approved by the Food and \nDrug Administration. The only difference? The price. One tablet \npurchased by a pharmacist in Canada costs $1.01; the same tablet \npurchased by an American pharmacist costs $1.86, 84 percent more than \nin Canada.\n  The high prices charged for prescription drugs in the United States \nare forcing Americans and state and local governments to turn to Canada \nto buy their medicines. Dozens of State and local governments--from \nMaine to Massachusetts to North Dakota--are now implementing drug \nimportation programs with Canada to save their citizens and their \nhealth care programs millions of dollars. Individual Americans are now \nimporting more than $1.1 billion in prescription drugs from Canada.\n  Unfortunately, they are doing so illegally, according to the FDA. The \npharmaceutical industry is the only industry that benefits from a \nCongressional ban on re-imported products. The time has come to \neliminate that barrier so American consumers, too, can benefit from the \nglobal marketplace.\n  Big, multi-national drug companies already reap the benefits of the \nworld market. In fact, more than $40 billion of the prescription drugs \nconsumed by Americans in 2002 were made in other countries, such as \nIreland, Singapore, and Japan so that the drug companies could take \nadvantage of tax breaks, cheaper labor and other incentives available \nabroad.\n  What's good for the goose should be good for the gander--American \nconsumers, pharmacists, and drug wholesalers should be equally free to \npurchase FDA-approved medicines from Canada, Europe and elsewhere. The \nbill I am introducing today would allow just that.\n  This new bill is similar in many respects to the Pharmaceutical \nMarket Access Act, sometimes called the ``Gutknecht bill'', which was \npassed by the House of Representatives by a wide bipartisan margin last \nJuly. For instance: Both bills allow prescription drugs to be imported \nfrom Canada, the\n\n[[Page S4228]]\n\nEuropean Union, and some other major industrialized nations. Both bills \nrequire pharmacies and wholesalers to register with the FDA to be able \nto import prescription drugs. Both bills provide for the importation of \nFDA-approved medicines. Both bills allow for reliance on anti-\ncounterfeiting technology to ensure drug safety. Both bills allow for \ndrug importation to begin immediately, without first requiring \ncertification by the HHS Secretary.\n  However, my cosponsor and I also believe that our bill makes a number \nof improvements over the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act both in terms \nof safety and closing loopholes to ensure that a drug importation \nprogram will not be thwarted by the big drug manufacturers. For \nexample, this bill ensures that individual Americans who import their \nprescription drugs via the Internet or mail-order are doing so from \nsafe, reliable Canadian pharmacies. This bill gives the FDA the ability \nto inspect Canadian exporters to assure safety. This bill enhances the \nFDA's ability to stop those drug imports that are unsafe. This bill \nwould give the FDA the resources needed to ensure the safety of \nimported medicines.\n  In addition, this bill contains several provisions to close loopholes \nthat would allow drug companies to circumvent drug importation. \nUnfortunately, a number of big drug companies are cutting off medicines \nto Canadian pharmacies that sell to Americans. This bill would make \nsuch tactics an unfair trade practice.\n  We will now work with the Senate leadership to get this bill enacted \nin the Senate promptly. The Senate has voted on drug importation \nlegislation three times since 2000. There is no need for a protracted \ndebate. In invite my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill \nand in acting soon to give our constituents relief from high drug \nprices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act\n\n\n                          I. importable drugs\n\n       Drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration \n     and manufactured in an FDA-inspected plant.\n       Drugs must be patient-administered and not a controlled \n     substance, an infused or injected drug, a biologic, or a drug \n     inhaled during surgery.\n\n\n     ii. commercial importation by pharmacists and drug wholesalers\n\n       Allows importation by licensed pharmacists and wholesalers \n     from Canada within 90 days of enactment and from the current \n     European Union members, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and \n     Switzerland beginning one year from enactment.\n       Requires registration of wholesalers and pharmacies with \n     FDA, and levies capped fees to support the costs of the \n     program. Registration may only be of those entities that are \n     fully licensed in accordance with applicable state and \n     federal law to act as pharmacies or wholesalers of \n     prescription drugs.\n       Importers and all resellers of imported products must \n     provide a full chain-of-custody (pedigree), tracking \n     possession of drugs from the point of manufacture to the sale \n     to the consumer.\n       Drugs must be re-labeled in English to comply with FDA \n     requirements. The FDA will provide approved labeling \n     information to importers.\n       FDA may ban the importation of a product that has been \n     determined to be counterfeit, contaminated, or is otherwise \n     adulterated so as not to meet the requirements of this \n     legislation. FDA may require testing of shipments of product \n     or use of approved anti-counterfeiting technologies to verify \n     the chain-of-custody of a drug.\n       This bill specifically protects pharmacies, wholesalers, \n     and individuals from patient damages arising from the \n     importation of drugs.\n\n\n                iii. personal importation by individuals\n\n       Immediately upon enactment, an individual may import up to \n     a 90 day supply of a prescription drug from Canada for their \n     personal use or for the personal use of a family member, just \n     as they do now. Once the FDA has implemented regulations, \n     individuals may be shipped prescription drugs purchased via \n     mail-order or websites only from a Canadian pharmacy \n     registered under this Act. These Canadian exporters will be \n     fully inspected and approved by the FDA. Canadian pharmacies \n     must validate a U.S. prescription, review health and \n     medication history, and track shipments.\n       The bill also allows individual Americans who travel \n     outside the United States to bring back with them for their \n     personal use a 90-day supply of medicine from Canada, \n     Australia, current countries in the European Union, Japan, \n     New Zealand, or Switzerland or a 14-day supply of medicine \n     from another foreign country.\n       The bill continues the FDA's current ``compassionate use'' \n     policy by allowing importation for patients with special \n     needs.\n\n\n                       iv. ``gaming'' the system\n\n       The bill protects those selling or using drugs imported \n     under the program by preventing an individual from taking \n     actions that would have the effect of thwarting drug \n     importation. Any individual who takes such an action against \n     a pharmacist, wholesaler, or consumer to hinder their \n     importation of prescription drugs will be in violation of the \n     Clayton Act, and treble economic damages may be awarded.\n       The proposal includes features to prevent a drug \n     manufacturer from blocking importation of drugs, such as by \n     changing the color, dosage form, or place of manufacture of \n     the drug so that it is no longer FDA-approved. Drug \n     manufacturers that make these kinds of changes would be \n     required to notify the FDA, and the FDA would be given the \n     authority to take the steps needed to approve the drug.\n\n\n                    v. limiting unsafe drug imports\n\n       Customs could seize and destroy small quantities of drugs \n     imported by individuals from foreign exporters that are \n     unapproved. The FDA would provide the individual whose drugs \n     were seized with a simple notice explaining how the \n     individual can import drugs from registered Canadian \n     exporters safely and legally.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my colleagues \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, Senator Daschle, Senator \nLott, Senator Chafee and others in introducing legislation to allow the \nimportation of safe prescription drugs from Canada, the European Union, \nAustralia, New Zealand and Japan.\n  This issue is about fairness for middle class Americans who are \nstruggling to afford costly prescription drugs. Americans understand \nfairness, and they know it's wrong that Americans pay far too much for \nprescription drugs--more than Canadians, more than the British, more \nthan in any other country in the world. That's not right. Prescription \ndrugs mean the difference between sickness and health--even life and \ndeath--for millions of average Americans. It's not fair that drug \ncompanies overcharge middle class families and patients have to do \nwithout the drugs they need.\n  We're here to say that help is on the way.\n  Our legislation will legalize safe imports of U.S.-approved drugs \nmanufactured in U.S.-approved plants. It is a creative new approach to \nmeeting the needs of our middle class families. We know it will be \nopposed by the drug companies, who are determined to continue to reap \nwindfall profits at the expense of American patients. It will be \nopposed by the Bush Administration, which is determined to protect the \npharmaceutical industry and its powerful campaign contributors. But it \nwill be welcomed by someone else--by every family in every community in \nAmerica who needs to fill a prescription.\n  Every pharmaceutical company in the world wants its drugs approved \nfor sale in the United States. We're the largest market on Earth. A \ndecision by the Food and Drug Administration that a drug is safe and \neffective is the gold standard for the world. But once that drug is \napproved for use in the United States, the drug manufacturer applies a \ngreedy double standard. What's fair about a system that forces American \npatients to pay sixty percent more than the British pay or the Swiss \npay for an FDA-approved drug manufactured to FDA standards? What's fair \nwhen, on average, Americans pay two-thirds more than Canadians? What's \nfair when Americans pay 80 percent more than Germans and twice as much \nas Italians?\n  This legislation will end that indefensible disparity, by enabling \nU.S. consumers to buy FDA-approved drugs at the same fair prices as \nthey are sold abroad.\n  The drug companies and the Bush Administration claim that imported \ndrugs threaten the health of American consumers because of the \npossibility of counterfeiting or adulteration. Under this bill, that \nargument can't pass the laugh test.\n  One-quarter of the drugs that Americans use today are already legally \nimported into the United States. The American people have no idea how \nlarge a percentage of the pills they take are out-sourced--produced for \nU.S. drug-makers in plants overseas,\n\n[[Page S4229]]\n\nwhere wages are cheaper. The catch is that the law allows that. Drugs \ncan be legally imported by the drug companies themselves, who then sell \nthem at the high U.S. price.\n  If drug companies can import drugs at high prices, why can't patients \nimport them at fair prices?\n  Our legislation sets up iron-clad safety procedures to guarantee that \nevery drug imported legally into the United States is the same FDA-\napproved drug that was originally manufactured in an FDA-approved \nplant--whether the drug is manufactured abroad and shipped to the U.S., \nor whether it is manufactured in the United States, shipped abroad and \nthen imported back into the United States.\n  Under our bill, the FDA is given new legal authority and resources to \nenforce the law. In fact, under this legislation, the procedures to \nprevent counterfeiting or adulteration of drugs shipped into the United \nStates are actually stronger than the protections against \ncounterfeiting of drugs manufactured for the domestic market.\n  Our legislation also includes strict rules to close the loopholes \nthat drug companies may use to evade the law. Violations will be \nconsidered unfair trade practices under the Clayton Act, and violators \nwill be subject to triple damages.\n  No doubt, in the months ahead, as the election approaches and the \npolitical pressure builds, drug companies and their allies in the Bush \nAdministration and Congress will offer an alternative program. They'll \ncall it an importation bill, but consumers beware. Counterfeit drugs \nhave no place in American medicine cabinets, and counterfeit proposals \nto reduce drug prices have no place in Congress.\n  Year in and year out, drug companies profits are the highest of any \nindustry in the United States. Year in and year out, patients are \ndenied the life-saving drugs they need because those astronomical \nprofits are obtained by equally astronomical prices--prices that drug \ncompanies can't charge anywhere else in the world because no other \ncountry in the world would tolerate such high prices. It's time to end \nthe shameful price-gouging here at home. It's time for basic fairness. \nIt's time to pass this bill, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Dorgan, \nSnowe, Kennedy, Daschle, and others in introducing the Pharmaceutical \nMarket Access and Drug Safety Act of 2004. This bill represents a \nstrong bipartisan compromise, and is designed to establish a system for \nAmerican consumers to safely import lower cost prescription drugs.\n  American consumers are frustrated, and for good reason. We pay the \nhighest prices in the world for brand name prescription drugs. Prices \ncontinue to rise at double digit rates--far outpacing inflation. With \nover 43 million uninsured Americans and millions more seniors without a \nsubstantial prescription drug benefit, filling a doctor's prescription \nis unaffordable for many people in this country. Every day, far too \nmany families are forced to make difficult choices between life-\nsustaining prescription drugs and other daily necessities.\n  The United States represents the largest pharmaceutical market in the \nworld. Our taxpayers make substantial investments into pharmaceutical \nresearch and development. And yet, Americans are still paying 30 to 75 \npercent more for their prescriptions than consumers in Canada, the \nEuropean Union, and elsewhere.\n  In 2000, Congress passed the Medicine Equity and Drug Safety, MEDS, \nAct to provide Americans with a legal means to obtain lower cost \nprescription drugs from industrialized countries with prescription drug \nregulatory systems similar to our own. Yet here we are, four years \nlater, and Americans still cannot legally access lower cost \nprescription drugs from other nations. The safety certification \nrequirement contained in the MEDS Act proved to be a poison pill. In \nthe bill we are introducing today, we have spelled out the safety \nmeasures that will be necessary for an importation program, making the \ncertification requirement unnecessary.\n  According to recent polls, nearly two thirds of Americans believe the \ngovernment should make it easier to import lower cost drugs from Canada \nand other countries. And, Americans have begun to take matters into \ntheir own hands. Last year, Americans spent an estimated $1.1 billion \non prescription drugs imported from Canada, twice the amount that was \nspent the previous year. And states are now taking action too.\n  We also passed an enormous expansion to the Medicare program, last \nyear. Unfortunately, that new law largely benefits the pharmaceutical \nindustry and other special interests, and is already slated to cost \n$534 billion--$134 billion more than was estimated just a few months \nago. That law, which will burden American taxpayers for generations to \ncome and contributes substantially to the financial insolvency of the \nMedicare program, did practically nothing to rein in the cost of \nprescription drugs.\n  With all of the money the Federal Government will now be spending on \nprescription drugs, very little is being done to help reduce their \ncosts. In fact, the Medicare package explicitly prohibits the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services from engaging in negotiations to lower \nprescription drug costs. This must change.\n\n  In the absence of Federal action, States such as Minnesota, Illinois, \nIowa, Wisconsin, Vermont and New Hampshire, together with cities such \nas Springfield and Boston, MA, Montgomery, AL, and Los Angeles, CA, \nhave moved this issue to the forefront. In fact, the City of \nSpringfield recently announced that their drug importation program \nsaved the city more than $2 million in the last 9 months alone. Despite \nthese successes, our Federal regulators continue to oppose any effort \nto facilitate importation.\n  Throughout the debate surrounding prescription drug importation, much \nconcern has been raised regarding consumer safety and the security of \nthe U.S. drug supply, with a particular focus on the dangers of \nInternet pharmacies and counterfeit drugs. Let me be clear. None of us \nwant American consumers to be harmed from purchasing imported \nprescription drugs. That is why throughout the development of this \npackage, consumer safety has remained our primary concern. This bill \nincludes a number of measures which will make imported drugs as safe, \nif not safer, than drugs purchased through the domestic supply chain. \nWith proper government oversight, such as that which would be provided \nunder our legislation, Americans should be able to obtain access to \nsafe lower cost prescription drugs from Canada, the EU and other \nmarkets.\n  Under our proposal, during the first year after enactment, the bill \nwould enable individual American consumers, wholesalers, and \npharmacists to import FDA approved prescription drugs from FDA approved \nand inspected Canadian exporters. Recognizing that the Canadian market \nis too small to satisfy the American demand, one year after enactment, \nthe bill would allow FDA approved pharmacists and wholesalers to import \nFDA approved drugs from a larger group of nations, including the \nEuropean Union, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand and Japan.\n  To ensure the safety of this new system, the FDA would be required to \nregularly inspect Canadian exporters as well as domestic importers. The \nlegislation also would require all importers and exporters to maintain \na full chain of custody, or pedigree, for the drugs imported into the \nU.S.\n  I want to mention my concerns over actions recently taken by several \npowerful brand companies. Putting profits before patients, they have \nlimited the supply of pharmaceuticals to Canadian pharmacies and \nwholesalers who export to the United States. Such a practice is \nunacceptable. Therefore, our bill seeks to close potential loopholes \nthat would allow companies to game the system and unfairly discriminate \nagainst pharmacists or wholesalers.\n  Prescription drug importation may not be the silver bullet that will \nmake prescriptions more affordable for all Americans, but it is a step \nin the right direction. At a minimum, Americans deserve fairer prices \nfor the prescription drugs their tax dollars helped to develop.\n  I have long supported prescription drug importation, and I find it \nremarkable that our Federal regulations still do not give American \nconsumers the right to access the same markets as consumers in other \nparts of the developed world.\n\n[[Page S4230]]\n\n  We are under no illusions that this is a perfect bill, however, it \ndoes represent a solid, bipartisan compromise. We are committed to \ncontinuing to consider ways to technically improve the bill and ensure \nthat the system we are developing is as effective and efficient as \npossible to provide all American consumers access to more affordable \nprescription drugs.\n  We cannot allow election year politics to distract us from passing \ncritical legislation that will substantially benefit the millions of \nAmericans who struggle to afford the high cost of prescription drugs. \nDespite the challenges of passing this legislation in an election year, \nwe are committed to this effort.\n  I believe American consumers deserve access to safe and affordable \nimported prescription drugs. I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to move this issue forward \nexpeditiously and to ensure that our strong bipartisan compromise is \nenacted this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, \n        Mr. Frist, Mr. Daschle, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. Bayh, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Pryor, Ms. Stabenow, \n        and Mr. Nelson of Florida):\n  S. 2329. A bill to protect crime victims' rights; ordered held at the \ndesk.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this past Sunday marked the start of \nNational Crime Victims' Rights Week. We set this week aside each year \nto refocus attention on the needs and rights of crime victims.\n  This year, the Senate had been scheduled to mark the occasion by \ntaking up S.J. Res. 1, a proposed constitutional amendment. Once again, \nwe were going to devote days or weeks debating that proposal, even \nthough the Republican leadership knew it had no real chance of \ngarnering the two-thirds super-majority needed to pass. We went through \na similar process four years ago, in April 2000, when the Senate \ndebated an earlier version of the amendment during the last \npresidential election year.\n  I noted then, during that earlier debate, the fact that I have long \nworked to protect and advance crime victims' rights. As a prosecutor, I \nworked day to day and year to year alongside victims, seeking justice \non their behalf. I have worked on and led many legislative efforts on \nbehalf of victims throughout my service in the Senate. One of the most \nrecent of those efforts was the creation of the September 11 Victim \nCompensation Fund, and I am grateful to have been able to take part in \nsomething that has brought some relief to so many victims.\n  I will never forget the victims I worked with as a prosecutor or the \nneeds of the new victims minted each day through the crimes committed \nagainst them. I believe that victims should be notified when the \ndefendant is in court or when he is about to be released. I believe \nthat victims should be heard at critical stages of the prosecution. I \nbelieve that victims are entitled to restitution from offenders. In \nrecent years, the debate was never about whether victims should be \nprotected--of course they should. Rather, the debate was about how they \nshould be protected, and whether the proposed constitutional amendment \nwas the best way to do that.\n  I did not think the proposed amendment was the best way forward. The \none thing about which every witness who testified on this issue agreed \nwas that every right provided by the Victims Rights Amendment can be, \nor already is, protected by State or federal statutory law.\n  We have long had it in our power to enhance victims' rights through \nregular legislation legislation that could pass with a simple majority \nand make an immediate difference in the lives of crime victims. \nLegislative enhancements are more easily enacted, more directly applied \nand implemented, and more able to provide specific, effective remedies. \nIn addition, as Chief Justice Rehnquist and others have pointed out, \nstatutes are more easily corrected if we find, in hindsight, that they \nneed correction, clarification or improvement.\n  I am delighted to be here today with the principal sponsors of S.J. \nRes. 1, the distinguished Senators from California and Arizona, and \nwith others, both supporters and opponents of the constitutional \namendment, to join together in our support of this crime victims' \nrights statute. I commend and admire Senator Feinstein and Senator Kyl \nfor their dedication to this issue. They are deeply committed to the \ncause of victims' rights as are all of us who have joined together to \noffer this bill. It is my hope that this statute will establish more \neffective and enforceable rights for crime victims in the federal \nsystem, and that it can do so without delay, by a majority vote.\n  First, unlike S.J. Res. 1, which is limited to victims of violent \ncrime, our statute establishes enhanced rights and protections for all \nvictims of crime. Therefore, the elderly woman who is defrauded out of \nher life savings will have the same rights of notice and participation \nas other crime victims.\n  Second, our statute spells out how these rights are to be enforced, \nusing language that Senator Kennedy and I developed in S. 805, the \nCrime Victims Assistance Act. In addition to providing victims with \nstanding to assert their rights in mandamus actions, our statute would \nestablish an administrative authority in the Department of Justice to \nreceive and investigate victims' claims of unlawful or inappropriate \naction on the part of criminal justice and victims' service providers. \nDepartment of Justice employees who fail to comply with the law \npertaining to the treatment of crime victims could face disciplinary \nsanctions, including suspension or termination of employment.\n  Third, our statute incorporates additional proposals from S. 805 to \nhelp States implement and enforce their own victims' rights laws. In \nthis way, instead of replacing programs that have already been \nimplemented by a majority of States, our statute enables States to \nretain their full power to protect victims in the ways most appropriate \nto local concerns and local needs.\n  Fourth, our statute calls for two annual reports, one by the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts, and the other by the General \nAccounting Office. These reports will provide Congress with feedback on \nhow the rights and procedures established by the statute are working in \npractice. Over time, we will be able to modify and fine-tune the \nstatute so that it provides an appropriate degree of protection for the \nrights of crime victims.\n  I emphasize that passage of this bill will necessitate careful \noversight of its implementation by Congress. If, as I hope, Federal \njudges and prosecutors take victims' rights seriously, there should be \nlittle need for victims to bring mandamus actions to enforce their \nrights. But if, for whatever reason, victims feel that they are not \nbeing treated fairly, we may see a wave of new litigation in the \nFederal courts, with victims and their lawyers having to insert \nthemselves into criminal cases. We will need to monitor the situation \nclosely.\n  I am committed to giving victims real and enforceable rights. But I \nam convinced that prosecutors should be capable of protecting those \nrights, once we make them clear. In my experience, prosecutors have \nvictims' interests at heart.\n  Senator Kennedy and I proposed in the Crime Victims Assistance Act a \nlimited-standing provision, which applied with respect to the victim's \nright to attend and observe the trial, and under which a victim could \nassert her right if the prosecutor refused to do so. Passing such a \nprovision would have allowed us to observe over a period of time \nwhether direct participation of victims in criminal proceedings has any \nunanticipated consequences for the administration of justice.\n  This Victims' Rights Act proposes a bolder experiment, entitling \nvictims to assert a panoply of rights, regardless of whether the \nprosecution is already asserting the same rights on their behalf. For \nexample, at the insistence of other sponsors, this bill will enable \nvictims to bring mandamus actions alleging the denial of their \nstatutory right ``to be treated with fairness and with respect for the \nvictim's dignity and privacy,'' which may be difficult claims to \nadjudicate.\n\n[[Page S4231]]\n\n  I note with some regret that our statute picks up language from S.J. \nRes. 1 denying victims a civil cause of action for damages in the event \nthat their rights are violated. Allowing victims to vindicate their \nrights through separate civil proceedings instead of through mandamus \nactions in the criminal case could well be a more efficient as well as \na more effective way of ensuring that victims' rights are honored. \nCertainly the prospect of being sued would provide a powerful incentive \nto take victims' rights seriously. But the Republican sponsors of the \nbill did not want to provide for damages.\n  Similarly, some Republican Senators did not want to allow courts to \nappoint attorneys to help crime victims. It is my hope and belief that \nvictims will seldom need representation, since they already have \npowerful advocates in our public prosecutors. Still, it is possible \nthat a judge would want to appoint an attorney for a victim in an \nextraordinary case, as for example if there is a material conflict \nbetween the victim's interests and the interests of the prosecution. By \nfailing to provide for this possibility, our new bill may perpetuate a \nsystem of unequal justice for victims, where the wealthy have the \nbenefit of counsel, and the poor do not.\n  Finally, I want to comment on the unusual genesis of this bill, and \nthe extraordinary procedure that I expect it will follow in the Senate. \nAs I mentioned earlier, the Senate was scheduled to begin work this \nweek on the proposed constitutional amendment, S.J. Res. 1. On \nWednesday, the Republican leadership moved to invoke cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. I would not have opposed this motion. I voted to \nproceed to an earlier iteration of this constitutional amendment 4 \nyears ago, and I would have been prepared to proceed to it again this \nweek. Given the time this would take and the expected outcome, it could \nbe argued that the Senate already has many pressing matters on its \nagenda, but I would not have opposed a debate on the constitutional \namendment.\n  Given the Republican leadership's insistence on proceeding to the \nconstitutional amendment this week, there has not been as much time as \nI would have liked to craft the statutory alternative that we introduce \ntoday. And because this bill will come to a vote almost immediately, we \nwill not get to hold hearings on it and polish the text in Committee. I \nwould have liked to get the views of the Office for Victims of Crime. \nMany victims' groups and domestic violence organizations opposed the \nconstitutional amendment, as did many law professors, judges, and \nprosecutors. I would have liked to hear their views on this statute. I \nam concerned that the statute may not adequately address the special \nproblems raised in domestic violence and abuse situations. Fortunately, \nhowever, this is a statute, not a constitutional amendment, and it can \nbe modified with relative ease if the need arises.\n  I commend my good friend, Senator Feinstein, for mediating this \nconsensus legislation. I know that she would have preferred to pass a \nconstitutional amendment--she has made that clear. Nevertheless, she \nworked hard to produce a bill that we all can support, showing once \nagain that she is first and foremost a legislator who wants to get \nthings done. Due in large part to Senator Feinstein's efforts, we now \nhave an opportunity to advance the cause of victims' rights with \nstrong, practical, bipartisan legislation. I have never doubted Senator \nFeinstein or Senator Kyl's commitment to victims' rights. I am \ndelighted that we have come together to advance that common cause.\n  Over more than 20 years I have sponsored and championed legislation \nto help victims. I have mentioned the recent September 11 Victim \nCompensation Fund, and I am also proud of such other advancements on \nbehalf of victims as a law to provide assistance to victims of \ninternational terrorism, and bills to raise the cap on victims' \nassistance and compensation programs and to protect the rights of the \nvictims of the Oklahoma City bombing. The legislation that we introduce \ntoday should provide us the opportunity to make progress on yet another \nimportant measure to address the needs of victims, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Talent, and Mr. Allen):\n  S.J. Res. 33. A joint resolution expressing support for freedom in \nHong Kong; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with my \ncolleagues Senator Talent and Senator Allen, an important resolution \nregarding recent developments in Hong Kong. Hong Kong has been a great \nfriend of the United States, a key ally in the war on terrorism and an \ninvaluable trading partner. In recent weeks, however, it has become \nincreasingly clear that Beijing will stand in the way of Hong Kong's \ndevelopment into a full democracy. Such actions compel support from the \nmembers of this body.\n  The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 sets forth the guidelines for the \nU.S. relationship with Hong Kong. It provides for a very special and \ndistinct relationship with the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, \neven as we recognize the Hong Kong is a part of China. This special \nrelationship rests on the notion that Hong Kong will be governed \ndifferently than the rest of China.\n  Unfortunately, Beijing continues to suggest that it has no intention \nof realizing Hong Kong's democratic potential. Recent decisions by the \nStanding Committee of the National People's Congress push direct \nelection of Hong Kong's Chief Executive into the future. Hong Kong's \nLegislative Counsel faces a similar fate. Some observers even suggest \nBeijing will wait another 30 or 40 years to allow universal suffrage in \nthe selection of executive and legislative office holders to become a \nreality. By then, the 50 year special arrangement will be near \nexpiration, threatening everything the people of Hong Kong have \nachieved.\n  I traveled to Hong Kong in January. My Subcommittee on East Asia and \nPacific Affairs held a hearing last month where we heard testimony from \nHong Kong's leading democracy advocates. A clear message emerges from \neveryone with whom I have spoken on this issue: Hong Kong is ready for \nfull democracy. The people have demonstrated the ability to create a \nvibrant society and they deserve universal suffrage and the ability to \nparticipate fully in the functions of government.\n  The resolution I submit today is simple. It recognizes the recent \nreport from the State Department dealing with the U.S.-Hong Kong \nrelationship. It highlights Hong Kong's autonomy as envisioned by the \nHong Kong Policy Act, and it highlights the unfortunate steps taken in \nBeijing to frustrate Hong Kong's democratic development. As the \nresolution says, Congress ought to declare ``that the people of Hong \nKong should be free to determine the pace and scope of constitutional \ndevelopments'' and that anything less violates the vision of democracy \nset forth in the 1984 Joint Declaration signed by Great Britain and the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  When Martin Lee came to testify about the importance of democratic \ndevelopment in March, Beijing referred to him as a dreamer. They meant \nit as an insult, but Mr. Lee embraces the label as he looks to a future \nof freedom in Hong Kong. This body can make a powerful statement of \nsupport for Martin Lee's democratic dreams by passing this resolution, \nand I hope they will move quickly to do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4231-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4231-S4232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, in a moment I will propound a unanimous \nconsent request with respect to the highway bill, but first let me \nexplain to everybody where we are. We passed our version of the bill in \nthe Senate on February 12 by an overwhelming majority, 76 to 21. \nSubsequent to that, the House passed their bill, H.R. 3550, on April 2 \nby, again, an overwhelming majority of 357 to 65. That bill is now at \nthe desk.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of the House-passed highway bill, H.R. 3550; provided \nfurther that all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of \nS. 1072, as passed, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill then be read \na third time and passed; further, the Senate then insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair then be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with a ratio \nof 11 to 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, this is \nlegislation I really understand. Senator Inhofe and a couple others \nworked hard to get this legislation passed. I would say, initially, \nthis legislation could not have passed but for the support, under some \nvery difficult times, of the majority leader. I commend him for his \noutward support and inward support. He supported us openly on the \nSenate floor and in all of the discussions we had off the Senate floor. \nI am very grateful for that.\n  We have a very fine bill. The House bill is a bill that is OK. It is \nnot as good as ours. But let me say this. We were moving along just \nfine on this legislation until, for reasons unknown to most people, the \nPresident said he is going to veto the bill if it is more than X number \nof dollars. Keep in mind that this legislation that passed the Senate \ndoes not create a single new tax. A vast majority of the money comes \nout of the trust fund to take care of this. It takes care of highways \nand transit--a good bill. It would create more than a million new \njobs--high-paying jobs--directly.\n  So I say to my friend, the distinguished majority leader, I believe \nif conferees were appointed tonight what we would do is the Senate \nwould designate staff people to work on this bill with the House \npeople. I would suggest--and I don't care what it is called; call it \nwhatever you want to call it--our staffs should start working on this \nlegislation.\n  It is obvious, because the Speaker has indicated why he does not want \nthis bill. He said he does not want his Members to have to cast a tough \nvote. Mr. President, 357 to 65--I served in the House. I know how many \nvotes it takes to override a veto. Over here I know how many votes it \ntakes to override a veto. This bill is a good bill, and the majority of \nthe House and the Senate would vote to override the President's veto. I \nbelieve the President, when confronted with the facts of what good \nlegislation this is, would not veto the bill anyway, with the need for \ncreating jobs. But I would hope the majority leader would allow the \nstaffs to begin working on this to see if we can get to a point where a \nconference committee can be appointed. I want this bill to pass. I \nthink it is something that needs to pass for our country. But I would \nhope we don't get in a position where our staffs can't work on this. I \nam sure the majority leader knows the staffs have already had one \nproductive meeting. We could have a couple more and maybe get to the \npoint where the majority leader would be satisfied that the staffs are \ndoing the right thing, in his estimation. I would be happy to talk to \nmy distinguished leader. He knows my interest in this bill. Hopefully, \nwe would get it passed.\n\n  I apologize, this late in the evening, for talking as long as I have. \nBut I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we are in a unique situation, as you just \nheard explained quite well. This is a bill I very much want. It is a \nnonpartisan bill about which this body has spoken very loudly. I \nappreciate the leadership of my colleague from Nevada on this bill. We \nare very proud of the product we have produced. My whole intention of \ncoming to the floor, which is the normal process, to appoint conferees, \nRepublican and Democratic conferees, is to continue in an orderly \nfashion and bring the bill to completion so it is law, not just a bill. \nWe passed it February 12. The House passed it on April 2. We passed two \nextensions of the previous highway bill already and the deadline for \nthe next temporary extension will be next Friday. We will have to do it \nonce again.\n  I am working very hard so we can have a conference committee, and we \ncan't have a conference committee until we have conferees. It is time \nto act on the highway bill.\n  As the distinguished assistant Democratic leader said, over a \nmillion, and I would say 2 million, new jobs will be created by this \nbill. It is vital to our economy. It is vital to the Nation's \ninfrastructure. Regular order would be for us to appoint conferees. We \nwill continue to work, having heard the objection, in regular order \nwhich, in my mind, would accelerate passage of the bill. We will \ncontinue to work with the other side, although I am disappointed we \ncannot proceed with this regular order. But I am committed to the bill. \nThe assistant Democratic leader is. Over 70 Members of this body are. \nSo we will continue to work diligently in that regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4232-3", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4232-S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I further ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote on the \nmotion to proceed to S. J. Res. 1 be vitiated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe--although I am never certain--that \ncloture will not be invoked on the asbestos bill. The reason I mention \nthat is I think the work done by Senators Feinstein, Hatch, Kyl, and \nLeahy has been tremendous on this piece of legislation that we are \ngoing to debate tomorrow.

There is a lot of work most people don't see. \nCertainly, you didn't see very much of it on the Senate floor over the \nlast couple days.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning, following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will resume consideration of the asbestos bill and \nthe motion to proceed to the asbestos bill.\n  There will be an additional hour of debate prior to that vote on \ninvoking cloture on the motion to proceed. I take this opportunity to \nthank Chairman Hatch and the many Members who have come to the floor to \nspeak on the importance of this legislation. Indeed, both sides of the \naisle have spoken to the critically important issue of an asbestos \nlitigation system which is inefficient and, in many ways, run amok over \nits initial intention.\n  This vote is the beginning of the process and not the end. I have \nmade that clear, hopefully, in every public statement and in every \nstatement with my colleagues, as we have worked to negotiate this bill \nover the last week. It began several weeks ago when we set out on this \ncourse of bringing this to a real focus.\n  It is time to legislate on this important issue, and tomorrow's vote \nis an effort to work through many issues of the bill and to eventually \nproduce an outcome.\n  If we are unable to invoke cloture on the asbestos bill, we are going \nto proceed to the victims' rights bill under the previous consent \nagreement. There will be up to 2 hours for debate prior to vote on \npassage of the victims' rights bill that was introduced earlier by \nSenators Kyl and Feinstein.\n  Therefore, Senators should expect at least two votes tomorrow. The \nfirst one will occur at approximately 11:30 in the morning on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed to the asbestos bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4233-5", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4233]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, let me, first of all, say I tried to not be \nthe last person speaking in the Senate, as people want to go home. We \nhave lots of people here, including the Presiding Officer. I was asked \nearly yesterday to give a statement today, and certain people are \nexpecting me to do this. So I apologize to all the staff. I will try to \nbe as quick as I can. I do believe that the statement is one that is \nimportant.\n  Let me, first of all, comment on the statements made by Senators \nHatch and Sessions--those statements I heard today dealing with the \nasbestos legislation. I acknowledge that it is important legislation.\n  For example, I met in my office with Ken Bowa from Nevada, one of the \nvice presidents of the Pfizer Company. You would not think that a \ncompany that manufactures pharmaceuticals would have an asbestos \nproblem, but they do. They bought a company 30 years ago,\n\n[[Page S4234]]\n\nor thereabouts, and that company at one time produced a material that \nhad asbestos in it. Even though this is a multibillion-dollar company, \nthat small purchase they made is causing them a lot of grief. So I know \nthe problems from the business perspective. There are lots of problems. \nI understand that. I understand that my friend, Ken Bowa, had the \ninterests of his client at heart, as do the other businesspeople, and \ntheir representatives come to see us.\n  One of the issues we always have to understand with asbestos is that \nin addition to the companies having problems, people are killed as a \nresult of messing around with asbestos, working with it, working around \nit. Women who washed their husbands' clothes now have very serious \nillnesses, such as asbestosis, mesothelioma. With mesothelioma, it is \nnot a question of dying; it is only a question of how soon. The average \nlife expectancy is 14 months.\n  There is no question that as a result of some of the books written in \nthe past year on Libby, MT, ``Fatal Deception,'' where companies knew \nthe danger of this product and they covered it up, they hid it, as a \nresult of that, people will get sick and will die.\n  This is an issue about which we must be very cautious before we do \nsomething. The main thing we need to do is make sure there is enough \nmoney to take care of the people who are tragically ill as a result of \nthis substance.\n  My friend from Alabama, the distinguished junior Senator from \nAlabama, said: Why don't we take care of this bill; there has been a \nlot of work that has gone into it, speaking about the bill on which we \nare going to vote regarding cloture tomorrow.\n  We reported out a bill--the way it should be done around here--we \nreported a bill out of committee on a bipartisan vote. That bill had a \nprice tag of $154 billion. The bill we are being asked to deal with \ntomorrow has a price tag of $109 billion. That is a huge difference. We \nwere not allowed to work on the committee-reported bill. We are now \nbeing asked to vote on this aberration of that bill.\n  This is not about greedy lawyers. It is about sick people. It is \nabout companies that are in dire straits as a result of asbestos.\n  In spite of all this, we have not taken appropriate action to ban the \nimportation of this toxic, poisonous, horrible substance, asbestos. I \nhave joined with Patty Murray to deal with the importation of this \nsubstance into our country, as other countries have done. We have not \ndone that. This will need a lot of work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4234-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4234-S4236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NEGATIVE IMPACT OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ACT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor is, first, to \nexpress my appreciation to the former chairman, now the ranking member, \nof the Education Committee, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, for \nconstantly reminding us of the importance of education, enabling \nAmerica's families to improve the quality of their life.\n  I want to talk about the negative impact of the No Child Left Behind \nAct.\n  Congress is not expected to pass much legislation this year, even \nthough there is much more that should be done. Of the dozens of issues \nwe have yet to consider, addressing the consequences of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act is paramount.\n  When the No Child Left Behind Act was passed, there were many who \nlauded President Bush's commitment to education. After all, who among \nus would allow any child to slip through the cracks of our educational \nsystem if it could be prevented? None of us would do that. At the time, \nmany thought this was sweeping legislation and that sweeping \nlegislation would fill those gaps.\n  Sadly, this has not been the case. The No Child Left Behind Act has \ndone more harm than good in more States than not. In the State of \nNevada, we are suffering under the burden of unfunded mandates this law \nimposed. In fact, a leading headline in the Reno newspaper, the second \nlargest newspaper in the State of Nevada, reads:\n\n       Educators Give No Child Left Behind Act a Failing Grade.\n\n  The man who stated that is the superintendent of public instruction \nof Washington County, the second largest school district in the State \nof Nevada. He said it is not working. It took a lot of courage for this \nman to do this. He comes from a county that is a Republican county by \nregistration, but it is a county that is very fair and very \nindependent. I am sure they recognize that Jim Hager, the fine man that \nhe is, the long-time superintendent he has been, would not say anything \nunless he truly believed it was true:\n\n       Educators Give No Child Left Behind Act a Failing Grade.\n\n  When I talk about Jim Hager, I am talking about the Washington County \nSchool District superintendent, but he is also president of the Nevada \nAssociation of School Superintendents. We have 17 counties in Nevada, \n17 school superintendents, and he is speaking for them. He is speaking \nfor the Nevada Association of School Superintendents.\n  Let me give a snapshot of the education landscape in Nevada. We have \n17 counties, as I have mentioned, in the State of Nevada. Clark County, \nof course, is the county Las Vegas is in. Well over 70 percent of the \npeople of the State of Nevada live in Clark County. It is a big county. \nThe State of Nevada has approximately 400,000 students. About 280,000 \nstudents are from Clark County. It is the fifth or sixth largest school \ndistrict in America.\n  I also want to say here, for future understanding of my remarks, in \nthe Clark County School District, about 30 percent of the children in \nthat school district are Hispanic. The vast majority of those Hispanic \nstudents come from Mexico. Many of those children, even though they are \nas smart as any other kids in America, have language problems because \nsome of their parents do not speak English.\n  Clark County, which has this huge school district, needs $1 million \nannually for recruitment efforts. They have to hire 2,000 new teachers \na year.\n  We have a real problem graduating minority students. We are 49th in \nthe Nation. We graduate overall about 63 percent of all students. That \nis not good. We recognize that. But you will not meet a single parent, \nteacher, principal, superintendent, or school administrator of any kind \nwho is not concerned about preserving and improving the quality of \neducation for the kids in Nevada. In fact, there is no one within the \nsound of my voice who is not committed to giving every child an \nopportunity to graduate and go on to higher education, whether that \nhigher education is college or some kind of trade school.\n  Whatever it takes for us to get there, we are going to do that. In \nfact, Nevada did create its own accountability system that will work in \nour States. It addresses the needs of our children in our own way. The \nNo Child Left Behind Act was passed and now we are living in its wake. \nIt reminds me of when I went to Hawaii for the first time. There was \nthis beautiful beach on the island of Maui. We were eating in a \nrestaurant and it was such a beautiful view. We had a conversation with \nthe waitress and she told us when she was a little girl the beach that \nwe could see opened up and went out for a football field, way out into \nthe ocean. The kids ran out there. There was a school nearby where the \nrestaurant is now. They ran out there. What they did not realize is \nthat was a tsunami and it pulled the water out and you could not see \nthe waves coming in. It washed over everybody and killed a lot of kids \nand a lot of people were hurt.\n  That is what has happened with the No Child Left Behind Act. One \ncannot see on the surface what has happened, but the undertow, the \ntsunami, has wiped out a lot of children. It is ironic that this \nsweeping education reform legislation authored by President Bush is \nreceiving a failing grade from every school system it was intended to \nhelp. There is no question about it, as I indicated before, that it is \nhurting kids in Nevada. It is so bad in Utah, they have withdrawn from \nthe program. The State of Utah--I am sure it is the first of a number \nof States to do that--said: We want no part of it. We want to educate \nour kids the way we think we should, and not have these burdens that I \nwill talk about in just a minute.\n  So more than 2 years after this legislation was passed, parents are \nstill struggling to understand the basics of the law, especially when \nthey learn about terms such as ``annual yearly progress'' and ``failing \nschool.'' As a parent, people want the best for their children. It is \ndisturbing to be told\n\n[[Page S4235]]\n\nthat the school their child attends is now considered failing.\n  As a result of this legislation, as my colleagues can see on this \nsecond chart I have, we have come up with some terms but hardly anyone \nunderstands them. In this glossary of terms, AYP--we will see that a \nlot--adequate yearly progress is a minimum level of improvement that \nschool districts and schools must achieve each year as determined under \nthe Federal No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Individualized educational plans are specific goals set by an \neducational team for a special education student and includes any \nspecial supports that are needed to help achieve these goals.\n  We can run through this whole list of definitions: Safe harbor, a \nprovision intended for schools and districts that are making progress, \nat least 10 percent, in student achievement but are not yet making \nadequate yearly progress targets goals. It is designed to prevent the \nover identification of schools not making adequate yearly progress.\n  The definitions are unbelievably difficult. The people back in \nWashington do not understand them. The people in Nevada certainly do \nnot understand them, nor do people around the rest of the country.\n  I have tried to help improve this legislation by introducing and \nsupporting measures that will help, not hurt, our most vulnerable \neducational communities. I will give an example. Every day in Nevada, \nrural communities are confronted by a shortage of resources. We have 17 \ncounties in Nevada. We have one county, Esmeralda County, that does not \nhave 1,000 people living in it, and it is a pretty good size county. We \nhave some schools that are very sparsely populated. We only have two \ncounties that are heavily populated. Clark, I have talked about, that \n70 percent of the people live there, and 20 percent in the metropolitan \narea of Washoe County. That leaves 10 percent of the people around the \nrest of the State.\n\n  It may surprise some people to know that there are still small towns \nin rural America where the citizens wait for a doctor to make rounds or \na mail truck to drop off mail. These families have elected to stay in \ntheir communities despite all the obstacles, and they deserve an \nopportunity to enjoy a good quality of life.\n  We have rural schools in Clark County. My home is in Searchlight, NV. \nI am very fortunate the school there is named after me. It is not a \nvery big school. There are about 50 kids in it, grades 1-6, but in \nClark County we have schools that are rural schools. In Nevada, we \nstill have one-room schools. So we are concerned about what is \nhappening in rural America.\n  I have not traveled to Minnesota very much. After they immigrated to \nthis country, my in-laws settled in Minnesota, and I know that a lot of \nvery small communities are in Minnesota. People think of Minnesota as \nMinneapolis and St. Paul, but I am confident there are a lot of rural \ncommunities, just like in Nevada. That is why I introduced legislation \nentitled ``Assisting America's Rural Schools Act'' that addressed the \nconcerns of rural school systems trying to comply with the teacher \nquality standards set by No Child Left Behind.\n  When I went to school in Searchlight, we had one teacher who taught \nall eight grades. There is a small town in Nevada called Austin in \nLander County. It is a community much like the one I was raised in. \nAustin boasts a total of 63 students in grades K-12. For grades 6-12, \nthere are only three teachers for all subjects. These teachers are \nconsidered highly qualified in science, English, math, and physical \neducation. In order for Austin to acquire a teacher who is highly \nqualified in the subject of history, the local education agency must \neither find and recruit another teacher or send one of its three \ncurrent teachers back to school to get accredited in history via \ndistance learning.\n  Unfortunately, Lander County does not have the money to do any of \nthis. The issue is not whether teachers in rural areas should be \nqualified to teach multiple subjects. They should. However, requiring \nthem to obtain highly qualified status in all subjects simultaneously \nis unreasonable.\n  So my legislation gave rural school systems some flexibility in \nmeeting the definition of a highly qualified teacher without \ndiminishing high accountability standards for teachers. Rural school \ndistricts would be able to give a one-year exemption to any teacher who \nis already qualified in at least one core academic subject. A highly \nqualified teacher who is working toward that certification in another \nsubject can still teach both subjects. The Department of Education \nadopted the principle of this bill last month.\n\n  The Secretary of Education came to Reno and made that announcement. \nTeachers in eligible rural school districts who are highly qualified in \nat least one subject will now have 3 years to become highly qualified. \nI am certain rural school districts and teachers are relieved the \nadministration recognized the burden No Child Left Behind had placed \nand they recognized that my legislation was important.\n  That was just one of the many glitches in this mammoth bill. How many \nmore will we face in years to come? Superintendent Jim Hager--I have \ntalked about him--is responsible for 60,000 students in Washoe County. \nHe gave an honest assessment of what is going on with the Leave No \nChild Behind Act throughout the State, and probably every other State. \nOne of his chief frustrations is that all students who come into the \nNevada school system are facing formidable challenges--learning \ndisabilities, language barriers, or influences beyond their control \nattributed to their living conditions.\n  These challenges are significant and oftentimes the school system is \nintended to be the primary system to fix, help, or remove these \nobstacles. No Child Left Behind expects these school districts to turn \nthese troubled children into top flight students within 1 year without \nreceiving full funding from the Federal Government to do so.\n  If the schools do not turn these children around in a timely manner, \nthey go on what is called a watch list, a badge that is not good, a \nbadge these schools have to wear. This badge puts these schools on the \nverge of being branded failure.\n  Let me show a chart that depicts Clark County's failing school cells. \nIf we look here, we will find in the Clark County school district where \nthe problems are. If we look across, we will find that white kids are \ndoing just very nicely. They are doing very fine. The schools that are \nmostly white have no problem, but if we go to a school that is \nHispanic, there is a problem. Every place we see the red, which is \nfailure, is Hispanic--one, two, three, four, five categories, and if we \nlook at other minorities, African Americans, the same thing. I think \nthis is a glaring example of why this legislation is bad.\n  It would be nice if you had a school which represented the percentage \nof people within the community, but that is not how schools are. We \nfind in Nevada, as every place else, schools that are heavily Hispanic. \nYou have schools that have large numbers of African-American children. \nIn these schools, these people who are teaching have problems with \nlanguage arts.\n  Let's say you have somebody starting school who has bad English. The \nway I look at this, even though my skin is white, I look at every one \nof these problems here as me. When I grew up, my parents were \nuneducated. They were not dumb; they were uneducated. My father never \neven graduated from the 8th grade. My mother never even graduated from \nhigh school.\n  I would have been part of this failing school system. If they had \ntried to test me out of the schools then, I couldn't have made it. It \nis just like a lot of these children.\n  These children here are not dumb. They have social problems. Maybe \ntheir parents didn't graduate from the 8th grade. Maybe their parents \ndidn't graduate from high school. Maybe they don't have both parents at \nhome. That doesn't mean they are dumb. Maybe what these children need, \nrather than a badge that they are in a failing school is extra help. \nThat has not happened.\n  I believe we should hold our teachers and students accountable. But \nif we expect them to achieve miracles without providing the resources \nthey need, we are setting them up for failure. That is what this bill \nhas done. It is not helping children learn and it is not helping \nteachers teach.\n  Testing a child to make him learn is like weighing a steer to make \nhim gain weight. By weighing a steer, he doesn't\n\n[[Page S4236]]\n\ngain weight. You have to feed him. That is how you get a steer to gain \nweight. Testing a child to make him learn is the same thing. You can't \ntest a child into being proficient in English or Spanish.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act is having a ripple effect throughout the \nState of Nevada and throughout the country. That is why I am going to \nsit down with every county superintendent in the State next month and \nask them what needs to be fixed. I think I know, but I want to hear \nthem. I want them to have the opportunity to speak to me. We need \nrelief in Nevada, and if we have to do it bit by bit we will. But this \nlaw as it stands puts our educational system in peril.\n  Nevada is not the only State that has problems. I was pleased the \nDepartment of Education adopted the principle of this bill last month, \nas I said. But if we look at the failing school system--look at another \nchart I have. Look at this one. This really, as far as I am concerned, \nis showing that it is pathetically horrible.\n  You can have a school that meets every criterion that is important \nunder the No Child Left Behind Act--except one. Everything is just \nfine. But if there is limited English proficiency in that school, they \nare a failing school. If everything else is fine but they have limited \nEnglish proficiency, they are given the red badge and now they are held \nup to being a failing school.\n  It is because they have children in the school who have come to \nschool not being able to speak very good English. They are not dumb. \nThey deserve an education. The No Child Left Behind Act is having a \nripple effect throughout Nevada and throughout the Nation.\n\n  Nevada is not the only State having difficulties implementing this \nlaw; it is a national problem. Thousands of school districts are \nalready trying to juggle school construction costs, increase graduation \nrates, find money for textbooks that they don't have. Reducing class \nsizes is impossible. They are figuring out what to do about overcrowded \nschools.\n  During the April recess I spoke with concerned citizens of Nevada. I \nwent to several schools in what I call my Capitol Classroom program. I \ntalked about overcrowded schools. There is one high school in Clark \nCounty with about 5,000 students in it. There are others almost that \nbig: a high school with 5,000 students. More than 70 percent of our \nNation's high schools have 1,500 or more students.\n  When the President signed the No Child Left Behind Act, he signaled \nhis support for programs that were supposed to help students learn, \nincluding smaller schools and smaller classes. In contrast to that \npromise, in this year's budget the President zeros out the Smaller \nLearning Communities Program--zero.\n  I had the good fortune at one time in my career to be chairman of the \nDemocratic Policy Committee. We had one of our retreats up in \nWilmington, DE. I brought in there a woman by the name of Deborah \nMeyer. She was from New York. Deborah Meyer was a school principal of a \nbig school in New York, an elementary school. Her kids were doing so \nawful that she decided to go to the school authorities and she said: \nLook, this is not working. Trust me. I want to try something. I want to \ntake this school and, instead of having one school, we are going to \nhave four schools. We are going to have four principals, four separate \nfaculties, four separate lunch hours--everything is going to be like a \nseparate school.\n  The school administrators said: We have nothing to lose. You are \ndoing so bad you can't do any worse than you have done.\n  She did that and within one quarter, in 3 months, the scores had \nrisen in every category and Deborah Meyer has become famous because of \nthat and she has gone other places and tried the same thing. We need to \nunderstand smaller schools help.\n  Senator Bingaman and I, along with 14 other colleagues, sent a letter \nto the labor subcommittee requesting funding be restored. Not enough, \nbut $200 million in the Smaller Learning Communities Program. We really \nneed that.\n  The President has been given bad advice by the budgeteers down there. \nCommon sense tells us students do best when they receive plenty of \npersonal attention from their teachers. Studies tell us the same thing. \nAccording to the Department of Education, research suggests that \npositive outcomes associated with smaller schools stem from their \nability to have close, personal environments where teachers can work \nwith a small set of students, challenging and inspiring them.\n  They build big schools because it is cheaper. Smaller learning \ncommunities can achieve in different ways: small learning centers, core \nacademics, magnet programs, schools within a school, as I have just \ndescribed. It would seem to me, if this administration really wanted to \nhelp our teachers teach and help our students learn they wouldn't be \ntrying to eliminate a program like this, to create smaller learning \ncommunities, which have been proven to do just that.\n  I touched only on a few things tonight dealing with problems of the \nNo Child Left Behind Act. It is going to take a lot of work to improve \nthis bill and make it what it promised to be, a tool that will help \nteachers and students in every public school in America. It is a \ndifficult job but we must keep our promise to America's children. We \ncan't afford to leave them behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/04/21/senate-section/article/S4236-1", "month": "04", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
