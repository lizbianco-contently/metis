Whatever time is deemed necessary to the \nmajority leader, we would be willing to abide by that. It would avoid a \nlot of the extraneous issues.

We are willing to move at any time convenient to the majority \nto a vote on the resolution itself, of course, with no amendments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7903-9", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7903-S7932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to S.J. Res. 40, which \nthe clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to consideration of Senate Joint \n     Resolution 40, a joint resolution proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States relating to marriage.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time until 6 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the chairman and ranking member \nor their designees.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Nevada, \nI appreciate his offer. I suggest we continue to work together to see \nif we can come up with a plan on how to proceed. It would be optimal to \nhave a vote, a substantive vote.\n  As the Senator from Nevada may not be aware, there are different \nopinions on how to best address this issue. There are a couple of other \nproposals that have been floated out there that Members on our side \nwould like to vote on by way of amendment to the underlying \nlegislation.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. It is a piece of \nlegislation on first impression here to the Senate and, given the \nimportance of this legislation, it begs a full debate and the \nopportunity for different points of view to be expressed through the \namendment process. While I appreciate the chance for an up-or-down vote \non the Allard text, I do know of many Members who have different ideas \nand would like to see those ideas be reflected by way of amendment.\n  At this point, we are not capable of agreeing to that but we would be \nanxious to work with the Senator to see if there is some construct we \ncan put together to allow this issue to be fully debated for those who \nhave different\n\n[[Page S7904]]\n\npoints of view with respect to how to deal with this very important \nissue of protecting traditional marriage, that they have their \nopportunity to express their language, their preferable constitutional \namendment as opposed to the one the Senator from Colorado has put \nforth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have not spoken to anyone, but it appears \nfrom the body language I pick up and what I believe I hear my friend \nfrom Pennsylvania saying, they do not like the measure now before the \nbody and they want to change it.\n  That is the problem we have when we report legislation directly to \nthe floor without the necessary hearings. As to this matter that is now \nbefore the Senate, it is my understanding we have not had hearings \nbefore the Judiciary Committee where they should have gone on. The \nSenate Chamber is not the place to do what committees are there to do.\n  If there is some mistake or some other amendment that the Senators \nwould rather have on the majority side, I suggest they take this back \nto the Judiciary Committee, have a full hearing, and decide really what \nthey do want. It goes without saying it will not wind up being very \npleasant if, in fact, we ever got to the resolution itself and this \namendment were open to the amendment process. Everyone knows if that \nhappens, this amendment would be bogged down with Christmas-tree-like \nornaments called amendments.\n  We thought when we arrived and worked with our Members--Friday \nmorning I personally called probably a dozen telling them what our plan \nwas, not to have a procedural bottleneck to this legislation--that we \nwould move immediately to that. That was not really what some wanted to \ndo. Some wanted an up-or-down vote on the motion to proceed. We were \nable to show them it was better for the system that we move directly to \nthe resolution.\n  We also thought we have so many things to do. Just last week we had a \nclosed evidentiary presentation on what is going on around the world \nand in our country with homeland security. There are things we need to \ndo in that regard. Last week the distinguished Presiding Officer was \nhere where my friend, the junior Senator from Pennsylvania, now stands \ntrying to work something out so that we could move forward on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security bill. That is \nsomething we should work on. We have all the appropriations bills to \ndo. There is so much this body needs to do and we were trying to open \nup as much time in the remaining time we have left in this short \nlegislative session before the August break, before the two national \nconventions, to provide more time on the Senate floor.\n  The leader told me last week one of the things he was considering is \ngoing to the Australian Free Trade Agreement. Some Members feel very \nstrongly about that. I know the committee has had hearings on this \nissue. I have spoken to Senator Hatch on more than one occasion.\n  My only point is that we should not be amending this resolution on \nthe Senate floor.\n  It is my feeling the best way to move to this is to move immediately \nto the resolution itself, do not have a motion to proceed which, if \ncloture is attempted on the motion to proceed, I do not think we will \never get to the resolution, and that is not fair. People in the State \nof Nevada feel strongly about it, as in the State of Pennsylvania, the \nState of Colorado, and the State of Alaska, one way or the other.\n  We should have the opportunity to vote up or down on this resolution, \nnot on some procedural issue. But it appears to me that is where we are \nheaded. We are headed as we are doing on so many other issues. Class \naction: I was not a supporter of the class action legislation, but for \nthe class action legislation there was a 5-foot jumpshot to make that \nlegislation succeed. I have to say, the majority did not miss the \njumpshot; they did not even bother to take the 5-foot jumpshot. They \nwalked away from that legislation.\n  I think the same thing has happened on a number of other issues. It \nappears to me what the majority wants is the issue, not a resolution of \nthe issue. And now, if we are going to have to vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on the motion to proceed, the majority can walk out and \nsay: See what those Democrats did. They wouldn't even let us vote on \nthe resolution.\n  I will tell everyone within the sound of my voice, we will allow a \nvote on the resolution. We want to go immediately to the resolution \nthat is now before the Senate. I believe it is two sentences long, so \nit should not take a lot of thought as to what the resolution contains. \nI would say, with the great minds we have on the Republican side--and I \ndo not say that in any way to castigate anyone; I believe we have \npeople with great legislative experience in the majority, and this \nissue has been around for a long time--why in the world would they \nbring something before the Senate they do not want?\n  So I hope we can avoid procedural pitfalls and move directly at a \ntime convenient.\n  I also say this: Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards would like to vote \non the resolution. But if we cannot set a time certain, set a time \nuncertain, and they may or may not make it. We do want a time certain \nwithin a respectable period of time, but I hope this is not being done, \nso they are being prevented from voting on it. As you know, we had an \nimportant issue here a couple weeks ago where we set a time certain, we \nthought we had a time certain, and, as a result of our \nmisunderstanding, Senator Kerry wasted a whole day here and was not \nable to vote.\n  So for whatever reason the majority appears not to want us to vote on \nthe resolution itself, I hope that can be resolved. We want to get \nalong. We want to allow as much time as possible on other issues, so \nthere can be adequate debate on other legislation other than this \nmatter.\n  What is going to happen if we proceed down this road, I would assume, \nis if the majority leader decides to file a cloture motion on the \nmotion to proceed tonight, we will vote on it Wednesday, and that will \nbe the end of this debate. That would be too bad, because I think \npeople should vote on the resolution itself and not be able to hide \nunder some procedural vote.\n  Maybe there are those on the other side who would rather not vote on \nthe amendment itself. I think if we had a good, straight, up-or-down \nvote on the resolution, I would be surprised if we did not get 8 to 12 \nRepublican Senators voting against the resolution now before this body. \nThat may be another part of what the leadership is doing in this \ninstance, saying simply: We are not going to allow the embarrassment to \ntake place where this resolution gets 40 or 42 votes, when 67 are \nneeded.\n\n  There are many who have said--and we have heard speeches on the \nfloor--why are we doing this? Why are we voting on something that is \ndoomed to failure? It will not pass. The constitutional amendment will \nnot pass the Senate. In fact, as I said, if we had an up-or-down vote, \nmaybe 42 votes would be in favor of it. That is 25 short of enough to \nmeet the constitutional muster.\n  So for whatever reason, for whatever plan the majority has, we want a \nvote on the resolution. However, if the majority decides to bring this \nresolution to the floor, and it is amendable, I do not think the motion \nto proceed will prevail. I cannot speak for every Senator over here, \nbut I can speak for a few of them.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the \nDemocratic whip to agree to having substantive votes because I think it \nis important to have a substantive vote. As someone who is a cosponsor \nof the amendment, I will assure you, I have no desire to have anything \nbut an up-or-down vote on the amendments that have been talked about \nover here on this side of the aisle.\n  The point I would simply want to make to the Senator from Nevada is, \nNo. 1, this issue has had many hearings. There have been seven hearings \nin congressional committees, four in the Judiciary Committee, ranging \nfrom one that was on September 4 of last year, one on March 3 of this \nyear, one on March 23 of this year, and one on May 13. The first three \nwere in the Judiciary Committee. The Subcommittee on Science, \nTechnology and Space had one on May 13. The Finance Committee\n\n[[Page S7905]]\n\nhad one on May 5. The HELP Committee had one on April 28. And recently, \nthe Judiciary Committee again had one on June 22. So there have been \nseven hearings.\n  This issue has been studied. As a result of the study, there are \npredominantly two different tracks people would like to take here. You \nhave many who are supporting Senator Allard's approach. There is \nanother approach many Members on our side would like to take. All we \nare suggesting is that at least those two ideas be given the \nopportunity to be voted on.\n  I do not think we are going to look for a whole long list of \namendments. My guess is we would be content with one amendment to \nprovide a little different option for Members on both sides of the \naisle to look at, and maybe both sides of the aisle to be supportive \nof. This may be a situation where we have options available that can \nattract bipartisan support. Obviously, Senator Allard's amendment has \nbipartisan support; Senator Miller is on that amendment.\n\n  It sort of bothers me a little bit when I hear the comment made--and \nit has been made over and over, not only here on the floor but by many \npundits--about we have more important things to do. I cannot think of \nanything more important to America than family and marriage. I cannot \nthink of anything more important than the basic social building block \nof our country, and that is what marriage is, that is what the family \nis. And it is in jeopardy. It is in serious, real jeopardy as a result \nof what the courts are doing--certainly in Massachusetts and \npotentially around the country--what mayors are doing, what county \nexecutives are doing, and others who are unlawfully acting. But in the \ncase of Massachusetts, under the color of law, at least, or maybe \nlawfully, if you concede that, they are reinterpreting the Constitution \nto change the definition of marriage.\n  Now, to me, that is a very serious issue. I cannot think of a more \nimportant issue to come before the Senate than to say: What should the \nfuture of our culture look like? I think we need to do that in a way \nthat is thoughtful and that is open to different ideas on how to \naddress this issue, because one person, as well meaning as he may be--\nand I strongly support his amendment--he has one idea, a group of us \nhave an idea. But there are other ideas out there that should be \nconsidered when this very important issue is debated. Why? So we can \nfind the sweet spot, we can find what can build the greatest consensus \nin the Senate to do something to protect an institution which is at the \ncore of who we are as a culture.\n  While I would say, yes, as we say around here, we try to keep the \ntrains running on time and passing appropriations bills, I think the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, who happens to be the \nPresiding Officer at this time, will tell you we are not ready to pass \nall the appropriations bills at this point, that we are still waiting \nfor the House to act and to do things to put us in position to deal \nwith that. There are important issues at hand, but I cannot think of \nanything more important than this issue.\n  So I say to the Senator from Nevada, I would hope he would \nconstructively engage in negotiation with us so we can have a full and \nfair debate, so we can have different alternatives so the Senate can \nwork its will and hopefully try to find some language that will \naccommodate a supermajority of Members. I haven't heard any Member come \ndown here and debate the substance of this issue. I suspect I will not \nhear any Member of the Senate come down here in the next 48 hours or \nlonger and say that marriage should be something other than one man and \none woman. There may be, but so far I have not heard that in the \nSenate.\n\n  Most who are opposing the constitutional amendment do so for a \nvariety of reasons but not because they don't support the definition of \ntraditional marriage. If that is the case, I would think we would want \nto work hard to try to find some way in which to protect this \ninstitution. Everybody admits, even those who are not for this \nconstitutional amendment that has been proposed, that traditional \nmarriage is under assault in the courts. Some would suggest this is an \nissue we just should not deal with. Some would suggest this is too \nheavyhanded a way.\n  Let's bring some people together. Let's bring the debate together. \nLet's see if we can find the language that would address this issue and \nstop what I believe is the death knell of our society, which is the \nultimate breakdown of the traditional family and the meaning of that to \nfuture generations of children.\n  I know the sponsor of the amendment is here. I will yield the floor \nto allow him to speak. If the Senator from Nevada has a comment, I \nwould be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is giving up the floor?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be very brief because I know the \nSenator from Colorado has worked hard on this issue. I always thought \nwe were going to vote on one constitutional amendment. It appears now--\nwe haven't seen the request and I acknowledge neither has the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania but I know the staff is working on a unanimous \nconsent request to present to us--we will be voting on two \nconstitutional amendments. That wasn't what I think any of us \ncontemplated.\n  We will be happy to review in detail any of the proposals that the \nmajority has. We always try to be as fair as we can. I hope we can do \nthat sooner rather than later. We will respond as quickly as we can to \nthe good-faith efforts of the majority, and we will respond in as good \nfaith as we can to their offer.\n  I appreciate the comments of my friend from Pennsylvania. He and I \ndisagree on a number of issues, not as many as some would think. I \nunderstand how seriously he feels about this issue. His heartfelt \nconcern is something that is shared by many people in this body, both \nDemocrats and Republicans. It is an important issue. Therefore, I think \nwe should move to the resolution before the Senate and have an up-or-\ndown vote on it as quickly as possible.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Colorado, who has spent so much time \non this issue, I recognize his deep concern. I apologize to him because \nhe has been here since we started.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to briefly respond. First, I thank \nthe majority leader and the minority leader for working on this issue. \nI think we can get it worked out as to how we should proceed on the \nfloor. This is an important issue this country faces in how we are \ngoing to deal with marriage. It has not been an issue hastily brought \nto the floor of the Senate. There have been hearings for at least \nalmost 10 months now on this very issue.\n  We have had four hearings in the Judiciary Committee and the other \nthree scattered throughout other committees, talking about the impact \non children and what has happened from a socioeconomic change in \ncountries--for example, Scandinavian countries that have recognized \nsame-sex marriage for some time, how that has deteriorated and the fact \nthere are so many children today born out of wedlock in those \ncountries, whereas before that societal change happened where we define \nmarriage, babies born out of wedlock was not such a high number. In \nfact, in the Scandinavian countries now, we have a greater incidence of \nbabies born out of wedlock than are born in wedlock.\n  We have countries, such as the Netherlands, just more recently \naccepting the idea of same-sex marriage which have been recognized \nprior to that as countries that valued the traditional institution of \nmarriage and actually had a very low divorce rate and very low rate as \nfar as children born out of wedlock. But when we look at the \nNetherlands now, we see, with the demeaning of the value of marriage, \nthat there are more and more children being born out of wedlock. That \nis a disturbing trend to many of us.\n  When you go to put together language that goes in the Constitution, \nit is with a lot of consideration and you have to spend a lot of time \nvisiting with a lot of constitutional scholars. I have done that. This \nhas been debated among our Federal colleagues. There are people who \nhave different views, as with any constitutional amendment that has \never been brought to the Senate or before the Congress. There are \nalways different views on that. I can't recall a constitutional \namendment\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\nthat ever came before the Congress when there was not some debate on \nit.\n  When you are asking to bring it to the floor, you have to expect \nthere are going to be some differences of views. The preponderance has \nbeen that those provisions we have in this particular amendment that I \nhave put together and introduced is the right balance because we define \nmarriage as a union between a man and a woman. I don't think there is \nany doubt about that language. It is very straightforward.\n  We have a second sentence in the amendment that says there is a \nlimited role for the courts. In other words, the courts shall not go \nahead and define marriage other than what we have defined here. But we \nrecognize there is a definite role for the States. We allow States to \nmove ahead, through the democrat process, and to deal with issues such \nas civil unions and domestic partnerships and the benefits that may \naccrue with those types of classifications through the legal system.\n  This has been carefully thought out. We have individuals over here \nwho have sort of the Federalist philosophy. I have sort of a Federalist \nphilosophy. I don't want to see the Government messing around in \nState affairs, so we have kept that at a very minimum. All we do is \ndefine marriage at the Federal level. Then we say it is up to the \nStates now to decide how they want to deal with civil unions and \ndomestic partnerships. We needed to do that in order to limit the power \nof the courts.\n\n  This is a constitutional amendment. It deserves a lot of thought and \ndebate. I am very pleased to have a number of cosponsors. The hearings \nhave gone very well. I do wish that in our hearings we had had more \nparticipation from the Democrats. In fact, I can recall a number of \nhearings where nobody showed up from the other side. There were two \nhearings held where there was a lot of participation from the other \nside, but at the other five hearings there wasn't any participation at \nall. So this is an opportunity for people to participate.\n  Anytime you talk about some kind of rule that you are going to put \nforward in the Senate where you limit debate, limit people's ability to \nparticipate, it is always going to be somewhat controversial. I don't \nthink the assistant minority leader should be particularly alarmed at \nthe fact we are having some discussions about how we should move \nforward. The last time I looked, I think there were some four bills \nthat have been blocked from becoming major bills--such as the energy \nbill, for example--from coming to the floor of the Senate because of a \nfilibuster. We have a number, I think about four bills or so that have \npassed the Senate and are not allowed to go anywhere because the other \nside has not appointed conferees. We have had the obstruction going on \nwith the judges.\n  That is well known. I don't need to go over that, what has been \ndebated. We spent a couple of all-nighters in the Senate talking about \nthe obstruction of the judges and how it is important that we fill \nthose positions.\n  My hope is we can move forward and come up with a reasonable rule, \nwhere everybody feels comfortable. That is what we are trying to do on \nthis side. The two meetings that had such good participation were both \nin the Judiciary Committee. At the first one we had, I and a number of \nother individuals had an opportunity to testify in front of the \ncommittee. Another was with Governor Romney from Massachusetts who came \nforth to testify. He pointed out to the committee the complications \nthey have had in their State as a result of this debate, how it needs \nto be clarified, and that he came down in support of defining marriage \nas being between a man and a woman.\n  There were a lot of implications that I think came out of his \ntestimony and needed to be debated and brought out. I hope we will be \nable to have an opportunity--in fact, if nobody does it, I plan on \nputting his testimony in the Record. I thought it was very good \ntestimony.\n  So here we are, and we have before us now, after the initiation of \nthe debate last Friday, this amendment that talks about marriage. \nAgain, I want to make clear that everybody understands the language. It \nsays:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  The second sentence is:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  That language came about after a lot of deliberation, which included \nstaff and members of the Judiciary Committee. Even though it wasn't \nvoted formally out of the committee, there has been a considerable \namount of debate and a lot of scholarly thought about it, and \nconstitutional experts have been approached as far as what would be the \nbest language.\n  I think we need to move forward with the debate. I am looking forward \nto hearing from the other side on this important issue. So far, we have \nhad red herring arguments and them wanting to talk about something else \nother than this amendment and the issues it brings up. I hope we can \nnow settle down and get a good debate from the other side about why \nthey don't think marriage ought to be defined as a union between a man \nand woman, or why they don't think this is a good amendment. So far we \nhave heard argument on procedure and that doesn't get to the meat of \nthe debate.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side to step forward. Let's hear \ntheir views and have this debate on this most important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I was not here on Friday, so I did not \nget a chance to hear a lot of the debate going on. I commend my \ncolleagues. I read some of their statements. I thank them for the high \nlevel of debate that has taken place so far.\n  Whether it was Senator Smith's comments, or Senator Cornyn's \ncomments, or Senator Allard's, and others, they are trying to bring to \nthe debate two fundamental points, which are that every person in \nAmerica, every person in this world, has worth and dignity and we \nshould respect them, irrespective of the choices they make in their \nlives. That is an important concept that I hope we do not stray from in \nthis debate; that this is not a debate about questioning the value or \nworth of an individual or the dignity of an individual or the rights of \nan individual. What this is about is the fundamental importance to our \nsociety of preserving, protecting, and promoting marriage as a union \nbetween one man and one woman.\n  So I hope we can engage in a debate where we can keep both things in \nmind, because sometimes it is thought that if you are for traditional \nmarriage, somehow you are against somebody. That is not how I see it. I \nthink traditional marriage is good for everyone. It results in a \nhealthier society, more stable children.\n  I am going to refer throughout the course of my remarks over the next \ncouple of days to a paper that was presented at Emory University on May \n14, 2003, which I think is one of the best studies I have seen in \nlooking at this issue of marriage. One of the reasons I think it is so \ngood is, No. 1, it responds to all of the allegations or charges made \nagainst those who support traditional marriage. It is authored by two \npeople, one of whom is gay. So you are hearing arguments from someone \nwho you would think normally would agree that traditional marriage \nshould be redefined; in fact, he argues in this paper, quite \neffectively and forcefully, that traditional marriage is important to \nbe maintained--not because he thinks it discriminates against him, but \nbecause it is important for our culture and society.\n  I want to read a few things from the summary of that report just to \ngive people a sense of why this is such an important issue to be \ndebated. In this country, we tend to take marriage for granted, \nthinking that somehow or another it will just happen, that people will \nget together and marry and will have children, whether we have an \ninstitution called marriage or whether that institution of marriage is \nredefined to include a whole host of other different relationships that \nreally won't affect the basic traditional marriage. In other words, \nsome might say, how will my relationship affect me? How will that \naffect your marriage?\n  Well, let me address that because I think this summary does a pretty \ngood job in doing this. The name of the article is ``Marriage Ala Mode; \nAnswering\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\nAdvocates of Gay Marriage,'' by Professor Katherine Young and Paul \nNathanson.\n  The summary begins:\n\n       There's nothing wrong with homosexuality. One of us, in \n     fact, is gay. We oppose gay marriage, not gay relationships.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Most people assume that heterosexuality is a given of \n     nature and thus not vulnerable to cultural change, that \n     nothing will ever discourage straight people from getting \n     together and starting families. But we argue--and this is \n     important--that heterosexual bonding must indeed be \n     deliberately fostered by a distinctive and supportive \n     culture.\n       Because heterosexual bonding is directly related to both \n     reproduction and survival, and because it involves much more \n     than copulation, all human societies have actively fostered \n     it. . . .This is done through culture: rules, customs, laws, \n     symbols, rituals, incentives, rewards, and other public \n     mechanisms. So deeply embedded are these, however, that few \n     people are consciously aware of them.\n       Much of what is accomplished in animals by nature \n     (``biology,'' ``genetics,'' or ``instinct'') must be \n     accomplished in humans by culture (all other aspects of human \n     existence, including marriage). If culture were removed, the \n     result wouldn't be a functioning organism whether human or \n     nonhuman. Apart from any other handicap would be the \n     inability to reproduce successfully. Why? Because mating \n     (sexual intercourse), which really is largely governed by a \n     biological drive, isn't synonymous with the complex behaviors \n     required by family life within a larger human society.\n\n  What are they saying? Will heterosexuals continue to copulate, have \nsexual relations? Sure. Will they build families. Nobody is suggesting \nthat if we get rid of the definition of traditional marriage, there is \ngoing to be a explosion of nontraditional marriage. That is not what \nthey are saying or what I am saying. I suggest that in those countries \nthat have, in fact, adopted whether it is same-sex marriages or civil \nunions, they have not seen a traumatic growth in the number of same-sex \nunions or same-sex marriages. In fact, there have been very few of them \nin the countries that have adopted those laws.\n  But what has happened? There is a gradual and systematic decline in \nheterosexual marriages, not heterosexual unions. People will continue \nto hook up. In fact, that is what occurs more and more in cultures, \neven in this country, where marriage is not held up as something that \nis important. We see it around us. There are cultures and subcultures \nin America where marriage is seen to be an older, passe convention.\n  What happens is there is actually more sexual activity, certainly \namong multiple partners and, what? Breakdown of the family, children \nbeing born out of wedlock, and communities and cultures in decay. That \nis what I see on the horizon for America.\n  It is not the reaffirmation of marriage by including more people in \nit but the degradation of marriage because it becomes simply a social \nconvention without meaning. One may say: What is the big deal? What is \nthe problem if that happens? The problem, if we look at communities in \nAmerica where marriage has broken down, we see communities that are not \nfunctioning very well. We see children who are the most at risk in our \nsociety because moms and dads are not around the home to provide for \nthem. So we have community breakdown, we have family breakdown, and we \nhave government intervention trying to repair this situation.\n  There have been huge government expenditures over the last 40, 50 \nyears trying to repair what is broken as a result of the family not \nbeing there to raise these children.\n  I was a student at Penn State many years ago. I always like to get \nback to my college campus. A few years ago, I went to speak to a group \nof students, the editorial board of the Daily Collegian. The Daily \nCollegian is the college paper. I am not sure that in the 14 years I \nhave been in public life they have ever said anything positive about \nme. Nevertheless, I went to meet with them.\n  We had a very animated discussion, as one tends to have on college \ncampuses with young people with vibrant ideas and a zeal for ideology. \nWe were disagreeing on everything, not surprising. I do not know how it \ncame up--I have been digging my memory banks and I cannot remember \nexactly how it came up--but I asked the question, What do you see as \nthe biggest problem facing America? One young man in the back raised \nhis hand and said: The breakdown of the traditional family. The \nbreakdown of the family.\n  I thought immediately when he said that, first, he must not have been \nengaged in the discussion for the previous half hour, and I thought he \nwould be laughed at and ridiculed by others around the table. What I \nfound was unanimous agreement. One after another of these young folks, \nwho would not be considered traditionalists or conservatives, went on \nabout how the breakdown of the family is sort of at the root of the \ninstability or insecurity they are feeling in their lives and that the \nculture is experiencing at this time. They talked about divorce. They \ntalked about how marriage was not what it used to be.\n  In fact, there was a survey done where they asked kids in the 1970s \nwhether divorce should be harder to get, and about 50 percent of the \nkids said, yes, divorce should be harder to get.\n  They asked a similar group of kids 25 years later, in the late 1990s, \nwhether divorce should be harder to get, and 75 percent of the kids now \nsay divorce should be harder to get. Why? Because they realize the \nimpact of the breakdown of marriage and family.\n  One of the criticisms we hear from those who oppose this \nconstitutional amendment is: Marriage is already in very bad shape. \nDivorce rates are high. Marriage does not work already in America. This \nis no big deal. You cannot really hurt marriage.\n  I make the opposite point. I think it is obvious. They are right, \nmarriage is already in tough shape. Many commentaries have said \nheterosexuals have messed up marriage as bad as they can in this \ncountry and in other countries around the world.\n\n  I make the claim that further deluding and debilitating marriage is \nnot the answer because we know of the dire consequences that a \nbreakdown in marriage results in with respect to children.\n  I make the opposite argument: Yes, I would argue divorce laws should \nbe tougher. I agreed with Louisiana when they put in covenant \nmarriages. I believe the no-fault divorce laws in the 1970s changed the \nessence of marriage, which is about a man and a woman entering into a \nselfless relationship, a union on which they would further give of \nthemselves in the creation of new human life and nurturing that life. \nIt was a selfless act, giving of oneself, giving up things to each \nother. That is how successful marriages work, and that is how \nsuccessful marriages nurture successful children.\n  With no-fault divorce and with the culture that came along with it, \nwe have marriage being about adults, not about children. It is no \nlonger about forming a union for the raising of children in the next \ngeneration. It is about: Am I happy in my marriage? Am I being \nfulfilled? It is less selfless and a little bit more selfish.\n  So if we look at this next generation of marriage, what is that? Is \nit about the selfless or is it about the selfish definition? Is it \nabout children? Certainly a change in the definition of traditional \nmarriage to include people of the same sex is not about children, it is \nabout adults. That further takes us away from the central principal \npurpose of marriage, which is the bonding of a man and a woman for the \npurpose of creating a union by which children for the next generation \nare born. So we continue to get further away from the ideal, and when \nwe do that, children suffer and cultures die.\n  I repeat, I do not know why people come here and insist that somehow \nthis is not important; that somehow this discussion does not rise to \nthe level of a constitutional amendment. That is another real funny \none. I am sure that was discussed on Friday. The Presiding Officer gave \nan absolutely brilliant opening statement on Friday, and I commend him \nfor his wonderful statement. I know he knows what the last \nconstitutional amendment was.\n  I have heard two complaints about constitutional amendments: This \nissue is not important enough to rise to a constitutional amendment. \nThat is No. 1. This is not important enough. No. 2, this limits rights, \nand no other constitutional amendments have limited rights.\n  The last constitutional amendment, the 27th amendment to the \nConstitution, limited pay raises for Members of\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\nCongress. So let's throw out the limiting rights. My rights have been \nlimited as a result of the 27th amendment. As a Member of Congress, we \ncannot pass a pay raise and accept it midterm. Constitutional \namendments have been used to limit rights.\n  No. 2, this does not rise to a level of importance. I do not think in \nthe grand scheme of things whether Members of the House and Senate can \nreceive a pay raise during their term is one of the great pressing \nissues that face our culture and our country. So the idea that the \nConstitution is not used for issues that are not of great weight and do \nnot limit rights is ridiculous.\n  The second point is, I do not believe this limits rights. What this \ndoes is promote a public good. It does not limit rights. It simply \npromotes a public good, and it is the union of a man and a woman for \nthe purpose of forming that union and providing for the next \ngeneration.\n  I suggest this constitutional amendment is necessary and is important \nenough to be debated today. Again, I hope we can come up with some \nagreement that will allow the different points of view as to how we \nsolve this problem, and maybe some other points of view from the other \nside of the aisle as to how we solve this problem.\n  To get to the bottom line of this debate, the bottom line is children \nneed mothers and fathers, and society should be all about that. Society \nshould be all about creating the best possible chance for children to \nhave a mother and a father. Unless the State endorses that, unless our \nlaws enforce that, then I think it is fairly obvious that our culture \nwill not, and that left to our own devices, as these authors say, we \nwill simply not have these unions.\n  In fact, if we look at other countries, Stanley Kurtz has done some \nresearch in countries around the world where this has occurred. In his \narticle, ``Decline in Marriage in Scandinavia and the Netherlands,'' he \ntalks about the reduction in the rate of marriage among heterosexuals. \nHe talks about the increase in the number of children born out of \nwedlock as a result of the institution of a different definition of \nmarriage. So we see in other countries that when marriage is changed, \nit is devalued. It does not become special. It does not become unique. \nIt is not reinforced by society as something as the ideal. As a result, \npeople do not engage it.\n\n  For example, the countries of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway have either \nmarriage or civil unions for same-sex couples. Sixty percent of first-\nborn children in those countries are now born out of wedlock. Now, that \nis equivalent to some of the poorest neighborhoods in our society. \nRemember, I talked earlier about how the breakdown of marriage has \naffected the poorest communities in our society and our culture, and in \nmany of those cultures marriage is not accepted, and as a result the \nGovernment has to come in and bail out those communities because there \nare no unions, there are no families, there is no support network for \nthese children? In middle-class and upper middle-class, socialistic, \nequality-driven Scandinavia, where there are no ghettos of poverty that \nwe see in America, 60 percent of first-born children in these countries \nare born out of wedlock. Why? Because marriage is not important. It has \nno meaning. So people simply do not get married.\n  There is a long laundry list which I will get into in more detail. I \nam trying to make a general overview of some of the arguments, but I \nwill be getting into more detail throughout the next couple of days.\n  Marriage is about children. Marriage is about the glue that holds the \nbasic foundational societal unit together, and that is the family. When \nwe change the composition of that glue, we weaken the bonds of marriage \nand then we weaken the American family.\n  Why a constitutional amendment? I think the Senator from Colorado \nsaid it, and I know others have, too, that if we really believed we \ncould solve this problem short of a constitutional amendment, let me \nassure everyone I would not be on the floor of the Senate today arguing \nthis issue. This is hard. It is hard to come to the Senate floor and \nargue for any constitutional amendment. It is doubly hard to actually \npass one because 67 votes are needed in the Senate, plus three-quarters \nof the States. If we could come up with a legislative solution that \nwould solve the problem that I see of runaway courts, I would be very \nanxious to find it. We tried back in 1996 with the Defense of Marriage \nAct, but just about every legal scholar who has come around has said \nthe Defense of Marriage Act will not stand, from the left to the right, \nand I will get into that in further discussion.\n  I see the Senator from California is in the Chamber, so I am not \ngoing to spend much more time, but the idea that we could pass a \nstatute to constrain the courts from reinterpreting the Constitution I \nbelieve is folly. We cannot. The only way for us to have the American \npeople define what marriage is, instead of State courts defining what \nmarriage is, is through the constitutional amendment process.\n  Some will get up and say, let us leave it to the States, let the \nStates fight this, like Massachusetts is doing, let the States fight \nthis battle. What we are seeing in Massachusetts is the States cannot \nfight this battle. Ultimately, if one looks at the Lawrence v. Texas \ndecision and the full faith and credit clause, there is no question in \nmy mind that the States will be powerless to defend themselves against \nthese runaway judges.\n\n  In essence, the Constitution will be amended. It will either be \namended by a group of State judges who will grab from the language of \nthe Constitution a right for anybody to be married to anybody else or \nthe American people through the process that was established in our \nConstitution, which is a very difficult process.\n  As a citizen, it is rather upsetting to look at the Constitution as a \ndocument and say, well, to create new rights under the Constitution we \nhave to have two-thirds of the Senate, two-thirds of the House and \nthree-quarters of the State legislatures, or four judges in \nMassachusetts. I looked through the Constitution many times and I never \nsaw that four-judges-in-Massachusetts clause, but that is what goes on. \nWe either do it that way or go through this complex process that is \nvery hard. Why? Because constitutional rights are big deals. It is an \nimportant thing. We should not create new rights in our Constitution \nwithout a very deliberative, thoughtful process, and the American \npublic should be engaged in that process. That is what we are about \ntoday. We are about engaging the American people in the thoughtful \nprocess of determining what marriage should be in America.\n  I would argue that those who oppose this process are saying one \nthing: Let the courts do the work that I do not have the courage to \nstand up and fight for myself. Let's be clear about that. Let the \ncourts do the work that I do not have the courage to articulate for \nmyself. Oh, we will all get up and say we are for traditional marriage \nand we like traditional marriage. If my colleagues are for traditional \nmarriage, there is one way to make sure it is maintained. They can say, \nI do not like this idea or I do not like that idea, but there is one \nway to make sure, if they are really for traditional marriage, if they \nreally believe this is an important building block of our society, if \nthey really believe marriage is about the union of one man and one \nwoman for the purpose of the future of our culture, there is one \nguaranteed sure-fire way to make sure that is maintained, and that is \nthrough a constitutional amendment.\n  Now, my colleagues can argue until the cows come home that they do \nnot like this way of doing that, and that is fine, and that there are \nother alternatives to pursue, but if they really care about preserving \none man and one woman in a union called marriage, there is one sure-\nfire way to do it, and that is to vote for a constitutional amendment \nthat does it. Any other excuse is simply that--an excuse to let someone \nelse do their dirty work.\n  I do not hear any of my colleagues who say this is not the way to \namend the Constitution writing letters to the litigants in \nMassachusetts and 11 other States who are suing to change the marriage \nlaws in those States to allow for a redefinition of marriage. Where is \nthe outrage? Where are they writing saying, oh, we do not think that is \nthe way it should be changed, either. We do not hear them criticizing \nthose who want to change traditional marriage and saying do not do \nthis, do not file\n\n[[Page S7909]]\n\nthese lawsuits, do not seek to have these marriages recognized. We hear \nnothing. We just hear, we will just let someone else handle this.\n  All it takes for this change in marriage in America is for well-\nmeaning, good people to moderately, deliberately, simply do nothing--\njust sit back, claim their virtue, claim their belief in one man and \none woman in marriage, and allow someone else to change it, and then \ncome and say, well, it is too late, or we cannot take marriage away; \nthese people are already married. How can we take that right away?\n  If my colleagues believe in their heart, for the betterment of \nAmerica, that marriage must be maintained for the good of the American \nfamily as a union between a man and a woman, there is only one choice, \nand that is to vote yes. Anything short of that is a hollow act, is a \nsmokescreen, to the American people and to their constituents. My \ncolleagues cannot claim to be for something and then vote against it \nand let someone else do the exact opposite of what they say they want, \nand that is what the courts will do. So I plead with my colleagues, who \nI believe have every good intention, to search their souls and to think \nabout the consequences for America.\n  Because other speakers have arrived, I will yield the floor in a \nminute. I know people come with good intentions and I know people do \nnot want to be seen as intolerant, and they do not want to be seen as \nhateful or mean spirited or being against anybody.\n  It is not easy, standing up against this popular culture in which we \nlive. But think about the future of America. Think about the future of \nAmerica without the institution of marriage because that is what we are \ndebating. It is not a matter of redefining marriage. It is simply that \nmarriage will be a social convention which will have no meaning and \ntherefore we will be without it.\n  Think about the future of children in America, where we say they do \nnot deserve a mother and a father and that we are not going to give \nthem the legal force to encourage it and hold it up as the right thing \nto do.\n  Look in the faces of those children and say: You just were not \nimportant enough for us to stand against what is very unpopular in the \nculture of today. I daresay, this debate, this vote, this issue will be \nread in history books in America--I hope in America--years from now as \nthat turning point. I hope my colleagues are on the right side of \nhistory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to make an argument directly \ncontrary to the arguments just presented by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania. I do not consider myself an expert on marriage. I \nhave been married for a long time. I have one daughter, three \nstepdaughters, and five grandchildren. I celebrate marriage. I \nunderstand the difficulties in working to keep it together. But I \nbelieve this is a waste of time.\n  The votes are not present to submit this amendment to the States. The \ntiming is just a few months before an election, and family law has \nalways been relegated to the States. This essentially would be the \nfirst departure from that.\n  My argument today is based on my understanding of the law. My \nunderstanding of what is happening in the States indicates to me that \nthe States are well able to handle the issue of marriage on their own. \nThe tenth amendment of the U.S. Constitution clearly states:\n\n       The powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n\n  Marriage is not once mentioned in the Constitution. Most authorities \nbelieve it to be a power reserved to the States.\n  As early as 1890, that is 114 years ago, in In Re Burrus, the United \nStates Supreme Court, in a child custody dispute, stated:\n\n       The whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and \n     wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the states, \n     and not to the laws of the United States.\n\n  Later, in a 1979 Supreme Court decision, Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, \nthe Court stated in dicta:\n\n       Insofar as marriage is within temporal control, the States \n     lay on the guiding hand.\n\n  Furthermore, the courts have long held that no State can be forced to \nrecognize a marriage that offends a deeply held public policy of that \nState. States, as a result, have frequently and constitutionally \nrefused to recognize marriages from other States that differ from their \npublic policy. Polygamous marriages, for example, even if sanctioned by \nanother State, have consistently been rejected. Marriages between \nimmediate family members have also been rejected by States, even if \nthose marriages are accepted in other parts of the country. In no case \nthat I know of has the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. \nConstitution been used to require a State to recognize a type of \nmarriage that would violate its own strong public policy. So States \nhave been on their own with respect to family law, including marriage.\n\n  Even as we consider the Federal Marriage Amendment, we see that the \nStates are taking their right and powers as they relate to family law \nand marriage very seriously. Thirty-three States have passed their own \nDefense of Marriage Acts, banning same-sex marriages, and five have \npassed ballot initiatives banning same-sex marriages.\n  My own State, California, passed a Defense of Marriage Act in the \nyear 2000. Proposition 22 was ratified by an overwhelming majority of \nCalifornians, 61 percent. The California Family Code now states that:\n\n       Only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or \n     recognized in California.\n\n  That is the law of my State. That policy statement trumps all local \nand other law.\n  Earlier this year, the mayor of my city, Gavin Newsom, of San \nFrancisco, decided this law was unconstitutional and ordered the county \nclerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. These actions did \nnot go unnoticed, and the California State Supreme Court subsequently \nenjoined the county clerk from issuing any further marriage licenses, \nand the county complied. Oral arguments were heard on the cases on May \n25, and the State Supreme Court will issue its decision within 90 days.\n  However, I want to make clear, crystal clear, that the Court is not \ndeciding on the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which said that \nmarriage shall be between a man and a woman. Rather, the Court issued \norders to show cause in Lewis v. Alfaro and Lockyer v. City and County \nof San Francisco, limited to the following issue: Were the officials of \nthe city and county of San Francisco exceeding or acting outside the \nscope of their authority in refusing to enforce the provisions of \nFamily Code sections 300, 301, 308.5, and 355 in the absence of a \njudicial determination that those statutory provisions are \nunconstitutional? In other words, acting in defiance of the statewide \nreferendum?\n  The orders to show cause are specifically limited to this legal \nquestion, and they do not include the substantive constitutional \nchallenge to the California marriage statutes themselves. The marriage \nstatute, therefore, is not in jeopardy of being overturned.\n  When we look around, we see that California is not the only State \nwhere people are speaking out about same-sex marriage. In fact, a \nlively debate is taking place throughout the country.\n  On July 6, the Washington Times ran an article entitled, ``Marriage \nGets a Boost in Michigan.'' The article notes that the supporters of \ntraditional marriage in Michigan recently turned in approximately \n475,000 signatures to put a State constitutional amendment before the \nvoters this November. An organizer of the effort was quoted to say:\n\n       The people responded. . . . They're tired of politicians \n     and activist judges making changes without having a voice. \n     This gives them a voice.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Michigan's achievement marks a four-for-four victory for \n     those who want marriage amendments on the November ballot.\n\n  Montana, Oregon and Arkansas will place similar measures on their \nballots this November. Mr. President, your own State will have one on \nthe ballot. North Dakota and Ohio are collecting signatures necessary \nfor ballot measures.\n  As you can see, the States have taken up the just powers accorded to\n\n[[Page S7910]]\n\nthem by the Constitution of the United States and are responding to \nthis issue, and that is as it should be.\n  The Family Research Council reported in a press release on July 9:\n\n       [A]n unprecedented nine States already have State \n     constitutional amendments on the ballot this fall and that \n     number is expected to increase to at least 14 States. Thirty-\n     eight States have previously gone on record stating marriage \n     is between one man and one woman. The people are making their \n     voices heard in their States but unfortunately that is not \n     enough.\n\n  Yet in the words of the Family Research Council, these actions by \nStates are ``unprecedented'' and show that a process is, indeed, taking \nplace throughout the country and that the people are active \nparticipants. Through that process, the people do have a voice and they \nare being heard. I believe interference from Washington in this \npolitical process is premature, unnecessary, and not in the context of \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  In light of this, it appears that proponents of the Federal Marriage \nAmendment disregard the debate occurring in the States and point only \nto Massachusetts and the fact that marriage licenses are being issued \nlegally to same-sex couples there. They argue that the same-sex \nmarriages in Massachusetts, the first State to allow such marriages, \nare what is driving the need to enshrine in the Constitution language \nthat marriage is between a man and a woman. I disagree.\n  Even in Massachusetts, the State legislature has begun work on a \nState constitutional amendment to bar same-sex marriages but allow \ncivil unions. This amendment is certainly not guaranteed to pass, but \nit is clear that the people of Massachusetts are dealing themselves \nwith the issue as was intended and, again, it would seem without the \nneed of assistance from Washington.\n  Because several dozen States have already passed a prohibition on \nsame-sex marriage, it seems clear that in those States an argument \ncould be made that strong public policy would lead to a refusal to \nrecognize out-of-State same-sex marriages.\n  So it is not a problem demanding an immediate solution. There is a \nprocess taking place in the States throughout the country as was \nenvisioned by the Constitution. For us to act now is not only premature \nbut it isn't going to work because the votes are not here.\n  So why are we doing this? Why are we doing this when we have only \npassed one appropriations bill? Why are we doing this when last week we \njust had a briefing on the impact of terrorism on this Nation and we \nhaven't passed a Homeland Security bill? Why are we doing this when the \nConstitution has reserved family law to the States and when States by \nthe dozens have already taken up the issue and passed, either by \nlegislature or by vote of the people, marriage amendments? Why are we \ndoing this?\n  The only answer I can come up with is because this is political. It \nis to drive a division into the voters of America, into the people of \nAmerica, one more wedge issue at a very difficult time to be used \npolitically in elections. Everybody in this body knows they are nowhere \nclose to 67 votes. If there were a motion to proceed, there might not \neven be enough votes for a motion to proceed.\n\n  Why are we doing this? Why are we stirring up the Nation? I probably \nhave 53,000 pieces of mail on this subject alone. People do not \nunderstand that the Constitution relegates family law to the States, \nand has relegated the issue of adoption, marriages, and everything \nhaving to do with family law to the States.\n  My daughter happens to be the supervising judge of the family court \nin San Francisco. You can talk to any judge and see just that. The \nStates have responded. It is not as if the States have ignored those \nissues. More than 36 States--more than three dozen States--have passed \nlegislation, and 8 are moving shortly.\n  For the life of me, I don't understand what honest motive there is in \nputting this in front of this body to philosophically debate marriage \non a constitutional amendment that is not going to happen, and which is \nenormously divisive in all of our communities.\n  I hope my colleagues will exercise prudence and tread carefully with \nour Constitution. I don't think we want to put out an amendment--I \ndon't think we can, but let us say with some change and there were 67 \nvotes, as the Senator from Pennsylvania correctly said, it then has to \ngo to a vote of three-quarters of the State legislatures. When three-\nquarters of the States have already taken action, why would they ratify \nthis? I think it is a useless exercise.\n  I have been on the Judiciary Committee long enough now to be able to \ntake an issue and see if it is properly before us. I don't believe a \nconstitutional amendment reserving the right of marriage to a man and a \nwoman is properly before us because I believe that is an area clearly \nrelegated to the States, and the States are exercising that right.\n  Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been watching this debate and there \nhasn't been much from the other side, but I commend the distinguished \nSenator from California for at least coming to the floor and expressing \nher viewpoints on this. As you know, she is a very important member of \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, and I enjoy working with her. I also \nunderstand her arguments that the States ought to decide these issues. \nBut more preferably interpreted, if she likes the status quo that means \nthe State courts must decide these issues and not the people of the \nStates or the State legislatures. Frankly, I agree that the States \nshould be able to decide these types of issues. The powers should not \nbe taken away from them and given to the courts.\n  In fact, 40 States have decided this issue in the Defense of Marriage \nAct, called DOMA. You would think that would be enough. I believe the \nother 10 States will adopt the Defense of Marriage Act over time which \nprovides a marriage should be between a man and a woman.\n  If my colleagues believe that the States ought to decide these \nmatters, then they have to acknowledge that the 40 States which have \nshould trump the 4-to-3 decision by an activist Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt.\n  The debate over marriage boils down to two fundamental questions: \nShould our goal be to keep marriage limited to a man and a woman? And, \nif so, is amending the U.S. Constitution necessary to accomplish that \ngoal?\n  The answer to both questions is yes.\n  The first question, whether we should keep marriage between a man and \na woman, can be examined in several ways. First, we can look at \ndifferent kinds of polls. In the last few months, polls by reputable \nnews organizations such as CBS News, FOX News/Opinion Dynamics, \nNewsweek, Time/CNN show that by at least 2 to 1 Americans would not \nredefine marriage. Not only is this polling overwhelming, but it exists \nin the face of a barrage by the liberal media urging a different answer \nto this question. These polls tell something about the opinions of \nindividual Americans, again, that flies in the face of having four \njustices in Massachusetts decide under the full faith and credit clause \nto impose this upon everybody in America rather than have the people in \nAmerica or the people within the individual States decide these \nmatters. These polls tell something about the opinions of individual \nAmericans.\n\n  Another kind of poll examines what the elected representatives of the \nAmerican people do on their behalf. Two years ago, the Supreme Court \nrepeated its long-held guidance that ``the clearest and most reliable \nobjective evidence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by \nthe country's legislatures.'' That evidence confirms the same \nconclusion: The American people oppose redefining traditional marriage.\n  In 1996, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Defense of Marriage Act. \nAs I mentioned, 40 States have adopted it and President Clinton, a \nDemocratic President, signed it into law. As its name implies, this \nlegislation was intended to defend what marriage has always been, a \nunion between a man and a woman.\n  Since 1996, the citizens and legislatures in nearly every State in \nthe Union have taken one or more steps to further protect traditional \nmarriage. Again this year, citizens in several more States have \ncollected hundreds of thousands of signatures to put before voters \nState constitutional protection for traditional marriage.\n\n[[Page S7911]]\n\n  Speaking of signatures, last Friday, some of my colleagues received \nnearly 1.5 million petitions from Americans to protect traditional \nmarriage and more are on the way.\n  This issue is not going to go away. Whether traditional marriage \nshould remain what it always has been, the goal most Americans support, \nrequires amending the U.S. Constitution. If the answer is yes, no one \nshould be able to get away with professing support for traditional \nmarriage but refusing to do what is necessary to make it real. Some \nhave indeed tried to have it both ways, saying they want to keep \nmarriage between a man and a woman but refusing to take any real steps \nto do so.\n  Last Friday, for example, I pointed out how Senator Kerry, the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, has publicly said marriage \nshould be between a man and a woman, yet voted against the Defense of \nMarriage Act which would allow that to occur. I pointed out he said \nthere is no reason to vote for the Defense of Marriage Act because the \nStates have enacted contrary to it. His own State, since then, has.\n  Does that mean he would vote for a new Defense of Marriage Act or \ndoes it mean that he would vote for the only thing that can possibly \nchange the situation, and that is a constitutional amendment? He has \nindicated he will not.\n  Members cannot have it both ways. Members cannot vote against DOMA, \nargue it is unconstitutional, and now say that a constitutional \namendment is not necessary because DOMA won't protect us. This is \nexactly what the junior Senator from Massachusetts is doing.\n  Look at this chart, ``But isn't DOMA unconstitutional?''\n  Senator Kerry said in the Advocate, September 3, 1996:\n\n       DOMA does violence to the spirit and letter of the \n     Constitution.\n\n  In other words, it is unconstitutional, he said in 1996.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nin his remarks on the floor of the Senate September 10, 1996, said:\n\n       Scholarly opinion is clear: [DOMA] is plainly \n     constitutional.\n\n  Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, a heralded liberal \nprofessor, for whom I personally have high regard and consider a \nfriend, in a letter submitted to the record of Senate proceedings on \nJune 6, 1996, said:\n\n       My conclusion is unequivocal: Congress possesses no power \n     under any provision of the Constitution to legislate--\n\n  As it does in DOMA--\n\n     any such categorical exemption for the Full Faith and Credit \n     Clause of Article IV.\n\n  And the ACLU, in February of 1997, said:\n\n       DOMA is bad constitutional law . . . An unmistakable \n     violation of the Constitution.\n\n  These are leading liberals who do not think DOMA or the Defense of \nMarriage Act was constitutional, yet today argue against the only way \nto resolve this matter. Oddly enough, most all of them are saying the \nStates ought to decide these matters.\n  I agree. If we pass a constitutional amendment, it will be up to the \nStates whether or not that constitutional amendment will be ratified, \nand three-quarters of the States will have to ratify it in order for it \nto be ratified. I might add, that means the people themselves will have \nto be very much involved in it throughout the country, unlike having \nfour judges in Massachusetts decide this issue for all of America. Once \nthey decided that Massachusetts law, then under article IV of the \nConstitution, the full faith and credit clause, every State in the \nUnion must recognize those Massachusetts marriages, which would upset \nthe domestic relation laws of 49 other States.\n  Let's face it, one of the reasons so many of my friends across the \naisle will argue strenuously this week that the time is not ripe for \nconsideration of this issue on the Senate floor, or that the Senate has \nmuch more important things to do, is because they wish to avoid getting \ncrosswise with the tens of millions of Americans who support \ntraditional marriage. It is more than tens of millions, it is hundreds \nof millions of Americans who support traditional marriage. Yet, also, \nthey do not want to offend their many supporters who wish to allow \nthese novel, nontraditional, same-gender marriages.\n  I cannot blame them for feeling that way, but sometimes you have to \nmake decisions in this body that make sense and that are right, that \nare moral decisions. There is nothing more important than marriage and \ntraditional family marriage at that. Sustaining traditional marriage is \nabsolutely critical to our country. I don't care how important \neconomics or any other issue is, this is one of the most important \nissues in the minds of most Americans, and it should be because our \nmoral climate depends on what we do here.\n  For my friends on the other side, their politically expedient \nsolution is this: As quietly as possible, vote against the marriage \namendment today and leave it up to the court to reinterpret the \nConstitution tomorrow. That sounds pretty good. Why don't we just leave \nit up to the courts? We have had a lot of 5-to-4 decisions in the \nSupreme Court. This was a 4-to-3 decision in a State supreme court that \nwill bind all of America. That is what they want. They want the courts \nto do that which they could never get through the elected \nrepresentatives of the people as evidenced by both the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts, who is running for President and his Vice \nPresidential nominee who is from North Carolina, who is also running. \nThey both believe traditional marriage ought to be maintained, but they \ndo not believe we should do anything about it if it is not. I hope we \ncan change their minds.\n\n  The real question is whether protecting traditional marriage requires \namending the Constitution. As Senator Smith, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon, said in the Senate last Friday, it would be better if the \nanswer were no. Polls suggest that many Americans would prefer their \nelected representatives be able to legislate in this area. That, \nindeed, is the way it was traditionally done.\n  In polling, as in life, however, the devil is in the details. A CBS \nNews/New York Times poll in March asked whether laws should be \ndetermined by the ``Federal Government or by each State government.'' \nThis sounds as if the choice is between the Federal or State \nlegislatures. That, however, is not the choice and never has been. The \nchoice today is between the judiciary and the legislature. But the \npolls never asked about that. In other words, polls are polls are \npolls, depending on how the question is raised.\n  The fact is, the judiciary is deciding for all of America, and an \nobscure supreme court in Massachusetts, at that is deciding this issue \nfor all of America. So the States really do not have a chance to decide \nthis issue on their own because if the supreme court of the State of \nMassachusetts, if that ruling is continuously upheld, and it appears it \nwill be, even by the Supreme Court under the Lawrence case, then every \nState in the Union is going to be bound by those marriages.\n  Another poll taken at the same time--this one by ABC News and the \nWashington Post--asked whether Americans would support amending the \nU.S. Constitution ``or should each state make its own laws''--another \nfalse choice. Activist judges are rapidly making it impossible for \nStates to make their own laws regarding marriage, making a \nconstitutional amendment the only option, if we want to preserve \ntraditional marriage.\n  The polls never ask about that. These highly misleading polls make \none wonder whether the liberal media outlets conducting them have some \nkind of agenda here. No. I know that is being skeptical, but I think \nalmost anybody with brains would conclude they do have an objective \nhere.\n  Does protecting traditional marriage require amending the U.S. \nConstitution? The best prescription depends on an accurate diagnosis. \nSimply put, when an issue such as this one that traditionally was \ndecided by State legislatures is redefined by judges in constitutional \nterms, the only effective option is amending the Constitution.\n  The judiciary has been flexing its cultural muscles for decades, \nimposing its own values upon the American people, supposedly in the \nname of the Constitution. There can be no doubt that traditional \nmarriage is in the path of what Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, \nin 1992, called the judiciary's ``social engineering bulldozer.''\n  That same year, the Supreme Court invented a constitutional right to \ndefine ``one's own concept of existence, of\n\n[[Page S7912]]\n\nmeaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.''\n  Four years later, the Court said resistance to making public policies \nmore favorable to homosexuals ``seems inexplicable by anything but \nanimus.''\n  Last year, the Court combined these ideas to take away from State \nlegislatures the ability to prohibit certain kinds of sexual practices. \nThe Lawrence v. Texas case in 2003: these are some quotes directly out \nof that case. Justice Antonin Scalia, who dissented in that case, said:\n\n       Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional \n     law that has permitted a distinction to be made between \n     heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal \n     recognition in marriage is concerned . . .\n       If moral disapprobation of homosexual conduct is ``no \n     legitimate state interest'' for purposes of proscribing that \n     conduct. . . .what justification could there possibly be for \n     denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples \n     exercising ``[t]he liberty protected by the Constitution?''\n  I might add, also in the Lawrence case, Justice Kennedy argued that:\n\n       The present case . . . does not involve whether the \n     government must give formal recognition to any relationship \n     that homosexual persons seek to enter.\n\n  Justice Scalia understood, however, that\n\n       This case ``does not involve'' the issue of homosexual \n     marriage, only if one entertains the belief that principle \n     and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this \n     Court.\n\n  Justice Scalia said the Lawrence decision:\n\n       ``leaves on pretty shaky grounds state laws limiting \n     marriage to opposite-sex couples.''\n\n  If that is so, and he is right--and he certainly has been proven \nright so far--then the argument of the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia really does not hold any water because the States are going \nto be overruled, 40 of them at least, and I believe all 50 in the end. \nIf we do not do something about it, they are going to be overruled in \ntheir desire to keep traditional marriage alive.\n\n  Now, Evan Wolfson, the director of Freedom to Marry, said this:\n\n       But when [Scalia's] right, he's right. We stand today on \n     the threshold of winning the freedom to marry.\n\n  Finally, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts applied all of \nthis by inventing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. That was \nnot a legislature. That was not the people speaking. In fact, it was \nnot even a unanimous court speaking. It was a 4-to-3 decision by four \nof the most liberal State justices in the country versus three very \nliberal justices in the country. It was a hard-fought decision. It was \nhardly the will of the people being met.\n  It is almost ludicrous to come here and say the will of the people \nshould be met here. If that is true, then we ought to give them that \nchance with a constitutional amendment which will be submitted to the \nwill of the people out there. Everybody in America who can vote will \nhave a right to vote for or against this constitutional amendment. We \nought to at least give them that chance.\n  Well, as I say, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts applied \nall this by inventing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. Step \nby step, by recasting these cultural questions in constitutional terms, \nthe courts took them away from the American people and their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  Now, that flies in the face of what we have heard from those on the \nother side of this issue: Let the States take care of this. Give me a \nbreak. Four liberal justices versus three liberal justices have said \nthis is going to be applied to all of America, because it applies as \nlaw in Massachusetts, and under the full faith and credit clause that \nlaw must be recognized in every State in the Union.\n  Well, these were not a bunch of random, coincidental legal events. \nThese falling dominoes were part of the very same strategy that today \nis targeting State and Federal laws protecting traditional marriage.\n  Last Friday, I outlined the five current fronts in the legal war to \nredefine marriage. There may be more on the way. Politically driven \nlawyers are nothing if not creative. This is why nearly all legal \nanalysts and scholars, either grudgingly or enthusiastically, conclude \nthat the ability of legislatures to make real decisions in this area \nmay already be a thing of the past. In other words, the people's \nright--the people's right--to make real decisions in this area may be a \nthing of the past. Why not just let these four liberal justices against \nthree liberal justices make this decision for everybody?\n  This is why a constitutional amendment to preserve traditional \nmarriage is the only effective solution, and why this is not premature. \nIt might have been premature if the Supreme Court's ``cultural \nbulldozer'' were still idling. It might have been premature if the \nSupreme Court had not embraced the insulting and false conclusion that \ntraditional views on certain cultural questions are nothing but \nirrational animus. It might have been premature if the Supreme Court \nhad not created a constitutional right to sexual autonomy. It might \nhave been premature were there not already dozens of lawsuits \nchallenging laws protecting both State and Federal laws protecting \ntraditional marriage.\n\n  But these things have already happened, and more aggressive legal \nassaults are coming. The judiciary's ``cultural bulldozer'' is in gear, \non the move, and has already done too much damage. If anything, we are \nbehind the curve, not ahead of it.\n  Some call this election year politics. Well, I suppose any measure \nconsidered by a political institution can be called politics. Yes, this \nis an election year. This is merely a cliche substituting for an \nargument. Those who use it perhaps have no real argument, and so they \nuse this cliche to imply that we would not be trying to defend \ntraditional marriage if this were 2003 or 2005. Simply saying that \ndemonstrates how absurd that argument is.\n  Supporters of traditional marriage, that is to say, the large \nmajority of the American people--that is the people out there in the \nStates who they are calling upon to make these decisions but are having \nit taken away from them by a four-liberal-justice to three-liberal-\njustice decision in Massachusetts--have not dictated the timetable \nhere. The minority who want to redefine marriage have done that. They \nbrought the lawsuits that took these issues from the American people.\n  Since the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts had used the State \nconstitution to redefine marriage, amending the State constitution is \nthe only way to protect it. Yet the court gave the legislatures just 6 \nmonths to do what it knew in Massachusetts takes 3 years to do under \ntheir constitutional form of government. This issue is already out of \nthe people's hands.\n  As Senator Smith said on this floor last week, words have meaning. \nActivists, with the help of judges, are seeking to change the meaning \nof the word ``marriage'' to further their political agenda. The \nproponents of the marriage amendment are saying: Stop. We want to \nretain the word ``marriage'' to its real meaning of a male and female \nunion, and it is inescapable that amending the U.S. Constitution is the \nonly way to accomplish that goal.\n  Think about it. I don't have any desire to discriminate against \nanybody, let alone homosexuals in our society or gay people. I know the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon feels exactly the way I do about it. \nI have been the author of the three AIDS bills along with Senator \nKennedy. We fought those through here on this floor against what were \noverwhelming odds at the time and passed them overwhelmingly because of \nthe arguments we made. It is no secret that along with Senators Smith, \nFeinstein, Kennedy, and others, I am the author of a hate crimes \nstatute that I believe would do justice in our society while still \npreserving capital punishment. But it is a long way from where we have \nbeen.\n  There is no question that I do not believe in discriminating against \ngays. But like my friends on this side who have always argued, \nparticularly my friend from Oregon, I draw the line, as do he and \nothers, when it comes to traditional marriage. I believe it is the \nbasic fabric of our country. Traditional marriage means children. It \nmeans raising children born to that marriage. I believe gay people \nought to be able to do whatever they believe they should in the privacy \nof their own homes, but I don't think they should have the right to \nredefine traditional marriage.\n  We have had traditional marriage in this world for over 5,000 years. \nThis is not some itty-bitty, inconsequential, off-the-subject debate. \nThis is one of the most important debates in history.\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\nBecause if we don't stand up for traditional marriage at a time when a \nlot of things seem to be falling apart, we are going to reap the \nwhirlwind.\n  This is an age where any child can bring up pornography on the \nInternet. At one time if you clicked on Harry Potter, you would get \npornography geared to those children. We all know that. Click on almost \nany children's book or subject or title or person mentioned in a \nchildren's book and you get pornography for children. I don't need to \ngo through all the other ills of our society to let everybody know that \nwe are living in a world where there is a lot of filth, a lot of \ndegradation. We have to stand up against it. We have to protect the \ntraditions that do make sense in our society, and traditional marriage \nis at the top of the list.\n  We might differ on some other matters, but it is difficult for me to \nsee how anybody could differ on traditional marriage, even though I \nknow my gay friends do. Does that justify the laws in some, if not all, \nStates that prohibit a gay partner from being able to go into an \nintensive care unit and care for his or her gay partner? That doesn't \njustify that. I think that is terrible, that our laws do not take care \nof that. Does it mean a gay person can't benefit from the laws of \nestates and trusts? I believe under current laws they can, but if they \ncan't, we ought to correct those laws. Does it mean they can't buy \ninsurance for their gay partner? We ought to make it possible that they \ncan. You could go through various things where there are inequities, \nbut we don't solve those inequities by changing a 5,000-plus-year \ndefinition of traditional marriage. We should solve those problems, and \nI am willing to work on these problems with my liberal counterparts on \nthe other side and conservatives as well, I am willing to work and try \nto resolve the problems. But I simply draw the line when it comes to \ntraditional marriage.\n  Gay people have a right to be free, to not be discriminated against. \nThey have a right to live in their relationships within the privacy of \ntheir own homes, just like others who have different approaches toward \nlife. But that doesn't give them or anybody else the right to define \ntraditional marriage.\n\n  I come from a culture where at one time polygamy was a religious \nbelief and was practiced by a small percentage of people in my faith. \nMy great-grandfather was one of the great colonists, one of the great \npioneers of the West. Jeremiah Hatch had 3 wives and 30 children. Those \nwere the days when they lived this principle because they believed it \nto be a spiritual principle. They believed it was important to bring as \nmany children into the world as they could, among other things. They \nbelieved it was a spiritual principle of the faith. But when Reynolds \nv. Simms came down, the Supreme Court case not allowing plural \nmarriage, basically my faith did away with plural marriage. I have to \nsay no one would argue that it should ever come back. Just to make the \npoint, I would never argue that it should come back. I have been \noffended by some people indicating that there might be some argument \nfor it.\n  What is important here is that all we are asking in this amendment \nis, sentence one:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  That is 5,000 years of practice throughout the world.\n  And the second sentence says:\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  That does not say you cannot have civil unions because if a State \ndetermines that is what they should do, then the State can determine \nthat. If you want to leave it up to the States, this is the way to do \nit. Not only would 38 States have to ratify this amendment--and I \nbelieve all 50 would--but they would also have the right, if they so \nchoose, to resolve these problems I have been mentioning here that are \nproblems for gay people that ought to be resolved.\n  The important thing is that if we are going to leave it up to the \npeople, this is the way to do it. It is the only way to do it. \nOtherwise we are leaving it up to four liberal justices in \nMassachusetts versus three liberal justices in Massachusetts who didn't \nagree with them and who basically opted for traditional marriage or at \nleast who seemed to opt for traditional marriage.\n  There is a vast movement beginning in America in every State \nlegislature to amend their constitutions to prohibit or should I say to \nreaffirm the respective State's belief in traditional marriage. \nAssuming that most States will do this--and I believe most will--would \nthose State constitutions be upheld under the Lawrence case or under \nany future cases? There is a real question whether that may be the \ncase.\n  The best way to allow the people to decide this is to have a \nconstitutional amendment so that they really have a say in what goes \non. I can live with whatever the people decide to do. But doing it this \nway, by allowing a 4-to-3 vote in Massachusetts to bind every State in \nthe Union to Massachusetts marriages through the full faith and credit \nclause, seems to me to be something that flies in the face of 5,000 \nyears of traditional marriage and family life.\n  I notice the distinguished Senator from Kentucky here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for yielding. I rise \nto discuss probably the most important issue this body or I have ever \ndebated on the floor of the Senate since I have been a member, 6 years.\n  Our Nation faces a potential disaster. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate realize we have a responsibility to affirm the ideal of marriage \nand protect one of the most basic building blocks of our society: the \nfamily.\n  The first thing we have to understand is that Government did not \ncreate marriage or the union between man and woman. It is something \nmuch more fundamental than legislation or laws. Marriage is older than \nthe Constitution of the United States. It is older than America. \nMarriage exists in every known human society, bringing men and women \ntogether to create and to provide for the next generation of society, \nand it is not the right of any government anywhere to undermine or \ndestroy it. It is a shame that some of my colleagues in the Senate do \nnot recognize the pressing need before us to safeguard a cultural \ninstitution that has served human beings so well for thousands of \ngenerations. We must act before it is too late.\n  In America today, we are facing a depressing situation, where \nunelected officials are attempting, because of their own arrogance, to \nredefine marriage. I do not know the reason why these judges believe \nthey are so wise and how they cannot see the dangerous consequences of \ntheir actions. But they now threaten our way of life. It is up to us to \nact to ensure that the American people have the opportunity to decide \nwhat is right for the society in which they live.\n  Marriage matters to our society. Mothers and fathers both matter to \nchildren. Only a man and a woman have the ability to create children. \nIt is the law of nature. No matter how much some might not like it or \nwant to change it or push for technology to replace it, this law is \nirrefutable. It is upon this law that so much of our society and our \ncultural institutions are based--families, communities, work, schools.\n  When the families suffer, when they are undermined, we all suffer. We \nknow that weak families lead to more poverty, welfare dependence, child \nabuse, substance abuse, illness, educational failure, and even criminal \nbehavior. Failing to protect marriage will send the message to the next \ngeneration that we do not care about them and that we have thrown away \na cultural institution that has served human beings throughout recorded \nhistory.\n  Traditional marriage has been central to the understanding of family \nin Western culture from the very beginning, and the central reason for \nmarriage has been for the rearing of children. Children have the best \nchance to succeed when they are reared in stable, traditional families. \nA loving family provides the foundation children need to succeed, and \nstrong families with a man and a woman bonded together for life always \nhave been and always will be the key to such families.\n  Eight years ago, Congress tried to protect marriage by passing the \nDefense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as the legal union \nbetween\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\none man and one woman as husband and wife. As a member at that time of \nthe U.S. House of Representatives, I was proud to support that \nlegislation. But since then, activist judges and some local \nofficials have aggressively tried to circumvent the law and the will of \nthe people in redefining marriage. These extremists have devised a \nclever strategy to override public opinion and force a redefinition of \nmarriage on the Nation through the court system. Because they knew they \ncould not make their case through elected legislatures, they decided to \nwork through unaccountable officials in hand-picked areas of this \ncountry.\n\n  The liberals' effort started in Vermont when the State supreme court \nordered the State legislature to legalize same-sex marriages or create \nsame-sex civil unions. Then they moved to Massachusetts, where the \nsupreme court forced the State to give full marriage licenses to same-\nsex couples. This happened even though the citizens of Massachusetts \nopposed the effort and no law had been passed to authorize it. \nNevertheless, in Massachusetts, same-sex marriages became a reality.\n  The activists will not stop trying to impose their extreme views on \nall of the rest of us, and they have now plotted a State-by-State \nstrategy to increase the number of judicial decisions redefining \nmarriage without--I say without--the voice of the people being heard.\n  Under our Constitution, States are required to give full faith and \ncredit to the laws of other States. While the Federal Defense of \nMarriage Act was once thought to be enough protection for States that \ndid not want to allow same-sex marriages, it now is very clear that the \nliberals who have no respect for the law are pushing a strategy to \ncompletely undermine the Defense of Marriage Act. Now the only recourse \nleft to those of us who want to follow the law and to defend our \ncultural institutions is to amend the U.S. Constitution.\n  I wish this were not the case. But States are profoundly threatened \nby these activist court decisions, and we have been backed into a \ncorner. In the meantime, couples from all over the country have \ntraveled to those States with same-sex marriages to receive their \nlicenses and plan to return to their home States.\n  At least 42 States have statutes that define marriage as a union of a \nman and a woman, but because of the acts of a few extremists, all of \nthese laws are threatened. In fact, at least 10 States currently face \ncourt challenges to their marriage laws, and 9 States, including my \nown, Kentucky, expect to have a constitutional amendment on the ballot \nthis fall in efforts to protect traditional marriage. So we are facing \na situation where our Constitution and our laws are going to be amended \none way or the other--by the people's representatives or by unelected \njudges.\n  Those of us who defend traditional marriage were not looking for this \nstruggle, but it has been forced upon us, and I feel we must do what we \ncan to prevail. We believe there is little else left more important to \nour Nation and to our future. When a small handful of unelected \nactivists take it upon themselves to rewrite laws and to try to \noverturn cultural institutions we have always relied upon, then we must \nuse every tool at our disposal to defend what we believe is right.\n  I do not take amending the Constitution of the United States lightly. \nNone of us in this body does. However, the only way to prevent this \nsocial misjudgment from being made by the courts is to allow the people \nto speak on the issue through a constitutional amendment process. It is \nthe most democratic, grassroots, political mechanism available left to \nlet the people speak. The people are the ones who live under the law. \nThey should be able to decide if they want to make such a fundamental \nand drastic change.\n  I hear from constituents of the Commonwealth of Kentucky every day \nasking me, begging me, to support the Federal marriage amendment so \nthey can be heard. In fact, I hear more about this than probably any \nother issue since I was elected to office. It is that important to that \nmany people. And because it is such a critical issue--traditional \nmarriage--any attempt to change something so fundamental should be \nultimately left to all of the people and not a select few to decide.\n  We must act, and we must act now. I urge my colleagues to let the \nvoice of the people be heard and act to save marriage. Please support \nthis constitutional amendment to define what marriage is. It is the \nmost important action we can take in this Senate.\n  I urge support, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. J. Res. 40, the \nFederal marriage amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I do so with \nconviction that this course is the right one, but with considerable \nfrustration that we have come to this point as a nation. This \nconstitutional amendment, in my view, should not be necessary.\n  The core definition of Western civilization's most stable and \nimportant social institution, traditional marriage, should not be \njeopardized by litigation and court decisions. Activist trial lawyers \nshould not be filing lawsuits asking courts to change the basic rules \nof marriage for all society. Judges should not be denouncing \ntraditional marriages as a stain on the Constitution that must be \nwashed away. But that is where we are: Confronting a coordinated, well-\nfunded, and persistent campaign in the courts to undermine marriage.\n  After careful study, I have come to the conclusion that the only way \nto protect traditional marriage from these undemocratic forces is to \npursue a constitutional amendment that protects traditional marriage. \nOnly through such a constitutional amendment process will the American \npeople genuinely have the opportunity to speak out and guarantee that \ntraditional marriage is protected.\n  I wish to spend a few moments explaining why I think this issue is so \nimportant.\n  In short, traditional marriage--marriage as the union between a man \nand a woman--exists, first and foremost, as the best environment for \nthe protection and nurturing of children. Traditional families are \nwhere we hope the children will be born and raised, and where we expect \nthem to receive their values. And we hope these things for a good \nreason.\n  As one social scientist who testified before the Finance Committee \nearlier this year said, children on average experience the highest \nlevels of overall well-being in the context of healthy marital \nrelationships.\n\n  This testimony is consistent with an overwhelming body of social \nscience testimony received by the Finance, Health, Judiciary, and \nCommerce Committees earlier this year. If we want our Nation's children \nto do well, we need to do what we can to ensure they grow up with \nmothers and fathers. So we need to protect the place where mothers and \nfathers properly unite--marriage.\n  I believe traditional marriage is an institution worth saving, and I \nbelieve we send a very important message to our children when we stand \nup for the institution of marriage. We tell them that marriage matters; \nthat traditional family life is a thing to be honored, valued, and \nprotected. We tell them marriage is the best environment for raising \nchildren, and we tell them every child deserves a mother and a father. \nWe point them to the ideal and that the radical redefinition of \nmarriage through the court threatens this ideal.\n  We cannot strip marriage of its core--that it be the union of a man \nand woman--and expect the institution to survive, as we have come to \nknow it.\n  It is because I feel so strongly about preserving and even \nencouraging a healthy marriage culture that I have been so disturbed by \nthe legal developments our Nation has witnessed over the past 10 years. \nWe are on the Senate floor discussing an amendment to the Constitution \nbecause activist lawyers persist in filing lawsuits to force States to \nredefine marriage to include same-sex couples. These activists are\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\ndodging the will of the American people who overwhelmingly oppose a \nredefinition of marriage and instead have been asking judges to rewrite \nthe marriage laws.\n  More than a year ago, I asked the staff of the Republican Policy \nCommittee, which I am privileged to chair, to analyze the court \ncampaign of these activists and to speculate on their prospects for \nsuccess. We concluded at that time the Massachusetts high court would \nlikely find traditional marriage unconstitutional, and that a number of \nlawsuits attacking marriage would begin to expand dramatically.\n  While some quarreled with those predictions, unfortunately they have \nproven to be 100 percent correct. I wish to summarize briefly these \nlegal developments that brought us to the point we are.\n  There is in this country a collection of activist lawyers who \ngenuinely and sincerely believe marriage should be redesigned so \ncouples of the same sex could marry. Groups such as the ACLU, Lambda \nLegal, and Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders, GLAD, and others \nhave frankly explained their strategy. Their goal is to use the courts \nto force the entire Nation to adopt same-sex marriage. They understand \nthey cannot do it through the democratic process convincing people of \nthe wisdom of their position, but must rather succeed in convincing \njudges to overturn our long-time understanding of the meaning of \nmarriage.\n  They saw their first great victory in Vermont in 1999. In response to \na suit by the ACLU and other activist groups, the Vermont State Supreme \nCourt ordered the legislature to recognize same-sex marriage or to \ncreate some form of civil union that was exactly like marriage.\n  Vermont citizens at the time opposed both same-sex marriages and \ncivil unions, but the court mandate was clear: Legislators must create \nsame-sex marriage or some form of same-sex civil union or the court \nwould do it for them. The legislators chose civil unions in the face of \nthe court's dictate, but it can hardly be said that they acted in \naccordance with the democratic process. No, this was ruled by lawsuit, \nnot by legislation.\n  These activist lawyers who had succeeded in Vermont quickly turned to \nnew States, this time aiming for a complete transformation of the \nmarriage laws. It is true that homosexual couples had gained all the \nrights and benefits available under Vermont law as married couples. The \nsame-sex marriage activists did not just want rights and benefits, they \nwanted to redefine marriage itself to change the cultural norms that \nhave characterized this institution of man and woman for ages.\n  These groups acted carefully. They put most of their efforts into a \nnew lawsuit in Massachusetts. The people of Massachusetts opposed same-\nsex marriage, and their legislators would never change the law to allow \nit. But the activists were not interested in a democratic solution. \nThey knew they could not convince many millions of citizens to \nundermine traditional marriage, so they decided to focus on just four \npeople, the majority of the supreme court of the State. They did what \ntoo many Americans do nowadays, they filed a lawsuit. The result was a \nresounding defeat for traditional marriage and the people of \nMassachusetts who continue to oppose same-sex marriage in their State.\n  In November 2003, a 4-to-3 majority of the Massachusetts Supreme \nJudicial Court ruled in Goodridge v. Massachusetts Department of Health \nthat the State constitution required the State to recognize same-sex \nmarriages.\n  Of course, the State constitution said no such thing. It contained \nthe same basic equal protection and due process clauses that exist in \nmost State constitutions and in our U.S. Constitution. These clauses \nhad never been understood to require the rewriting of marriage itself, \nbut that is what the four judges determined.\n  As breathtaking as this decision was, even more stunning was the \ndisdain that these four judges showed for traditional marriage and its \nsupporters. The court wrote that there was ``no rational reason'' to \npreserve traditional marriage laws; that support for traditional \nmarriage was rooted in little more than ``persistent prejudices'' and \nthat the several-thousand-year-old institution of marriage was little \nmore than ``an evolving paradigm'' that could be redrafted and \nrewritten by the courts whenever they desired.\n  One judge even scoffed at what he called the ``mantra of tradition.'' \nIn a followup opinion reaffirming and expanding the earlier decision a \nfew months later, the same four justices even said that the marriage \nlaws of Massachusetts were ``a stain on the Constitution,'' and that \nthe stain must be eradicated by the court.\n  Incredibly, the court even suggested that it would be better to \nabolish civil marriage altogether than preserve it in its traditional \nform.\n  On May 17 of this year, the Goodridge decision took effect, and the \nState began issuing same-sex marriage licenses in Massachusetts. Many \nsame-sex couples from other States traveled to Massachusetts and then \nreturned back to their own States.\n  While the Massachusetts Legislature has given preliminary approval to \na State constitutional amendment to return marriage to its traditional \nmeaning, it will be more than 2 years before the citizens can even vote \non that amendment. In the meantime, for hundreds of people who have \ntraveled to Massachusetts from all over the country, same-sex marriage \nis a reality.\n  So what happens next? Is it realistic to believe that same-sex \nmarriage can be isolated to Massachusetts? Will the activist lawyers \nwho brought that suit continue to press their claims on behalf of these \n``couples'' who return to their States of residence? The answer is \nclear. The activist groups already are seeking to bypass the \nlegislative process and impose their agenda through courts in other \nStates.\n\n  There are now more than 35 lawsuits pending in 11 States across our \nNation in which States' marriage laws have been challenged as \nunconstitutional, States such as California, Florida, Indiana, \nMaryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, \nWashington, and West Virginia. Many of these lawsuits are brought by \nthe same lawyers who filed suits in Vermont and Massachusetts, \nactivists from the ACLU, LAMBDA Legal, and GLAD in particular. In fact, \nthe lawsuit in Maryland was filed only last week by the same legal team \nat the ACLU that is managing lawsuits in New Jersey and elsewhere. Many \nmore lawsuits surely will follow.\n  As I said, the activist court strategy is no secret. The ACLU, LAMBDA \nLegal, a group calling itself Freedom to Marry, are very open about \ntheir hopes of imposing same-sex marriage through the courts.\n  Let us look at some of the lawsuits we can expect. First, these \nactivists will file more suits challenging State marriage laws the same \nway they did in Massachusetts and are doing in 11 other States today.\n  Second, there will be lawsuits seeking to strike down the Defense of \nMarriage Act so that same-sex couples can get access to Federal \nbenefits such as tax filing status, Social Security benefits from same-\nsex partners, and many of the other benefits or rights that the Federal \nGovernment grants to married spouses.\n  Already, for example, there is a lawsuit pending in Florida that \ndirectly claims that DOMA is unconstitutional.\n  Third, these activists will file lawsuits trying to force other \nStates to recognize same-sex marriages in Massachusetts and any other \nplace where they can convince judges to change the marriage laws \nagainst the people's will. Such a lawsuit currently is pending in \nWashington State, where a same-sex couple received a marriage license \nin Oregon and now insists that Washington must recognize that marriage, \ndespite clear State law to the contrary.\n  Finally, there will be many other lawsuits that cannot be anticipated \nthat will happen as same-sex married couples move from State to State, \nas many Americans nowadays do. These couples will try to get divorced \nwhen marriages fail. They will try to execute and enforce wills when \none of them dies. They will have all kinds of run-of-the-mill business \ndisputes as happens in other situations, and courts will struggle to \nfigure out how to treat their legal relationships when these disputes \narise.\n  Those struggles will take on a constitutional dimension. For example, \ntwo women who received a marriage license in Canada later decided to \ndeclare bankruptcy in Washington State.\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nThey filed their petition jointly as though they were married. Because \nall bankruptcies are filed in Federal court pursuant to Federal law, \nthe Defense of Marriage Act is implicated. The bankruptcy trustee has \nobjected to their joint petition, citing DOMA's provision that for the \npurposes of all Federal law, marriage is the union of a man and a \nwoman.\n  The bankruptcy petitioners now argue that DOMA itself is \nunconstitutional and that the bankruptcy court must recognize the \nCanadian same-sex marriage. Thus, a simple bankruptcy petition has \ntaken on constitutional dimensions. Cases such as this will \nproliferate, some filed by activists and some filed by citizens just \ntrying to live their lives, as appears to be the case in the bankruptcy \npetition in Washington State.\n  The result will be tremendous confusion in the courts throughout the \nNation, as some States recognize same-sex marriage for some purposes \nwhile other States recognize them only for other purposes.\n  As these lawsuits progress, it will be the courts, not the people, \nthat make the decisions on whether same-sex marriage will spread \nthroughout the entire Nation.\n\n  In the not too distant future, the legal activists who are managing \nthis attack on traditional marriage laws will decide that they are \nready for the big case, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. After \nwreaking havoc on traditional marriage throughout the Nation, these \nactivists will tell the Supreme Court that the confusion in the States \ndemands a national solution. They will argue, not unpersuasively, that \nwe are one Nation, that we cannot long function with such fundamentally \ninconsistent understandings of marriage.\n  When that day comes, when the U.S. Supreme Court is presented with \nthe opportunity to rule traditional marriage laws unconstitutional, it \nis very possible that the Court will side not with the oft-surveyed \nviews of the American people but rather will find a constitutional \nreason to say the people have been wrong all this time.\n  Legal and cultural confusion cannot long endure on this question. \nWhen a case reaches the Supreme Court, it most likely will craft a \nnational solution. What the same-sex marriage activists expect and hope \nfor is exactly the result that concerns me. Once the Court has spoken, \nwhile there surely will be great public outcry if contrary to public \nopinion, our history shows it is very difficult to change a Supreme \nCourt decision by constitutional amendment.\n  The only way the American people will ever have a voice in this \nmatter is if Congress sends to the States for ratification a \nconstitutional amendment defining and protecting traditional marriage. \nFederal DOMA, which has already been challenged, could easily be struck \ndown by the courts. Marriage laws in the States likely will be struck \ndown just as happened in Massachusetts. No Federal law, no Federal \nregulation, no State law, no State constitutional amendment, can \nprevent this from happening. The only solution is an amendment to the \nConstitution and the only question is when to start the process. The \nmore time that elapses with conflicting State law and same-sex couples \nseeking to have their marriages recognized in different States, the \nmore our society will be conflicted and the more lawyers and judges \nwill be making the decisions.\n\n  The constitutional process is the most democratic, the most \ngrassroots, the most respectful process available for the establishment \nof national policy. A constitutional amendment requires the support of \ntwo-thirds of both Houses of Congress. Then it requires the support of \nthe legislatures of three-fourths of the States of the Union. Then, and \nonly then, can the amendment become effective.\n  This is, as it should be, a very high hurdle. But it is a high hurdle \nthat guarantees that the American people have a full and complete \nopportunity to speak to the issue, that they can express their views to \ntheir Senators, to their Congressmen, and to their State legislators. \nIt takes time, but in the end, as opposed to court decisions, if a \nconstitutional amendment passes, we know that the American people want \nit.\n  Look at the proposed constitutional amendment that is before us and \nexamine what it will do. It is on the chart directly behind me. The \nfirst sentence reads:\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n\n  The sentence is straightforward. It provides a common definition of \nmarriage throughout the United States, one man and one woman. It \nguarantees that the central definition of marriage is preserved \nthroughout our country. It protects the American people who \noverwhelmingly believe traditional marriage should survive against \nthose who would undermine it. We are one nation. While we have a wide \nvariation in many thousands of laws among different jurisdictions, for \nthe central, core issues in the way we organize our society, we have \ncommon views and common laws.\n  That is why, as a nation, we denied one State admission into the \nUnion until it outlawed polygamy. We recognized that marriage was only \nbetween one man and one woman, and we would not even let that State \nenter the Union if it did not agree with that basic, core value.\n  This first sentence just reaffirms what has long been our national \npolicy and ensures that no court can say otherwise.\n  Now, turning to the second sentence, it reads.\n\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  This sentence simply ensures that only the people or their elected \nrepresentatives, not judges, can decide whether to allow marriage or \nits legal incidents can be conferred on people. This would prevent what \nhappened in Vermont. The State supreme court hijacked the democratic \nprocess and coerced the legislature to create same-sex civil unions. \nThe people didn't want it but the court decreed it. The second sentence \nof this amendment would prevent that kind of result.\n  The reason to add the second sentence, thus, would be to ensure no \ncourt would be able to construe the State or Federal constitution to \nrequire the creation of same-sex marriage or any institution or \narrangement containing the incidents or benefits that derive from \nmarriage itself. In other words, courts will not be able to create a \nright to civil unions based on the equal protection or due process \nclauses of the Constitution. They will not be able to twist the \nconstitutional language, in other words, to serve these narrow policy \ngoals.\n  However, the marriage amendment in no way bars or bans these kinds of \nspecial civil union or domestic partnership arrangements, as long as \nthey are enacted through the legislative process. The marriage \namendment preserves our current State organized regime by protecting \nthe rights of citizens to act in their State legislatures to provide \nwhatever benefits to same-sex couples that they should choose. Those \nbenefits could be narrow, granting special inheritance rights, for \nexample, or they could be broad, a full civil union law, for example.\n\n  In another example the legislatures of California and New Jersey have \nrecently created arrangements they call domestic partnerships, that \ngrant many of the benefits of marriage to same-sex couples.\n  Let me say again, the legislatures of those States passed those laws. \nBenefits were granted through the democratic process. Nothing in the \nmarriage amendment prevents the citizens of a State from acting through \ntheir regular legislative process to grant benefits to same-sex couples \nin that State. So if a State wanted to create marriage-like ``civil \nunions,'' it could still do so. A legislature's only constraint is it \ncould not create same-sex marriage.\n  Before I close, I would like to say a few words to address a concern \nabout the amendment that I have heard expressed by some of my Senate \ncolleagues. Some claim the question of same-sex marriage can be handled \neffectively on a State-by-State basis. Some, including people I respect \nvery much, have told me if Massachusetts wants to have same-sex \nmarriage, it should be able to do so and that Arizonans should not \ncare. They argue that because our States tend to manage most family law \nmatters, there is no reason to place this issue in the U.S.\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\nConstitution. They think of the issue as a thing of the distant future, \nsomething that we need not bother with. ``Let Massachusetts worry it,'' \nin effect.\n  I respect those who make this argument, but I strongly disagree with \nthe notion that Congress can punt on the protection of marriage. The \nproblem, it seems to me, with this line of thinking is that it \nassumes--in perfectly good faith, I am sure--a world that simply does \nnot exist. The citizens of each State are not being permitted to decide \nthis question. We should all sympathize with the citizens of \nMassachusetts who have been forced to see marriage in their State \nredefined and undermined, without the vote of the legislature or the \ncitizens of that State.\n  Massachusetts is only the beginning. We see from the 35-plus lawsuits \nin 11 different States that the activists will continue to campaign in \nthe courts. The lawyers who are championing this cause are not going to \npermit a State-by-State democratic solution. States rights implies not \nthe courts but the people making the decisions.\n  The most prominent leader of the same-sex marriage movement, Evan \nWolfson, who helped file the lawsuits in Vermont and Massachusetts and \nelsewhere, has candidly made the point. He scoffs at those who think \nthe Nation can tolerate fundamentally different conceptions of marriage \non a State-by-State basis. He understands that it is all or nothing. As \nhe says on his Web site:\n\n       America is one country, not 50 separate kingdoms. If you're \n     married you're married.\n\n  In other words, people move around so much in this Nation that we \ncannot long endure a scenario in which some marriages disappear at the \nState line. The legal, social, and cultural complications are simply \ntoo great. The question of whether traditional marriage is to survive \nmust ultimately be decided for the entire Nation.\n  In conclusion, the question is, Who decides? Will it be judges, \nscattered across the land and ultimately over in the Supreme Court? Or \nwill it be the American people, through the constitutional amendment \nprocess? This is not some idle question of political theory. The \nprocess determines the result. If courts make the decision, they will \nredefine marriage for every State. If the people can decide, I have \nconfidence they will stand up for marriage.\n  So, in conclusion, I call on my colleagues not to stand in the way of \nthe people's right to speak. Let the American people make the ultimate \ndecision as to whether we will jettison thousands of years of history \nand reinvent marriage or whether we will stand by the institution that \nwe all rely upon so much for the future of our children.\n  I will say it again. This question cannot and will not ever be \ndecided on a State-by-State basis. Either we will preserve traditional \nmarriage in this Nation or we will see it redefined everywhere. The \nvote we will have in this Chamber is the first step, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in making the right one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator from Arizona yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The last point my colleague made is one that is very \nimportant. A lot of people in the Senate, and even some across the \ncountry, have suggested that the Defense of Marriage Act will stand.\n  There is a lot of legal opinion. The Senator from Utah spoke about \nhow the Defense of Marriage Act probably will not stand. But your point \nis, even if the Defense of Marriage Act stands, the Defense of Marriage \nAct only protects States from other States forcing their laws on us.\n  Your point is even if that State can resist that, you lose anyway. \nCan you explain that? I think that is a very important point. The \nDefense of Marriage Act really doesn't save marriage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nexactly correct. I would like to argue that the Defense of Marriage Act \nis constitutional, but I share the same concerns that have been \nexpressed by others, that the Court will find it unconstitutional. But \nin either result, this challenge will continue in the State courts. We \nhave the precedent of Massachusetts, and a very clear strategy that the \nlawyers on the other side have outlined. They have not tried to hide \ntheir intentions. They have been very forthright about their intentions \nof getting State courts to declare State laws and the State \nconstitutions to require same-sex marriage, just as they did in the \nState of Massachusetts. These 35 lawsuits in 11 different States--at \nleast some of them--will argue this precise point. It is quite possible \nthat on the same basis that the Massachusetts Supreme Court decided \nthat its due process and equal protection language required the \nrecognition of same-sex marriages, that identical language or almost \nidentical language in all of the State constitutions--identical also, \nby the way, to the Federal Constitution--would require that other \nStates like Massachusetts recognize same-sex marriage. So it won't \nmatter that DOMA says that one State doesn't have to recognize the \nmarriages of another if State by State the courts decide that in those \nrespective States the law requires or the Constitution requires \notherwise.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The potential exists if DOMA is maintained and \nprotected that you could have--let us just say some of the more liberal \nState courts that we have out there, whether it is Massachusetts, New \nJersey, California, New York, big States--most of these are actually \nfairly large States that we are talking about--if marriage were defined \nin those States and let us say not in Pennsylvania, Arizona, Utah, or \nAlabama, what would be the result? How would America function? What \nwould marriage be in America? What would be the environment in which we \nwould be living? It is a very interesting question we are now faced \nwith just in Massachusetts, but we have sort of seen one isolated \nlittle case that is still in question. But as an accepted matter that \nthere are now in many States potentially couples who are married who \nare not traditional couples, what would be the impact on our society?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, there is one area I agree with the proponents \nof same-sex marriage on, and that is, the country is going to go one \nway or the other. You cannot survive a situation in which some States \nrecognize certain benefits, other States recognize other benefits, \nother States don't recognize any, others recognize same-sex marriages, \nothers, civil unions, and so forth. He makes the point that it has to \nultimately be all or nothing. I don't see how on that point he is wrong \nbecause people in this country move around.\n  I cited the case of the bankruptcy petition filed by the Canadian \ncouple, but it could have just as easily been a married couple in \nOregon and moving to Washington. The fact is disputes will arise all \nover the country in courts of States that didn't necessarily confront \nthe question but will have to confront some element of it. When two \npeople present themselves as having been lawfully married in another \nState and they have some dispute between them, the court of my State, \nfor example, isn't going to be able to avoid the issue and will have to \ndecide one way or other.\n  We are going to end up, I fear, in the situation in which a \ndefinition of marriage has many different meanings all across the \ncountry. Something as fundamental as that--as I said, the one thing I \nagree with the proponents of same-sex marriage on--cannot stand. You \nhave to either define it one way or the other for our society to \nfunction--just to function. It becomes a question of, A, what that \ndefinition should be--and that is why I have a disagreement with those \nfolks--and, B, who makes the decision.\n  My primary point is that the people of the country should be making \nthe decision, not just a few lawyers and judges. The best way for \npeople to have a voice in this is by the constitutional process in \nwhich they are directly and indirectly involved through the Senate, \nthrough the House, and through their own State legislatures.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Arizona yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to yield. I actually give up the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. He is \none of the Senate's finest legal scholars. He has argued a number of \ncases\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\nbefore the Supreme Court, I believe three or more. He won all of those \ncases. There is not one lawyer in a thousand in America who has argued \na case before the Supreme Court, much less three.\n  I would like to just ask one simple fundamental question, if the \nSenator could explain it to our colleagues and to the people of this \ncountry. If the Supreme Court found, as they indicated that they may in \nthe case of Lawrence v. Texas, that marriage under the Due Process or \nEqual Protection clauses of the Constitution has to include same-sex \nmarriages rather than just the traditional marriage form, will that not \nwipe out all of the constitutional amendments that are being passed in \nthe States of America and all the statutes in America and the Defense \nof Marriage Act that we passed in this Congress?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is also an \nextraordinarily fine lawyer in his own right. Of course, the answer is \nyes. Once the Supreme Court has spoken, and there is language in this \nLawrence case that suggests to many that the Court would be inclined to \nrule in that fashion, then the Court has just enunciated the supreme \nlaw of the land and no State constitutional provision or Federal law in \nany way could attempt to override that. That would be the law of the \nland.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If California passed it with 90 percent of the vote, or \n60 percent, as I believe they did pass a statute by ballot initiative, \nno matter what the people voted, it would be trumped and wiped out by \nthe ruling.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama is correct. The \nFederal Constitution trumps State constitutions. Even if the people of \na State amend their own State constitution, were the Supreme Court to \ndeclare that same-sex marriages are required by the equal protection or \nthe due process clause of the U.S. Constitution, that would be the \nsupreme law of the land, overriding any other Federal law, State law, \nor State constitution.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts this afternoon. I \nthank him for his insight into the complexity and the confusion that \nwill result if we don't have a national standard as we have always had \non marriage.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his courage and compassion \nand understanding of the importance of family.\n  I thank the President for his eloquent remarks last Friday on this \nimportant matter.\n  I thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for \nhis brilliance and for the comprehensive statements he made today and \nFriday concerning the need for and the custom and the legality of a \nconstitutional amendment on this question.\n  People say, Why do we need to do it now?\n  I was in a hearing and one of the individuals said, Well, the State \nof Massachusetts may pass a constitutional amendment, and that would \nsort of, he indicated, solve the problem. I asked him, if it is all \nright for the people of Massachusetts or Michigan or Alabama or Utah to \npass a constitutional amendment that defines marriage, what is wrong \nwith the people of the United States and the Federal system passing a \nconstitutional amendment to deal with marriage?\n  All of the people who seem to be questioning and suggesting we should \nnot go forward with this kind of amendment are doing so on the basis \nthat State constitutions are being amended. But as we heard from \nSenator Kyl, a State constitution will not solve the matter if the \nSupreme Court acts as they have indicated they will. I believe it is \nperfectly appropriate for the people of the United States to consider \nwhether they would want to amend our Constitution.\n  Some say that marriage is just not important, that this is not a \nmatter we ought to spend any time on, and why now. They say, you are \njust bringing this up because there is an election ongoing. Let me say \nthat it was just last year that the Supreme Court ruled in Lawrence. It \nwas less than a year ago when Massachusetts ruled in their case that \nmade so much of an impact, and the result of the Massachusetts case was \njust brought into effect May 17 of this year.\n  What started this debate was not people who believe in family as we \nhave always known it. They didn't start this debate. They didn't start \nthe discussion, the debate and legal activism, that attempts to change \na fundamental American institution. It was the courts that did so \nactivist lawyers and activist judges.\n  It would indeed be unthinkable to most people that we would ever need \nto discuss a constitutional amendment to defend marriage. \nUnfortunately, the integrity of the legal system is being eroded as \npolitical agendas are being implemented more and more through rulings \nof the courts. That, let me say, fundamentally goes to the heart of the \nAmerican democracy.\n  Democracy in this country rests power with the people. But lifetime-\nappointed judges usurp this power--and it does not even take all nine \non the Supreme Court, or all seven on the Massachusetts Supreme Court. \nIn fact, it was four out of the seven judges on the Massachusetts \nSupreme Judicial Court, unaccountable to the public, who issued an \nopinion and cannot be held to account.\n  If we vote on issues the American people do not affirm, do not \napprove of and object to, we can be removed from office. That is the \nway the system works.\n  We must not allow this power to go to the courts. In fact, that is \nprecisely the issue that has driven the debate ever since President \nBush has been in office, even going back to President Reagan: What do \nyou want out of judges on the courts of America? Do we want judges who \nimpose agendas to do what they think is right under the circumstances? \nOr do you want judges who follow the law--Judges who care about the law \nand are respectful of it and indeed respectful of the people of the \nUnited States of America who, through their elected representatives, \nthey believe should be setting social policy in this country.\n  That is the challenge we are facing. That is the second important \npart of this debate. The first is marriage is an institution of \ntremendous importance and the rulings we have seen in courts today will \nundoubtedly erode the validity, impact, and power of that institution \nthat has helped raise healthy generations of Americans year after year. \nThat is one aspect.\n  The other aspect is the power of unelected judges. That power is \nfrightening. We have seen a number of opinions from the Supreme Court \nof the United States that cause concern. We saw the Supreme Court avoid \nruling recently on the Pledge of Allegiance case that challenged the \n``under God'' language in the Pledge. They could have ruled on that and \nnailed that issue down. I suspect it suggests the Court is undecided \nabout that. Certainly a number of their opinions have given a basis for \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to strike down the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in my view, is seriously \ndrifting from its principles. We have had members of that court, more \nthan one, start talking about European law as they analyze legal \nmatters. They have forgotten the American Constitution is a contract \nbetween the American people and their Government. It empowers our \nGovernment to carry on certain powers and not to do others and retain \nto the democratic process other actions.\n  This amendment will have a twofold impact. No. 1, it will protect the \nintegrity of marriage, a critical institution to our culture; No. 2, it \nwill indicate to our courts that the American people are not incapable \nof defending their liberties when they are under attack by courts. They \nseem to think this issue will be stirred up for a number of months and \nthen it will settle down and people will go away; that is the way it is \ngoing to be, do not worry about it. There will be editorials and church \npeople will carry a sign and someone will sign a petition, but we have \nlifetime appointments and we are like philosopher kings. We can see the \nlong term and what is good for America. We have decided this is the \nright thing for America to do. We will take the heat for a few months \nor a year or two and it will go away, we will be affirmed, and we will \naffirm our view and stand by it and that will be the end of that. These \nsmall-minded citizens will go away.\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\n  I am afraid there is an arrogance in some of these opinions that goes \nthat far. It disturbs me.\n  One of the dissenting justices in the State of Massachusetts, I \nsuppose the most liberal State in the country, certainly the most \nliberal judiciary, stated that the Goodridge v. Massachusetts \ndecision ``exceeds the bounds of judicial restraint,'' and he went on \nto note this decision ``replaces the intent of the legislature with \nthat of the court.''\n\n  In other words, that is precisely what they did. The judges on the \ncourt, four of the seven, got it in their minds how marriage ought to \nbe defined in America and they went back and took the equal protection \nclause of the state constitution, very similar to the U.S. \nConstitution, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court interpreted \nthat clause to effect a policy change that the founders and the \ndrafters of that constitution certainly never thought possible many \nyears before when that equal protection clause was passed.\n  I suggest, without doubt, it replaced the intent of a legislature, a \nbody in Massachusetts that is accountable to the public, with the \nintent of the court. That is what activism is. That is what Senator \nHatch so eloquently talked about for many years in the committee he \nchairs. When judges impose their personal or political views, liberal \nor conservative, through the redefinition of the meaning of language in \nthe Constitution, they are activist judges. We need to deal with that.\n  I will take a moment to go over something that has been discussed \nbefore, the Lawrence v. Texas case in 2003. Some say the Supreme Court \nis not going to say we have to recognize same-sex marriages along with \ntraditional marriage. Read that opinion. Senator Hatch pointed it out.\n  This is the language of the Court:\n\n       In Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, the \n     court reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty \n     protected by the Due Process Clause.\n\n  That is broad language, trust me. I don't know what that means, but \nit is not good.\n  I repeat: ``reaffirmed the substantive force of the liberty protected \nby the Due Process Clause.''\n  And continuing:\n\n       The Casey decision again confirmed that our laws and \n     tradition afford constitutional protection to personal \n     decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, \n     family relationships, child rearing, and education . . .\n\n  And they went on to state:\n\n       Persons in a homosexual relationship may seek autonomy for \n     these purposes, just as heterosexual persons do.\n\n  So, persons ``in homosexual relationship may seek'' the same \nprotections for these purposes, the purposes above, which includes \nmarriage.\n  Justice Kennedy, who wrote the opinion for the majority in Lawrence, \nmade clear that the holding of the case did not involve formal \nrecognition of same-sex marriage because the holding of the case had to \ndo with sodomy laws in Texas. It didn't have anything to do with \nmarriage. It does not involve whether the Government must give formal \nrecognition to any relationship that ``homosexual persons seek to \nenter.'' He suggests it was not about marriage.\n  The Court did not issue a decision about marriage--that is correct. \nJustice Scalia is also correct in responding, saying ``this case `does \nnot involve' the issue of homosexual marriage only if one entertains \nthe belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the \ndecisions of this court.''\n  In other words, the logic of the case is so compelling and powerful \nthat if properly applied to the next case that comes before the Court, \nit will hold that homosexual marriage must be recognized in the same \nway.\n  That is why we are here. No one, in my view--not one Member of this \nbody--would be able to say that marriage, as we have traditionally \nknown it in America, is not in jeopardy as a result of this opinion. \nEverybody knows the Supreme Court of the United States is on the verge \nor may be on the verge of ruling like the Massachusetts Supreme \nJudicial Court did.\n  So marriage in America under the U.S. Supreme Court is in jeopardy. \nMarriage as we know it is in jeopardy by the Supreme Court. So what is \nwrong with this body simply allowing the American people, through their \nelected representatives, to pass a constitutional amendment on \nsomething as important as marriage? It is not unimportant. I reject the \nidea that this institution which is so valuable to our culture is not \nimportant and not worth debate in this body. They are the same ones who \nsay: Oh, look, States are passing constitutional amendments. We don't \nneed to pass one. But if States can pass a constitutional amendment, \nwhat is wrong with the Federal Government passing one?\n  And talk about confusion, as Senator Kyl said, let's say the Supreme \nCourt rules consistent with Massachusetts. How long will it take for a \nconstitutional amendment to be passed? In the meantime, what will \nhappen to the marriages and all the arrangements that will be accruing \naround the country legally? Are they all going to be upset?\n  So if we are concerned about the power of the courts--I know Senator \nHatch is because they are reaching beyond the traditional role of a \ncourt through activist decisions--and if we are concerned about \nmarriage, why don't we move on this amendment? Why don't we send it \nforward to the people of the United States so they can consider it? \nSomebody said: Well, I don't like every word that is in this \nconstitutional amendment. Maybe I could support it, but I would like it \nto be a little different. Well, if we move this amendment forward on \nthe floor so it can be considered by this body, then people can offer \namendments to change it. We will debate and talk about how to better \nword the amendment if it needs to be changed. I feel comfortable with \nthe way it is, but I am willing to debate and talk about any changes.\n  I believe this body can make a difference. I believe we need to speak \non this issue for several reasons. One is because we need to send a \nmessage to the courts that we control the culture of this country, we \ncontrol how intimate relationships like marriage ought to be defined; \nthat is, we the people, and not unelected, lifetime-appointed judges.\n  I have another chart to show; a lot of liberal lawyers in the country \nalso agree with what I have been saying. Laurence Tribe, from Harvard \nLaw School, last fall, right after the decision in Lawrence or about \nthe time this decision was rendered, said:\n\n       You'd have to be tone deaf not to get the message from \n     Lawrence that anything that invites people to give same-sex \n     couples less than full respect is constitutionally suspect.\n\n  So again, isn't that affirmation of what I have said, that the \nSupreme Court is on the verge or may yet step forward with a \nMassachusetts-type ruling?\n  There is another quote I think is interesting. In Justice Scalia's \ndissent, he said the Lawrence decision:\n\n     leaves on pretty shaky grounds state laws limiting marriage \n     to opposite-sex couples.\n\n  ``Pretty shaky grounds.''\n  Evan Wolfson, director of the Freedom to Marry group that favors the \nMassachusetts ruling, said:\n\n       But when [Scalia's] right, he's right. We stand today on \n     the threshold of winning the freedom to marry.\n\n  He is talking about the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I believe this Senate needs to consider the matter of marriage in \nAmerica. We need to think seriously about it. We need to consider \nwhether the social science evidence I have discussed and others have \ndiscussed earlier indicate these rulings will further undermine \nmarriage in America, thereby endangering our culture, as it inevitably \nwill. And we need to consider the reach of Federal judges which \ncontinues to expand beyond their legitimate role.\n\n  This amendment provides an opportunity for the people to speak on \nboth those questions. I think it is important for us. I urge my \ncolleagues to think clearly about it. This is not harmful or negative \nor targeted to anybody. It is an amendment that will focus on affirming \ntraditional marriage, family, and children, which is what a State has a \nright to be interested in: the institution that nurtures, raises, and \neducates the next generation who will lead our country. Those are \nimportant issues. I hope we will move forward with the debate, we will \nallow this issue to come before the Senate, we will debate it and \ndebate the language of the amendment--and if we improve it, so be it--\nand then pass it and send it out to the people of America.\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nthat the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes about \nthe social impact of the marginalization of the American family and \ntraditional marriage over the past years. First, I want to address \nspecifically some of the questions that have been raised both here in \nthis Chamber and in the media and by others who have asked two main \nquestions that seem to be coming back time and time again. One is, why \ncan't we leave this to the States? Secondly, there are those who ask, \nwhy now? Why do we need a Federal constitutional amendment now before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court strikes down traditional marriage laws? And then \nI would like to address more of the social consequences of what we are \nseeing.\n  First, the idea of leaving this decision to the States, while an \nappealing concept in theory, as a practical matter is impossible. \nIndeed, as I and others on this floor have said so on many occasions in \ntalking about this issue, it has been decisions out of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt interpreting the Federal Constitution and creating a broad right \nof personal autonomy that have, even addressing the marriage context \nand relationships between people of the same sex as well as traditional \ncouples and the institution of marriage, it is that broad rationale \nthat has now been bootstrapped by the Massachusetts Supreme Court in \nthe Goodrich case to create this right, this right that did not exist \nin 1780 when John Adams wrote the Massachusetts Constitution, but all \nof a sudden was discovered some 224 years later by the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court.\n  Of course, the Massachusetts Supreme Court was not the one who \ndreamed up this right. We have to give credit where credit is due. And \nthat is to the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in Griswold v. \nConnecticut, in the Roemer case out of Colorado, and then in the \nLawrence v. Texas case last summer.\n  It would be nice if we could say, for those of us who do believe in \nthe primary authority of the States in all matters except insofar as \nthe Constitution mandates that it is a Federal Government \nresponsibility, I would at first blush find it appealing to be able to \nleave such matters and others to the States. But we know as a practical \nmatter that that is impossible; first, because of the likelihood that \nthe current challenges to State marriage laws under the Federal \nConstitution may succeed under the framework, under the roadmap that \nhas been laid out by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence v. Texas. And \nthose challenges currently exist in Utah, Florida, and Nebraska. So no \nmatter what State laws exist, obviously the Federal Constitution, as \ninterpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, has supremacy. That is what the \nsupremacy clause is all about.\n  So while it may be appealing to say that we would like to leave this \nmatter up to the States, the very real and present risk is that a \nFederal court, interpreting the Federal Constitution, will strike down \nall State marriage laws that stand in the way of same-sex marriages \nunder the rationale used by the U.S. Supreme Court in Lawrence, as \nembraced by the Massachusetts Supreme Court in interpreting their State \nconstitution in the Goodridge case.\n  But there is also another practical consideration, and that is on May \n17, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court called traditional marriage a \n``stain that must be eradicated,'' terming it ``invidious \ndiscrimination'' and without rational basis, when they embraced this \nrevolutionary and radical notion, redefining the traditional \ninstitution of marriage after these many years, they didn't just affect \nthe rights of people within the confines of the State of Massachusetts.\n  What happened, of course, is that couples came to Massachusetts from \nother States and took advantage of the laws of Massachusetts--at least \ninsofar as interpreted by the Massachusetts Supreme Court--and said \nthey wanted to be married and then move back to the States where they \nlive. Indeed, we know that happened. Same-sex couples have come to \nMassachusetts and married and returned to their States in 46 different \nStates.\n  So to suggest that what happens in Massachusetts stays in \nMassachusetts is wrong, as a practical matter. But the problem is, of \ncourse, that now we know there are a handful--I think at last count \nperhaps 9 or 10--of challenges to State laws restricting marriage or \nprotecting traditional marriage by those who were married in \nMassachusetts--same-sex couples--who then moved back to their home \nState and filed a lawsuit in their State courts seeking to force their \nState to recognize the validity of that same-sex marriage.\n  As I and others have talked about on numerous occasions, the fact is, \nthis is part of a national litigation strategy by those who would seek \nto overturn traditional marriage between a man and a woman. And we are \nnot playing offense on this issue; we are playing defense in trying to \ndefend traditional marriage against this national litigation strategy.\n  So those are just two reasons it is putting your head in the sand to \nsay that this is a matter that is just limited to one State. As a \npractical matter, we saw on television in San Francisco where one mayor \nand local officials, in violation of California law, invited people to \ncome there and get married. Now, of course, that issue is balled up in \nlitigation pending before the California Supreme Court. So this is not \na local issue confined to the States, nor is it a matter that can be \nhandled, practically or legally or otherwise, by individual States, no \nmatter how hard they might try.\n  The other question that has been raised is, Why now? The U.S. Supreme \nCourt has not ruled traditional marriage to be unconstitutional and \nrequired same-sex marriages a national constitutional matter--not yet. \nAlthough it is clear in the hearings that we had in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that using the tools that the U.S. Supreme Court \nprovided in these cases that I have already discussed, clearly there is \na path mapped out, and the logical conclusion of the rationale used in \nthose decisions is to strike down traditional marriage as we know it.\n\n  But the question is, Why now? Some said, well, this may happen--I was \ntalking to one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle at about \nnoon. He said: Well, this may happen in 3, 4, or 5 years, but it is not \nan imminent threat right now. So why in the world would we seek to \namend the Constitution at this time?\n  Well, I point, by way of practical example, to what is happening in \nMassachusetts today. The decision to embrace this radical redefinition \nof marriage on May 17 was not put to a vote of the people of \nMassachusetts; it was an edict from the supreme court of that State. \nBut once we saw that the elected representatives of the people of \nMassachusetts decided to meet and discuss this issue, well, we have \nseen that they have chosen to reject the decision of the Massachusetts \nSupreme Court and to protect traditional marriage. The problem is, in \nMassachusetts, their law requires two successive sessions of the \nMassachusetts Legislature to meet and agree on the constitutional \namendment before it can be passed by the people, effectively meaning \nthat there is no constitutional amendment in that State possible until \n2006.\n  In the meantime, what are the people to do? Well, the people of that \nState and their elected representatives are watching this progression \nof same-sex marriages because the Supreme Court of Massachusetts \ndemanded it and ordered it. Even though it is going to ultimately be \noverruled by the people, in the meantime you are going to have a couple \nof years in which couples--same-sex couples--are going to seek to be \nmarried and be officially married\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\nunder the laws of Massachusetts, only to have it then prohibited in \n2006 going forward.\n  Well, I would think that people who ask why now would see that as an \nexample of why it is important to do it here and now--before the \nFederal courts in this country adopt the reasoning of that \nMassachusetts case.\n  We know the U.S. Constitution has been amended 27 times. We know it \nis reserved for special cases, and the burden on someone who would seek \nto amend the Constitution is very high--a two-thirds vote of the \nCongress and three-quarters of the States having to vote to ratify. And \nthat is appropriately so. But it is, as we have discussed, the only way \nthat we the people can have a vote and can have a voice on this \nimportant issue, especially once the Federal courts, under the guise of \ninterpreting the Federal Constitution, were to hold otherwise.\n  We know just from the history of those 27 amendments that, on \naverage, they have taken about 8 years. I could be wrong on that \nfigure, and I will doublecheck that, but it has taken roughly 8 years \nto ratify an amendment to the Constitution, on average. So we know if, \nin fact, a Federal court today were to hold that traditional marriage \nviolated the Constitution, then the American people were to decide, \nthrough their elected representatives, to pass a constitutional \namendment, we may find ourselves in effectively the same box that the \npeople of Massachusetts find themselves in now, where in that case you \nhave effectively a 2-year period in which same-sex couples are getting \nmarried under the auspices of the decision of the Massachusetts Supreme \nCourt, and to effectively not be able to undo this example of a very \naggressive judicial activism. So the same situation would apply under \nthe Federal Constitution because of the amount of time it usually takes \nto get a Federal constitutional amendment to pass.\n  So those are two questions that I wanted to address specifically. But \nI must also say, Mr. President, that I have been profoundly \ndisappointed at the silence that has been basically the only response \nwe have heard from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I \ntruly believe that they would prefer that this issue would just go away \nand that it not draw too much attention because they know if the \nAmerican people get energized on this issue, they will agree with those \nof us who believe that traditional marriage and families are worthy of \nprotection by virtue of this constitutional amendment.\n  They are hoping that nobody pays very much attention, that it will \nsort of slide by, and that they will not feel the negative \nrepercussions of their objection to this important amendment and the \nprotection of traditional family and traditional marriage through this \nprocess.\n  I wish rather than just not saying very much at all or anything, they \nwould come to the floor and actually debate the issue. If they think \nthey have a strong case, if they think that reason and justice and \nlogic are on their side, I say let's talk about it.\n  This is sometimes called the world's greatest deliberative body, but \nit is hard to have very much deliberation, it is hard to have very much \ndebate if the opponents to this amendment simply boycott the debate and \nhope the issue passes without many people paying much attention, and \nthey are able, as I said, to avoid the wrath of the people for failing \nto take what steps we find it within our means and ability to take to \nprotect traditional marriage.\n  Last March, I chaired a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee \non the Constitution regarding the decision I mentioned a moment ago, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas. The Goodridge \ndecision had not actually been handed down last September when we first \nhad that hearing. But in the interim, between that time and this, of \ncourse, in March and then May, we had the Goodridge decision handed \ndown which has resulted in an explosion of litigation across America.\n  During those hearings, both in September and then later on--we \nactually had a total of three hearings in the Subcommittee on the \nConstitution--we had some thought-provoking testimony. But at the \nhearing in March, I was personally moved by the sentiments of Pastor \nDaniel de Leon of the Templo Calvario Church in California and the \ntestimony of Rev. Richard Richardson of the African Methodist Episcopal \nChurch in Boston whom we were honored to have in attendance.\n  Both testified they would rather be at home working with the members \nof their congregations rather than having to come to Washington to \ntestify why it is important to defend traditional marriage. But it is \nbecause of the work they do, because they see the results in the \ndecline of marriage and traditional families in their communities every \nday, that they believe traditional marriage is so important and worth \ndefending.\n  Some say we are not likely to win this vote that, as I understand, \ncould happen on Wednesday. Regardless of the outcome of this amendment \nat this time, I believe it is important we have a national discussion \non the importance of marriage and a discussion that is based on facts.\n  We have heard a lot of people talk about the benefit of marriage for \nadults. We have heard some discussion about hospital visiting rights \nand inheritance rights, even though many of these issues could be \nsolved simply by a matter of contract between the parties involved. We \nhave learned that people who want to can actually enter into \narrangements that will achieve the results they want short of marriage \nby signing a few simple documents.\n  We have even heard some discussion about government benefits, even \nthough with these benefits come burdens, and the actual financial \nramifications of these benefits are a matter for debate.\n\n  Yet I have heard little conversation about what I believe to be the \nmost important issue that is related to what we are discussing, and \nthat is the benefits of marriage for children. It is easy for some \npeople to step back and say this issue does not affect them, but the \nfacts, the social science research that we see from other countries \ndemonstrates otherwise.\n  This research shows us that this issue affects everyone but \nparticularly children. None of us can, if we are going to claim to be \nin good faith about this debate, ignore these facts and these examples, \nnor should we, I believe, be neutral or merely stand on the sidelines.\n  Scandinavia, as we have heard before, has treated same-sex households \nas marriage for more than a decade. This practice was instituted in \nDenmark in 1989, in Norway in 1993, and in Sweden in 1994. The direct \nreaction to these decisions was relatively small. Few people, it seems, \nwere actually interested in the new arrangements, in the new rights \nthey achieved to marry a person of the same sex, and to this day the \nnumber of participating households is rather low.\n  But the greatest effect was not upon those who sought this new \ninstitution but on the society at large. Sad to say, there has been an \nenormous rise of family dissolution and out-of-wedlock childbirth. \nToday, about 15 years after Denmark created this new institution, a \nmajority of children in Scandinavia are born out of wedlock, including \nmore than 50 percent in Norway and 55 percent of the children in \nSweden, and in Denmark, a full 60 percent of first-born children have \nunmarried parents.\n  In Scandinavia, as a whole, traditional marriage is now an \ninstitution entirely separated from the idea of child rearing or \nchildbearing, and it is an incidental union, no longer an important \none, much less a unique one.\n  Scandinavia is not alone. In the Netherlands, during the mid-1990s, \nthe rate of out-of-wedlock childbirth began to shoot up by an \nastonishingly high rate of 2 percentage points a year, a rate matched \nby no other country in Europe.\n  By 2003, the out-of-wedlock birthrate had nearly doubled to 31 \npercent of all Dutch births. It is no coincidence that these were the \nyears when the social debate over legalizing same-sex marriage was the \nloudest in the Netherlands.\n  During Holland's drive for same-sex marriage, advocates in Parliament \nand elsewhere openly scorned the idea that marriage ought to be defined \nby its childbearing and child rearing character. Of course, there is \nalways a risk that if you spend a decade telling people that marriage \nis not about family and it is not about children they might\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\njust start believing you. But that is apparently what happened in the \nNetherlands. The Dutch people simply stopped getting married, even when \nthey had children. When it is no big deal, marriage becomes just \nanother choice on a menu of relationship options, and the children pay \nthe price.\n  Respected British demographer Kathleen Kiernan drew on the \nScandinavian case to form a four-stage model by which to gauge a \ncountry's movement toward Swedish levels of out-of-wedlock births.\n  She said in stage 1 the vast majority of the population produces \nchildren without marriage, such as in Italy. In the second stage, \ncohabitation is tolerated as a testing period before marriage, and it \nis generally a childless phase, such as we currently have in America. \nIn stage 3, cohabitation becomes increasingly acceptable, and parenting \nis no longer automatically associated with marriage. While Norway was \nonce at this stage, recent demographic and legal changes have pushed it \ninto stage 4, along with Sweden and Denmark.\n  In the fourth stage, marriage and cohabitation become practically \nindistinguishable, with many children, even most children, born and \nraised outside of traditional marriage.\n  According to Kiernan, once a country has reached a stage, return to \nan earlier phase is very unlikely.\n  As you can see, Mr. President, the dissolution of marriage is passed \non to children, to the next generation, and the devaluation of marriage \nas an important institution continues.\n  In America, the results could be even more significant than in \nScandinavia or the Netherlands because, after all, we already have a \nsignificant problem of out-of-wedlock childbirth in our own country. \nWhen the example of traditional marriage is removed, when cohabitation \nand marriage are equally respected and when childbearing is no longer \nsomething that ought to ideally come in the context of traditional \nmarriage, I fear the problem of single-parent households will only \nworsen.\n  We have a wealth of social science research from hundreds of sources \nover the course of decades which consistently reflects both the \npositive ramifications for children of a stable, traditional marriage \nand the negative effects of family breakup, including divorce and out-\nof-wedlock childbirth. Marriage provides the basis for the family, \nwhich remains the strongest and most important social unit.\n  As we have heard, countless statistics and research attest to the \nfact that when marriage becomes less important because it is expanded \nbeyond its traditional definition to include other arrangements, that \nuntoward consequences such as greater out-of-wedlock childbirths occur. \nPeople simply regard marriage as less significant and certainly, by \ndefinition, no longer unique.\n  Let me be clear. There are literally thousands, tens of thousands, \nprobably hundreds of thousands, of single parents in this country who \ndo a heroic job of raising their children in single-parent households. \nNothing I have suggested is meant at all to disparage the great work \nthey do. It is only to point out what social science and common \nexperience would tell us is true, and that is, if possible, the optimal \ncondition to raise any child, in terms of the family in which they are \nraised, is a family that is intact and where they have a loving father \nand a loving mother.\n  We recognize there are circumstances where that is not possible for a \nvariety of circumstances for every child, but that should not deter us \nfrom seeking the optimal situation for every child if it is, in fact, \npossible.\n  Here in America we made the decision we ought to particularly \nencourage and support those who marry and have children. This, of \ncourse, is not a partisan issue. That is one reason why I am so \ndisappointed by the silence with which we are met on the other side of \nthe aisle, talking about this important issue. In fact, it was one of \nthe most distinguished Democratic Members of this body, Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, who argued more than a decade ago that we must stop \n``the breakup of family inevitably'' as best we can. He said:\n\n       The principle social objective of American National \n     Government at every level . . . should be to see that \n     children are born into intact families and that they remain \n     so.\n\n  We don't raise our neighbors' children as our own, but we do help all \nthe children in every community every time we affirm and reinforce the \nimportance of traditional marriage, through our speech, by our actions, \nin our culture, and by our laws. It is a position reinforced through \nour laws and our practices, and I believe it is right. Government \nshould not be neutral, nor should it pretend to be neutral when it \ncomes to children and families.\n  Most Americans take for granted that traditional definitions of \nfamily and marriage as we know them will always exist but that, as we \nhave seen, is a mistake. We see in Scandinavia and the Netherlands why \nthat assumption would be a mistake. Now we see that same development \noccurring in one of our States and being spread through litigation \nthroughout the country.\n  The American people are not persuaded that this radical redefinition \nof marriage is needed or that it is a good thing. When given the \nopportunity to express themselves, they have always supported \ntraditional marriage clearly and forthrightly.\n  I, for one, believe that a national discussion of this issue is a \ngood thing. Those of us on the side of traditional marriage must not \nflinch and we should not back down and we should not allow people to \npaint our motivations as hateful or hurtful because, indeed, they are \nnot.\n  We recognize two simple propositions simultaneously in this country. \nOne is the essential dignity and worth of every human being. But, \nsecond and at the same time, we recognize that we see enormous benefits \nto our children, to society, and to all of us by preserving the \ntraditional institution of marriage. We are merely seeking to defend \nthe fundamental bedrock of our society, the wellspring of families and \nthe welfare of children. That is what we are for. We, who have the \nresponsibility of serving in elective office, have the duty to act to \nprotect marriage as a social good, not to ignore this issue until it is \ntoo late.\n  Some believe traditional marriage itself is about discrimination, \nthat all traditional marriage laws are unconstitutional and therefore \nmust be abolished by the courts. They align themselves with four \njustices in Massachusetts who contend the traditional institution of \nmarriage is ``rooted in persistent prejudices'' and ``invidious \ndiscrimination'' and not in the best interests of children.\n  These activists, out of the mainstream as they are, accuse others of \nwriting discrimination into the Constitution. Yet they are the ones who \nare willing to write the American people out of our constitutional \ndemocracy.\n  Now that the threat to traditional marriage is a Federal threat, a \nFederal constitutional amendment is the only way to preserve \ntraditional marriage laws nationwide before it is too late. We need \nstable marriages and stable families. The institution of marriage is \njust too important to leave to lawyers and lawsuits and to chance.\n  Unless and until the American people are persuaded otherwise, we have \na duty as their representatives to defend the laws they have passed, \nindeed the laws that we have passed, such as the Defense of Marriage \nAct in 1996, and not let extremists in the courts or outside them \nreshape society according to their own whim. We can be confident in the \nfact that a constitutional amendment is the most representative process \nwe have in American law.\n\n  There is no possible response to this judicial activism, to this \nrewriting of the Constitution by judicial fiat, but an amendment. Give \nthe States a voice. Give the people a voice. They deserve no less on \nsuch an important issue.\n  I suggest the burden of proof is on those who seek to experiment with \ntraditional marriage, an institution that has sustained society for \ncountless generations. The experimenters must present their case to us, \nthat the radical new social unit they propose is good for the \ncommunity, is good for families, and most of all good for children. \nThus far, the laboratory where this experiment has already been run, in \nScandinavia and the Netherlands, has given us nothing but disastrous \nresults.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority's time\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\nhas expired. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas \nfor his leadership on this issue and for his comments. To have a former \nState attorney general of the State of Texas and a former member of the \nTexas Supreme Court speak on this subject as an enlightened judge and \nas an authority, in my opinion, on the Constitution, is a very \nimportant part of this process. So I look forward to hearing more of \nhis thoughts on this subject as he has talked about the case law, the \nlegal precedents, and what is at stake with this amendment.\n  I know others have done it, but let me take a moment to read the \namendment we are proposing to the Constitution, because there has been \na lot of discussion about what we should do. I have seen a number of \ndifferent amendments or language being proposed, many of them a couple \nof paragraphs, quite long or complicated. This one is very simple, \ndirect, right to the point and I think does what needs to be done. Some \npeople would say it does not go far enough, but I think this is the \ncareful way the Constitution should be amended.\n\n       Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the \n     union of a man and a woman.\n       Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any \n     State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the \n     legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other \n     than the union of a man and a woman.\n\n  It is quite simple and direct. Will it lead to some court \nconsideration in the future? Surely. But what has caused this problem \nis the aggressive actions of the activist courts to take decisions in \nMassachusetts and in other places that have left us no alternative. So \nI rise today in strong support of S.J. Res. 40, the Federal marriage \namendment. It would amend the Constitution to provide specific \nprotection for the institution of traditional marriage. I am an \noriginal cosponsor of this measure because I believe marriage should \nonly consist of a union between a man and a woman.\n  Traditional marriage has existed as a fundamental building block of \nour society for thousands of years, and we have learned that it \nprovides the best and most stable environment for nurturing the \nchildren who become America's and the world's next generations. Now we \nsee the courts have been moving in this area on what I consider a \nradical quest to sweep away the traditional definition of marriage, one \nman and one woman, by allowing same-sex couples to marry.\n  This undemocratic activism by the courts can only be stopped, the \nfuture stability of our society protected, and this whole area \nclarified, by the safeguard of a constitutional amendment. Some \nSenators have argued that while they support traditional marriage, they \ndo not believe a constitutional amendment is necessary or proper at \nthis time. They maintain the Defense of Marriage Act, passed in 1996, \nis sufficient to protect traditional marriage by allowing individual \nStates to bar the recognition of same-sex marriages that may be allowed \nin other States. Unfortunately, I am convinced they are incorrect.\n  When the Supreme Court of Massachusetts directed the Massachusetts \nlegislature to authorize same-sex marriages, the inadequacy of the \nDefense of Marriage Act, DOMA, as it is commonly referred to, was \nexposed. Approximately three-fourths of the States have laws protecting \ntraditional marriage, indicating the democratically enshrined views of \nthe residents of those respective States. But activist courts in many \nof those States could unfortunately overturn these laws by forcing that \nState to authorize same-sex marriage or to recognize same-sex marriages \nperformed in other States. Additionally, now that the State of \nMassachusetts has endorsed same-sex marriages, the legal system in \nevery other State will be impacted when couples of the same sex are \nmarried in Massachusetts but go to other States to seek divorces or \nprobate wills, even if that particular State chooses not to recognize \nsuch marriage. This development could obviously create, and is \nbeginning to create, legal chaos in the country.\n\n  Furthermore, sadly, it is only a matter of time before the Defense of \nMarriage Act is overturned by unelected Federal judges who ``find'' \nrights in the U.S. Constitution which simply are not there, such as the \nU.S. Supreme Court did in the Lawrence v. Texas case. Therefore, a \nconstitutional amendment protecting marriage is the only way to \nadequately guarantee the sanctity of this fundamental institution.\n  Those who oppose the amendment say the U.S. Constitution should only \nbe amended on rare occasions and for crucial reasons, if at all. I \nagree, and I think this is a rare situation and a critical one. I have \nbeen disappointed occasionally over the years that we have not been \nable to succeed in amending the Constitution. A few years ago we lost \nin the Senate by one vote to have a constitutional amendment requiring \na balanced budget. A few years after that, we actually had balanced \nbudgets and a number of Senators said, see, we do not need it. Well, \nhere we are again.\n  By the way, there would have been an exception for national \nemergencies or national security requirements that we are now dealing \nwith.\n  When we look at the Constitution, wonderful document that it is, the \noriginal Constitution turned out not to be perfect. We had the articles \nof the Constitution and we went through Article V, Article VI, Article \nVII, and stopped, and then we had the 10 amendments that are referred \nto as the Bill of Rights. So there were 10 amendments that were soon \nadded, and in the last century alone we added 12 amendments. Most \npeople would say some of those amendments are not exactly earth-\nshattering amendments. The 27th, being the last one, is one that took \nalmost the entirety of this country's history to get through the \nprocess to actually be ratified, but it had to do with the compensation \nof the services of Senators and Representatives. I will bet if we asked \nthe American people to list the 10 things they think the Constitution \nshould perhaps be amended for, that would not be one of the top 10.\n  It is a sacred document. It is one we should defend and protect. We \ntake an oath to it. We do not take an oath to the people. We take an \noath to protect and defend the Constitution, and I think we should do \nthat.\n  There are occasions when we should consider the process. They should \nbe in areas that are critical and they should be rare. We have not had \na serious debate on a constitutional amendment now for about 6 or 8 \nyears. A constitutional amendment dealing with marriage being between \none man and one woman seems to me to be an issue that is important \nenough for us to have a debate on amending the Constitution.\n  There are those who say it should not be amended lightly. I certainly \nagree with that. But our Founding Fathers made sure it would not be \ndone often and that it would not be done lightly. The process for \nratification of an amendment is a very difficult and lengthy one. Under \nthe Constitution, within Article V itself, it says it requires a two-\nthirds vote of both Houses of Congress to approve a constitutional \namendment and three-fourths of the State legislatures must ratify the \namendment for it to become a part of the Constitution.\n  There is one other very difficult procedure in the Constitution in \nwhich a convention process can be conducted to get an amendment \napproved. I know how difficult that is, too, because some years ago I \nactually joined in a bipartisan effort to try to go through the State \nlegislatures to take advantage of this part of the Constitution to have \na convention that would lead to a balanced budget requirement in the \nConstitution. My own State legislature took that action, as well as \nseveral other States, but it soon fizzled out and I do not believe that \nprocess has been used in the history of our country. So this is not an \nissue we should take lightly. It is rare, it is exceptional, and it is \none that will take a lot of thought and debate before we get through \nthe process.\n  Some people say, well, what about federalism? What about the rights \nof the States? That is what we are talking about.\n  If we do not deal with this issue that may arise from the full faith \nand credit clause, some States such as, say, Alabama or Oklahoma are \ngoing to have a\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\nreal problem in dealing with what the courts have directed in the State \nof Massachusetts.\n  Full faith and credit says we have to respect each other's laws. But \nI do think we need clarity in this very critical area. I think the \nConstitution deserves to be amended when it deals with something so \ntraditional and which is such a vital part of our country and our \nfuture.\n  Marriage is our most basic social institution, and its traditional \ndefinition as the union of a man and a woman is intended to be the best \nenvironment for rearing children. There is a reason that we have a \n``traditional'' definition of marriage: God's design and the resulting \nevidence of science and common sense clearly demonstrates that the \nunion of a man and a woman is the best, most secure and nurturing \natmosphere in which to bring up children.\n  This does not mean that single parents, foster parents, and others \ncannot do heroic jobs of raising children--because many children are \nbeing raised by these heroes. However, marriage is meant to affirm the \nideal model in which to bring up the next generation. Mothers and \nfathers both matter, and both make critical contributions in the lives \nof children. A man and a woman united in marriage can uniquely provide \nthe many different attributes that children need as they are reared to \nbecome our next generation, and both make important contributions.\n  I am going to yield the floor at this point, since I am about to lose \nmy voice talking about this subject, but I think this is an issue whose \ntime has come. I commend the leader and Senator Santorum for making \nsure this issue is debated in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nSantorum be recognized for so much time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that the \norder for the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate both the Senator from Mississippi and \nthe Senator from Texas for their excellent comments and for adding to \nthis debate.\n  I think one of the main facts we tend to overlook in this institution \nis the importance of the debate--the importance of engaging in a \nsubject matter and having a colleague focus on an issue and having the \nAmerican public focus on an issue.\n  I think in a very short period of time the issue of marriage actually \nhas come to the fore in America--to actually start to think about what \nmarriage is. What is the purpose of marriage? What is it all about, and \nhow does it fit into American culture?\n  I told the story when the Massachusetts decision was first handed \ndown about being questioned by college students. As the Presiding \nOfficer knows, we are constantly bombarded by high school and college \nstudents who come down and visit with us. It is a wonderful thing when \nyou get a chance to stay in touch with what the young mind is thinking \nand the popular culture they are influenced by.\n  Once Goodridge was handed down, I would get the question, How do you \nfeel about changing the definition of marriage? I would enter into a \ndiscussion. I came up with the idea of asking those young people, \nbefore I answered that question, What is the purpose of marriage? \nAbsolutely without fail, for about a 2-month period of time, as I would \ndo that almost on a daily basis when we were in session because the \nissue was a hot issue at the time, I would get three or four hands \ngoing up. The answer would be to affirm the love between two people. \nThat was the answer.\n  I would ask several other folks, generally speaking, some sort of \nvariation on that theme. There would usually be some young man--usually \na young man, occasionally a young lady, in the back, always in the \nback--who would put his hand up and sheeplishly say something like \nprocreation and rearing of children.\n  I have to tell you that for a several-month period of time, when that \nyoung man or young lady would raise their hand and would say that, the \nmajority of the kids in the group would laugh, which somewhat startled \nme. Then, of course, I would say I agree with that man in the back or \nthat young lady in the back about the principal purpose of marriage. \nYet to many of our young people that was not something which was \nconsidered. The only thing that was considered was about them in a \nsense. Consider yourself. Why do you want to be married? Well, to make \nme happy, to join me with someone I love. That is what marriage is \nabout. It is about me.\n  I would suspect, if you went back and talked to your grandmother or \ngreat-grandmother, and you asked what the purpose of marriage is, they \nwould probably give you a very different answer. Thankfully, I am \ngetting a different answer now when I ask that question. More and more \npeople are saying what that sheepish young boy or young girl would say \nin the back, and there are fewer and fewer laughs when they say it is \nabout children.\n\n  I can only give as a reason for that the fact that we have had this \ndebate as to what marriage means and the importance of it to our \nsociety. It is like the oxygen we breathe. We breathe it and we know it \nis there. It is essential to life, but we sort of take for granted that \nit is just going to be there. That is our bodily function because it is \njust going to be there. The body politic, the body, the social body, \nthat culture that is in America sort of takes marriage for granted. \nWhen we see places where marriage maybe has been taken too much for \ngranted or simply been pushed aside as something that isn't necessary, \nwe see how culture and society suffer greatly.\n  One of the things I wanted to do in the little time I have here--and \nI think the Senator from Kansas is here, and I know he wants to speak--\nis talk about what the purpose of marriage is. Why is this issue so \ncentral? We tend to talk about what the need for this amendment is and \nget sort of wrapped up in the procedure.\n  I think one of the great blessings of the Senate is an opportunity to \ndebate, educate, and to think through things.\n  I earlier quoted a study by professors Young and Nathan. I will go \nthrough a little bit more of this article. But they lay out in a \nparagraph of the study the purpose, if you will, the reason for \nmarriage, and why society must encourage it.\n  As I mentioned in my earlier comments, if society doesn't encourage \nmarriage and fidelity between a man and a woman, the natural \ninclination is certainly--as I think we have seen in many subcultures \nin America--not to be faithful, not to be responsible fathers, not to \nbe involved with a woman for a long-term commitment. This is something \nwhich, if not nurtured by culture, could cause us to evolve very \nquickly into a rather self-absorbed, self-centered culture, with men \nbeing the principal stirrer of that lethal cocktail in America.\n  But to quote professors Young and Nathan:\n\n       The culture of marriage must encourage at least five \n     things. A, the bonding between men and women that ensures \n     their cooperation for the common good; B, the birth and \n     rearing of children, at least to the extent necessary for \n     preserving and fostering society in a culturally approved \n     way; C, bonding between men and children so that men are \n     likely to become active participants in family life; D, some \n     healthy form of masculine identity which is based on the need \n     for at least one distinctive, necessary and publicly valued \n     contribution to society and is especially important today \n     because the other two cross-cultural definitions of manhood, \n     provider and protector, are no longer distinctive now that \n     women have entered the public realm; and E, the \n     transformation of adolescence into sexually responsible \n     adults so young men and women are ready for marriage and the \n     beginning of a new cycle.\n\n  So why do we support marriage? Why do we hold up marriage as a \nspecial institution to which we give prestige and esteem, that we \nsupport with cultural and social norms, to which we give\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nlegal preferences, legal protection? Why do we do this as a culture? \nWhy has every culture in the history of man provided the same kind of \nnurturing and support for husbands, for men and women to become \nhusbands and wives and fathers and mothers?\n  We do this for the reasons that are laid out here--at least for these \nreasons laid out here. Some of them are really interesting, if you dig \ninto them as to how, without this kind of nurturing, we can see very \nclearly how our society would be harmed.\n  I haven't heard anybody get up and argue that marriage between a man \nand a woman is bad. I haven't heard anybody get up and suggest that we \nshould change the definition of ``traditional.'' In fact, I haven't \nheard anybody here, nor do I expect to hear anyone here, advocate for \nthe States to change the definition of traditional marriage.\n  One wonders if there is unanimity of opinion as to what marriage is. \nAnd I suspect, although I would be happy to hear people come forward \nand disagree with these elements that I have just laid forth--but if \nthere is agreement as to what marriage is and the purpose and the \nbenefits of society for marriage, why are we so reticent in doing what \nwe know for sure will protect that institution?\n  Again, Members can make the arguments up and down that there are \nother ways we can protect marriage: The States can do it, the State \ncourts can do it, the legislatures can do it, the DOMA statute, or the \nHouse, which is looking at some sort of limitation of jurisdiction. We \ncan look at a whole variety of different things and say this could \nwork, this might work, this may happen, but ultimately we know for sure \none thing will work. A constitutional amendment defining marriage will, \nwithout question, work.\n  We have to ask ourselves, if marriage is this institution so critical \nto the future of our society, it is so foundational for our children \nand for men and women to build these bonds for the common good--and \nafter the Senator from Kansas speaks, I will go through chart after \nchart of the benefits children gain from being in a married family--if \nwe accept that social good, then why is there not overwhelming support \nfor something most people even 10 years ago would have said: This is \ncommon sense. Of course marriage is between men and women. We do not \nhave to put that into the Constitution. Everyone agrees with that.\n  Yes, everyone agrees, but Members will stand up in the Senate and \nsay: We all agree with that, but it does not belong in the \nConstitution. Marriage is not important enough. Families are not \nimportant enough to be protected by our Constitution, to be protected \nfrom rogue judges who say things like marriage is a stain on our laws \nthat must be eradicated.\n  I believe ultimately we will protect marriage. Let's start now. Let's \ncome together and make some commonsense decisions about protecting the \ninstitution that is so valuable to this country, that we know is a \npublic good. We can do that starting this week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the \nproposed marriage amendment for up to 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on this proposed \namendment, constitutional amendment to protect marriage. I am an \noriginal cosponsor. I support the Allard amendment. He has done an \nabsolutely fabulous job of bringing this forward. I will articulate \nthose reasons for my colleagues and for others.\n  This is a critical battle. We are at a critical stage in the culture \nof the United States. What happens on this particular issue will have a \nprofound impact on the future of the United States of America. It is \nthat which we are actually debating today.\n  I have no doubt it is imperative we act now by means of a \nconstitutional amendment to protect marriage. As some of my \ndistinguished colleagues have already pointed out, this action has been \nmade necessary not by election year politics but by the reckless \nactions of a judiciary bent on radical social experimentation.\n  Let there be no mistake, the stakes in this battle of the future of \nour culture are enormous. This attempt by the judiciary to radically \nredefine marriage is both a grave threat to our central social \ninstitution and a serious affront to the democratic rule in our Nation.\n  On our reaction to this threat hinges the future of marriage and our \nfuture as a self-governing people. Both are at stake. Most Americans \nbelieve homosexuals have a right to live as they choose. They do not \nbelieve a small group of activists or a tiny judicial elite have a \nright to redefine marriage and impose a radical social experiment on \nour entire society.\n\n  Let us be clear, this is not a battle over civil rights; it is a \nbattle over whether marriage will be emptied of its meaning in \ncontradiction to the will of the people and their duly elected \nrepresentatives. We are a democracy, not a people ruled by a judicial \ndictator. In order to reach a predetermined outcome with regard to \nmarriage, judges such as the five judges responsible for the Goodridge \ndecision in Massachusetts are disregarding thousands of years of custom \nand experience, the laws of every society, and the beliefs of every \nmajor religious tradition. Unless action is taken by Congress to \nprotect marriage by means of a constitutional amendment, the marriage \nlaws of 50 States will be at the mercy of Federal judges, and marriage \nitself will be redefined out of all recognition.\n  The Defense of Marriage Act passed by Congress in 1996 is not enough. \nWithout a constitutional amendment, Federal judges will likely rule \nDOMA, the Defense of Marriage Act, unconstitutional under the doctrine \nof full faith and credit, and marriages recognized in one State will be \nrequired to be recognized in all.\n  As several of my distinguished colleagues have noted, challenges to \nDOMA are already making their way through the courts. This radical \nattempt to redefine marriage also highlights the need to rein in an \nincreasingly reckless judiciary. When activist judges show no regard \nfor legal intent or precedent, using their positions to achieve policy \ngoals, they must be resolutely opposed. In fundamentally altering the \ndefinition of marriage and changing duly approved marriage laws, these \njudges show contempt for the democratic process itself.\n  The choice is clear: Either we amend the Constitution and protect the \nrights of the people to self-determination in this process or the \nConstitution will be amended, in effect, by the edict of judges.\n  The time has come to act. If we continue to let activist judges \ndetermine the fate of marriage, the battle may be lost and we could \nlose the institution of marriage. Marriage can be lost.\n  It is important to take a step back from the heat of this controversy \nin order to understand why defending the institution of marriage is so \nimportant to the Nation's future. America's political system is framed \naround a particular understanding of human freedom, an understanding of \nfreedom not as mere license but as something that must be guided and \ngoverned by a fundamental internal moral code. In keeping with human \nnature, the direction is toward both the individual good and the common \ngood.\n  Our great experiment and freedom as a nation has not been without its \ndifficult moments of trial when we have struggled with our very \nidentity as a people as we attempted to resolve the tensions inherent \nin the responsible exercise of freedom. The attempts to grapple with \nthe evils of slavery in the 19th century and civil rights struggles of \nthe 20th century are primary examples.\n  In the long view of history, it seems likely we will look back at the \nsocial changes identified with the decline of marriage and the family, \nwhich began to make cultural inroads in the 1960s, and conclude that \nthis vast cultural experiment has been a very harmful one, particularly \nharmful on children. That experiment, of course, continues today, but \nthere are indications America is beginning to reevaluate that \nexperiment, to assess where it is heading, and whether, as a people, we \nneed to correct course.\n  A vitally important part of this assessment is to study the social \nscience data regarding what happens when sexuality and children are \ntaken outside\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\nof the context of marriage and what happens when marriage declines as \nan institution as a result of a culture in which divorced or out-of-\nwedlock births, cohabitation, and single parenthood have become a \nsocial norm.\n  One of the central questions before our society right now is whether \nthis course is desirable and, if not, what can be done to avert it. \nParticularly important is what the social science evidence has to tell \nabout how children have been affected by the weakening of the \ninstitution of marriage over the last 40 years. It is incumbent upon \nthose who deal with public policy issues to investigate this trend and \nits consequences on society.\n  A very wise man who served in this body for a number of years, the \nlate Democratic Senator from New York, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, was a \ngreat cultural commentator. He once wrote this:\n\n       [T]he central conservative truth is that it is culture, not \n     politics, that determines the success of a society. The \n     central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture \n     and save it from itself.\n\n  I think we see both truths in action in this debate.\n  Senator Moynihan also wrote:\n\n       [T]he principal objective of American government at every \n     level should be to see that children are born into intact \n     families and that they remain so.\n\n  The ``principal objective,'' according to the late-Senator Moynihan.\n  I have no doubt about what the outcome of this debate over an \namendment to protect marriage would be if more of us in the public \npolicy arena adhered to this principle, because seeing to it ``that \nchildren are born into intact families and that they remain so'' is, in \na nutshell, what this whole debate is all about. And the only way to \nachieve that laudable aim is to protect the traditional meaning of \nmarriage as the union between one man and one woman and prevent rogue \njudges from defining marriage out of existence.\n  The costs to our society, should Federal judges force the States to \nrecognize the legal equivalence of same-sex unions, would be \nsignificant--even disastrous--when measured in terms of the effects on \nour central social institution, the family.\n  Marriage is at the center of the family, and the family is the basis \nof society itself. The Government's interest in the marriage bond, and \nthe reason it treats heterosexual unions in a manner unlike all other \nrelationships, is closely related to the welfare of children. \nGovernment registers and endorses marriage between a man and a woman in \norder to ensure a stable environment for the raising and nurturing of \nchildren. Social science on this matter is conclusive: Children need \nboth a mom and a dad.\n  Study after study shows children do best in a home with a married, \nbiological mother and father, and the Government has a special \nresponsibility to safeguard the needs of children. The social costs of \nnot doing so are tremendous. Child Trends, a mainstream child welfare \norganization, has noted:\n\n       [R]esearch clearly demonstrates that family structure \n     matters for children, and the family structure that helps the \n     most is a family headed by two biological parents in a low-\n     conflict marriage. Children in single-parent families, \n     children born to unmarried mothers, and children in \n     stepfamilies or cohabitating relationships face higher risks \n     of poor outcomes. . . . There is thus value for children in \n     promoting strong, stable marriages between biological \n     parents.\n\n  Giving public sanction to homosexual ``marriage'' would violate this \nGovernment responsibility to safeguard the needs of children by placing \nindividual adult desires above the best interests of children. There is \nno reliable social science data demonstrating that children raised by \nsame-sex couples do as well as children raised by married, heterosexual \nparents. Redefining marriage is certain to harm children and the \nbroader social good if that redefinition weakens Government's \nlegitimate goal of encouraging men and women who intend on having \nchildren to get married.\n  If the experience of the last 40 years tells us anything, it is that \nthe consequences of weakening the institution of marriage are tragic \nfor society at large. While it has become fashionable to champion a \nwide variety of ``alternative family forms,'' it is abundantly clear \nthat children are much less likely to thrive in the absence of their \nbiological father. Children who grow up without their fathers are two \nto three times more likely to fail in school, and two to three times \nmore likely to suffer from an emotional or behavioral problem. They can \nachieve, but it is a much more difficult route.\n  I have a series of charts to share with my colleagues to make this \npoint.\n  Developmental problems are less common in two-parent families. To \nshow where this goes, they are five times more likely to be poor. \nNearly 80 percent of all children suffering long-term poverty come from \nbroken or never-married families--80 percent of all children suffering \nlong-term poverty.\n  I want to show this chart to my colleagues. Eighty percent of \nchildren suffering long-term poverty come from broken or never-married \nfamilies.\n  The crisis of child poverty in this country is, in large degree, a \ncrisis of marriage. The percentage of children in intact families \nliving in poverty is very small compared to those in families where the \nfather is not present.\n  I want to show another chart to my colleagues: Percentage of children \nin poverty in 2000. You can see across the chart, for children in \nnever-married families, 67 percent of the children are in poverty. If \nyou go down on the chart to those children in families where the \nparents are in their first marriage, where the parents stay in that \nunion, less than 12 percent of the children are in poverty.\n  Marriage has the effect of lifting families and children out of \npoverty. After the birth of a child out of wedlock, only 17 percent of \npoverty-level income mothers and children remain poor if the mother \nmarries the child's father. More than half of those mothers and \nchildren remain poor if the mother remains single.\n  That is shown on this chart. If the mother remains single, over half \nremain below the poverty level. If she gets married, less than 17 \npercent remain below the poverty level.\n  Divorce, on the other hand, impoverishes families and children. It \nhas been estimated that the average income of families with children \ndeclines by 42 percent after divorce.\n  This is the impact of divorce on the income of families with \nchildren. As this chart shows, you can see, after divorce, the income \nlevel of that average family declines 42 percent. Divorce is a key \ncontributor and creator of child poverty.\n  Children who grow up fatherless are also at a much increased risk of \nserious child abuse. A child whose mother cohabits with a man who is \nnot the child's father is 33 times more likely to suffer abuse than a \nchild living with both biological parents in an intact marriage--33 \ntimes more likely to suffer child abuse.\n  You can see the child abuse levels in families: with married \nbiological parents, comparative rates of abuse, 1 percent; biological \nmother cohabiting, 33 percent. Indeed, one of the most dangerous \nenvironments for a child today is in a home with a mother cohabiting \nwith someone to whom she is not married. It is an incredibly dangerous \nsituation overall--not for everybody and not in all circumstances, but \nthe numbers just go up dramatically.\n\n  Married mothers are also half as likely to be victims of domestic \nviolence than mothers who have never been married. As teenagers, \nfatherless children are more likely to commit crime, engage in early \nand promiscuous sexual activity, and to commit suicide.\n  It is clear that both children and society as a whole pay an enormous \nprice in fatherless homes.\n  The American people realize this. A Gallup poll from several years \nago showed almost 80 percent of the public agrees with the proposition \nthat ``the most significant family or social problem facing America is \nthe physical absence of the father from the home.''\n  It is a problem that requires urgent attention in our country. Nearly \n25 million children today reside in a home where the father is absent. \nHalf of these children have never stepped foot in their father's home. \nLess than half of all teenagers currently live with their married \nbiological mothers and fathers.\n  That is what this chart shows us. Less than half of all teenagers \nlive with their married biological mothers and fathers.\n  This year, approximately 1 million children will endure the divorce \nof\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\ntheir parents and an additional 1.2 million will be born out of \nwedlock. Altogether, the proportion of children entering broken homes \nhas more than quadrupled since 1950.\n  You can see this chart goes from 1950 up until about the year 2000. \nThis shows children born out of wedlock, children born in previous \nyears whose parents are divorced, and you can see that trend line and \nwhat that has done in America since 1950.\n  This is a crisis for both our children and our country, the fact that \nso many children are growing up without fathers. It has been \nexacerbated by the decline of the institution of marriage. According to \nthe Census Bureau, the number of cohabiting couples has increased from \na half million to almost 5 million in the last 30 years. The number of \nhouseholds with neither marriage nor children present has gone from 7 \nmillion in 1960 to just under 41 million in 2000.\n  All this is not to say that good children cannot be raised in other \nfamily settings. They can. Many healthy children are raised in \ndifficult circumstances. Many single parents struggle heroically and \nsuccessfully to raise good children. Still, social science is clear, \nthe best place for a child is with a mom and a dad. Both are needed.\n  Traditional marriage is a social good because it dramatically reduces \nthe social costs associated with dysfunctional behavior. Supporting and \nstrengthening marriage significantly diminishes public expenditure on \nwelfare, raises government revenues, and produces a more engaged, \nresponsible citizenry.\n\n  There is a real question about the future of societies that do not \nuphold traditional marriage. Once a society loses sight of the central \nimportance of marriage in raising children, the institution can go into \na tailspin. If marriage begins to be viewed as the way two adults make \nknown their love for each other, there is no reason to marry before \nchildren are born rather than after. And if it is immaterial whether a \ncouple should be married before the birth of a child, then why should \nthey marry at all?\n  In Europe, many parents have stopped marrying altogether because they \nno longer view marriage as having anything to do with parenthood or \nchildren. The legalization of same-sex marriage has been instrumental \nin working this change in perspective, leading most to think of \nmarriage as simply the expression of mutual affection between two \nconsenting adults. As a result, couples are marrying later and later \nafter children are born, or simply foregoing marriage altogether. Rates \nof parental cohabitation have skyrocketed, and family dissolution has \nbecome endemic.\n  The experience of other nations demonstrates that the imposition of \nsame-sex ``marriage'' and civil unions leads to a weakening of \nmarriage. As scholar Stanley Kurtz has shown, in Scandinavia, the \nsystem of marriage-like same-sex registered partnerships established in \nthe late 1980s has contributed significantly to the ongoing decline of \nmarriage in that region. In The Netherlands, same-sex marriage has \nincreased the cultural separation of marriage from parenthood, \nresulting in a soaring out-of-wedlock birthrate. Kurtz warns that same-\nsex ``marriage'' could widen the separation between marriage and \nparenthood here in the United States, and perhaps undo the progress we \nhave made in arresting the once seemingly inexorable trend towards \nhigher rates of illegitimacy among some communities in the United \nStates.\n  And Stanley Kurtz is not alone in pointing to the negative effects \nthese developments have had on marriage in The Netherlands.\n  I think it is important to go into this point at some length, because \nwe have a case study of what can happen to the institution of marriage \nwhen it is redefined to include same-sex relationships. We have a case \nstudy. We know what happens when you redefine it. It has happened in \nThe Netherlands.\n  In a letter released just last Thursday addressed to ``parliaments \naround the world debating the issue of same-sex marriage,'' a group of \nDutch scholars raised concerns about gay marriage's negative effects on \nthe institution of marriage in The Netherlands. In a letter published \nin the July 8 edition of a Dutch paper, five Dutch academics suggested \nthat ``there are good reasons to believe the decline in Dutch marriage \nmay be connected to the successful public campaign for the opening of \nmarriage to same-sex couples in The Netherlands.''\n  The letter's signatories came from several academic disciplines, \nincluding the social sciences, philosophy, and law. The scholars \ncaution against attributing all of the recent decline of Dutch marriage \nto the adoption of same-sex marriage, but they did say, ``There are \nundoubtedly other factors which have contributed to the decline of the \ninstitution of marriage in our country. Further scientific research is \nneeded to establish the relative importance of all these factors.'' \nHowever, they conclude, ``At the same time, we wish to note that enough \nevidence of marital decline already exists to raise serious concerns \nabout the wisdom of the efforts to deconstruct marriage in its \ntraditional form.''\n  In recent years, they note, there is statistical evidence of Dutch \nmarital decline, including ``a spectacular rise in the number of \nillegitimate births.'' By creating a social and legal separation \nbetween the ideas of marriage and parenting, these scholars warn, same-\nsex marriage may make young people in The Netherlands feel less \nobligated to marry before having children.\n  The publication of the letter of warning in this Dutch paper was \naccompanied by a front page news story and an interview with two of the \nsignatories. In the interview, Dutch law professor M. van Mourik said \nthat ``the reputation of marriage as an institution [in Holland] is in \nserious decline.'' According to Mourik, the Dutch need to have a \nnational debate on how to restore traditional marriage. The decision to \nlegalize gay marriage, said Mourik, should certainly never have \nhappened. ``In my view that has been an important contributing factor \nto the decline in the reputation of marriage.''\n  One of the letters' other signatories, Dr. Joost van Loon, is a Dutch \ncitizen who heads a research unit on culture and communication at \nBritain's Nottingham Trent University. Van Loon has done comparative \nstudies of family life and sexual attitudes in The Netherlands and \nBritain, and is also acquainted with research on American marriage. Van \nLoon believes that gay marriage has contributed to a decline in the \nreputation of Dutch marriage. He says, it's ``difficult to imagine'' \nthat the Dutch campaign for gay marriage did not have ``serious social \nconsequences,'' said Van Loon, citing ``an intensive media campaign \nbased on the claim that marriage and parenthood are unrelated.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter and \nbackground documentation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Dutch Scholars on SSM\n\n       [New statement. Here it is in Dutch. What follows is an \n     unofficial English translation]\n       At a time when parliaments around the world are debating \n     the issue of same-sex marriage, as Dutch scholars we would \n     like to draw attention to the state of marriage in The \n     Netherlands. The undersigned represent various academic \n     disciplines in which marriage is an object of study. Through \n     this letter, we would like to express our concerns over \n     recent trends in marriage and family life in our country.\n       Until the late 1980's, marriage was a flourishing \n     institution in The Netherlands. The number of marriages was \n     high, the number of divorces was relatively low compared to \n     other Western countries, the number of illegitimate births \n     also low. It seems, however, that legal and social \n     experiments in the 1990's have had an adverse effect on the \n     reputation of man's most important institution.\n       Over the past fifteen years, the number of marriages has \n     declined substantially, both in absolute and in relative \n     terms. In 1990, 95,000 marriages were solemnized (6.4 \n     marriages per 1,000 inhabitants); by 2003, this number had \n     dropped to 82,000 (5.1 marriages per 1,000 inhabitants). This \n     same period also witnessed a spectacular rise in the number \n     of illegitimate births--in 1989 one in ten children were born \n     out of wedlock (11 percent), by 2003 that number had risen to \n     almost one in three (31 percent). The number of never-married \n     people grew by more than 850,000, from 6.46 million in 1990 \n     to 7.32 million in 2003. It seems the Dutch increasingly \n     regard marriage as no longer relevant to their own lives or \n     that of their offspring. We fear that this will have serious \n     consequences, especially for the children. There is a broad \n     base of social and legal research which shows that marriage \n     is the best structure for the successful raising of children. \n     A child that\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\n     grows up out of wedlock has a greater chance of experiencing \n     problems in its psychological development, health, school \n     performance, even the quality of future relationships.\n       The question is, of course, what are the root causes of \n     this decay of marriage in our country. In light of the \n     intense debate elsewhere about the pros and cons of \n     legalising gay marriage it must be observed that there is as \n     yet no definitive scientific evidence to suggest the long \n     campaign for the legalisation of same-sex marriage \n     contributed to these harmful trends. However, there are good \n     reasons to believe the decline in Dutch marriage may be \n     connected to the successful public campaign for the opening \n     of marriage to same-sex couples in The Netherlands. After \n     all, supporters of same-sex marriage argued forcefully in \n     favour of the (legal and social) separation of marriage from \n     parenting. In parliament, advocates and opponents alike \n     agreed that same-sex marriage would pave the way to greater \n     acceptance of alternative forms of cohabitation.\n       In our judgment, it is difficult to imagine that a lengthy, \n     highly visible, and ultimately successful campaign to \n     persuade Dutch citizens that marriage is not connected to \n     parenthood and that marriage and cohabitation are equally \n     valid `lifestyle choices' has not had serious social \n     consequences. There are undoubtedly other factors which have \n     contributed to the decline of the institution of marriage in \n     our country. Further scientific research is needed to \n     establish the relative importance of all these factors. At \n     the same time, we wish to note that enough evidence of \n     martial decline already exists to raise serious concerns \n     about the wisdom of the efforts to deconstruct marriage in \n     its traditional form.\n       Of more immediate importance than the debate about \n     causality is the question what we in our country can do in \n     order to reverse this harmful development. We call upon \n     politicians, academics and opinion leaders to academics and \n     opinion leaders to acknowledge the fact that marriage in The \n     Netherlands is now an endangered institution and that the \n     many children born out of wedlock are likely to suffer the \n     consequences of that development. A national debate about how \n     we might strengthen marriage is now clearly in order.\n           Signed,\n       Prof. M. van Mourik, professor in contract law, Nijmegen \n     University.\n       Prof. A.

(National Longitudinal Survey of \n     Adolescent Health).\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. We have studied this question thoroughly. I and a \nnumber of my distinguished colleagues have held extensive hearings on \nthe importance of protecting and strengthening the institution of \nmarriage. Traditional marriage is a boon to society in a variety of \nways, and government has a vital interest in encouraging and providing \nthe conditions to maintain as many traditional marriages as possible. \nMarriage has economic benefits not only for the spouses but for the \neconomy at large. Even in advanced industrial societies such as ours, \neconomists tell us that the uncounted but real value of home activities \nsuch as child care, senior care, home carpentry, and food preparation \nis still almost as large as the ``official'' economy. Not least of the \nreasons heterosexual marriage is a positive social good is the fact \nthat, in the married state, adults of both sexes are vastly healthier, \nhappier, safer, wealthier and longer lived.\n  It is ironic, then, that the very governments that stand to benefit \nin so many ways from intact, traditional unions have, in recent years, \nseemed determined to follow policies that have the effect of weakening \nmarriage.\n  If the movement for civil unions and same-sex marriage succeeds, we \nmay well be dealing a fatal blow to an already-vulnerable institution. \nIt is possible to lose the institution of marriage in America. And that \nis precisely the hidden agenda of many in this cultural battle: To do \naway with the traditional definition of the family entirely. An \ninfluential organization of lawyers and judges, the American Law \nInstitute, has already recommended sweeping changes in family law that \nwould equalize marriage and cohabitation, extending rights and benefits \nnow reserved for married couples to cohabiting domestic partners, both \nheterosexual and homosexual.\n  Once the process of ``defining marriage down'' begins, it is but a \nshort step to the dissolution of marriage as a vital institution \naltogether.\n  It is incumbent on this Senate to protect the institution of marriage \nfrom this vast social experiment to redefine it out of existence. I \nurge my colleagues to vote for this constitutional amendment and to do \nso now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                   Death of American Soldiers In Iraq\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, over 11,212 constitutional amendments have \nbeen offered in Congress since the Bill of Rights was ratified. As I \nsaid here this morning, I certainly understand the depth of feeling of \nthe Senators who have spoken on this issue. I watched the Presiding \nOfficer speak this morning. I watched the Senator from Texas, the \nSenator from Kansas. I have tried to follow the debate very closely. I \nknow the intensity of their feelings on this matter.\n  I would like to change direction a little bit and get back to some of \nother topics that are also important. One of the issues I wanted to \ntalk about is what is going on in Iraq. Over the weekend, I don't know \nhow many soldiers were killed in Iraq. It was more than 10, probably \n12.\n  In today's paper, the Washington Post, on page A11, there is a very \nshort story: ``Insurgents Kill Three U.S. Troops in Northern Iraq.'' \nBut if you read more closely, this very short story talks about the \ndeath of not three but seven American soldiers.\n  This has become so routine, the death of our military in Iraq, that \nwe bury it someplace in the back of the newspapers.\n  This is a large newspaper, the Washington Post. I would not be \nsurprised if most papers in the country don't even have a story on it--\nseven soldiers killed. Between the publication of this yesterday \nmorning and today, seven soldiers were killed, all with families.\n  Today, in America, there are people who are still crying and will cry \nfor weeks and will never forget the deaths of their loved ones--sons, \nhusbands, neighbors.\n\n[[Page S7929]]\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to the depth of the feeling we have on \nthis constitutional amendment now before the body, let's understand \nthat we have a war going on in Iraq, and our men and women are being \nkilled on a daily basis in significant numbers. I hope we will \nunderstand that when we have seven soldiers killed in Iraq, it should \nbe more than a headline on page A-11 of the newspaper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is expected on \nthe floor of the Senate shortly to file cloture on the resolution \ncurrently pending. I must say I am baffled by the decisions and actions \ntaken by the majority on occasions such as this. I am baffled because \nwhen I left on Friday, I had made a proposal to the majority leader \nthat we were prepared for an up-or-down vote on this resolution, with 2 \ndays of debate, and we would move on, preferably, hopefully, to \nhomeland security. I left with the understanding that would be the \norder.\n  I find now, for reasons that are still unclear to me, it is the \nmajority that is unwilling to accept that unanimous consent request. We \nhave no objections on our side, none. We could go to that resolution \nunder unanimous consent, with no amendments, with an up-or-down vote. I \nhave told several of our colleagues that would be the order, having had \nthe conversation I did with Senator Frist. So it is an amazing position \nto be in to come back today and realize that it is the majority that \ncannot produce the unanimous consent request that would allow us the \nvote we expected we would have on Friday. Of course, this is on top of \nthe unanimous consent vote we were expecting to have last week with \nregard to amendments and an ultimate final passage on class action. So \nwe will have wasted a couple of weeks once again. I don't know how many \nweeks we have wasted this year. I am going to go back and try to find \nout how many weeks have been totally devoid of any legislative \naccomplishments.\n  In spite of the fact that we have agreed, I hear all these charges of \nobstructionism. The obstructionism oftentimes is on the other side. \nThey cannot get their act together. That is clearly the case here. No \none should be misled. No one should misunderstand why we are having to \ndeal with a cloture motion on the motion to proceed, because our \nRepublican friends don't have one version, they have now several \nversions they would like to bring to the Senate floor to have voted on \nbecause they cannot agree on one version. That is the truth.\n\n  It is all the more ironic and troubling because this is legislation \nthat ought to go through the committee, if any should go through. We \nare treating this as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We are amending \nthe U.S. Constitution, and we are bringing language to the floor of the \nSenate that hasn't had the benefit of consideration in committee, \nhasn't had the hearings, hasn't had the vote. We are treating it as \njust another old amendment.\n  This is an amendment that will be added to a document that is \nprecious, that we treasure, that we ought to have respect for. Frankly, \nto be in a situation like we are in now, to be forced into a debate \nunder these circumstances, is just wrong.\n  I intend to make a unanimous consent request. I will wait until the \nmajority leader comes to the Senate floor to do so, but I will then ask \nunanimous consent that we have an arrangement like I thought we were \nscheduled to agree to last Friday; that is, we take up this resolution, \nwe have a good debate, we have a vote, and then we move on. Under these \ncircumstances, we could be at this for weeks, if not months, given all \nof the other pressing issues we must face. We have yet to deal with \nappropriations bills. We have just been briefed about the serious \nthreat our country is facing--arguably as great a threat as any we have \nseen since 9/11--and we have yet to pass a homeland security bill. We \nhave yet to pass the railroad security bill. We have yet to pass \nlegislation to deal with our porous borders, our ports, our railroad \ntunnels. We have yet to find ways in which to help first responders. \nBut somehow we can add amendment after amendment on gay marriage.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter that Lynne Cheney had right this \nweekend. The wife of the Vice President said this ought to be left to \nthe States. The wife of the Vice President was right. We ought to \nlisten to her advice and let the States continue to make these \ndecisions, and we ought to get on with the business of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I know the majority leader is coming to \nthe Senate floor, and I know the Democratic leader has kindly waited \nuntil he has arrived to make his unanimous consent request.\n  In the couple of minutes that remain until he gets here, I would like \nto offer my own response, not on behalf of anybody else other than this \none Senator from Texas. I, frankly, don't think it is a waste of time \nto talk about the institution of the American family, traditional \nmarriage, which is my strong belief. I don't think the American people \nfeel it is a waste of time. We have a lot of important issues to \ndiscuss. I certainly think this deserves to be at the top of the list, \nalthough there are certainly many important issues.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. As soon as I get through, I will be glad to.\n  One of the concerns I personally have about the unanimous consent \nrequest that will be proffered is it would not allow for any amendments \nto be made. I just point out to the distinguished Democratic leader my \nown concern that, as he pointed out, this has not actually been voted \nout by the Judiciary Committee, but it has been through a number of \ncommittee hearings, three of which I have chaired, and I believe there \nhave been at least two others chaired on this important issue by the \nJudiciary Committee and others.\n  I am concerned with the offer that we have an up-or-down vote on this \nmatter on Wednesday, without the opportunity for anyone to offer \namendments. That is a concern I have shared with the majority leader \nand others. Indeed, it was just last week on the class action bill, \nwhere the majority leader offered that piece of legislation but filled \nthe amendment tree so there was no opportunity for our friends on the \nother side to offer an amendment, they objected mightily because no \namendments were allowed. So I remind my colleagues that if it is a \nconcern that you cannot offer amendments on a piece of ordinary \nlegislation, it is doubly a matter of concern--at least it is to me, \nand I speak for myself--where there would be no opportunity to offer \namendments on this legislation.\n  Finally, it is my understanding that a cloture motion is being \ncirculated. So we are not talking about weeks and months of debate on \nthis issue; I think we are talking about a matter of days. I believe we \nought to have a full and fair debate and let everybody have a chance to \nbe heard.\n  So far, we have not heard very much from our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle on this issue. There have been some who, like the \nDemocratic leader, have said we ought to leave it to the States. I and \nothers have tried to articulate why that is not possible. I wish it was \npossible.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield now for a question?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I will be glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is no one who disagrees this matter \nshould not be debated, but the Senator from Texas has indicated there \nshould be a full and complete debate. We have agreed to debate it for \nhowever long he wants. Our suggestion is 2 days. Does the Senator think \nthe debate should be more than 2 days? If not, for how many days does \nhe think it should be?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I think 2 days of good, strong debate would not be a bad \nidea, but I would not want to, at least up front, totally preclude the \npossibility of offering any amendments, and that may, indeed, \nnecessitate longer debate, depending on what happens during the course \nof the give-and-take on the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Again, through the Chair to my distinguished colleague from \nTexas, he also understands one of the ways we get bogged down on \nissues--on some occasions, not always--is by unlimited amendments. The \nSenator from Texas will recall in the matter dealing with class action, \nthere was no desire on our behalf, that is, the minority, to\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\nhave unlimited amendments. We indicated we would have a limited number \nof amendments.\n  On this constitutional amendment, the Senator understands if the \nmajority offers an amendment, we have people on our side who are \nchamping at the bit to offer amendments. Does the Senator understand \nthat?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I was not aware, Mr. President, that our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle had any interest in offering any amendments \nor really debating this subject very much, for that matter, given their \nabsence on the floor today. I was not aware of any amendments that \nmight be offered by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I \nthink that is not a bad idea myself.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, again I say through the Chair to my \ndistinguished colleague, he also understands, under the rules in the \nSenate, it would be very easy to delay this process for at least a \ncouple weeks. As the Senator knows, we have all kinds of legislation to \ndo, some of which was laid out by the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  We believe--I am speaking for myself--it would be in the interest of \nthe Senate if we could dispose of this amendment that was brought to \nthe Senate floor at an early date and, the time we would want to debate \nit, of course, would be up to the majority leader. We are willing to \ndebate it for whatever time the Senator believes appropriate. Two days \nis certainly appropriate.\n  I would also say to my distinguished colleague, we had people speak \non the amendment today on this side. I spoke this morning before the \nSenator from Texas arrived. I know Senator Feinstein has spoken, and \nthere are others who certainly will speak at some time. The fact there \nhas been more Republicans than Democrats speaking on the amendment \ntoday does not take away from the serious view we have of this most \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the questions and the \nopportunity the Democratic whip has given to respond, but that has not \nchanged my view that it is not a good idea for this body, on something \nas serious as a constitutional amendment, to have one on the Senate \nfloor, but then enter into a unanimous consent agreement that no \namendments be considered. I agree time is precious, especially with the \nshort time that remains for legislative action, but I do think on \nsomething as fundamental as the American family and preservation of \ntraditional marriage that a little bit of time--certainly a couple of \ndays, maybe even a week I would be willing to do if it was necessary to \nactually get some action to address this important issue. I would \npersonally want to take longer. Here I defer to the discussions between \nthe distinguished Democratic leader and the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will respond. As I understand it, \nSenator Frist is not planning to come to the floor in the immediate \ntime period, but I will just say, as the distinguished Senator from \nTexas knows, a constitutional debate is a different kind of debate on \nthe Senate floor. This is not any other bill. The debate, of course, \nlast week had to do with whether we could use the so-called class \naction bill as a vehicle to raise other issues that are of great \nimportance to us in statutory form. This is a constitutional amendment, \namending the Constitution of the United States, therefore leaving open \nother amendments relating to the Constitution.\n  Somebody could offer an amendment eliminating the first amendment, \nmodifying the first amendment, and all it takes is 51 votes. Somebody \ncould offer an amendment--as I understand it, Senator Hollings is \nthinking very seriously about offering an amendment limiting campaign \nspending. That is actually one amendment that I have supported in the \npast. That takes 51 votes.\n  Anyone who thinks that whatever amendments would be offered would be \nsimply relevant to marriage I think would be faced with a rude \nawakening that this could open up the whole Constitution to a series of \namendments, and maybe a good discussion about some of these other \nissues may be warranted. Again, it is a question of time.\n  It is a question of thoughtful consideration about whether we want to \namend the Constitution in ways outside of marriage for which there have \nnot been hearings. I am told there was one hearing on this particular \ntext, but most of the hearings that have been held have been held on \nthe general issue of amending the Constitution and defining marriage.\n  There is no argument, in my view, among many of us, most of us, about \nwhether a marriage ought to be between a man and a woman. It ought to. \nThe real question is whether or not we ought to amend the U.S. \nConstitution, and then if we open it up to amendment, whether we ought \nto amendment it in other ways as well, including campaign finance \nreform, maybe victims' rights, maybe limitations on the first \namendment. Others have suggested an amendment on flag burning. There \nare a lot of amendments out there. In fact, I am told in the 108th \nCongress, just last week I was informed that 67 constitutional \namendments have been proposed in this Congress, in the 108th Congress. \nI am quite sure, of course, that not all of them were offered in the \nSenate.\n  I can just imagine the array of ideas presented by our colleagues \nregarding amending the U.S. Constitution. As I say, it takes 51 votes. \nUltimately, of course, it takes 67 votes to pass whatever package has \nbeen approved. But that is what we get ourselves into. We need to think \nvery carefully. We all say we would support and defend the Constitution \neach time we are sworn in as a U.S. Senator--support and defend the \nConstitution. Some of us see this as supporting and defending the \nConstitution in its most important way. So we do not take lightly these \nchallenges, these situations.\n  I will say again, I think it is regrettable we have not been able to \nreach a unanimous consent agreement on how to proceed. We are actually \ngoing to vote on a motion to proceed without knowing what proceeding \nmeans because we do not have any way of knowing how many different \nideas for amending the Constitution will be offered.\n  As the Senator from Nevada noted, we could be on this for a long \ntime.\n  I will wait to proffer this request, and if I am not here, I know the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader will offer this consent \nrequest, but we will be prepared to offer it at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, over the course of Friday, through the \nweekend and through today, we have been discussing the process for \nconsideration of the marriage amendment. We have had a good discussion, \ngood debate in the Senate both Friday and today in talking about the \nsubstance of the underlying amendment.\n  There has been frustration expressed on the other side of the aisle \nthat we had not agreed to their unanimous consent agreement. This \nstarted discussions within the last week of a proposal that had been \nmade to have debate and then a vote on the one amendment. I appreciate \nboth sides of the aisle talking, trying to bring this to appropriate \nclosure.\n  As majority leader, as I told the assistant Democratic leader at the \nend of last week, I thought it was very important to consult the rest \nof my colleagues beginning Friday afternoon. We had the discussion \nFriday and into today. After consultation with my colleagues, I found \nthere is great interest in offering one amendment which is literally a \none-sentence amendment. The Democratic leader has made statements in \nthe Senate and made mention that the overall process could take a long \nperiod of time. I disagree. I don't think this needs to be a long, \narduous process.\n  From this side of the aisle, we have offered an agreement that allows \nfor two votes, one on the Allard amendment and then a one-sentence \namendment. We are giving the other side of the aisle both of those \namendments. This does not have to be a difficult process. It does not \nhave to be as difficult as portrayed by the other side.\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\nWe can be done with the whole process by 1 o'clock on Wednesday. That \nwould be the plan. I don't think this is an inordinate amount of time \nto spend on such an important issue to the American people.\n  I find a lot of the comments that have been made interesting because \nwe have had our share of difficulties in moving as expeditiously on any \npiece of legislation recently, and now we have a proposed agreement by \nthe other side of the aisle for a very quick vote. There seems to be, \nfrom their standpoint, this disbelief that we might have an amendment.\n  There are many important issues to be considered by the Senate. I \nwish we did not have as much delay so we could schedule them in a \ntimely way. This particular matter on marriage is a very important \nmatter. We can handle this constitutional amendment in a very \nresponsible, judicious, and civil way. That is certainly my intent.\n  We have offered a unanimous consent agreement to do this. I am \nawaiting an answer from the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the problem with what has transpired over \nthe weekend is Senator Daschle and I spent Friday until somewhat late \nin the afternoon calling Democrat Senators to see if they would be \nwilling to go forward on gay marriage without offering any amendments. \nThere really was a kickback from a number of the Senators saying they \nhad amendments to offer. We were able to contact Senators and convince \nthem it was the best thing for the Senate to go directly to a vote on \nthe amendment. This was reported in the Senate.\n  We simply are unable to agree to the suggestion of the Senator from \nTennessee, the distinguished majority leader, because if you offer an \namendment, we offer an amendment, it would just go on forever.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the motion to proceed to S.J. \nResolution 40 be agreed to, that no amendments or motions be in order \nto the joint resolution, and that the Senate vote on passage of the \njoint resolution at 12 noon on Wednesday, July 14.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I \nmentioned in my comments a few moments ago, from our side of the aisle \nthere is a wish to offer one other amendment. Again, it is an amendment \nwe presented to the other side of the aisle.\n  I, as majority leader, do not want to cut off that discussion, that \ndebate, because this obviously is a very important consideration \ndealing with marriage.\n  That being the case, I would ask the assistant Democratic leader to \nmodify his unanimous consent request with the following:\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that the motion to proceed be \n     agreed to; provided further that the only amendments in order \n     to the resolution be a first-degree amendment offered by \n     Senator Allard and a first-degree amendment to be offered by \n     Senator Smith; provided further that no other amendments or \n     motions be in order to the joint resolution, and that all \n     debate time on the resolution and amendments be equally \n     divided between the chairman and ranking member or their \n     designees; provided further that at 12 noon, on Wednesday, \n     July 14, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Allard \n     amendment, to be followed by a vote on the Smith amendment, \n     to be followed by third reading and a vote on passage of S.J. \n     Res. 40, again, as amended, if amended, with no other \n     intervening action or debate.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so amend his request?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, here is the \nquandary in which we find ourselves. If amendments are offered to a \nconstitutional amendment on the floor, it only takes a simple majority \nof the Senate to amend the resolution that is on the floor.\n  So let's assume that someone offers an amendment dealing with flag \nburning, even though it takes 67 votes to pass a constitutional \namendment dealing with flag burning, by a simple majority that could be \nattached to S.J. Res. 40. Or let's assume that in addition to that, \nsomeone offers an amendment on victims' rights. Again, it would take 67 \nvotes to pass a constitutional amendment. But in this instance, it \nwould take 51.\n  So we would have this gay marriage amendment strapped with not only \nthe gay marriage amendment--in whatever fashion we find that with the \namendments suggested by the distinguished majority leader--but it would \nalso have a flag burning amendment attached to it. It would have a \nvictims' rights amendment attached to it. And Senator Hollings, as we \nall know, wants to offer an amendment dealing with campaign finance \nreform. So it just will not work.\n  I know how hard the distinguished majority leader is trying to work \nsomething out, but I think he is going down the wrong road. What we \nshould do is get rid of this amendment. And I do not say that in any \nderogatory fashion. I say ``get rid of'' so we can go to other matters; \nwe can go to something that we need to work on Wednesday afternoon.\n  In a colloquy I had with the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. \nCornyn, former attorney general of the great State of Texas, he said: \nWe need sufficient time to discuss this amendment. I said: Two days? \nThat is what we have agreed to. If you want 3 days, we will do that.\n  So we are trying to be reasonable. I know how strongly people feel \nabout this issue, but we cannot accept a modification. Therefore, Mr. \nPresident, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not modify his request.\n  Does the majority leader object?\n  Mr. FRIST. Reserving the right to object, and I plan to object, Mr. \nPresident, but just to clarify, our unanimous consent request is just \ntwo amendments and not opening it up to other amendments like a flag \nburning amendment, victims' rights, or other amendments.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand that.\n  Mr. FRIST. So our intent is to very much keep it very controlled in \nthe consideration of amendments. With that being the case, having heard \nthe objection to the modification, I object to the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk to the \npending motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 620, S.J.

Mr. President, if I could be heard very briefly. I know the \ntime is late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we on this side are disappointed with the \nobjection that the distinguished majority leader made to our request. \nBut I would like to add that upon the disposition of this matter, the \nmarriage amendment, we are prepared to proceed to the consideration of \nthe Homeland Security appropriations bill, not under the restrictions \nthat were suggested by the distinguished Senator from Alaska, but we \nare willing to work with the majority on coming up with some way to \nproceed to that most important legislation. We would hope the majority \nwould consider going to that, if not next, soon thereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of the assistant \nDemocratic leader. Since last week, we have been in discussion, and we \nare working closely with Senator Stevens, the distinguished chairman, \nand others in terms of an appropriate arrangement to proceed to \nhomeland security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the live quorum as \nrequired under rule XXII be waived; provided further that \nnotwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII this vote occur at 12 noon \non Wednesday, July 14.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget \nscorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under \nSection 308(b) and in aid of Section 311 of the Congressional Budget \nAct of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate \nscorekeeping of Section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the First Concurrent \nResolution on the Budget for 1986.\n  This report shows the effects of congressional action on the 2004 \nbudget through June 25, 2004--the last day that the Senate was in \nsession before the recent recess. The estimates of budget authority, \noutlays, and revenues are consistent with the technical and economic \nassumptions of the 2004 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget, H. Con. \nRes. 95, as adjusted.\n  The estimates show that current level spending is above the budget \nresolution by $8.6 billion in budget authority and by $28 million in \noutlays in 2004. Current level for revenues is $3.1 billion above the \nbudget resolution in 2004.\n  Since my last report dated April 20, 2004, the Congress has cleared \nand the President has signed the following acts which changed budget \nauthority, outlays, or revenues for 2004: the Surface Transportation \nExtension Act of 2004, Part II--P.L. 108-224; the TANF and Related \nPrograms Continuation Act of 2004--P.L. 108-262; the Surface \nTransportation Extension Act of 2004, Part III--P.L. 108-263; the Child \nNutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004--P.L. 108-265; and, an \nact approving the renewal of import restrictions contained in the \nBurmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003--P.L. 108-272. In addition, \nthe Congress has cleared for the President's signature H.R. 4103, the \nAfrican Growth and Opportunity Acceleration Act of 2004.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the budget scorekeeping report be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2004.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed tables show the effects of \n     Congressional action on the 2004 budget and are current \n     through June 25, 2004 (the last day that the Senate was in \n     session before the recent recess).

MAZIK\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I want to take a few minutes to \nremember Ronald R. Mazik and pay tribute to the many contributions he \nhas made to his community, to his profession, and to this country.\n  Ron played many roles and achieved much in his lifetime. As an \nathlete, engineer and businessman, he excelled in a wide array of \nendeavors. Of his many achievements, one is particularly deserving of \nmention: as a pioneer in the field of telehealth.\n\n[[Page S7933]]\n\n  Ron conceptualized and initiated innovations in the use of video and \nadvanced communication systems, which are revolutionizing the way \nhealth services are provided to people with exceptional needs. His \nseminal work in interactive video promises to improve both the \naccessibility and quality of supports to those with developmental, \nmental and physical challenges, and brings us closer to our dream of \ninsuring that all citizens lead a full and healthy life. The intellect \nand energy that Ron applied toward that goal must be regarded as an \nolympic performance.\n  Of Ron's contributions to the field of telehealth and to society, \nthose close to him knew that he most valued his role as a father to his \nsons, Ron and Ken. With his many accomplishments, he unfailingly looked \nto his sons as his greatest source of pride and of joy.\n  It is an honor to recognize Ronald R. Mazik for his contributions to \nall of our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7933-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF JAMES E. McMULLEN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I rise to honor James E. McMullen, \nDeputy Assistant Secretary, Budget and Strategic Planning of the \nDepartment of Labor on the occasion of his retirement. In his capacity \nas Deputy Assistant Secretary, Mr. McMullen was responsible for the \nDepartment's management and implementation of the Government \nPerformance and Results Act, GPRA, and provided senior departmental \nstaff with recommendations, guidance, and assistance in making \ndecisions and selecting appropriate alternatives to meet short- and \nlong-range budget goals. Mr. McMullen was also responsible for the \ndevelopment of policies, systems, and procedures for the Department's \nbudget of $60 billion, and was charged with planning, directing, and \ncoordinating the formulation and presentation of the Department's \nbudget submissions to the Office of Management and Budget and to \nCongress.\n  Mr. McMullen has served as Associate Deputy Secretary of Labor. In \nthat position he assisted the Deputy Secretary in the Development of \npositions on major policy issues and provided policy guidance and \nprogram direction to Assistant Secretaries.\n  Mr. McMullen previously served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary for \nAdministration and Management. In that position, he was responsible for \nthe day-to-day management of the Department's budget, human resources, \ninformation technology, administrative services, grant and contract \npolicy, civil rights, and safety and health.\n  Mr. McMullen served as the Department of Labor's Budget Director for \nseveral years. He joined the Department's Office of Budget in August \n1980 and held several positions of increasing responsibility. Mr. \nMcMullen came to the Department of Labor as a Presidential management \nintern. During his internship, he worked for the House Appropriations \nCommittee and the Office of Management and Budget, as well as several \nlocations within the Department.\n  In April 2004 he received the Philip Arnow Award, which is the \nhighest honor given to a career employee in the Department of Labor. In \n1999 he received the Meritorious Executive Rank Award, and he has \nreceived special recognition from the William A. Jump Memorial \nFoundation for his outstanding achievements in public service.\n  I have been either chairman or ranking member of the Labor-HHS-\nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee since January 1989, working in \npartnership with Senator Tom Harkin. For all these years, Jim McMullen \nhas been a fixture at our budget hearings, and has provided outstanding \nassistance to our committee. His will be hard shoes to fill, and he \nwill be missed. We wish him well in his future endeavors, and thank him \nfor his dedication to duty, hard work, and professionalism that set \nsuch a high standard for others to follow in public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7933-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AMERICAN LEGION PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT COMMANDER ROBERT D. ``BOB'' \n                                SHALALA\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today I recognize an American patriot \nwhose commitment and dedication to the cause of our veterans has been \nlong established. From 1960 to 1964, Bob Shalala served on active duty \nin the United States Navy aboard the U.S.S. Galveston, the U.S.S. \nWright and the U.S.S. Fred T. Berry. Before his active duty ended, he \nserved as the aide to the Commanding Officer of a naval air squadron \nand was also selected to join the Navy's Blue Jacket Choir, which \nentertained audiences around the country. Returning to Pennsylvania, he \nstarted his illustrious 40-year career as a Philadelphia police officer \nand twice was selected as Police Officer of the Year.\n  His remarkable career in the American Legion of Pennsylvania began \nwith the Legion's Philadelphia Police Post. In the next 37 years, Bob \ngave new meaning to the word ``leadership'' as he served in every \nposition from the Post level to District Commander to Sectional \nCommander to the top position--Department Commander. In between, he \nmanaged to chair a host of different committees and served as the \nPennsylvania American Legion top membership recruiter for 2 years while \nplacing second nationally in the Legion's membership effort.\n  Not surprisingly, Bob Shalala's goal as Department Commander over the \npast year has been to improve and promote membership. The American \nLegion in the State of Pennsylvania is the largest in the country and \nthe position of Department Commander is a formidable one. From peers \nand members comes that Bob accepted the challenge of leadership and has \nset a high standard for his successors to emulate. An excellent \nspokesman, Bob Shalala departs his position as Department Commander in \nJuly 2004 with the gratitude of the Department's 240,000 members for a \njob performed exceedingly well. As the mantle of leadership passes to a \nnew Department Commander, I express my gratitude to Bob Shalala for \nserving Pennsylvania veterans with such alacrity and dedication. He has \nfaced the churning sea and completed his mission. In nautical terms \nthat Navy men will understand, I raise high the flag hoist signaling \nBravo Zulu--well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7933-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PENNSYLVANIA AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY PRESIDENT ANN CONEYBEER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today, I honor the many women who serve \nour veterans through their tireless efforts and membership in \nauxiliaries of such organizations as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and \nthe American Legion to name a few. These women, the wives, mothers, \nsisters and daughters of veterans give tirelessly of their time to \nprovide needed assistance and funding to veterans and their families in \nthe communities.\n  In particular, I cite Ann Coneybeer--the outgoing President of the \nPennsylvania American Legion Auxiliary. In July 2004, Ann will complete \nher tour of duty in this elected position.\n  Ann had four brothers who served in World War II thus making her \neligible for membership in the Legion. For the past 41 years she has \nbeen a very active member where she has served as Unit President, \nWestern Vice President and Department Vice President. In between Ann \nheld a number of chairmanships at the State level including Leadership, \nAmericanism, Constitution and By-Laws, Finance, Membership, \nParliamentarian, Poppy and Veterans Affairs & Rehab and Children and \nYouth. Serving as Chairman is often a thankless job, but Ann fulfilled \nthese responsibilities with dedication, energy and persistence.\n  As Ann Coneybeer departs office, I extend to her my thanks and the \nthanks of Pennsylvania veterans and their families for her many years \nof service, for her leadership and, most of all, for her belief in the \ncause of our Nation's veterans and our Nation's principles. She is \ntruly a great American and it is a privilege that I honor her today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7933-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7933-S7934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH.

On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the\n\n[[Page S7934]]\n\nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On February 10, 2000, in Bay Shore, NY, Javier Morales was charged \nwith allegedly assaulting a man he believed was gay.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7934-1", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RETIREMENT OF DR. TALLEY\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nwork of a wonderfully talented individual, whose leadership has helped \nthe University of South Dakota Medical School grow, and advance an \nexcellent reputation within the national health care community during \nhis 17-year tenure as dean. At the age of 68, Dr. Robert Talley retires \nfrom his role as dean to become the University of South Dakota's \ninterim director for internal medicine residency in Sioux Falls, where \nhe will continue to teach and guide our South Dakota medical community.\n  Dr. Talley graduated from the University of Michigan in 1958 and from \nthe University of Chicago Medical School in 1962. He went on to Yale \nNew Haven Hospital where he pursued an internship and residency. He \nthen completed cardiology and clinical pharmacology fellowships at \nGrady Memorial Hospital in 1969.\n  Dr. Talley's career took him to various positions in San Antonio, \nwith the University of Texas Medical School and Veterans Administration \nHospital from 1969 through 1975. He became the chairman of the USD \nDepartment of Internal Medicine in 1975, and was promoted to dean in \n1987. Dr. Talley was a founding member of the Medical Service Plan, the \npredecessor of University Physicians.\n  While Dr. Talley served as dean, the medical school received full \naccreditation during each review. Dr. Talley developed a model of \nmedical student clinical education, which is considered cutting edge in \nthe United States, and helped to form unique partnerships with the \nSouth Dakota Health Science Research Foundation and the Wegner Health \nScience Information Center. In the past 5 years, funded research in the \nbasic biomedical sciences division alone grew 189 percent, resulting in \ngreat part from Dr. Talley's reorganization of the basic biomedical \nsciences division at the university. Dr. Talley provided outstanding \nleadership in medical education and is responsible for significant \ninnovation in USD's approach to the education of South Dakota's health \ncare providers.\n  At the national level, Talley is a member of the Liaison Committee on \nMedical Education, which accredits 125 undergraduate medical education \nprograms in the United States. He served as chair of the American \nMedical Association Section on Medical Schools and chair of the \nInternal Medicine Committee, National Board of Medical Examiners. Most \nrecently, the American College of Physicians--American Society of \nInternal Medicine bestowed a Mastership rank on Dr. Talley in \nrecognition of his distinguished contributions to internal medicine.\n  Dr. Talley could have devoted his talents to private practice. But \ninstead he chose to be an educator--he chose to use his skills in a \nmanner that would enable him to reach a wide circle of individuals and \nwhich has had profoundly important public policy consequences.\n  He knows his students by name and utilizes the wide range of his \nstudents' abilities to enhance classroom discussion. His approach to \nteaching enriches health education on multiple levels that will prepare \nstudents for real-life situations in working with patients. Dr. \nTalley's impact on the University of South Dakota, its students and \nfaculty, and on the entire State will be felt for generations to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7934-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KENT A.

Smith. For the past quarter century, \nMr. Smith, as deputy director, has managed the day-to-day operation of \nthe National Library of Medicine, a part of the National Institutes of \nHealth, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The National \nLibrary of Medicine is the largest medical library in the world, and it \nserves as the indispensable hub of national and international \nscientific medical communication.\n  The administrative and managerial astuteness of Mr. Smith has \nconverted the vision of the Library's directors, Donald A.B. Lindberg, \nM.D., and his predecessor, Martin M. Cummings, M.D., into outstanding \noperational programs. There are many examples. One of the great success \nstories at the Library and the National Institutes of Health in the \nlast decade is the National Center for Biotechnology Information. This \ninstitution, which serves as the collector and disseminator of \nmolecular sequence data resulting from the Human Genome Program, is \nabsolutely indispensable to the conduct of 21st century biomedical \nscience. Its various web services are used almost a billion times each \nyear by people around the globe. Mr. Smith provided invaluable support \nto members of the House and Senate, and their staff, in developing the \nlegislation that created the center.\n  He has also been closely associated with the amazingly successful \nentry of the National Library of Medicine into the world of web-based \nconsumer health information relied on by millions of Americans. His \nskill at managing people and budgets has allowed the Library to move \nbeyond its traditional emphasis on serving exclusively scientists and \nhealth professionals. Today, such heavily used consumer information \nservices as MedlinePlus, ClinicalTrials.gov, NIHSeniorHealth.gov, and \nthe Household Products Database are testimony to his success in \nadministering such a diverse institution as the Library now is.\n  Kent Smith, trained in mathematics, economics, and management, is \nknown to medical librarians around the world. In our country he has had \nclose ties to the 5,000 member institutions of the National Network of \nLibraries of Medicine, and he has championed their cause in many \nvenues. His leadership and tireless efforts have had great impact on \nthe development of federal information policies that ensure broad \npublic access to an expanding universe of electronic government health \ninformation resources.\n  He is also known for his strong leadership of national and \ninternational organizations in the information field. He has served as \nPresident of the National Federation of Abstracting and Indexing \nServices, President of the International Council of Scientific and \nTechnical Information, Chair of the Policy Group of the Federal Library \nand Information Center Committee, Vice President of the UNESCO General \nInformation Program, and Chairman of CENDI, a group of federal \nscientific and technical information and technology managers.\n  I am aware that there are many far-sighted and dedicated managers \nserving the people of the United States. It is a pleasure for me to \nhonor one with whom I am personally acquainted and who, on the occasion \nof his retirement, richly deserves our thanks for a job well \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7934-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7934-S7935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IOWA AMERICAN LEGION AUXILIARY UNITS\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I wish to honor and publicly \nrecognize the 125th anniversary of the founding of the town of Lennox, \nSD. The town of Lennox has a proud past and a promising future. In \n1879, the Milwaukee Railroad established a branch where the town stands \ntoday.\n  The town of Lennox was named after B.G. Lennox, private secretary to \nS.S. Merrill, a railroad executive. By 1880, 90 people lived in Lennox, \nand the town has experienced steady growth since then. The 2000 census \nlisted Lennox as having a population of just over 2,000 people.\n  Lennox is governed by a seven-person city council. There are numerous \nprojects and major developments underway in Lennox. Currently, the city \nis upgrading its water system, with two new water towers and a new well \nto ensure that the city has plenty of water. The Lennox Commercial Club \nhas many of the town's businesses as members and meets monthly to \nsponsor promotions and encourage business growth. An active senior \ncenter, the Good Samaritan Center, the Hilda's Heritage Home all \nprovide support for seniors.\n  Small towns like Lennox are the backbone of rural States such as \nSouth Dakota. A growing community built by good neighbors and a strong \nfoundation is a great place to raise a family. The town has been \ncelebrating throughout the year and is continuing through July with \nevents at the high school, community church and a sauerkraut/polka \nparty on the town's main street. This sort of wholesome, small town \ncelebration is a great example of rural South Dakota's commitment to \ngood values and local history. It is with great honor that I share this \ngreat community with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7935-2", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING GREG CANNELL OF AMERICAN FALLS, IDAHO\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to recognize Mr. Greg Cannell \nof American Falls, ID, for his heroic actions in saving the life of a \nrural mail carrier. Last December, Greg selflessly and fearlessly \njumped into near-freezing waters to save a mail carrier who had skidded \noff a winding mountain road and into the nearby river.\n  On December 1, 2003, Ron Meadville, a rural mail carrier, was \nreturning from his 110-mile route along the remote North Fork road \nnorthwest of Salmon, ID. Greg Cannell and a friend, Tina Taysom, were \ntraveling ahead of Meadville on the same road. Cannell and Taysom \npulled over to look at some deer, and Meadville passed them. When \nCannell pulled back on the road and rounded a bend, he couldn't see the \nmail truck but saw a set of skid marks that veered off the road, toward \nthe near-frozen river. Meadville had hit a patch of ice that sent his \ntruck hurtling over the 25-foot embankment to land upside down in the \nSalmon River, in more than 5 feet of 33-degree water. Greg Cannell \nacted immediately. He stopped his truck, jumped out, slid down the \nsteep embankment and plunged into the river. After several strenuous \nattempts, Cannell was able to pull open the truck door, grab \nMeadville's hand, and pull him out through an opening between the seat \nand the doorjamb. By this time, Meadville was experiencing hypothermia.\n  Cannell and Taysom pulled Meadville up the embankment to their \nvehicle. Meadville managed to tell them that he lived about a mile from \nwhere they were. Cannell took him to his home where he helped \nMeadville's wife care for him. Cannell refused any care for himself \nuntil he knew Meadville was safe.\n  Greg Cannell risked his own life to save a stranger. He refuses to be \ncalled a hero, but he is truly a hero to Ron Meadville and his family. \nWithout his courageous actions, Ron Meadville would not be alive today. \nGreg Cannell's actions truly were heroic and it is a pleasure for me to \nhonor him and share his story.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7935-3", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7935-4", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/07/12/senate-section/article/S7935-5", "month": "07", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7935-S7936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2828.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require an \nannual plan on outreach activities of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I have introduced the Veterans \nBenefits Outreach Act.\n  Caring for our veterans is a commitment that supersedes politics. The \nPresident and Congress are united in our promise to provide veterans \nwith access to quality care and benefits.\n  Spending for veterans medical care has doubled since 1993. President \nBush's budget for the VA increased by 9 percent in fiscal year 2002, 13 \npercent in 2003 and another 4 percent in 2004. We in the Senate passed \na budget resolution calling for another 5 percent increase next year. \nWe have begun giving veterans concurrent receipt of their disability \nand retirement benefits, and are working to fix the survivor benefit \nplan.\n  But what good are these benefits if people don't know they can apply \nfor them? According to an article that ran on the front page of the St. \nPaul Pioneer Press today entitled: ``Wounded and Forgotten,'' there are \nan estimated half a million veterans who are eligible for Federal \ndisability payments but are not receiving them--simply because they \ndon't know that they can.\n  We need to do a better job of educating veterans about their rights. \nTo this end, my legislation calls for the Veterans Administration to \ndevelop a strategy each year to reach out to veterans who are not \ntaking advantage of the programs they're eligible for--to give them a \nchance to make an informed decision about the benefits America has \npromised them.\n  In addition to veterans who are not getting their benefits because \nthey are unaware of them, there are some veterans who know they are \neligible but have been turned away because of lost documents. You see, \nin 1973, the National Personnel Records Center in Missouri caught on \nfire, destroying thousands of veterans' personnel records.\n  The law already calls for the VA to give veterans the benefit of the \ndoubt when they are missing documents that had been destroyed in the \nfire. But it is clear that in practice this is simply not the case. Too \nmany veterans get nothing more than a postcard telling them their case \ncannot be proven because of the destruction of their records three \ndecades ago.\n  It is simply unconscionable that these veterans should have to suffer \nbecause their records were ruined while in the custody of the \ngovernment. To deal with this problem, my legislation also directs the \nVA to set up an appeals process for those whose applications are \nrejected because of documents lost in that fire.\n  My legislation is about going the extra mile to do the right thing. \nThese are not hand-outs, these are not new entitlement programs--these \nare benefits prescribed under the law for people who have already \nqualified for them by serving their country. We must do whatever it \ntakes to give America's veterans the benefits we promised them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2638\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 403\n\n       Whereas approximately 13,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States have serious long-term health conditions that may \n     force them to seek assistance with daily tasks;\n       Whereas 56 percent of the individuals in the United States \n     with serious long-term health conditions are age 65 or older;\n       Whereas the percentage of the population over the age of 65 \n     is expected to rise from 13 percent in 2004 to 20 percent in \n     2020;\n       Whereas 15 percent of all seniors over the age of 65 suffer \n     from depression;\n       Whereas studies have suggested that 25 to 50 percent of \n     nursing home residents are affected by depression;\n       Whereas approximately 1,450,000 people live in nursing \n     homes in the United States;\n       Whereas by 2018 there will be 3,600,000 seniors in need of \n     a nursing home bed, which will be an increase of more than \n     2,000,000 from 2004;\n       Whereas as many as 60 percent of nursing home residents do \n     not have regular visitors;\n       Whereas older patients with significant symptoms of \n     depression have significantly higher health care costs than \n     seniors who are not depressed;\n       Whereas people who are depressed tend to be withdrawn from \n     their community, friends, and family;\n       Whereas the Corporation for National and Community Service \n     (CNS) Senior Corps programs currently provide seniors with \n     the opportunity to serve their communities through the \n     Retired and Senior Volunteer Program, Foster Grandparent \n     Program, and Senior Companion Program;\n       Whereas through the Senior Companion Program in particular, \n     in the 2002 to 2003 program year, more than 17,000 low-income \n     seniors volunteered their time assisting 61,000 frail elderly \n     and homebound individuals who have difficulty completing \n     daily tasks;\n       Whereas numerous volunteer organizations across the United \n     States enable Americans of all ages to participate in similar \n     activities;\n       Whereas Faith in Action, 1 volunteer organization, brings \n     together 40,000 volunteers of many faiths to serve 60,000 \n     people with long-term health needs or disabilities across the \n     country, 64 percent of whom are 65 years of age or older;\n       Whereas the thousands of volunteers that, through the \n     Senior Companion Program and volunteer organizations \n     nationwide, provide companionship and assistance to frail \n     elderly individuals, nursing home residents, and homebound \n     seniors, deserve to be commended for their work;\n       Whereas the demand for these services outstrips the number \n     of volunteers, and organizations are seeking to enlist more \n     individuals in the United States in the volunteer effort;\n       Whereas companionship and assistance programs for seniors \n     with long-term health needs offer many demonstrated benefits, \n     such as: allowing frail elderly individuals to remain in \n     their homes; enabling seniors to maintain independence for as \n     long as possible; providing encouragement and friendship to \n     lonely seniors; and providing relief to home care givers;\n       Whereas regular visitation and assistance is the best way \n     of assuring seniors that they have not been forgotten, and \n     State and local recognition of regular visitation programs \n     can call further attention to the importance of volunteering \n     on an ongoing basis; and\n       Whereas a month dedicated to service for seniors and \n     recognized across the United States will call attention to \n     volunteer organizations serving seniors and provide a \n     platform for recruitment efforts: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of August as ``Service for Seniors \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the need for companionship and assistance \n     with daily tasks among seniors with long-term health \n     conditions throughout the year, and encourages the people of \n     the United States to volunteer regularly at a nursing home or \n     long-term care facility;\n       (3) encourages volunteer organizations that offer \n     companionship and assistance to seniors to incorporate \n     ``Service for Seniors Month'' in their recruitment efforts;\n       (4) encourages individuals in the United States to \n     volunteer in these service organizations in order to give \n     back to a generation that sacrificed so much; and\n       (5) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States and interested \n     groups to observe ``Service for Seniors Month'' with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities that promote awareness \n     of, and volunteer involvement service for, seniors with long-\n     term health needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 123--RECOGNIZING AND HONORING THE LIFE AND \n LEGACY OF ALEXANDER HAMILTON ON THE BICENTENNIAL OF HIS DEATH BECAUSE \nOF HIS STANDING AS ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL FOUNDING FATHERS OF THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. \nLautenberg) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 123\n\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton dedicated his life to serving \n     his adopted country as a Revolutionary soldier, aide-de-camp \n     to General George Washington, Representative to the \n     Continental Congress, member of the New York State Assembly, \n     first Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, and \n     Inspector General of the Army;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was a poor teenage immigrant to \n     New York from the West Indian Islands of Nevis and St. Croix;\n       Whereas in the early days of the Revolutionary War \n     Alexander Hamilton was commissioned as a captain and raised \n     and trained his own New York artillery regiment and served \n     valiantly in the battles of Long Island and Manhattan;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton quickly captured the attention \n     of General George Washington who made him his aide-de-camp \n     and confidant throughout the most difficult days of the \n     Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas in 1781, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Hamilton of \n     the Continental Army led a bold attack of New York troops \n     during the siege of Yorktown, the decisive and final battle \n     of the Revolutionary War;\n       Whereas in 1782, Alexander Hamilton was elected as a member \n     of the Continental Congress from New York;\n       Whereas as a private citizen Alexander Hamilton served many \n     philanthropic causes and was a co-founder of the New York \n     Manumission Society, the first abolitionist organization in \n     New York and a major influence on the abolition of slavery \n     from the State;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was a strong and consistent \n     advocate against slavery and believed that Blacks and Whites \n     were equal citizens and equal in their mental and physical \n     faculties;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was one of the first members of \n     the founding generation to call for a convention to \n     drastically revise the Articles of Confederation;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton joined James Madison in \n     Annapolis, Maryland in 1786 to officially request that the \n     States call a constitutional convention;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was elected as a delegate to the \n     Constitutional Convention of 1787 from New York, where he \n     played an influential role and was the only delegate from New \n     York to sign the Constitution;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the primary author of the \n     Federalist Papers, the single most influential interpretation \n     of American constitutional law ever written;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the most important \n     individual force in achieving the ratification of the \n     Constitution in New York against the strong opposition of \n     many of the delegates to the ratifying convention;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the leading voice of the \n     founding generation in support of the controversial doctrine \n     of judicial review, which is the backbone for the role of the \n     Supreme Court in the constitutional system of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas on September 11, 1789, Alexander Hamilton was \n     appointed by President George Washington to be the first \n     Secretary of the Treasury;\n       Whereas as Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton \n     salvaged the public credit, created the first Bank of the \n     United States, and outlined the basic economic vision of a \n     mixed agricultural and manufacturing society supported by a \n     strong financial system that would underlie the great \n     economic expansion of the United States for the next 2 \n     centuries;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton was the leading proponent among \n     the Founding Fathers of encouraging a strong manufacturing \n     base for the United States in order to create good paying \n     middle-class jobs and encourage a society built on merit \n     rather than class or skin color;\n       Whereas in pursuit of this vision Alexander Hamilton \n     founded The Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures \n     which in turn founded the town of Paterson, New Jersey, one \n     of the first industrial centers of the United States;\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton proposed and oversaw the \n     creation of the Coast Guard for law enforcement in \n     territorial waters of the United States;\n       Whereas in 1798, President John Adams called upon Alexander \n     Hamilton to raise an army in preparation for a possible war \n     with France and, as Inspector General of the Army, he trained \n     a powerful force of well-equipped soldiers who were able to \n     help deter war at this vulnerable stage in the founding of \n     the United States;\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\n       Whereas throughout the founding era Alexander Hamilton was \n     the leading advocate of a strong national union led by an \n     efficient Federal Government with significant protections for \n     individual liberties;\n       Whereas on July 11, 1804, Alexander Hamilton was fatally \n     wounded in a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey at the hands of \n     Vice President Aaron Burr; and\n       Whereas Alexander Hamilton died in Manhattan on July 12, \n     1804, and was eulogized across the country as one of the \n     leading visionaries of the founding era: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) honors the great importance of the life and legacy of \n     Alexander Hamilton to the United States of America on the \n     bicentennial of his death;\n       (2) recognizes the tremendous significance of the \n     contributions of Alexander Hamilton to the United States as a \n     soldier, citizen, and statesman; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to share in this \n     commemoration so as to gain a greater appreciation of the \n     critical role that Alexander Hamilton had in defense of \n     America's freedom and the founding of the United States.\n\n
