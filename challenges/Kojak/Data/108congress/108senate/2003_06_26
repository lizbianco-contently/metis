Mr. President, this morning the Senate will immediately \nresume consideration of S. 1, the prescription drug benefit/Medicare \nbill. Under the previous agreement, the Senate will begin two back-to-\nback rollcall votes shortly. We were in late last night, and we set \nthose votes to occur the first thing this morning.\n  The voting schedule will be as follows: The first vote will be in \nrelation to the Harkin amendment No. 991 dealing with demonstration \nprograms. The second vote will be in relation to the Edwards amendment \nNo. 1052 dealing with drug advertising. For the remainder of the day, \nwe will continue to debate and vote on amendments to S. 1.\n  We have made very good progress over the last 2 weeks on this bill. \nThe Democratic leader and I were just talking, and we still have 50 \namendments pending. It is my hope a number of these amendments will be \ndisposed of by voice vote. I know the managers are working along that \nline. Inevitably, though, we are going to have a very heavy voting \nschedule today and into this evening. Members should expect rollcall \nvotes throughout the day and, if necessary, into the wee hours of the \nmorning on Friday. We will know a little bit later today the pace of \nthese amendments and how they can best be handled.\n  My intention was to finish this bill before the July 4 recess. I \nthink everybody is working in good faith to do just that. With the \ncooperation of all Members, and if we are able to continue voting \nthroughout the day and the debate-and-amendment process, we may be able \nto pass this legislation this evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8605-6", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

There will be 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe amendment.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The amendment before us is the one where the money \nfollows the purse. It is $350 million a year for 5 years whereby States \ncan use this money to get out of institutions, out of nursing homes, \npeople with disabilities and get them into community, home-based \nliving.\n  Thirteen years ago, this Congress and the President signed a bill \ncalled the Americans With Disabilities Act. One of the premises of that \nwas we no longer wanted to segregate people with disabilities in our \nsociety. We wanted to integrate people with disabilities in education, \nwork, travel, jobs, everything. However, under the Medicaid system, it \nis still segregation.\n  Seventy percent of our Medicaid money goes to institutional care, \nonly 30 percent to community-based care. What this amendment says is \nthat for the first year, the Federal Government will pick up the full \nshare of the State so the State can take people out of institutions and \nput them into community-based living.\n\n[[Page S8607]]\n\n  This was proposed by President Bush in his budget proposal for next \nyear. It is exactly what the President proposed.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The offset we use is also an offset supported by the \nadministration. I have a letter Senators can look at--I put it in the \nRecord last night--from the Department of Justice, supporting the \noffset we use to pay for this to ensure that we can get people in \ncommunity-based settings and out of institutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President. I would like to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Harkin/Smith Money Follows the Person Amendment pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  This amendment would authorize the 2004 Money Follows the Person \ninitiative in Medicaid, a part of the President's New Freedom \nInitiative to integrate people with disabilities into the communities \nwhere they live.\n  This amendment would create a 5-year program to help States move \npeople with disabilities out of institutional settings and into their \ncommunities. For example, under this legislation, Oregon's effort to \nhelp an individual move out of an institutional care facility and into \na community home would be 100-percent federally funded for 1 year.\n  After that first year, the Federal Government would pay its usual \nrate. Under the provisions of this amendment, states like Oregon can \ntake advantage of $350 million dollars of Federal assistance for 5 \nyears for a total of $1.75 billion.\n  This amendment is important to the disabled community for many \nreasons. First, by supporting States' efforts to help Americans who \nhave been needlessly placed in institutional settings move into \ncommunity settings, this amendment will help States increase access to \nhome and community-based support for people with disabilities.\n  Second, by assisting the movement of people who are not best served \nby an institution into a community care facility, this amendment gives \nthem the freedom to make choices. Too often, Americans with \ndisabilities are unable to take advantage of opportunities others take \nfor granted--to choose where they want to live, when to visit family \nand friends, and to be active members of their communities.\n  Third, this amendment helps honor those veterans whose disabilities \nresulted from noble and selfless service to this Nation. This morning, \nI heard from the head of the Oregon Chapter of the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America. He confirmed that this amendment would benefit countless \ndisabled veterans in Oregon alone. I would ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter that I received from the Paralyzed Veterans of America in \nsupport of this amendment be printed in the Record.\n  I likewise ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from United \nCerebral Palsy and The Arc of the United States in support of this \namendment be printed in the Record.\n  Finally, this amendment would help States comply with the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act. As my colleagues in the Senate are well aware, \nwe are nearing the 13th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities \nAct and of the Olmstead Supreme Court decision.\n  That decision ruled that needless institutionalization of Americans \nwith disabilities constitutes discrimination under the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this important amendment and to support the freedom of choice \nfor Americans with disabilities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   The Arc and UCP\n\n\n                                  Public Policy Collaboration,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: On behalf of United Cerebral Palsy and \n     The Arc of the United States, we applaud your co-sponsorship \n     of S. AMDT. 991 to the Prescription Drug and Medicare \n     Improvement Act that would authorize the Money Follows the \n     Person initiative in Medicaid proposed by President Bush in \n     his FY 2004 budget as part of his New Freedom Initiative.\n       Senate Amendment 991 and the President's proposal would \n     create a five-year program to provide 100 percent federal \n     funding for one year on behalf of individuals who move from \n     an institutional setting to the community with home and \n     community services and supports. Money Follows the Person \n     would assist states in meeting their obligations under the \n     Olmstead Supreme Court decision to serve people with long \n     term support needs in the least restrictive setting. The Arc \n     and UCP believe that the Money Follows the Person initiative \n     will help states increase access to home and community-based \n     supports for people with disabilities and help states take \n     greater steps to permanently re-balance their long-term \n     supports delivery system. Changes in the institutional bias \n     in the Medicaid program are long overdue. The Money Follows \n     the Person initiative will assist states in making a \n     transition for people who want to leave institutional \n     settings.\n       UCP is a national organization that works with and for \n     people with cerebral palsy and related disabilities and their \n     families. It is committed to promoting and improving supports \n     and services for people with disabilities so that they can \n     live, work, go to school and otherwise be fully included in \n     their communities. UCP also supports a broad range of \n     research and education efforts on cerebral palsy and related \n     disabilities.\n       The Arc is the national organization of and for people with \n     mental retardation and related developmental disabilities and \n     their families. It is devoted to promoting and improving \n     supports and services for people with mental retardation and \n     their families. The Arc also fosters research and education \n     regarding the prevention of mental retardation in infants and \n     young children.\n       We urge all Senators to join you and Senator Harkin to \n     support inclusion of your amendment, S. AMDT. 991, in the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug bill.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lynne Cleveland,\n       Co-Chair.\n     Leon Triest,\n       Co-Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                              Oregon Paralyzed Veterans of America\n                                         Salem, OR, June 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Gordon Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: on behalf of the Oregon Chapter of the \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America and other disabled citizens of \n     the state of Oregon, we thank you for joining Senator Harkin \n     in introducing Amendment 991 (``Money Follows the Person''), \n     to the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003 \n     (S. 1). This amendment would authorize an initiative \n     contained in the President's proposed FY 2004 budget, a \n     critical part of the administration's New Freedom Initiative \n     to integrate people with disabilities into the community.\n       Amendment 991 includes fiscal offsets of $1.75 billion over \n     five years to fund Medicaid demonstrations to assist states \n     in developing and implementing cost-effective choices between \n     institutional and community services. Financing Medicaid \n     services for individuals who transition from institutions to \n     the community is a major part of this effort.\n       When enacted, the Federal Government would fully reimburse \n     states (100% Federal match) the cost of one year of Medicaid \n     home and community-based services for people with \n     disabilities who leave institutions. After the initial year, \n     states would be responsible for matching payments at their \n     usual Medicaid matching rate. $350 million would be available \n     in FY 2004 and in each of the following four years to \n     implement these changes.\n       PVA believes that this amendment is essential to enable \n     Oregon and other states to comply with the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act and the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision. \n     People with disabilities must have a meaningful choice to \n     receive long term services and supports in their home or \n     community.\n       Again, thank you for introducing Amendment 991 during the \n     prescription drug and Medicare debate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sam Leam\n       President.\n     Patrick E. Rogers\n       Government Relations Director.\n\n  (At the request of Mr. DASCHLE, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have been a long-standing \nsupporter of the Olmstead decision to end the institutional bias in \ncare for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, States have been slow \nto implement this landmark decision. To better help States in this \neffort, I am proud to say that I am an original cosponsor of Senator \nHarkin's MiCASSA legislation, S. 971, the Medicaid Community-Based \nAttendant Services and Supports Act of 2003, a bill to ensure that \n``the money follows the people'' and that true choice is granted for \npeople with disabilities to decide whether they wish to live in their \nown communities instead of being institutionalized. The bill also \nprovides major Federal resources to assist\n\n[[Page S8608]]\n\nStates with the costs of paying for community-based attendant and \nsupport services. Had I been present for the vote, I would have voted \nagainst the motion to table the Harkin amendment and would have voted \nin favor of its inclusion in the Medicare prescription drug \nbill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I think what the Senator from Iowa has \ndone is a very worthy thing. The President has focused on this. Part of \nthe President's plan is what the Senator from Iowa has before us. The \nproblem with this is that this is a Medicaid proposal that is under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee would like \nthe opportunity, in the context of looking at the Medicaid Program, to \nwork this through the structure. A, to have this amendment come to the \nfloor, not having gone through the normal process, I think is \ninappropriate; B, this is a Medicare bill, not a Medicaid bill.\n  I say to the Senator from Iowa, I know Senator Grassley has said to \nme he is willing to work with his colleague from Iowa on moving this \nforward. The legislation the Senator from Iowa has put forward has \nmerit and will probably receive bipartisan support, but it does not \nbelong on this bill.\n  So I ask my colleagues--by the way, it is $1.75 billion. I understand \nthere is an offset, but this is a Medicare bill and we should defeat \nthis amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Colorado be recognized \nto lay down an amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1017\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I send amendment No. 1017 to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado (Mr. Allard), for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1017.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for temporary suspension of OASIS requirement for \n     collection of data on non-medicare and non-medicaid patients)\n\n       At the end of title VI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF OASIS REQUIREMENT FOR \n                   COLLECTION OF DATA ON NON-MEDICARE AND NON-\n                   MEDICAID PATIENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--During the period described in subsection \n     (b), the Secretary may not require, under section 4602(e) of \n     the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 or otherwise under OASIS, a \n     home health agency to gather or submit information that \n     relates to an individual who is not eligible for benefits \n     under either title XVIII or title XIX of the Social Security \n     Act (such information in this section referred to as ``non-\n     medicare/medicaid OASIS information'').\n       (b) Period of Suspension.--The period described in this \n     subsection--\n       (1) begins on the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) ends on the last day of the 2nd month beginning after \n     the date as of which the Secretary has published final \n     regulations regarding the collection and use by the Centers \n     for Medicare & Medicaid Services of non-medicare/medicaid \n     OASIS information following the submission of the report \n     required under subsection (c).\n       (c) Report.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary shall conduct a study on how non-\n     medicare/medicaid OASIS information is and can be used by \n     large home health agencies. Such study shall examine--\n       (A) whether there are unique benefits from the analysis of \n     such information that cannot be derived from other \n     information available to, or collected by, such agencies; and\n       (B) the value of collecting such information by small home \n     health agencies compared to the administrative burden related \n     to such collection.\n\n     In conducting the study the Secretary shall obtain \n     recommendations from quality assessment experts in the use of \n     such information and the necessity of small, as well as \n     large, home health agencies collecting such information.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the study conducted under paragraph (1) by not \n     later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as preventing home health agencies from collecting \n     non-medicare/medicaid OASIS information for their own use.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, Medicare home health providers are in a \npaperwork crisis. Current regulations of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, requires that caregivers administer voluminous \npaperwork to patients when they administer care.\n  These paperwork requirements are too excessive for both patients and \ncaregivers. Caregivers must administer numerous forms including data \ncollection, patient privacy information, a plan of care, advance \ndirectives, a visit schedule, a comprehensive assessment, and more.\n  One of these requirements, called OASIS, or the Outcome and \nAssessment Information Set, is 94 questions long and takes a few hours \nto fill out. Before a nurse or physical therapist administers care, she \nand the patient must sit down and answer questions and fill out this \npaperwork. Colorado providers have told me they spend more time filling \nout paperwork than they do caring for patients.\n  As a result of this excessive data collection and dissemination, home \nhealth caregivers are leaving the home health industry. Two weeks ago a \nhome health administrator in Colorado Springs came to share with me the \nsituation in her agency. On her plane trip here, three of her newly-\nhome health physical therapists called to tell her they were leaving \nthe agency because of excessive paperwork requirements. They said they \nwere going to leave the home health industry and return to the hospital \nindustry.\n  We cannot afford this. Home health care is a vital player in health \ncare for seniors and all individuals. If this paperwork crisis \ncontinues, home health care will continue to lose caregivers and bloat \nits current caregiver shortage.\n  Currently CMS requires that home health caregivers administer OASIS \nto Medicare patients, to Medicaid patients, and to patients who have \nprivate health insurance. The problem with this regulation, however, is \nthat the data collected for private health insurance patients is not \neven used. This data literally sits in the offices of home health \nagencies with no current purpose.\n  The fact is CMS requires that home health agencies encode the OASIS \ndata for Medicare and Medicaid patients only and to transmit it to \ntheir States. Then the information is transmitted into the Federal \nOASIS Repository.\n  For all private insurance patients, the home health agencies do not \nhave to encode or transmit the data. So these nurses, physical \ntherapists, occupational therapists, and nurse practitioners are \nrequired to collect this data for no reason.\n  It is my understanding CMS intends to require the transmission of \ndata for private health patients at some point. But it has been 4 years \nand they have not done it yet.\n  In the meantime there are still many problems with OASIS. Until CMS \nissues the improved regulation, caregivers should be allowed to stop \ncollecting unused data that ends up in the filing cabinets of home \nhealth agencies.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senators Feingold, Collins, Kohl, \nand Leahy would suspend the CMS requirement of collecting OASIS data \nfor private insurance patients, non-Medicare and non-Medicaid patients, \nuntil an outcome by CMS's two OASIS working groups is reached.\n  Specifically, OASIS would be suspended until the 2 months immediately \nafter HHS issues its regulations about OASIS. The regulations will be \nbased on the information collected from and the recommendations of \nCMS's two working groups that are determining over the course of 3 \nyears ways to improve OASIS data collection and quality assurance.\n  Our amendment is supported by caregivers in home health who \nadminister OASIS, including physical therapists, nurses, nurse \npractitioners, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. \nCongresswoman Nancy Johnson, chairwoman of the Oversight Subcommittee \nof the House Committee on Ways and Means, also strongly supports this \namendment. In addition, our language was included in Medicare reform \nbills in the Senate in the last 2 consecutive years. Further, I commend\n\n[[Page S8609]]\n\nSenator Feingold for introducing legislation last Congress to reform \nOASIS and I commend Senator Murkowski and Senator Kerry for their work \non the MARCIA regulatory reform legislation, which included an OASIS \nsuspension.\n  My colleagues and I believe OASIS data collection is helpful and \nshould be applied. Even providers and patients, who must comply with \nthe law, believe this. Yet the requirements to collect data should be \nachievable and inexcessive.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this effort for caregivers and patients.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two \nadditional cosponsors be added to the amendment, Senator Kohl and \nSenator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 991\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Madam President, will the Chair state the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes evenly divided before \nthe vote on the next amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, yesterday we voted on the Edwards-\nHarkin amendment which had two provisions. The first provision dealt \nwith the FDA approval process for ``me too'' drugs. There were concerns \nexpressed by the Members of the Senate about that provision. Even \nthough I disagreed with those concerns, I don't think it would have \nslowed down the FDA approval process. Because of those concerns, we \nhave removed those provisions from this amendment.\n  The amendment we are about to vote on deals only with advertising. It \nin no way bans advertising. All this amendment does is require that the \nadvertising engaged in by drug companies and pharmaceutical companies \nbe evenhanded. The only thing this amendment requires is that the \ninformation be accurate and evenhanded. In other words, you can't have \nkids dancing in a field as the image on television and in small print \nat the bottom saying the drug can cause strokes or have other side \neffects.\n  We want to make sure the American people in these advertisements get \naccurate information and which is not misleading. This amendment does \nexactly that. We have eliminated the provision so many were concerned \nabout yesterday.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Let us make sure the \nAmerican people get true and accurate information in the advertising \nthey are seeing on drugs on television.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise in opposition to this amendment \nsubmitted by my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Edwards. \nYesterday, the Senate defeated an amendment offered by my colleague \nthat would have restricted direct-to-consumer advertising of \nprescription medicines.\n  This new amendment continues this effort by offering similar \nadvertising provisions to those already defeated.\n  I have a list of 14 organizations which I ask unanimous consent be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 26, 2003\n     To: Members of the United States Senate:\n       The undersigned organizations are writing in opposition to \n     the amendment offered by Senator Edwards regarding changes to \n     Direct to Consumer advertising of pharmaceutical products. \n     This amendment would impose serious restrictions on \n     information which is of considerable value to the millions of \n     patients we represent.\n       Our organizations are advocates for millions of Americans \n     who suffer from a broad range of illnesses. Early detection \n     and treatment of these illnesses is an important factor in \n     helping those individuals lead longer and healthier lives. \n     Communication, public education and awareness are key \n     components in the outcomes American patients can hope to \n     achieve. Limiting access to credible information is bad \n     healthcare policy and we urge you to oppose the Edwards \n     amendment and any other efforts to deny Americans \n     information.\n           Respectfully,\n       The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.\n       The National Mental Health Association.\n       The American Association of Diabetes Educators.\n       The American Foundation for Urologic Disease.\n       The American Lung Foundation.\n       The National Health Council.\n       The Interamerican College of Physicians and Surgeons.\n       The Kidney Cancer Association.\n       The Society for Womens Health Research.\n       The National Headache Foundation.\n       The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease.\n       The National Osteoporosis Foundation.\n       The American Liver Foundation.\n       The National Stroke Association.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, these are organizations that are advocates \nfor millions of Americans who suffer from a broad range of illnesses. \nEarly detection and treatment of these illnesses is more communication. \nPublic education and awareness are key components. Advertising is the \nkey component of it.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to promulgate new rules that would require advertisements to \nprovide information about a drug's effectiveness in comparison to other \ndrugs for ``substantially the same condition.'' In other words, you \nhave to advertise with your competitors as well. The unfortunate effect \nwould be to make the advertisements even more complex, not less, for \nconsumers. It would force ads to drop other information that would be \nbeneficial to consumers.\n  I ask that you reject the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from the Congressional Budget Office be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Congressional Budget Office has reviewed \n     a proposed amendment (GOE03.597) by Senators Grassley and \n     Baucus to S. 1, a bill to amend title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act to make improvements in the Medicare program, to \n     provide prescription drug coverage under the Medicare \n     program, and for other purposes. That amendment would add \n     subtitle D to title II, establishing an alternative payment \n     system for preferred provider organizations in highly \n     competitive regions and fee-for-service modernization \n     projects.\n       CBO estimates that the amendment would add $12 billion in \n     outlays to the cost of the bill over the 2009-2013 period--$6 \n     billion for payments to preferred provider organizations and \n     $6 billion for the fee-for-service modernization projects. \n     The amendment would allow the programs to continue after \n     2013, but under the rules the amendment specifies for the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, CBO estimates that \n     those programs would incur no additional net costs after that \n     time.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert A.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1054\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be set aside so that I might call up amendment No. 1054 on \nbehalf of Senator Feingold, with respect to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Feingold, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1054.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Madam President, I rise today to offer the Cantwell-\nLincoln Prescription drug transparency amendment to S. 1, the medicare \nprescription drug bill. I thank my cosponsor, Senator Lincoln, for \nworking with me on this important amendment that will help protect \nconsumers against high prescription drug prices.\n  This amendment does three things.\n  First, it requires any PBM contracting with Medicare to disclose to \nthe Department of Justice how much of the rebates and discounts \nnegotiated for Medicare are being passed back.\n  Second, the disclosure of these financial arrangements to the \nDepartment of Justice provides an incentive for PBMs to return as much \nof that savings as possible to Medicare, which will in turn, help \nreduce the high cost of prescription drugs.\n  Finally, it prohibits a pharmaceutical company from owning a pharmacy \nbenefit manager, an inherent conflict of interest.\n  By requiring transparency, the Cantwell-Lincoln amendment works to \nprevent collusion on pricing and helps ensure seniors are not paying \nunnecessarily high prices for their medications.\n  PBMs have been the target of numerous lawsuits filed in recent years \nby health plans, employers and governments. The allegations in these \nlawsuits are always the same: overinflated drug prices, price collusion \nbetween PBMs and manufacturers, failure of PBMs to share discounts and \nrebates, and switching patients to more expensive drugs without the \nconsent of the patient or the doctor.\n  The PBMs have denied wrongdoing and have settled in many cases.\n  Last year, Merck agreed to pay $42.5 million to settle lawsuits over \nallegations that Medco improperly promoted higher priced Merck drugs \nwhen less expensive options from other pharmaceutical companies were \navailable.\n  In 1998, Merck signed a settlement agreement with the Federal Trade \nCommission stating that, ``Medco has given favorable treatment to Merck \ndrugs.''\n  This admission is proof that pharmaceutical companies and PBMs have \nengaged in collusion on drug pricing in the past, extracting excessive \nprofits from people who rely on these drug services. The Cantwell-\nLincoln amendment is needed to help prevent price gouging in the \nfuture.\n  Other governments have struggled to keep a close watch on PBM \npractices.\n  In 2000, one of the big four PBMs, Advance PCS, was hired by the \nstate of Arkansas to provide coverage for the state's 135,000 \nemployees. A recent audit found that the PBM was over charging the \nstate for numerous drugs. During one 4-month period, the PBM \novercharged the state $479,000 on generic drugs alone.\n  PBM executives say that my amendment makes turning a profit \nimpossible. It is true that PBMs are not charities but private \ncompanies with a duty to their shareholders to earn a profit.\n  Let's not forget, however, that these are also private companies \ncharged with providing a Government-funded benefit in the best \ninterests of 40 million senior citizens. These private companies also \nare duty bound to get the most for the Government's $400 billion \ninvestment.\n  Traveling in my home State of Washington, I hear regularly from \nsenior citizens about the high cost of prescription drugs. While \nseniors in my State, like elsewhere in the country, want a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, they also desperately want some relief from \nhigh prescription drug prices. They say, ``Stop the price gouging. Do \nsomething to make sure that prescription drugs are reasonably \naffordable for everyone.''\n  PBMs have come to dominate the prescription drug benefit market. \nNearly 210 million Americans are served by one of the four largest \nPBMs.\n  According to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, national \nprescription drug spending increased by 15.7 percent in 2001. Despite \npromises from pharmacy benefit managers to lower costs, prescription \ndrugs continue to be the fastest growing sector of health care spending \nin this country.\n  Soaring in tandem with prescription drugs prices are PBM profits. St. \nLouis-based Express Scripts--one of the four largest PBMs--provides \ncoverage to 40 million people. The company reported that its net income \ngrew 63 percent last year to $202.8 million.\n  Another one of the big four, Advance PCS, which covers 75 million \npeople, was ranked by Fortune Magazine as the ninth fastest growing \ncompany in the nation based on its profits over the past 5 years.\n  Unfortunately, it has been near impossible to find out whether PBMs \nare fairly sharing rebates and other savings with patients or simply \nusing it to boost the bottom line.\n  Even the General Accounting Office has been unable to find out how \nrebates are being divided between PBMs and the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan. A GAO requested by Senator Dorgan last year failed to \ndiscover if the PBMs were passing along the savings because none of the \nPBMs financial documents were available for review.\n  Several private companies and employee groups that contract with PBMs \nhave resorted to lawsuits to get access to this information.\n  The Cantwell-Lincoln amendment requires the PBM to disclose to the \nDepartment of Justice the financial arrangements that dictate what \npercentage of rebates and other savings are being passed back to the \nclient.\n  This disclosure creates a major incentive for PBMs to return as much \nas possible of the rebates and spread back to the Medicare program. \nThis incentive also will help reduce prescription drug prices.\n  The PBMs have argued that reporting this financial information would \nkill their ability to continue to negotiate low drug prices. I am a \nbusinesswoman, and I understand the need to keep financial agreements \nconfidential. That is why my amendment mandates the information be \nhanded over to the Department of Justice, where it remains \nconfidential.\n  Department of Justice oversight also allows for regular review of \nthese financial arrangements to weed out any potential collusion on \npricing. This added protection also will help lower drug costs for \nseniors.\n  The Cantwell-Lincoln amendment also prohibits PBMs from being owned \nby pharmaceutical manufacturers. This cross-ownership is problematic \nbecause it could allow for pharmaceutical companies to collude with \nPBMs to favor the manufacturers more expensive drugs over less \nexpensive alternatives.\n  A report on PBMs by the National Health Policy Forum points out the \nconcerns raised by close relationships between PBMs and drug \nmanufacturers. Close ties between the two could lead to a lack of drug \nchoice for consumers, with one manufacturer's drugs getting \npreferential treatment by the PBM.\n  Actions taken this week by the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia \nreinforce the\n\n[[Page S8614]]\n\nneed for greater PBM oversight as outlined in the Cantwell-Lincoln \namendment.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that articles from the \nWashington Post and Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 24, 2003]\n\n  U.S. Is Joining Lawsuit That Says Medco Put Profits Before Patients\n\n                         (By Barbara Martinez)\n\n       The Justice Department is joining a lawsuit that alleges \n     Merck & Co.'s Medco pharmacy-benefits subsidiary adopted an \n     ``aggressive profits-before-patients policy.'' Medco's \n     approach resulted in a potentially dangerous lack of \n     oversight in filling prescriptions and increased \n     pharmaceutical costs for the federal government, the suit \n     says.\n       The department's involvement in the suit, brought by two \n     former Medco pharmacists, doesn't necessarily mean that it \n     believes all the allegations. But it signals that the \n     government investigated the accusations and found at least \n     some of them worth pursuing in court. The government, which \n     also joined a second lawsuit against Medco Monday that made \n     similar allegations, intends to file its own complaint within \n     90 days. Justice Department investigators have been examining \n     Medco and other pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs, for \n     several years, but this is the first time they have indicated \n     that any suit would be filed. PBMs handle prescription-drug-\n     card benefits for millions of employees.\n       The complaint alleges that after Merck--one of the world's \n     largest drug companies--purchased Medco in 1993, the PBM \n     began to make systemic changes in its mail-order \n     prescription-filling system--disregarding safety and instead \n     promoting higher profits per prescription.\n       In a statement, Medco said, ``We are confident that when \n     all the facts are presented they will show that our business \n     has one focus, providing the highest quality of prescription \n     health care to our clients and members.'' It added: We are \n     prepared to present a nigorous defense and believe that we \n     will prevail. We will prove that the allegations'' in the \n     complaint ``are absolutely untrue or reflect years-old \n     isolated issues that were identified and corrected and in no \n     way and at no time compromise the quality of patient care.''\n       The airing of previously sealed allegations in the suit \n     comes at a difficult time for both Merck and PBMs. Merck \n     plans to spin off Medco as a publicly traded company this \n     year, while PBMs have been angling to get a piece of a \n     Medicare drug benefit currently being debated in Congress. \n     Medco provides drug benefits to more than 60 million \n     Americans, including millions of federal and state employees. \n     Medco's annual revenue totals about $30 billion.\n       The case could have repercussions on Capitol Hill, too, \n     where PBMs are locked in a fierce lobbying battle, especially \n     with the retail-pharmacy industry, over details of Medicare \n     legislation. The measure would create a drug benefit that \n     PBMs would have a prominent role in providing. Already \n     Monday, the National Community Pharmacists Association, which \n     represents about 25,000 owners of independent drugstores, \n     stepped up its lobbying efforts. The group is pushing for \n     stricter disclosure requirements for PBMs.\n       In the newly unsealed complaint, which was filed in U.S. \n     District Court in Philadelphia, the two former Medco \n     pharmacists make detailed charges that enormous pressure was \n     placed on employees to falsify orders to meet goals and to \n     disregard complaints by patients and doctors about drug \n     switching or pill shortages.\n       Daily internal publication of prescription-error rates to \n     help pharmacists measure their own safety standards were \n     eliminated, the suit asserts. Instead, daily loudspeaker \n     messages announced prescription-filling costs, as well as the \n     stock price of parent company Merck, the suit says. Many \n     Medco employees are compensated in part with Merck stock \n     options.\n       To save money, the suit alleges, Medco reduced licensed \n     pharmacists' role in the filling and supervising of \n     prescription drugs at its mail-order facilities. In addition, \n     the job of calling a physician to discuss a potential drug \n     interaction--once the job of only pharmacists--ultimately \n     fell to employees who ``seldom have college degrees, and have \n     no prior training in pharmacy services other than limited on-\n     the-job training.'' And as a result of being pressured to \n     meet quotas on how many doctors to call, employees regularly \n     lied on physician call records to indicate they alerted \n     doctors about problems when they really had not, according to \n     the lawsuit.\n       The lawsuit was filed under the Federal False Claims Act. \n     In such lawsuits, the plaintiff, often a former employee of a \n     company that does business with the government, alleges that \n     the company has defrauded the government. If the government \n     considers the allegations valid, if joins the complaint, \n     litigates the case and shares any recovery or damages with \n     the person who filed the suit.\n       Medco has a significant amount of legal government \n     business, providing mail-order prescriptions to millions of \n     federal employees through the Federal Employee's Health \n     Benefit Program.\n       Many of the allegations in this complaint relate to Medco's \n     mail-order business, where patients mail in a prescription \n     and Medco fills it and sends it back. PBMs such as Medco have \n     been pushing hard to promote their mail-order facilities as a \n     cost-effective alternative to retail stores.\n       According to the suit, Medco ``boasts to its clients \n     nationwide that licensed pharmacists check each mail-order \n     prescription before it is sent out, with as many as three or \n     four quality checks.'' The suit says such scrutiny only \n     happened prior to Merck's 1993 acquisition of Medco.\n       After the acquisition, Medco automated more of its \n     prescription-filling capabilities and ``significant changes'' \n     were instituted that ``marked a shift from prudent pharmacy \n     practices'' to a ``focus on profit maximization,'' the \n     complaint said.\n       One of Medco's largest and most technologically advanced \n     mail-order facilities is in Las Vegas, where the two former \n     Medco pharmacists who filed the complaint worked. According \n     to the suit, after Medco upgraded its Las Vegas facility in \n     the mid-1990s, ``pharmacists were no longer reading and \n     verifying mailed prescriptions prior to entry into a \n     computer.'' Instead, upon arrival, the prescriptions were \n     entered by ``data-entry clerks with no formal pharmacy \n     training'' and who were supervised by nonpharmacist managers.\n       The suit also alleges that under a special program, touted \n     by Medco as promoting the most cost-effective drugs, Medco \n     called doctors to get them to change their prescriptions \n     because of undisclosed payments to Medco from drug \n     manufacturers. The suit said patient and physician complaints \n     about switching prescriptions were ``common'' but that \n     ``Medco routinely ignores these complaints, including the \n     health risks associated with inappropriate drug switches.''\n       In addition, Medco, like other PBMs, provides ``drug \n     utilization reviews'' of prescriptions and patients. The \n     process aims to prevent adverse drug interactions, verifies \n     appropriate drug strength, catches drug allergies or \n     duplicate medications.\n       Until 1995, such calls to physicians to alert them to \n     possible problems were made by pharmacists who could fully \n     explain the situation and suggest alternatives. Subsequently, \n     the suit says, these calls were being made only by ``cheaper, \n     non-pharmacists employees.'' The pharmacist was only brought \n     in at the end of a call, to verify information.\n       But with workers having quotas of 20 to 25 calls an hour, \n     the pharmacist was handling as many as 100 calls within 60 \n     minutes. As a result of pressures to meet the quotas, the \n     complaint said, employees regularly fabricated records \n     documenting that they called doctors to alert them to \n     potential safety issues, among other matters, when they \n     really hadn't. Sometimes, the suit says, the employees would \n     change prescriptions without the pharmacist's intervention.\n       In other areas of the mail-order facility, the complaint \n     says, employees ``permanently delete, cancel or otherwise \n     falsify prescriptions orders'' to reduce back-order size. As \n     a result, the complaint says, many patients didn't get the \n     medications they needed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 2003]\n\n                    U.S. Joining Suit Against Medco\n\n                          (By Charles Duhigg)\n\n       The U.S. attorney in Philadelphia announced yesterday that \n     he is joining a complaint against Medco Health Solutions Inc. \n     that alleges the nation's second-largest pharmacy-benefit \n     manager improperly canceled prescriptions, switched \n     medications without physician approval and sent patients \n     partially filled orders.\n       The U.S. attorney's office has been investigating whistle-\n     blower allegations against the company since 1999 and intends \n     to file its own complaint in September, said Associate U.S. \n     Attorney James G. Sheehan.\n       The government has decided to intervene in two lawsuits \n     brought by three whistle-blowers. Those suits allege that \n     Medco changed prescriptions without a physician's approval to \n     favor more expensive drugs produced by Merck & Co. and \n     induced physicians with false information to switch to higher \n     cost Merck drugs. Medco also destroyed mail order \n     prescriptions without filling them and in other cases mailed \n     patients less than the number of pills ordered but charged \n     for the full amount, the lawsuits allege.\n       Medco is a subsidiary of Merck.\n       ``We know from industry studies that almost half of mail \n     order participants will run out of medicine within two days \n     if they fail to receive their new prescriptions,'' said \n     Patrick L. Meehan, the U.S. attorney for the eastern district \n     of Pennsylvania.\n       Medco officials contend that the allegations are untrue or \n     ``reflect years-old isolated issues that were identified and \n     corrected,'' said Ann Smith, director of public affairs at \n     Medco. At no time was the quality of patient care \n     compromised, Smith said.\n       Most Americans know pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, \n     from the plastic cards they hand over at local pharmacies \n     when filling a prescription. Major employers and health plans \n     hire these companies to negotiate with drug companies to \n     control drug costs for plan enrollees, and to oversee the \n     complex paperwork associated with filling prescriptions.\n       The Senate is considering plans to provide prescription \n     drug coverage to the elderly\n\n[[Page S8615]]\n\n     that may enhance the clout of pharmacy-benefit managers, \n     industry analysts say. The companies are expected to \n     administer government drug spending under some plans, \n     according to congressional testimony offered by the National \n     Association of Chain Drug Stores, and to receive a larger \n     share of government reimbursements for prescription drugs.\n       More than 62 million Americans get prescriptions processed \n     through Medco, according to the company. Medco handles \n     pharmacy benefits totaling nearly $30 billion per year, \n     including $1.2 billion from Blue Cross/Blue Shield as part of \n     the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n       George Bradford Hund and Walter W. Gauger, who both worked \n     as pharmacists in Medco's Las Vegas processing facility, and \n     Joseph Piacentile, a physician, allege in their complaints \n     that on busy days Medco would cancel or destroy prescriptions \n     to avoid penalties for delays in filling orders. Customers \n     would be told that the prescriptions had never been received, \n     Sheehan said.\n       The company is also accused of fabricating records and, \n     when the handwriting on prescriptions was unclear or \n     difficult to read, simply guessing at what they said, \n     according to Sheehan. The government's suit against Medco \n     could ask for damages in the millions of dollars and new \n     oversight systems.\n       Merck acquired Medco in 1993 at a time when other \n     drugmakers were purchasing pharmacy-benefit managers. By the \n     end of the 1990s, all pharmaceutical manufacturers but Merck \n     had sold their units amid concerns that the drug companies \n     would use the benefit managers to push their own drugs, \n     rather than doing what was best for clients.\n       I 1998 Merck signed a settlement agreement with the Federal \n     Trade Commission stating that ``Medco has given favorable \n     treatment to Merck drugs.'' Last December, Medco agreed to \n     pay $42.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit alleging \n     that the company improperly promoted higher priced Merck \n     drugs rather than seeking the best price from alternative \n     pharmaceutical companies. Merck announced it intended to spin \n     off Medco last year, but delayed the initial public offering \n     of shares because of the depressed stock market.\n       Yesterday's announcement marks the first significant legal \n     action by a federal agency against a pharmacy-benefit \n     manager. Previously, attorneys general of at least 25 states \n     have opened inquires into Medco to determine whether it has \n     violated state laws, and New York State Attorney General \n     Eliot L. Spitzer said last Friday that his office was \n     investigating another company, Express Scripts Inc., for \n     allegedly overbilling state health plans.\n       Shares of Merck closed yesterday at $62.11, down 78 cents, \n     or 1.24 percent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 24, 2003]\n\n                 Medco Accused of Favoring Merck Drugs\n\n                          (By David B. Caruso)\n\n       Federal prosecutors on Monday said a company that was \n     supposed to help health plans find low-cost prescription \n     drugs instead pressured doctors to switch patients to \n     medications made by its owner, pharmaceutical giant Merck & \n     Co.\n       U.S. Attorney Patrick Meehan said his office has joined a \n     pair of civil ``whistleblower'' lawsuits against Medco Health \n     Solutions, accusing the Merck subsidiary of providing \n     misleading information to the government in connection with \n     its contract to manage drug benefits for federal employees.\n       More than 1,000 companies have hired Medco to coordinate \n     prescription drug coverage for employee health plans, making \n     it the nation's largest manager of pharmacy benefits, and the \n     company is supposed to use its bulk-purchasing power to lower \n     drug costs.\n       But the suits say Medco routinely induce physicians to \n     switch patients to Merck drugs, even if a patient had been \n     doing well on another medication that cost less.\n       The government also says the company failed to call doctors \n     to explain prescriptions that were unclear, and fabricated \n     records to make it appear as if calls from pharmacists to \n     physicians had been made.\n       The three whistleblowers--a New Jersey doctor and two \n     Nevada pharmacists who once worked for Medco--claim the firm \n     also misled clients about its practice of accepting cash \n     rebates from pharmaceutical companies in exchange for \n     promoting their products. The suits claim the payments amount \n     to kickbacks.\n       Medco spokesman Jeffrey Simek said the charges are ``either \n     absolutely untrue, or they reflect years-old isolated issues \n     that were identified and corrected.''\n       He denied the firm gives preferential treatment to Merck, \n     or any other drug company.\n       ``Our policy is that we will never make a drug interchange \n     that will not result in a benefit for either our clients, or \n     the members of their health plans,'' he said. ``If we \n     improperly favored any drug by any single company, we could \n     never succeed.''\n       Several health plans have previously sued Medco, claiming \n     that it improperly accepted $3.56 billion in payments from \n     drug companies in the late 1990s to promote their products, \n     but Monday's filing by the U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia is \n     the first such action by a federal prosecutor.\n       Medco, like other pharmacy benefit companies, acknowledges \n     participating in rebate programs. Simek said the company took \n     in $2.5 billion in rebates in 2001. But he said the payments \n     work like coupons and ultimately lower medication costs for \n     clients.\n       The suits also accuse Medco, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., of \n     shortchanging patients by mailing them fewer than the number \n     of pills they paid for. They say the company tried to avoid \n     penalties for delays in filling mail orders by destroying \n     prescriptions on days when the order volume was heavy.\n       Simek said the company investigated the allegations and \n     determined they were isolated incidents that didn't affect \n     patient care. Two employees were fired, he said.\n       Court filings identified the whistleblowers as Dr. Joseph \n     Piacentile, of New Jersey, and George Bradford Hunt and \n     Walter W. Gauger, two pharmacists who previously worked for \n     Medco in Las Vegas.\n       Attorneys general in several states have said they are also \n     investigating whether the company, and other pharmacy benefit \n     firms, broke the law.\n       Merck has been trying to spin off its Medco business. It \n     canceled an initial public offering for the company in July \n     after revealing that it had misstated its revenues by $12 \n     billion in recent years by counting prescription copyaments \n     made to pharmacies as Medco revenue. Merck said in May that \n     the firm would be spun off instead to Merck shareholders.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, it was reported this week that U.S. \nAttorney Patrick Meehan plans to join a pair of lawsuits filed by three \nformer Medco Health employees. The employees--two pharmacists and a \ndoctor--allege that Medco provided misleading information to the \nGovernment related to a contract to provide drug coverage for Federal \nemployees. The lawsuits accuse Medco of switching patients to more \nexpensive drugs and fabricating records to make it look as if the \nprescription changes were made by doctors and not by Medco.\n  These are serious allegations resulting from an investigation that \nbegan in 1999. This is the first such action taken by a U.S. attorney \nagainst a PBM and is a strong signal that all is not right with this \nindustry.\n  U.S. Attorney Patrick Meehan told the Newark Star Ledger:\n\n       The kind of conduct alleged in the complaints threatens not \n     only the integrity of the system as a whole, but also the \n     well being of the very patients it is designed to benefit. \n     These allegations suggest that, somewhere along the line, the \n     focus became the profit instead of the patient.\n\n  The possibility of profitability trumping patient care has promoted a \nnumber of consumer groups to favor the accountability system outlined \nin my amendment. Consumers Union, Public Citizen, Families USA, AFSCME, \nthe National Community Pharmacy Association and the Washington State \nPharmacy Association all support my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2003.\n       Dear Senator: As the Senate continues to debate S. 1, the \n     ``Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003,'' \n     Consumers Union urges you to redouble your efforts to improve \n     the legislation so that it better meets the needs of seniors \n     and people with disabilities, many of whom are in dire need \n     of meaningful protection from the devastating impact of \n     spiraling prescription drug costs.\n       Some of Consumers Union's most serious concerns about S. 1 \n     are:\n       The amount set aside in the Congressional budget resolution \n     for a Medicare prescription drug bill, $400 billion over 10 \n     years, is inadequate for the task and limits coverage to 22 \n     percent of the projected prescription drug expenditures over \n     this time period;\n       Prescription drug coverage provided by S. 1 is skimpy, \n     leaving many beneficiaries who lack coverage in 2003 actually \n     paying more out of their own pockets for prescription drugs \n     in 2007, when they have coverage. (For more information, \n     please see our report, Skimpy Benefits and Unchecked \n     Expenditures: Medicare Prescription Drug Bills Fail to Offer \n     Adequate Protection for Seniors and People with Disabilities, \n     at www.consumersunion.org);\n       The bill lacks a standard, uniform benefit, does not \n     guarantee the availability of a prescription drug benefit \n     through the Medicare program, and leaves all beneficiaries \n     uncertain about what coverage will be available to them (and \n     uncertain about the premium they will be charged);\n       While the Senate has approved helpful amendments that would \n     accelerate the introduction of generics and possibly provide \n     beneficiaries access to lower-priced drugs from Canada, the \n     bill's reliance on hundreds of private insurance companies \n     and HMOs precludes the possibility of the federal government \n     using its purchasing power to negotiate deep discounts for \n     consumers. It does too little, therefore, to rein in \n     spiraling prescription drug expenditures;\n       The bill creates confusion for Medicare beneficiaries, \n     forcing them to sort out the\n\n[[Page S8616]]\n\n     options in the drug-only marketplace and options in the HMO/\n     PPO marketplace, and it further complicates the ``comparison \n     shopping'' task by allowing the prescription drug benefits to \n     vary from the basic parameters (e.g., deductible, cost-\n     sharing, doughnut, catastrophic coverage). Simply-put, the \n     confusing options that will face Medicare beneficiaries \n     flunks the ``kitchen table'' test;\n       S. 1 will leave many Medicare beneficiaries worse off since \n     employers will cut back their retiree coverage because any \n     coverage is not counted toward retirees' out-of-pocket costs; \n     and\n       While the bill provides for a relatively generous subsidy \n     for low-income consumers, it requires them to get their \n     prescription drug benefit through Medicare instead of \n     the currently universal Medicare program, even though they \n     qualify for Medicare coverage by virtue of their age or \n     disability.\n       We are deeply troubled by discussions that are underway \n     that would undermine the traditional fee-for-service Medicare \n     program--the very program that assures beneficiaries that \n     they have the freedom to go to the doctor of their choice--by \n     providing extra subsidization to private PPOs and HMOs. By \n     enriching the benefits available in the private marketplace, \n     PPOs and HMOs will attract relatively healthy people; the \n     traditional fee-for-service Medicare option will erode over \n     time, because of the design of the subsidies and desire to \n     cut costs. The sickest and most vulnerable will be severely \n     disadvantaged.\n       There are several amendments that would help address some \n     of the problems with S. 1. We urge you to support amendments \n     that would:\n       Expand the prescription drug benefits so that they are \n     comparable to prescription drug coverage in employer-based \n     health insurance plans;\n       Rein in prescription drug expenditures through the use of \n     the federal government's buying power to negotiate deep \n     discounts;\n       Provide for scientific study of the comparative \n     effectiveness of alternative prescription drugs;\n       Guarantee that beneficiaries would have access to a \n     prescription drug benefit through the Medicare program at a \n     set premium;\n       Count the contributions made by employers toward \n     beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs;\n       Maintain a level-playing field so that benefits in PPOs and \n     HMOs are not more generous than benefits available in \n     traditional fee-for-service Medicare;\n       Instruct the National Association of Insurance \n     Commissioners to adjust medigap benefit packages to allow \n     beneficiaries to buy additional coverage;\n       Increase the transparency of transactions by pharmaceutical \n     benefit managers;\n       Cut the time before the prescription drug benefits begin.\n       The current debate about a Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit has led seniors and persons with disabilities to \n     believe that relief is in sight. In its present form, S. 1 \n     will be a big disappointment to beneficiaries when it is \n     implemented in 2006. We urge you to amend S. 1 so that it is \n     more effective in providing meaningful relief to Medicare \n     beneficiaries while addressing the pressing need to curb \n     prescription drug expenditures.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Gail E. Shearer,\n\n                                 Director, Health Policy Analysis,\n     Washington Office.\n                                  ____\n\n         Society of Professional Engineering Employees in \n           Aerospace,\n                                        Seattle, WA, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: As you know, union members and \n     retirees in Washington are very concerned about the current \n     activities involving prescription drug benefits for Medicare \n     seniors. We thought you should know that we are part of a \n     national delegation of unions that met with Secretary Tommy \n     Thompson to express our opposition to any PBM-based \n     alternative to our local pharmacies.\n       PBMs own much of the mail order drug service in this \n     country. For the past 2 years, we have been warning \n     congressional members that a PBM-based benefit would \n     potentially harm many local pharmacies that serve our \n     communities. Still however, lawmakers almost passed a PBM-\n     based benefit in the 107th Congress.\n       Since last year, the reputation of PBMs has grown worse. \n     Now they are being sued by a California based union, AFSCME. \n     Allegedly, four of the largest PBMs have been pocketing money \n     that is meant for the consumer.\n       SPEEA urges you and your fellow Senators to look into this \n     lawsuit before passing any PBM-based legislation. In this day \n     and age, transparency must be part of any program set up by \n     the United States government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles Bofferding,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: On behalf of AFSCME's 1.4 million \n     members, I am writing to express my strong support for your \n     amendment to S. 1, the Medicare prescription drug bill, that \n     would make certain that costs savings generated by Pharmacy \n     Benefit Managers (PBM) on behalf of the Medicare program are \n     returned to the program. We believe that this is a critical \n     means of controlling costs for this new benefit.\n       PBMs create most of their cost savings and their profits by \n     negotiating with drug manufacturers to receive favorable \n     rates on a pharmaceutical company's drugs in exchange for \n     including the drugs on the PBM's formulary of preferred \n     medicines. This bill would require that all contracts with \n     PBMs to provide the Medicare benefit with a private insurer \n     or the government itself include language that would ensure \n     that all savings negotiated with a pharmacy be passed back to \n     the government or the private insurer administering the \n     benefit on behalf of the government.\n       We believe it is crucial that PBMs be required to disclose \n     the percentage of rebate they have negotiated with the \n     pharmaceutical companies that are passed onto their clients. \n     Your amendment would do precisely that--giving some assurance \n     to consumers and the government that the savings achieved by \n     the PBMs are being shared.\n       I believe that your amendment goes a long way toward \n     ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries will receive their fair \n     share of the cost savings produced by contracts with PBMs, \n     and AFSCME strongly supports its adoption.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n     Director of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: Families USA, the national consumer \n     health advocacy organization, strongly endorses your \n     amendment to ensure that the conflicts of interest, which can \n     occur in the delivery of a Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit, are minimized or avoided.\n       Everyone agrees that whether Medicare directly administers \n     the benefit or whether it is administered through private \n     plans, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) will be used. They \n     have the expertise and knowledge necessary to help administer \n     this program. But in the recent past, there have been \n     examples of abuse in this sector. particularly troubling has \n     been the steering of patients to a particular prescription \n     drug product because it was more profitable for the \n     administering company and not because it was better for the \n     patient! In a very real sense, that is malpractice. It is \n     inexcusable. It must be stopped. At least one major PBM has \n     announced a code of ethics to prevent such abuses. But these \n     important consumer protections should not depend on company-\n     by-company internal codes of ethics. Your amendment is \n     needed.\n       Your amendment requires the confidential disclosure of the \n     type of information that will enable the Department of Health \n     and Human Services to protect against rebates and kickbacks \n     that would cause a company to steer people toward profitable \n     medicine rather than needed medicine. Your amendment helps \n     ensure that those who will surely be called on to help \n     administer the new benefit provide good health care to the \n     beneficiaries and not just profitable health care to their \n     owners.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Washington State\n\n\n                                         Pharmacy Association,\n\n                                        Renton, WA, June 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Maria Cantwell,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: The Washington State Pharmacy \n     Association, representing pharmacy practitioners from all \n     practice arenas in the State of Washington, strongly endorses \n     your amendment to ensure that the conflicts of interest, \n     which can occur in the delivery of a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit through a PBM, are minimized or avoided.\n       Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) are an integral part of the \n     health care delivery system. Efficient plan administration \n     and timely claims processing are mandatory components of a \n     successful health care benefit which are important to \n     patients, payers and providers. However, in recent years the \n     PBM industry has expanded their role to include benefit \n     design that has created significant conflicts of interest and \n     ethical questions of appropriate health care delivery versus \n     profitable health care delivery.\n       Your amendment, as proposed, provides the necessary \n     transparency that will provide patients, payers, and \n     regulators the necessary information to appropriately monitor \n     PBM business practices. Your amendment is a significant step \n     toward insuring that the health care provided to the citizens \n     of this country is focused on improving the patient's health \n     and wellbeing and not the fiscal wellbeing of the pharmacy \n     benefit managers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Rod Shafer, R.Ph.,\n                                                              CEO.\n\n\n[[Page S8617]]\n\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, these groups and others have been \ntrying to call attention to problematic PBM practices. These groups \nrightly point out that strong consumer protections are needed in any \nMedicare drug benefit.\n  The American Association of State, County and Municipal Employees \nagrees that these protections provide ``a critical means of controlling \ncosts.''\n  A national coalition of workers representing more than 20 states also \nare supportive of efforts to monitor PBMs. Many in this coalition \ncurrently use PBMs to provide benefits and many of them are wondering \nwhy drug costs continue to rise.\n  There is a balance to be had here, and the Cantwell-Lincoln amendment \nmakes sure the scale is not tipped too far one way. It is a good \namendment that will lower prescription drug prices, provide much needed \nconsumer protections and ensure strong government oversight. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is the amendment before us now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is before us.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have looked at the amendment on this side. It has \nbeen modified, and I urge we accept it on a voice vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We have looked at this amendment. I agree with Senator \nGrassley.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nimmediately following Senator Kennedy's comments I be recognized to \noffer an amendment regarding cancer. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat this morning the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the \nMcConnell amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote in relation \nto the Boxer amendment numbered 1036, to be followed immediately by a \nvote in relation to the Bingaman amendment numbered 1065, with no \nsecond degrees in order to the three above amendments prior to the \nvote, with 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote, and with 10 \nminutes equally divided before the first vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that as soon as \nSenator Kennedy finishes his speech Senators McConnell and Boxer will \nbe recognized for 10 minutes with the time equally divided, and then we \ngo into the series of votes. Is that right?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is my understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1092\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will have a chance to have greater \ndiscussion and debate on one of the important amendments that is before \nthe Senate. But I wanted to bring to the attention of our Members as we \ngo through the course of the day the Grassley-Baucus amendment, which \nhas two different parts to it. I would like to address the part of the \namendment which I find enormously compelling and which deserves the \nbroad support of all the Members of this body.\n  This amendment provides equal funding for Medicare and the private \nplan demonstration plans. That is effectively what will be in the \nGrassley-Baucus amendment. The Republicans say the private sector can \ndo a better job providing health care for seniors and we say Medicare \ncan do a better job. This amendment tests both. This amendment improves \nthe coordination of care for seniors with multiple chronic conditions \nwho remain in Medicare. Republicans have said we need to move seniors \ninto private plans if we want to provide chronic care coordination, \ndisease management, or enhanced preventive services.\n  I am confident this demonstration program will show Medicare can do \nan even better job than private plans in providing preventive health \nservices and ensuring care coordination. Care for patients with chronic \nconditions is especially critical. These patients account for 95 \npercent of Medicare spending, according to ``Care Coordination for \nPeople with Chronic Conditions'', an analysis published this year by \nJohns Hopkins University.\n  Currently, 60 million Americans have multiple chronic conditions, and \nthat number is expected to grow to 157 million by the year 2020.\n  Sixty-two percent of seniors have multiple chronic conditions, but \ntheir care is often fragmented. A senior citizen may get treatment for \nher diabetes from one doctor, care for her arthritis from a second \ndoctor and attention for her high blood pressure from a third.\n  Study after study shows that improving the coordination of care for \nthose with multiple chronic conditions can improve outcomes and reduce \ncosts.\n  For example, in Laconia, NH, the Home and Community Based Care \nprogram improved disease management for seniors with multiple \nconditions. This program saved an average of $8,100 in health care \ncosts for each senior served and decreased admission to nursing homes.\n  In Georgia, the Service Options Using Resources in a Community \nEnvironment--SOURCE--program improved disease management for 1,600 \nbeneficiaries in 80 counties. The costs of caring for those seniors in \nthe SOURCE program over two years was over $4,000 lower than for those \nwho were not in the program.\n  My own state of Massachusetts is part of the New England States \nConsortium, a multi-state effort funded by the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation to study the improvements that can be made in health care \nthrough better care coordination.\n  Expert groups in health care have said that care coordination should \nbe one of the highest priorities for our health care system. For \nexample, in its recent report, Priority Areas for National Action: \nTransforming Health Care Quality, the Institute of Medicine identified \n20 ``priority areas'' for improving health care.\n  The Institute of Medicine has carefully examined the issue of care \nquality. The Institute's recent report, ``Priority Areas for National \nAction'' has a series of recommendations on improving the quality of \nhealth care in America. We have included in our amendment 13 of the 20 \npriority items that have been identified by the Institute of Medicine \nthat will make a significant difference in quality. The amendment will \nhave an important impact in reducing costs by improving care \ncoordination and providing needed preventive services.\n  A recent study funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation reaches \nthe same conclusion. The study examined the effect of care coordination \non outcomes for patients with diabetes. Care coordination and simple \npreventive services dramatically improved the outcome for patients with \ndiabetes in terms of their blood glucose levels. Elevated blood glucose \nis a major concern for patients with diabetes, and preventive services \nare effective in keeping blood glucose levels down. As we know, \ndiabetes is one of the principal health concerns for our country, and \nis of particular concern for our seniors.\n  A decrease of even one percentage point in the blood glucose level of \na patient with diabetes can have a profound effect on health. That \nseemingly small decrease results in a 21 percent drop in mortality from \nthe disease, a 12 percent decrease in strokes, a 24 percent decrease in \nrenal failure, and a remarkable 43 percent drop in the amputations that \nso many patients face as a result of this cruel disease. More effective \nmanagement of blood glucose levels is also effective in keeping \npatients out of hospitals or nursing homes and thus reducing costs. A \nreduction in blood glucose levels of just one percent reduces health \ncare costs by $800 per patient.\n  These kinds of extraordinary improvements in health care quality are \nwhat this amendment is all about. We are going to provide some $6 \nbillion nationwide over a 5-year period to give life to these kinds of \nquality improvement efforts, and we are going to challenge the private \nsector to do it as well.\n  We believe that the kinds of quality improvement initiatives included \nin this amendment will be a major factor for the support for this \nlegislation. Health care quality and its impact on health care costs is \nan aspect of the health care debate that has not received sufficient \nattention.\n  This amendment will give us an opportunity to take dramatic steps \nforward in Medicare which will strengthen and improve the quality of \nhealth care for our seniors. The amendment will also have a very \npositive impact in terms of cost reductions.\n  This amendment also addresses the whole question of prevention which \nis equally critical to keeping people healthy. Immunizations, managing \nhigh blood pressure, cancer screening, and patient education can all \nhave an enormous impact on keeping people healthy and reducing costs. \nToo often Medicare pays huge amounts to care for people who are sick \nbut fails to invest adequately in keeping them healthy.\n  Failure to invest adequately in preventive services is a tragic \nconsequence of the repayment system we now have under the Medicare \nsystem. When the original Medicare system was established, we did not \nhave the knowledge, awareness, and understanding of the importance of \nprevention nearly to extent we have it today. Preventive care was not \nreimbursed the way it should be.\n  Under this amendment, we will have the opportunity to provide the \nkinds of real, effective support for prevention programs they deserve. \nIncreased support for preventive services will mean\n\n[[Page S8619]]\n\nlower costs and better quality of care for our seniors under Medicare.\n  As I mentioned, too often we pay huge amounts to care for people who \nare sick, but fail to invest in keeping people healthy. This amendment \ngives Medicare the tools to invest in keeping people healthy. Too often \nthe care for people with the highest cost, the most serious illnesses, \nsuch as cancer and stroke, is not optimal.\n  This demonstration will help Medicare assure the highest quality care \nfor the sickest patients. Medicare is a fine program. It has kept our \nsenior citizens secure for 40 years. Today let us make Medicare even \nbetter with this amendment.\n  I will include the selective parts of the studies I referred to \npreviously in the Record. I ask unanimous consent that the selective \nparts be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I mentioned, the New England Journal \nof Medicine--in a major study published just today--focuses on the \nissue of quality. The study demonstrates that the problem most likely \nto occur in our health care system is not overutilization of services, \nbut underutilization. This point bears repeating. Patients all over \nAmerica are not receiving the services they need to keep them healthy. \n46 percent of patients did not receive the recommended care, while only \n11 percent received care that was not recommended and was potentially \nharmful. That means that four times as many patients did not receive \nthe care they needed as received care they did not need. The problem in \nour health care system is not overutilization of services, but \nunderutilization.\n  The problem of not receiving needed care is particularly acute for \nsome of the most serious disorders that affect seniors. The New England \nJournal article states that less than a quarter of patients with \ndiabetes received recommended blood tests. Fewer than two-thirds of \npatients with high blood pressure received the recommended care. These \ntwo diseases alone take an extraordinary toll on the lives of our \ncitizens. Nearly 600,000 seniors die each year from heart disease, and \ncomplications of diabetes kill over 50,000 seniors. We could \ndramatically reduce the serious toll of these diseases--and many \nothers--by improving access to preventive services and enhancing the \nquality of care.\n  Modern medicine--and a strong Medicare program--have been effective \nin allowing seniors to live with chronic conditions that once were \nfatal. Millions of seniors are alive today because of advances in the \ntreatment of heart disease, high cholesterol, cancer and other serious \nillnesses. As a result of this success, however, millions of seniors \nhave multiple chronic conditions which put them at higher risk for \nillness and hospitalization. The Institute of Medicine reports that \nonly 0.7 percent of seniors with just one chronic condition require \nhospitalization in any given year. 6.2 percent of seniors with 4 \nchronic conditions are hospitalized, and over 25 percent of those with \n10 or more chronic conditions require a hospital stay. Currently, 60 \nmillion Americans have multiple chronic conditions, and that number is \nexpected to grow to 157 million over the next two decades.\n  Improving the coordination of care for those with multiple chronic \nconditions can markedly improve outcomes. Yet the average Medicare \nbeneficiary sees more than six different doctors in a year. Clearly, we \nneed to do more to see that seniors receive the most appropriate care \nfor all their conditions--not just the one that any particular doctor \namong these six is treating individually. Study after study cited by \nthe Institute of Medicine indicates that care is inadequately \ncoordinated for patients with some of the most serious diseases.\n  Our health care system also fails to provide adequate preventive \nservices. Survival rates for many forms of cancer increase dramatically \nif the disease is detected early--yet far too few patients receive the \ntype of early screening that can literally mean the difference between \nlife and death. For example, early diagnosis of colon cancer results in \na survival rate of 90 percent, but that survival rate drops \nprecipitously if the cancer spreads or grows before it is detected. \nEarly detection not only saves lives--it reduces costs too. Proper \nscreening can save up to $25,000 for every patient who avoids painful \nand lengthy treatment through early detection of cancer. Despite this \ncompelling evidence of the value of preventive services, only a third \nof patients receive the recommended form of colon cancer screening.\n  The story is the same with adult immunization. Pneumonia and \ninfluenza are the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, \nand the fifth leading cause of death among seniors. Over a third of \nseniors with invasive pneumonia will die of the disease. Many cases of \nthese diseases are preventable with a simple immunization--yet one-\nthird to one-half of all seniors do not receive needed immunizations. \nCoverage rates for high-risk seniors are particularly poor. Tragically, \nonly about a quarter of seniors with chronic disease receive a flu \nshot.\n  This very important amendment will address these challenges which the \nInstitute of Medicine, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the New \nEngland Journal of Medicine have all commented on as being critical if \nwe are going to strengthen quality and begin to get a greater handle on \ncosts.\n  I will refer to the part of the amendment that addresses these \nquestions. Page 13 of the amendment describes the enhanced benefits \nthat will now be available to beneficiaries in terms of care \ncoordination, disease management and preventive services not otherwise \ncovered under section 18 of the Social Security Administration. I ask \nunanimous consent to include the section of the bill containing this \nprovision in the Record.\n  The amendment provides chronic care coordination services, disease \nmanagement services and other benefits that the Secretary will \ndetermine to improve preventive health care for Medicare beneficiaries. \nThese services will improve chronic disease management and management \nof complex life-threatening or high-cost conditions. The amendment will \nmake a real difference in improving the health of millions of seniors.\n  This is really a historic opportunity. I can say, having been here \nfor some period of time, the idea that you would get $6 billion over 5 \nyears to be able to support prevention and the coordination of care for \nour seniors--I didn't believe it would ever be realized. We have that \nchance with this amendment.\n  I think one of the most important aspects of this legislation is its \nemphasis on the area of prevention, which is so important, as I have \njust described. Increased support for preventive health care services \nwill improve and strengthen the quality of health care and also result \nin savings for the Medicare system. We have seen how these services \nhelp the intensely ill and sick and fragile elderly. And we will \nincrease the coordination of services as well. All of this makes a \ngreat deal of sense. And we have the evidence--ample evidence--to show \nthat action in this area can make a very important difference to the \nelderly.\n  I will let others describe the other part of the amendment dealing \nwith private plans. But we challenge them, after the 5 years in which \nthe resources will be spent--with a GAO study that will report back how \nthe money has been spent--we challenge them to see which will make the \ngreatest difference in terms of quality of care for our senior \npopulation and will make a difference in terms of the savings in the \nMedicare system. There is no question in my mind--no question in my \nmind--what that GAO report will demonstrate. We have clear \ndocumentation and scientific information that talks about the various \nstudies that have been done to date, and also the conclusions that have \nbeen reached by the thoughtful, nonpartisan groups in this very area.\n  We welcome the opportunity to show to the American people which \nsystem is really going to work effectively. At the end of that period \nof time, we will have the chance to enhance and improve on that, to \nmake sure the future generations' health care will be strengthened.\n  So I hope this amendment, which will be before us very soon, will \nreceive overwhelming support because I think it will have a real chance \nto evaluate the different approaches and see what\n\n[[Page S8620]]\n\nis going to be most effective in terms of quality and cost.\n\n                   Blood Glucose--Reductions Pay Off\n\n       Longitudinal studies demonstrate that a one percentage \n     point reduction in Hemoglobin A1C (blood glucose) results in: \n     14% decrease in total mortality; 21% decrease in diabetes-\n     related deaths; 14% decrease in myocardial infarction; 12% \n     decrease in strokes; 43% decrease in amputations; 24% \n     decrease in renal failure; and $800 reduction in health care \n     costs.\n\n\n                     Problems with Quality of Care\n\n       The problem with quality that is most likely to occur, is \n     underuse: 46.3 percent of participants did not receive \n     recommended care. With overuse, 11.3 percent of participants \n     received care that was not recommended and was potentially \n     harmful.\n\n\n                         Variations in Quality\n\n       There is substantial variability in the quality-of-care \n     patients receive for the 25 conditions for which at least 100 \n     persons were eligible for analysis. Persons with senile \n     cataracts received 78.7 percent of the recommended care; \n     persons with alcohol dependence received 10.5 percent of the \n     recommended care. The aggregate scores for individual \n     conditions were generally not sensitive to the presence or \n     absence of any single indicator of quality.\n\n\n                               Discussion\n\n       Overall, participants received about half of the \n     recommended processes involved in care. These deficits in \n     care have important implications for the health of the \n     American public. For example, only 24 percent of participants \n     in our study who had diabetes received three or more \n     glycosylated hemoglobin tests over a two-year period. This \n     routine monitoring is essential to the assessment of the \n     effectiveness of treatment, to ensuring appropriate responses \n     to poor glycemic control, and to the identification of \n     complications of the disease at an early stage so that \n     serious consequences may be prevented.\n       In our study, persons with hypertension received 64.7 \n     percent of the recommended care. We have previously \n     demonstrated a link between blood-pressure control and \n     adherence to process-related measures of quality of care for \n     hypertension. Persons whose blood pressure is persistently \n     above normal are at increased risk for heart disease, stroke, \n     and death. Poor blood-pressure control contributes to more \n     than 68,000 preventable deaths annually.\n\n\n                      final list of priority areas\n\n       The committee's selection process yielded a final set of 20 \n     priority areas for improvement in health care quality. \n     Improving the delivery of care in any of these areas would \n     enable stakeholders at the national, state, and local levels \n     to begin setting a course for quality health care while \n     addressing unacceptable disparities in care for all \n     Americans. The committee made no attempt to rank order the \n     priority areas selected. The first 2 listed--care \n     coordination and self-management/health literacy--are cross-\n     cutting areas in which improvements would benefit a broad \n     array of patients. The 17 that follow represent the continuum \n     of care across the life span and are relevant to preventive \n     care, inpatient/surgical care, chronic conditions, end-of-\n     life care, and behavioral health, as well as to care for \n     children and adolescents (see boxes ES-1 to ES-6). Finally, \n     obesity is included as an ``emerging area'' that does not at \n     this point satisfy the selection criteria as fully as the \n     other 19 priority areas.\n       Recommendation 3: The committee recommends that DHHS, along \n     with other public and private entities, focus on the \n     following priority areas for transforming health care:\n       Care coordination (cross-cutting);\n       Self-management/health literacy (cross-cutting);\n       Asthma--appropriate treatment for persons with mild/\n     moderate persistent asthma;\n       Cancer screening that is evidence-based--focus on \n     colorectal and cervical cancer;\n       Children with special health care needs;\n       Diabetes--focus on appropriate management of early disease;\n       End of life with advanced organ system failure--focus on \n     congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease;\n       Frailty associated with old age--preventing falls and \n     pressure ulcers, maximizing function, and developing advanced \n     care plans;\n       Hypertension--focus on appropriate management of early \n     disease;\n       Immunization--children and adults;\n       Ischemic heart disease--prevention, reduction of recurring \n     events, and optimization of functional capacity;\n       Major depression--screening and treatment;\n       Medication management--preventing medication errors and \n     overuse of antibiotics;\n       Nosocomial infections--prevention and surveillance;\n       Pain control in advanced cancer;\n       Pregnancy and childbirth--appropriate prenatal and \n     intrapartum care;\n       Severe and persistent mental illness--focus on treatment in \n     the public sector;\n       Stroke--early intervention and rehabilitation;\n       Tobacco dependence treatment in adults; and\n       Obesity (emerging area).\n\n\n               Care Coordination--Rationale for Selection\n\n                                 Impact\n\n       Nearly half of the population--125 million Americans--lives \n     with some type of chronic condition. About 60 million live \n     with multiple such conditions. And more than 3 million--2.5 \n     million women and 750,000 men--live with five such conditions \n     (Partnership for Solutions, 2001). For those afflicted by one \n     or more chronic conditions, coordination of care over time \n     and across multiple health care providers and settings is \n     crucial. Yet in a survey of over 1,200 physicians conducted \n     in 2001, two-thirds of respondents reported that their \n     training was not adequate to coordinate care or education for \n     patients with chronic conditions (Partnership for Solutions, \n     2001).\n       More than 50 percent of patients with hypertension (Joint \n     National Committee on Prevention, 1997), diabetes (Clark et \n     al., 2000), tobacco addition (Perez-Stable and Fuentes-\n     Afflick, 1998), hyperlipidemia (McBride et al., 1998), \n     congestive heart failure (Ni et al., 1998), chronic atrial \n     fibrillation (Samsa et al., 2000), asthma (Legorreta et al., \n     2000), and depression (Young et al., 2001) are currently \n     managed inadequately. Among the Medicare-eligible population, \n     the average beneficiary sees 6.4 different physicians in a \n     year, 4.6 of those being in the outpatient setting (Anderson, \n     2002a).\n\n\n    Cancer Screening That is Evidence-Based--Rationale for Selection\n\n                                 Impact\n\n       Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer among men \n     and women in the United States, with an estimated incidence \n     of 148,300 cases annually. In 2002, 56,600 Americans died \n     from colorectal cancer, making it the nation's second leading \n     cause of cancer-related death. Lifetime risk for developing \n     colorectal cancer is approximately 6 percent with over 90 \n     percent of cases occurring after age 50 (American Cancer \n     Society, 2002). The estimated long-term cost of treating \n     stage II colon cancer is approximately $60,000 (Brown et al., \n     2002).\n       Cervical cancer is the ninth most common cancer among women \n     in the United States, with an estimated incidence of 13,000 \n     cases annually. Cervical cancer ranks thirteenth among all \n     causes of cancer death, with about 4,100 women dying of the \n     disease each year (American Cancer Society, 2002). The \n     incidence of cervical cancer has steadily declined, dropping \n     46 percent between 1975 and 1999 from a rate of 14.8 per \n     100,000 women to 8.0 per 100,000 women (Ries et al., 2002). \n     Despite these gains, cervical cancer continues to be a \n     significant public health issue. It has been estimated that \n     60 percent of cases of cervical cancer are due to a lack of \n     or deficiencies in screening (Sawaya and Grimes, 1999).\n\n\n                      Prevention--Cancer Screening\n\n                             Improvability\n\n       Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer while it is still at a \n     localized state results in a 90 percent survival rate at 5 \n     years (Ries et al., 2002). The American Cancer Society's \n     (ACS) guidelines recommend screening for colorectal cancer \n     beginning at age 50 for adults at average risk using one of \n     the following five screening regimens: fecal occult blood \n     test (FOBT) annually; flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years; \n     annual FOBT plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years; double \n     contrast barium enema every 5 years; or colonoscopy every 10 \n     years (American Cancer Society, 2001). The United States \n     Preventive Services Task Force strongly recommends screening \n     for men and women 50 years of age and or older for colorectal \n     cancer. Screening has been found to be cost-effective in \n     saving lives, with estimates ranging from $10,000 and $25,000 \n     life-year saved.\n\n\n             immunization (adult)--rationale for selection\n\n                                 Impact\n\n       Pneumonia and influenza are the seventh leading cause of \n     death in the United States (The Commonwealth Fund, 2002). \n     Pneumococcal disease causes 10,000 to 14,000 deaths annually; \n     influenza causes an average of 110,000 hospitalizations and \n     20,000 deaths annually (United States Department of Health \n     and Human Services, 2000). Approximately 30-43 percent of \n     elderly people who have invasive pneumonia will die from the \n     disease (United States Preventive Services Task Force, 1996). \n     The elderly are also at increased risk for complications \n     associated with influenza, and approximately 90 percent of \n     the deaths attributed to the disease are among those aged 65 \n     and older (Vishnu-Priya et al., 2000).\n       To decrease the burden of these diseases, including \n     incapacitating malaise, doctor visits, hospitalizations, and \n     premature deaths, experts recommend vaccination. Yet one-\n     third to one-half of older adults (aged 65 and over) do not \n     receive these vaccinations (The Commonwealth Fund, 2002). \n     Coverage rates for high-risk adults who suffer from chronic \n     disease are especially poor, with only 26 percent receiving \n     an influenza vaccination and 13 percent a pneumococcal \n     vaccination (Institute of Medicine, 2000).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To protect seniors with cancer)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROTECTING SENIORS WITH CANCER.\n\n       Any eligible beneficiary (as defined in section 1860D(3) of \n     the Social Security Act) who is diagnosed with cancer shall \n     be protected from high prescription drug costs in the \n     following manner:\n       (1) Subsidy eligible individuals with an income below 100 \n     percent of the federal poverty line.--If the individual is a \n     qualified medicare beneficiary (as defined in section 1860D-\n     19(a)(4) of such Act), such individual shall receive the full \n     premium subsidy and reduction of cost-sharing described in \n     section 1860D-19(a)(1) of such Act, including the payment \n     of--\n       (A) no deductible;\n       (B) no monthly beneficiary premium for at least one \n     Medicare Prescription Drug plan available in the area in \n     which the individual resides; and\n       (C) reduced cost-sharing described in subparagraphs (C), \n     (D), and (E) of section 1860D-19(a)(1) of such Act.\n       (2) Subsidy eligible individuals with an income between 100 \n     and 135 percent of the federal poverty line.--If the \n     individual is a specified low income medicare beneficiary (as \n     defined in paragraph 1860D-19(4)(B) of such Act) or a \n     qualifying individual (as defined in paragraph 1860D-19(4)(C) \n     of such Act) who is diagnosed with cancer, such individual \n     shall receive the full premium subsidy and reduction of cost-\n     sharing described in section 1860D-19(a)(2) of such Act, \n     including payment of--\n       (A) no deductible;\n       (B) no monthly premium for any Medicare Prescription Drug \n     plan described paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1860D-17(a) of \n     such Act; and\n       (C) reduced cost-sharing described in subparagraphs (C), \n     (D), and (E) of section 1860D-19(a)(2) of such Act.\n       (3) Subsidy-eligible individuals with income between 135 \n     percent and 160 percent of the federal poverty level.--If the \n     individual is a subsidy-eligible individual (as defined in \n     section 1860D-19(a)(4)(D) of such Act) who is diagnosed with \n     cancer, such individual shall receive sliding scale premium \n     subsidy and reduction of cost-sharing for subsidy-eligible \n     individuals, including payment of--\n       (A) for 2006, a deductible of only $50;\n       (B) only a percentage of the monthly premium (as described \n     in section 1860D-19(a)(3)(A)(i)); and\n       (C) reduced cost-sharing described in clauses (iii), (iv), \n     and (v) of section 1860D-19(a)(3)(A).\n       (4) Eligible beneficiaries with income above 160 percent of \n     the federal poverty level.--If an individual is an eligible \n     beneficiary (as defined in section 1860D(3) of such Act), is \n     not described in paragraphs (1) through (3), and is diagnosed \n     with cancer, such individual shall have access to qualified \n     prescription drug coverage (as described in section 1860D-\n     6(a)(1) of such Act), including payment of--\n       (A) for 2006, a deductible of $275;\n       (B) the limits on cost-sharing described section 1860D-\n     6(c)(2) of such Act up to, for 2006, an initial coverage \n     limit of $4,500; and\n       (C) for 2006, an annual out-of-pocket limit of $3,700 with \n     10 percent cost-sharing after that limit is reached.\n       (5) Construction.--Notwithstanding the preceding provisions \n     of this section, nothing in this section shall be construed \n     in a manner that would provide an individual who is diagnosed \n     with cancer with benefits under part D of title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act (as added by section 101) that are \n     different from the benefits that the individual would have \n     been eligible for if such individual was not diagnosed with \n     cancer.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment I just sent to the desk \nensures protection of seniors diagnosed with cancer from the high \nprescription drug costs associated with that illness.\n  My amendment states specifically that any senior in Medicare and \ndiagnosed with cancer shall have the right to a drug plan in which the \nbeneficiary shall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, no more than a \n2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending up to $4,500 a year, no \nmore than a 5-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and \n$5,800 a year, and no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug \nspending over $5,800 if their income is below the poverty level.\n  My amendment states that any senior in Medicare who is also diagnosed \nwith cancer, with an income between 100 percent and 135 percent of the \npoverty level, shall have the right to a drug plan in which the \nbeneficiary shall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, no more than a \n5-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 10-\npercent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no \nmore than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending over $5,800.\n  My amendment provides that any senior in Medicare diagnosed with \ncancer, with an income between 135 percent and 160 percent of the \npoverty level, shall have the right to a drug plan in which the \nbeneficiary shall pay no more than a $50 deductible, an average monthly \npremium not greater than $35, no more than a 10-percent copayment for \ndrug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 20-percent copayment for \ndrug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no more than a 10-percent \ncopayment for any drug spending over $5,800.\n  My amendment also provides that any senior in Medicare and diagnosed \nwith cancer, with an income above 160 percent of the poverty level, \nshall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay \nno more than a $275 deductible, an average monthly premium not greater \nthan $35, no more than a 50-percent copayment for drug spending up to \n$4,500, and no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending over \n$5,800.\n  With this amendment, which conforms to the provisions within the \nbill, all seniors with cancer get help with prescription drug costs, \nespecially the poor and moderate-income seniors.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Boxer amendment is very simple. It says \nif a person is receiving cancer drugs and they come to a period of \ntime--as this bill is written--where they run out of the ability to get \nhelp from the Medicare Program, that they, in effect, are covered.\n  We want a cancer patient to have no donut hole, no gap in coverage. \nThat is what the Boxer amendment is all about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do we have any time?\n  Mr. REID. We have at least 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield me a minute?\n  Mr. REID. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Boxer amendment provides the \nadditional resources for the treatment of cancer. I think all of us \nunderstand the importance of the continuity of care in the treatment of \ndisease generally. That is why I am going to continue to vigorously \nfight for additional resources to fill in this gap in the future for \nall diseases. But it is particularly important to fill this gap for \npeople who are afflicted with the disease of cancer. They are waiting \nfor Congress to fill in this gap.\n  It does seem to me, because of the compelling reasons for the \ncontinuity of care in terms of diseases generally we ought to be able \nto find the additional resources to fill this gap.\n  The Boxer amendment does not replace the fundamental structure of \nthis legislation. It finds the additional resources to be able to make \nsure there will be continuity of care for what is, for many families, \ntheir Number 1 health concern. So that is a very compelling reason. I \nhope the amendment will be favorably considered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to withhold the suggestion \nof a quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.\n  Who yields time?\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back.\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the McConnell amendment No. 1097.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry), would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

The Senator from Kentucky and I agreed to an extra 30 \nseconds each, so I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to speak to the hearts and the \nminds of each and every one of my colleagues and friends, so I will \nspeak straight from the shoulder.\n  The amendment we just voted for did nothing, not one thing, for \ncancer patients, except reiterate what is already in the underlying \nbill.\n  What my amendment does, and why I hope we will rise to the occasion \nand support it, is to send a strong message to anyone diagnosed with \ncancer, and to their families, friends, and loved ones, that if and \nwhen they are diagnosed with cancer, they will not face the benefit \nshutdown that is now in this bill.\n  I will show my colleagues on this chart that at $4,500 of drug costs, \nthe benefit shuts down. I want my colleagues to think about someone \nthey know with cancer, someone who is battling cancer. Do we want to \nput this burden on them? They must take their drugs. They cannot cut \ntheir pills in half in order to survive.\n  The Cancer Society tells us that 6 million to 7 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries are battling some form of cancer, and 380,000 of them \nwill die of cancer. Please, let us relieve this burden of them having \nto pay 100 percent of their drug costs during this benefit shutdown. I \nbeg my colleagues to take a stand. I beg my colleagues to be \ncompassionate. I beg my colleagues to be independent for once on an \namendment and support the cancer patients who are counting on us today \nto at least relieve them of this terrible financial burden that will \nhit them just when they are the sickest.\n  I urge an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Before I use my time, I have a unanimous consent \nrequest. That unanimous consent request is that the time lapse between \nthe next two votes be 10 minutes instead of 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, from a parliamentary point of \nview, this amendment, if adopted, would subject the entire bill to a \nbudget point of order. We have enough people in this body who maybe do \nnot want a prescription drug bill that could take down the whole bill.\n  The other reason is, all the concerns the Senator has mentioned we \nhave taken into account within the $400 billion capability of our \nlegislation. We have before us this $400 billion to provide \nprescription drug benefits to our seniors. We have used that $400 \nbillion to help low-income seniors with prescription drug costs if they \nhave cancer, diabetes, or anything else for which they need drugs.\n  We have used the $400 billion to limit the catastrophic costs of \nprescription drugs to all seniors. We do not create two drug classes \nfor the sick and the ill, and that is why we should move forward with \nthis amendment so it does not bring down the whole bill on a potential \nbudget point of order.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Is there a sufficient \nsecond?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Florida, \nMr. Graham, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I also ask unanimous consent that we be allowed 2 \nminutes to advocate for the amendment and the opposition get 2 minutes \nas well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will take one of those 2 minutes and \nSenator Domenici the other.\n  This is a Bingaman-Domenici amendment. The purpose of it is not to \neliminate the asset test. That was an earlier amendment I offered and \nthen withdrew. Instead, it is to update the asset test, where you would \nstill be required to demonstrate that your income was below poverty or \nin that range, but instead of having to demonstrate that your total \ncombined assets were only $4,000, you would be able to show that they \nwere less than $10,000.\n  This also eliminates the paperwork burden that currently is imposed \nin most States on people who are required to itemize their assets and \nessentially provide a full financial statement to get the full low-\nincome benefit.\n  We think this is a needed update on the asset test. It will allow a \nlot more people to get the full benefit.\n  I yield the remaining time to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. I \nbelieve it is absolutely fair and nothing more than simple equity. We \nhave had an asset test under Medicaid, which applies here, since 1988. \nIt is $4,000. That means there is an income test and an asset test of \n$4,000. I believe the time has come to change that $4,000 to something \nmore reasonable--not gigantic, just $10,000. It says the income test \nstill applies, but you can own assets up to $10,000.\n  It also says you do not have to fill out all kinds of forms. You can \nsign an affidavit under penalty of felony, as to what your assets are, \nand that suffices. If there is anything this bill needs it is \nsimplicity. So this adds simplicity to this form. But most of all, for \nthe poor people, it permits them to own a car today. You know, hardly \nany cars are worth less than $4,000. I think you can be poverty \nstricken and still own an automobile.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe the amendment should be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \namendment offered by Senator Bingaman. We are not here to alter the \nguidelines for the Medicaid Program because it certainly would have an \nimpact on the underlying Medicaid Program.\n  Let me be clear. We did not create a new asset test for this benefit. \nWe followed the asset test that exists in current law and that governs \nexisting low-income assistance programs under Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Actually, we learned our lesson from the last debate last fall on the \ntripartisan bill. We realized in constructing that approach that we \nexcluded 40 percent of low-income Medicare beneficiaries. So this time \nwe built on the existing Medicaid and Medicare Programs. We created a \nnew program for those under 160 percent of the poverty level that has \nno asset test. By doing so, we capture 8.5 million more Medicare \nbeneficiaries for a total of 17.5 million Medicare beneficiaries or 43 \npercent of the overall program.\n  We target our assistance, the most assistance to those most in need. \nSo it is important for our colleagues to understand, we are using asset \ntests that already exist in current law to maximize the most assistance \nto those most in need of this benefit.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 69, nays 29, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 251 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Graham (SC)\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--29\n\n     Allard\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dole\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n      \n  The amendment (No. 1065) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 251, I voted nay. I \nintended to vote yea. It does not change the outcome of the vote. I ask \nunanimous consent that the Record reflect as I have stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to a McConnell or designee \namendment regarding Alzheimer's, to be followed immediately by a vote \nin relation to the Durbin amendment on the same subject, again, with no \nsecond degrees in order to either amendment prior to the votes; \nprovided further that the Senate then proceed to a vote in relation to \nthe Dorgan second-degree amendment on premiums to the Grassley-Baucus \namendment No. 1092. Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following \ndisposition of the Dorgan amendment, the Senate then proceed to a vote \nin relation to the underlying Grassley-Baucus amendment, with no other \namendments in order to amendment No. 1092 other than the mentioned Kyl \nand Dorgan amendments. I also ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided for debate between each of the votes in this \nseries as well.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, everyone here is working in \nthe best of faith to try to work through\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nthis situation. We don't have the actual document of the Durbin \namendment. I have been told what is in that. I related that to the \nmajority and to the two managers of the bill. It is very similar to the \nBoxer amendment. If it is anything different than that, I will make \nsure that we vitiate this agreement.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. So if the Durbin amendment is other than we \nanticipate, I will obviously reserve the right to modify mine as well.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask the \nmajority leader if in the period between now and when the first vote \noccurs, there will be provided 30 minutes for the offering and \ndiscussion of my amendment. I had previously talked with the Senator \nfrom Nevada. Senator Pryor and I wish to be recognized for 30 minutes \nto offer our amendment. I simply ask if that timeframe allows that \nopportunity so that we have 30 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to make sure I am \nprotected to lay down my amendment now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have approximately an hour and a half. I \nwould ask, as Senator Dorgan asked earlier, that he and Senator Pryor \nbe given 30 minutes of that hour and a half, and Senator Durbin be \ngiven a half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are talking about how to divide up \nan hour and a half. How about a consent that we divide the time \nequally?\n  Mr. REID. That will be fine. I ask unanimous consent that the \nagreement give each side an extra 5 minutes, so the vote would occur at \n2:40, rather than 2:30, and the time be divided equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, I don't care what the vote \nis. Senator Pryor and I wish to speak for 30 minutes. If that is not \nprovided for in the unanimous consent, I will object.\n  Mr. REID. That is fine on this side.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1102\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, pursuant to the consent agreement just \nentered into, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1102.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To protect seniors with Alzheimer's disease)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. PROTECTING SENIORS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.\n\n       Any eligible beneficiary (as defined in section 1860D(3) of \n     the Social Security Act) who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's \n     disease shall be protected from high prescription drug costs \n     in the following manner:\n       (1) Subsidy eligible individuals with an income below 100 \n     percent of the federal poverty line.--If the individual is a \n     qualified medicare beneficiary (as defined in section 1860D-\n     19(a)(4) of such Act), such individual shall receive the full \n     premium subsidy and reduction of cost-sharing described in \n     section 1860D-19(a)(1) of such Act, including the payment \n     of--\n       (A) no deductible;\n       (B) no monthly beneficiary premium for at least one \n     Medicare Prescription Drug plan available in the area in \n     which the individual resides; and\n       (C) reduced cost-sharing described in subparagraphs (C), \n     (D), and (E) of section 1860D-19(a)(1) of such Act.\n       (2) Subsidy eligible individuals with an income between 100 \n     and 135 percent of the federal poverty line.--If the \n     individual is a specified low income medicare beneficiary (as \n     defined in paragraph 1860D-19(4)(B) of such Act) or a \n     qualifying individual (as defined in paragraph 1860D-19(4)(C) \n     of such Act) who is diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, such \n     individual shall receive the full premium subsidy and \n     reduction of cost-sharing described in section 1860D-19(a)(2) \n     of such Act, including payment of--\n       (A) no deductible;\n       (B) no monthly premium for any Medicare Prescription Drug \n     plan described paragraph (1) or (2) of section 1860D-17(a) of \n     such Act; and\n       (C) reduced cost-sharing described in subparagraphs (C), \n     (D), and (E) of section 1860D-19(a)(2) of such Act.\n       (3) Subsidy-eligible individuals with income between 135 \n     percent and 160 percent of the federal poverty level.--If the \n     individual is a subsidy-eligible individual (as defined in \n     section 1860D-19(a)(4)(D) of such Act) who is diagnosed with \n     Alzheimer's disease, such individual shall receive sliding \n     scale premium subsidy and reduction of cost-sharing for \n     subsidy-eligible individuals, including payment of--\n       (A) for 2006, a deductible of only $50;\n       (B) only a percentage of the monthly premium (as described \n     in section 1860D-19(a)(3)(A)(i)); and\n       (C) reduced cost-sharing described in clauses (iii), (iv), \n     and (v) of section 1860D-19(a)(3)(A).\n       (4) Eligible beneficiaries with income above 160 percent of \n     the federal poverty level.--If an individual is an eligible \n     beneficiary (as defined in section 1860D(3) of such Act), is \n     not described in paragraphs (1) through (3), and is diagnosed \n     with Alzheimer's disease, such individual shall have access \n     to qualified prescription drug coverage (as described in \n     section 1860D-6(a)(1) of such Act), including payment of--\n       (A) for 2006, a deductible of $275;\n       (B) the limits on cost-sharing described section 1860D-\n     6(c)(2) of such Act up to, for 2006, an initial coverage \n     limit of $4,500; and\n       (C) for 2006, an annual out-of-pocket limit of $3,700 with \n     10 percent cost-sharing after that limit is reached.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very briefly, the amendment I just sent \nto the desk ensures protection of seniors diagnosed with Alzheimer's \nfrom the high prescription drug costs associated with that illness.\n  My amendment states specifically that any senior on Medicare \ndiagnosed with Alzheimer's shall have the right to a drug plan in which \nthe beneficiary shall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, no more \nthan a 2.5-percent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more \nthan a 5-percent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, \nand no more than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending over \n$5,800 if their income is below the poverty level.\n  My amendment states that any senior on Medicare diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's with an income between 100 and 135 percent of the poverty \nlevel shall have the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary \nshall pay no deductible, no monthly premium, and no more than a 5-\npercent copayment for drug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 10-\npercent copayment for drug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no \nmore than a 2.5-percent copayment for any drug spending over $5,800.\n  My amendment provides that any senior in Medicare diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's with an income between 135 percent and 160 percent of the \npoverty level shall have the right to a drug plan in which the \nbeneficiary shall pay no more than a $50 deductible, an average monthly \npremium not greater than $35, no more than a 10-percent copayment for \ndrug spending up to $4,500, no more than a 20-percent copayment for \ndrug spending between $4,500 and $5,800, and no more than a 10-percent \ncopayment for any drug spending above $5,800.\n  My amendment also provides that any senior on Medicare diagnosed with \nAlzheimer's with an income above 160 percent of the poverty level shall \nhave the right to a drug plan in which the beneficiary shall pay no \nmore than a $275 deductible, an average monthly premium not greater \nthan $35, no more than a 50-percent copayment for drug spending up to \n$4,500, and no more than a 10-percent copayment for drug spending over \n$5,800.\n  With this amendment, which conforms to the provisions within the \nbill, all seniors with Alzheimer's get help with drug costs, especially \nthe poor and moderate-income seniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1093 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of \nSenator Kyl, to withdraw the Kyl amendment to the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Dorgan \namendment be offered now and the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1103 to Amendment No. 1092\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself and \n     Mr. Pryor, proposes an amendment numbered 1103.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To reduce aggregate beneficiary obligations by $2,400,000,000 \n                      per year beginning in 2009)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. ____. AGGREGATE REDUCTION IN MONTHLY BENEFICIARY \n                   OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       Section 1860D-17, as added by section 101, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(d) Aggregate Reduction in Monthly Beneficiary \n     Obligations.--The Administrator shall for each year \n     (beginning with 2009) determine a percentage which--\n       ``(1) shall apply in lieu of the applicable percent \n     otherwise determined under subsection (c) for that year, and\n       ``(2) will result in a decrease of $2,400,000,000 for that \n     year in the aggregate monthly beneficiary obligations \n     otherwise required of all eligible beneficiaries enrolled in \n     a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan or a Medicare Advantage \n     plan that provides qualified prescription drug coverage.\n     This subsection shall not apply in determining the applicable \n     percent under subsection (c) for purposes of section 1860D-\n     21.''.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with the \nquestion of what to do about the $12 billion of remaining available out \nof the $400 billion Congress set aside for a prescription drug benefit \nplan in the Medicare Program. According to CBO, the underlying bill is \n$12 billion of that $400 billion, so what do we do with that $12 \nbillion? If the bill on the floor of the Senate to add prescription \ndrugs to the Medicare Program costs $388 billion, and we have allocated \n$400 billion, the question is, what do you do with the other $12 \nbillion? So we had a group of people--I am not quite sure who they \nwere--negotiate over a period of time, and they have now developed a \nplan for what to do with the $12 billion.\n  By far, the simplest, most direct, and most appropriate use of the \n$12 billion would be to improve the prescription drug benefit for \nMedicare recipients. After all, that is why we are here. That is the \npurpose of this discussion and debate. That is the purpose of writing \nthis legislation--to provide a prescription drug benefit to the \nMedicare Program that serves the interests of our senior citizens.\n  Regrettably, the Grassley amendment before us, to which I have just \noffered a second-degree amendment, does not accomplish those goals. So \nI offer an amendment that is very simple. It says let's try to improve \nthis prescription drug benefit plan for senior citizens with the $12 \nbillion that is available.\n  Let me just mention a word generally about Medicare. We have people \non the floor of the Senate who don't like Medicare. They don't say it, \nI know. One of their colleagues said it yesterday in New York City. It \nis the only flash of candid comment that I have seen recently. \nCongressman Thomas, in the New York Times, dated 6/26, says:\n\n       Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle are \n     saying that if this bill becomes law [meaning the Medicare \n     prescription drug bill] it will be the end of Medicare as we \n     know it. Our answer to that is, we certainly hope so.\n\n  Let me read it again so we understand what he is saying: ``Some of \nour friends [Democrats, he means] . . . are saying if this bill becomes \nlaw, it will be the end of Medicare as we know it. Our answer to that \nis, we certainly hope so.''\n  When I was a young boy in a town of 400 people, my dad asked me to \ndrive an old fellow to the hospital in Dickinson, ND. He was a man with \na very serious health problem, and he had no relatives, had no vehicle, \nhad no resources. So I was a teenager just about out of high school. I \ngot him in my car and drove him to St. Joseph's Hospital in Dickinson, \nND, and dropped him off there to be treated. He had a serious health \nproblem but no insurance, no money, nothing.\n  The fact is, that was at a period of time in the late 1950s and early \n1960s when a good many senior citizens had no capability to get health \ncare. They had no insurance coverage. It wasn't the case that insurance \ncompanies were running after old folks to ask them: Can we please sell \nyou a health insurance policy? They want to insure 22-year-olds--\nhealthy, vibrant, young 22-year-olds.\n  That is where they make money. They don't make money by chasing 75-\nyear-old people and selling them health insurance policies. Back in the \nearly 1960s, one-half of America's elderly had no health insurance--\nnone. None at all.\n  Then along came Medicare. The Congress had a real debate about that. \nI wasn't here then, but you know there were naysayers who say no to \neverything for the first time. They said no, no, no; you cannot create \nMedicare. Well, we did create Medicare, and now 99 percent of the \nsenior citizens in this country don't have to go to bed at night \nworrying about whether they can get medical care because they have \nhealth care coverage under Medicare. God bless them for that. They \nneeded it, they deserved it, and this country provided it through the \nMedicare Program.\n\n  Some say: We have incredible problems financing this program. Yes, we \nhave some financial problems, no question about that. Do you know how \nwe solve those problems? Go back to the old life expectancy. Go back \n100 years and, on average, you were expected to live to 48 years of age \nin this country. Now people live to 76 to 77 years of age.\n  Life expectancy has increased dramatically in this country. That is \ngood news. Our financing problems with Medicare are born of good news. \nPeople are living longer. Good for them. Good for us. Good for our \ncountry.\n  Is it a problem to have good news? I do not think so. We will solve \nthese issues. But even as we have done that, even as people are living \nlonger and better lives, these new miracle medicines that have been \ncreated since Medicare was created are very expensive but very \nnecessary for people to continue their lifestyle. And we have no \nprescription drug coverage in the Medicare Program.\n  Clearly, if we wrote Medicare starting from scratch today, we would \nhave prescription drug coverage. That is clear to everyone. But \nprescription drugs were not a key medical expense when Medicare was \ncreated, so now we have to put that coverage in the Medicare Program.\n  Because some people do not like the Medicare Program--to wit my \ncolleague, Congressman Thomas who said, ``certainly we hope this will \nbe the end of Medicare as we know it,''--they want to privatize \nMedicare. Now, keep in mind that the private sector is the sector that \nwould not insure old people in the first place, which is the reason why \nCongress had to develop the Medicare Program.\n  That brings us back to this question of what to do with the $12 \nbillion. We are struggling to put together a benefit that means \nsomething to the people who need it. This is not theory. It is not a \ndebate in the abstract. It is about some 85-year-old widow who, today, \nis going to the pharmacy in the back of a grocery store and trying to \nfigure out how much her prescription drugs are going to cost so she can \nfigure out how much money she has left for groceries. That is happening \nin a real sense today all across this country.\n  We have $12 billion. We also have a bill that says to senior \ncitizens: You pay $35 a month on an optional basis if you want this \nprogram of ours, and after $35 a month, you pay the first $275 in \nprescription drugs. Between $275 and $4,500, the Federal Government \nwill help you by paying 50 percent of your prescription drug costs. And \nthen between $4,500 and $5,800, there is what is famously called the \ndonut hole, which means you receive no coverage.\n  So you are not covered until you spend $275, then you are partially \ncovered, then you are not covered again, and then you get catastrophic \ncoverage. This is the most byzantine, complicated system we could \npossibly put together. It clearly is done by committee. We could not \nhave done this so\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\nbadly if it were done without a committee.\n  Having said all of that, the question is, What do we do with the $12 \nbillion? We are told today, with the Grassley amendment, that we will \nprovide $6 billion of the $12 billion to test a new alternative bidding \nsystem for paying PPOs--and if this is not complicated enough, just \nstay with me--that would reimburse these PPOs based on the median \namount of the three lowest bids. There is nothing here that protects \nAmerican taxpayers by ensuring we are not paying private health plans \nsubstantially more than traditional Medicare costs.\n\n  Here is what it means in English. It means we are going to have an \nexperiment with private sector delivery, but we are going to \nincentivize insurance companies. We are going to provide them some of \nthis money so that they will actually want to offer this plan, so we \ncan say at the end of it that somehow the plan is a good plan.\n  We already know that does not work. My colleague, Senator Hollings, \nsays there is no education in the second kick of a mule. We know this \ndoes not work. We know what happens. We know the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Committee, MedPAC, which is a nonpartisan committee that \nadvises Congress on Medicare payment policies, says private plans cost \n15 percent more than traditional Medicare. We know that. We do not have \nto spend $6 billion giving money to private insurers to do an \nexperiment. We know what does not work. We know the cost advantage of \nMedicare, and yet our colleagues continue to resist and continue to \ninsist that we move Medicare beneficiaries into the private sector. And \nnow with half of the $12 billion, they say let's do this little \nexperiment.\n  Will it enhance the health of senior citizens? No. Will it improve \nhealth care? No, not at all. Will it actually improve the underlying \nbill, improve the benefits, reduce the costs? No, not at all. This is \njust like a puppy dog following the master home. It is putting more and \nmore money down this chute to pursue this dream of trying to \ndemonstrate something we already know does not work.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Do I understand that senior citizens, given the choice \nbetween traditional Medicare and Medicare HMOs, have already voted and \nthat 88 or 89 percent of them want traditional Medicare; that they do \nnot want to put their medical fate in the hands of these HMO private \ninsurers who are unreliable, who may or may not cover the procedures \nthey need? Haven't the seniors of this country, with their experience, \nalready voted on this issue we are considering?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Seniors have already made that judgment. They have \nalready decided that. So we want to take $6 billion and give it to \nprivate health insurers at a time when Senators have been coming to the \nChamber and saying we cannot improve this plan because we do not have \nany money. I have quotes of all the Senators, and I shall not name them \nall. I could read lots of quotes from the last 2 weeks of Senators. Why \ncan't we improve it? Because we are limited by money. So now we have \n$12 billion more? That is what happens when you go into a room, shut \nthe door, make a little deal, and say this is how we want to use this \nmoney: We are going to take $6 billion and try an experiment that we \nfailed at previously. It makes no sense to me. It is a byzantine \nfailure, in my judgment, to do it this way.\n  What I am proposing in my amendment is use the money to actually \nimprove the program for senior citizens. We can drive down the cost of \nthe prescription drug policies and improve the coverage.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, if he will yield further, is the \nSenator aware of a recent survey of seniors--over 600 across the United \nStates--where they were told what this plan, S. 1, is all about? They \nsaid the fact that the $35 premium is not mandated in this law but is \nsimply a suggestion; it may go higher; the fact private \ninsurance companies that provide the prescription drug benefit may \ndecide to change the benefit or go out of business every 2 years; the \nfact there is a $275 deductible and a huge gap in coverage for the \nsickness of the senior citizens--when they looked at all those items, \nis the Senator aware of the fact that most of the seniors, when asked, \nsaid they did not believe that S. 1 really answered the need in America \nthat seniors are looking for?\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know that is the case. I have seen the same survey to \nwhich the Senator referred. I think there are some provisions in this \nbill that have some merit. I prefer we do something rather than do \nnothing, but when we do something, let's do something right and \nsomething that benefits senior citizens. This is the case when you cite \nthe polls, when you cite what our previous experience has been. It is a \ncase, especially with respect to the use of this $6 billion, of the old \njoke from the movies: What are you going to believe, me or your own \neyes?\n  The fact is, we have already had these experiments. We understand how \nmuch additional costs are involved in the private sector delivery of \nthis benefit, and we also know what Medicare does and how Medicare \nworks. We know the private insurers have about a 14-percent overhead in \nadministrative costs and delivering their service. We know that. We \nalso know Medicare has about a 4-percent cost, a dramatic advantage.\n  For that reason alone, you would want to provide this benefit through \nthe traditional Medicare delivery system. Against all odds, we have \npeople in this Chamber who, I guess, although they do not say it, \nbelieve along with Congressman Thomas that this bill ought to be the \nend of Medicare as we know it. Congressman Thomas said: Our answer to \nthat is, we certainly hope so.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator, is it possible Halliburton is going to \npay some of these services with the six--I will withdraw that question. \nI ask the Senator, if one believes in privatization and competition, \nwhy does the private sector need a $6 billion subsidy to compete with \nMedicare? If they are good, if they are efficient, if they are customer \nfriendly, why do they need this Federal subsidy of $6 billion to offer \nan attractive health care package to seniors?\n  Mr. DORGAN. First, they do not need it, and no subsidy is warranted. \nThe point of my amendment is to say if you have $12 billion, and they \nsay let's take $6 billion and use it for an experiment that we know \ndoes not work, let's instead use that money to help seniors. Then the \nunderlying amendment says let's take another $6 billion and test \nwhether focusing on wellness will work, which we know it does work. We \ndo not exactly have to have an experiment on that. Do things that \npromote wellness and the fact is you save money on the acute care side \nby not having people go into the hospital because they are taking care \nof themselves and have the kind of preventive care that is necessary to \ntake care of themselves.\n\n  I have another amendment pending. It has been pending for nearly a \nweek. I hope it will be approved by the end of this process. It is a \nvery inexpensive amendment that deals with that very kind of wellness \napproach.\n  If senior citizens have heart disease, Medicare covers cholesterol \nscreening. It makes sense, does it not? But Medicare does not cover \ncholesterol screening if one does not know they have heart disease. It \ndoes not make sense.\n  Heart disease is our biggest killer in this country. We ought to \ncover cholesterol screening across the board. That is the way one can \ndiscover who is at risk for heart disease at a point when steps can be \ntaken to prevent it. Yet Medicare does not cover that screening unless \na person already has evidence of heart disease.\n  There are many things we should do to improve Medicare's preventive \ncoverage. My hope is that perhaps we will have that amendment approved \nbefore the end of this process.\n  My colleague from Illinois talked about HMOs a moment ago. We are not \nin the trenches of the HMO debate as it was first envisioned by the \nWhite House, which said to senior citizens, here is a Faustian bargain: \nwe will give you a prescription drug benefit but only if you enroll in \nan HMO. Talk about a goofy proposal; that is it.\n  I have been talking about HMOs. There were some HMOs that did some \ngood things, held down some prices. I understand that. But we have all \nalso heard the stories of HMOs not taking\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\ngood care of people. I guess we do not need to review the HMO stories \nabout what happens to patients when profits were at stake. For \ninstance, a woman falls off a cliff in the Shenandoah Mountains, \nsustains very serious head injuries and body injuries. She is hauled \ninto an emergency room on a gurney in a coma. After a long \nconvalescence, she finally gets out of the hospital only to be told by \nher HMO that they will not cover her emergency room treatment because \nshe did not have prior approval to use the emergency room. This is a \nwoman who is hauled in on a gurney in a coma.\n  I will not revisit all of those HMO stories because it will take too \nmuch time, but I will say this: With Medicare, we know what works. Some \nof my colleagues make the case that it costs too much. Do my colleagues \nreally know what costs too much in Medicare? It costs too much because \npeople are living too long. What a wonderful set of victories we have \nin this country. With great health care, people are living longer.\n  I probably should not talk about my uncle again, but I have an 81-\nyear-old uncle who runs the 400 meter and 800 meter in the Senior \nOlympics. He is probably out running today. He runs 3 miles a day at 81 \nyears old. Forty years ago, one reached 81 years old and they had to be \nin a chair someplace, but not any longer. People live longer, doing \nthings no one ever expected them to do. And that includes my uncle. \nGood for them. Good for him. But because people live longer, Medicare \ncosts more. That is not a sign of failure; it is a sign of success.\n  Now we are trying to add to Medicare that which should have been \nadded some long while ago: The miracle drugs that do provide miracles \nbut only if one can afford them. We are talking about covering the \ndrugs that keep seniors out of the hospital and they do not have to go \ninto an acute care hospital bed. That is what we are dealing with.\n  With this amendment, we are dealing with $12 billion. Instead of \nbifurcating it into two different experiments, one of which failed and \none of which we do not need because we know the answer, what I propose \nwe do is use that $12 billion to reduce from $43 to $38 the premium our \nsenior citizens will have to pay for this prescription drug benefit, \nstarting in 2009.\n  There are people who live on $350 or $450 a month, their total income \nfrom their miserable little Social Security payment, who are living \nalone in a small town, are struggling to buy food, struggling to buy \nthe necessities of life. There are people who have been told by their \ndoctor: Oh, by the way, you have heart disease and diabetes, and here \nare the prescription drugs you need; and they sit at home knowing they \ndo not have a penny to pay for those prescription medicines. Talk to \nthose seniors and understand how important this coverage is. The \ncoverage ought to be good and extensive coverage, and it ought to \nprovide what we know we should provide for senior citizens.\n  Second, it ought to be done in an affordable way. Unfortunately, \nanother weakness of this plan is that there is no defined benefit, \nwhich means the premiums can vary. The monthly premiums will increase \nyear after year because we have not done enough to put downward \npressure on prescription drug prices--and as prescription drug prices \nincrease, the monthly premium will increase. The expectation is that \nthe monthly premium starts at $35 and goes to $60 in a 10-year period. \nMy amendment proposes about a $6 reduction in the monthly premium for \nsenior citizens. That is a more effective way to use this $12 billion. \nEither that, or I would propose we extend the coverage through the \n$1,300 gap that exists in coverage, which I think would also represent \na meritorious way of using this amount of money.\n  My colleague, Senator Pryor from Arkansas, is in the Chamber and he \nmay wish to address this issue as well. I have offered this amendment \non behalf of myself and my colleague Senator Pryor, so I yield the \nfloor in the hope that Senator Pryor will wish to make some comments as \nwell.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is unfair for Members of the other \nside of the aisle to give us statistics that say 89 percent of the \nseniors are in for fee-for-service Medicare and only 11 percent are in \nMedicare+Choice and that is a nationwide average. It is an accurate \nstatistic, but it does not speak to the seniors of America who like \nMedicare+Choice and I have figures from four cities--Miami, New York, \nSan Francisco, and Chicago.\n  In Miami, 45 percent of the senior citizens have chosen managed care, \nthe Medicare+Choice option, as opposed to fee-for-service; New York, 22 \npercent; San Francisco, 29 percent. In Chicago, it was only 6 percent. \nThat may be one reason why Senator Durbin keeps bringing this up quite \nregularly. This data is from the Congressional Research Service, and it \nis as recent as March 2003.\n  When people, wherever they are in the Senate, want to denigrate \nMedicare+Choice by saying only 11 percent of the people in this country \njoin in and that is such a small percentage and that these figures are \nevidence it is not liked, go to Miami and ask 45 percent of the \ncitizens who belong to Medicare+Choice why they like it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, last night was a difficult night for me \nbecause I was lying in bed worrying about the insurance companies and \nhow we were not getting them enough money during this Congress. Of \ncourse, I am being facetious because I think we have a very clear \nchoice.\n  I commend Senator Dorgan, Senator Durbin, and a number of others who \nhave shown national leadership on this effort to try to make this bill \nbetter. I think there is a broad consensus that we want to add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare. We want to help seniors all over \nthis country, but at the same time we have to make sure it is set up \nthe right way. It has to make sense.\n  Quite frankly, one of the things that to me does not make sense, and \nprobably to most people around the country does not make sense, is that \nwe might give a pretty healthy sum of money to the insurance industry.\n  All over the country--and I know it is certainly true in my State--\ninsurance companies are raising premiums. It may be health care \npremiums--everybody knows those are going up. It may be property and \ncasualty; it may be homeowners policies, auto policies, medical \nmalpractice, legal malpractice. You name it, across the board, as far \nas I know, the price of every single kind of insurance in this country \nis going up.\n  Nonetheless, there are some in this Congress who want to actually \ngive them a sizable chunk of money that could go to people who really \nneed the help.\n  I take my hat off to Senator Dorgan for his leadership. One thing he \nhas figured out is a way to make the monthly premium less for people. \nNow, saving $6 a month to someone at my income level, and all of our \nincome levels, that is not a lot of money, but for those senior \ncitizens all over this country who live below the poverty level--the \nonly money they get every month is Social Security, maybe a little help \nfrom the family--$6 is a lot of money. Six dollars may make this \nprogram affordable for them. It is real money. It is money that at the \nend of the year, if you add it up, is only $72 a year, but that is real \nmoney to so many Americans all over this country.\n  The purpose of the bill, not just this amendment but the whole bill, \nis to help Americans afford their prescription drugs. I know that \nSenator Durbin, who is in the Chamber, and Senator Dorgan and a number \nof others in this Chamber have tried to make prescription drugs more \naffordable in this legislation. There have been different efforts tried \nin different ways. One of the things I tried was to strengthen \nreimportation from Canada to try to make prescription drugs more \naffordable, but certainly making the premiums more affordable makes the \nprogram more accessible to more Americans. That is a win/win/win for \neverybody.\n  So I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding me some of his \ntime. I know he is frantically talking to colleagues to try to have \nthem adopt this amendment when we vote on it this afternoon.\n  Let's run through the numbers very quickly one more time so we \nunderstand clearly what we are talking about. This amendment expends \n$2.4\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\nbillion per year to make premiums cheaper. It will reduce the typical \npremium--this is average--by $6 a month.\n\n  I take my hat off to the folks in this Chamber who worked out \ncompromise after compromise after compromise trying to come up with \nsolutions to make this bill something that will become law, something \nthat the majority of Members can vote for, not just in this Chamber but \nthe House, something the President can sign.\n  I believe strongly people in this country deserve to have access to \nthese wonderful prescription medications that are in many ways miracle \ndrugs. It is a shame for this country to have these drugs available on \nthe marketplace but so expensive that people cannot afford them. That \nis what we are trying to accomplish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague from Arkansas as well as my \ncolleague from North Dakota. They have come to the floor and said to \nthe Members of the Senate, look, we found $12 billion. Imagine $12 \nbillion over a period of time. We are in the middle of debating a \nprescription drug bill. What would the Senate do with new found money, \n$12 billion worth?\n  We took a look at the underlying bill, the prescription drug bill. \nThere are a lot of problems with it. There is no guaranteed monthly \npremium. It has a deductible. It has a period of time when there is no \ncoverage. You are paying prescription drug bills and you have no \nprotection, no coverage. There are a lot of uncertainties in this bill.\n  You would think the first thing you would do with the $12 billion is \nmake this a stronger bill, try to take care of some of the weaknesses, \nthe deficiencies.\n  Wrong. Given $12 billion, an agreement has been reached not to give \nthe money to the seniors to help them pay for prescription drugs but to \ngive $6 billion to HMOs and private insurance companies, a $6 billion \nFederal subsidy so they can experiment with alternatives to Medicare.\n  I am like my colleague from Arkansas; I could not get a moment's rest \nlast night for fear that we just were not going to give enough money to \nthe insurance companies when this was all over with. I lost all my \nsleep the night before worried about the fact that maybe pharmaceutical \ncompanies would not get all the money that we could possibly throw \ntheir way. Then along comes this amendment. We can rest easy tonight \nbecause we will give $6 billion to HMOs. This industry which \nmanufactures the milk of human kindness for seniors and families across \nthe America by denying basic health care coverage so they can run up \nprofits is going to need a Federal subsidy.\n  What a delicious irony that we cannot help poor seniors trying to pay \nfor prescription drugs because, Senator, we just do not have enough \nmoney. And we cannot help our schools, we cannot pay for President \nBush's No Child Left Behind, this unfunded mandate on everybody's local \nschools because, Senator, we just do not have enough money. But the $6 \nbillion we just found we are going to give to the HMO insurance \nindustry.\n  When they write the history of this debate, this amendment will stand \nout. This amendment is a tribute to selfishness, a tribute to \nshortsightedness. Why in the world aren't we helping the people who \nneed it the most? Why are we giving the money to the HMOs so they can \nexperiment with an effort to end Medicare?\n  I just ran into Bill Thomas in the hallway, chairman of the House \nWays and Means Committee, most powerful man when it comes to Medicare \nin the House of Representatives. He said in today's New York Times:\n\n       Some of our friends on the other side of the aisle are \n     saying if this bill becomes law, it will be the end of \n     Medicare as we know it. Our answer to that is, we certainly \n     hope so.\n\n  Well, thank you, Congressman Thomas, for your candor. And your candor \nis the reason why so many Senators have now come to the Senate and said \nthe only way to end Medicare is to subsidize HMOs with even more money \nso they can be more profitable and try to force Medicare out of \nbusiness. That is what it is all about.\n  My colleagues will have two choices. They can join me in voting with \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Pryor, and others and say if you have $12 \nbillion, for goodness' sake, put it into this bill. Make this bill a \nlittle better for seniors. Reduce the cost for seniors. Give them some \nassurance of what they will pay. Provide more prescription drug \ncoverage. That is one option. I will support it.\n\n  If it does not succeed, I will offer a second option. It reaches a \npoint under the bill we are debating, during the course of a year, when \nthere is a gap in coverage where the Federal Government will not help \npay one penny on your prescription drugs, and about $3,700 into the \nyear out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs, this plan cuts off. \nThe underlying plan says you are on your own until you get in the range \nof $5,500. Then we will start paying you again. So there is a gap in \ncoverage where that senior citizen, that widow living by herself, has \nto pay all of the prescription drug bills until she reaches the \ncatastrophic coverage level.\n  This would not be a problem if you did not have over $3,700 in \nprescription drugs a year. But a lot of seniors do. I have run into \nthem, met them in Illinois, heard their testimony on Capitol Hill from \nacross the country.\n  I will offer an alternative to my colleagues in the Senate that says \nsimply this: We want to make sure people who suffer from some of the \nmost expensive diseases that afflict senior citizens can pay for their \nmedication. So we will take the $12 billion and we will put it into the \nbasic bill and cover heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and \nits complications.\n  We are not going to leave you high and dry. At the end of $3,700 of \nsubsidy from the Government, we are going to take the $12 billion and \nput them back in there to try to keep helping you if you are afflicted \nwith one of these diseases.\n  I will readily concede to my colleagues that I can think of a half a \ndozen other diseases where people have horrendous prescription drug \nbills and need help but I will try to appeal to my colleagues. Here is \nyour choice. You have a parent or a grandparent, suffering from cancer, \nwho has to buy expensive drugs to stay alive. The Government program \nthat we are proposing stops paying for those drugs halfway through the \nyear because they have reached a point where they spent $3,700 and now \nthey have to wait and spend another $1,500 to $1,800 of their own money \nbefore they have coverage. You can help them pay for those cancer \ntherapies or you can send $6 billion in Federal subsidies to HMO \ninsurance companies.\n  That is the choice. It is a fairly straightforward choice.\n  According to a July 2002 study, heart disease and hypertension are \nthe most expensive conditions to treat. Millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries are suffering from them and struggling to pay for their \nmedications. That is one of the conditions we would help pay for with \nthe $12 billion, $6 billion of which is headed for these private \ninsurance companies' subsidy.\n  The majority of America's cancer patients are on Medicare. They are \nyour parents and grandparents. They are struggling with all forms of \ncancer. Nearly 60 percent of new cancer diagnoses and 50 percent of all \ncancer-related deaths occur in people 65 years and older.\n  I am not identifying a problem that does not exist. It exists. Ask \nany family about cancer, my family included. We all have stories to \ntell. And you know how expensive it is now to keep that loved one alive \nto try to give them a chance to survive. This bill cuts them off and \nleaves them high and dry. My amendment gives them a chance.\n  More than 2 million of all Medicare beneficiaries will have cancer in \n2003. Let me give an example of a couple who wrote to my office. They \nwrote a couple years ago from a downstate community, a small community. \nIt is one of the letters that Senators get every day, one that we \nsaved. It was sent to us in September of 2002.\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin:\n       My wife has multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the bone \n     marrow. This disease, while controllable, is not curable. As \n     a result, she has to take a great deal of drugs for physical \n     as well as mental anxiety.\n       Last year our combined prescription drug bill [and this is \n     the year 2000] was $4,500. This year our regular prescription \n     drug bills will be more.\n       Now my wife Marion has been put on Thalidomide. A great \n     many multiple myeloma\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\n     patients are now on Thalidomide. Said drug is very expensive. \n     With a low dose [and this is in the year 2000] it is $455.99 \n     a month.\n\n  Incidentally, we checked. That same low dose now costs $645 a month. \nSo in 3 years it has gone up over 40 percent. It costs them $5,500 a \nyear just for that drug. This is an elderly couple in their retirement \non a fixed income, fighting cancer, putting every dollar in their \nsavings into keeping one of them alive. Think about $644 a month. Think \nabout seniors trying to survive on $1,100 a month on Social Security. \nAnd think about this bill which says to this family from Illinois and \nothers just like them: I am sorry, but at some point we are going to \nstop paying.\n  Doesn't it make more sense for us to take the $6 billion and not give \nit in a subsidy to these private insurance companies but instead give \nit to these seniors to help them pay these bills? I think it does.\n  I don't have to tell you the story of Alzheimer's. Is there a family \nin America that does not have a loved one or a friend who is struggling \nwith some form of Alzheimer's? God bless us; we are living longer, but \nas we do life gets more complicated. Let me give an example of a \ngentleman in Maplewood, MN. His annual out-of-pocket drug costs for \nAlzheimer's are $7,000--annual cost. This man is 78 years old. He pays \nas much out of pocket for prescription drugs as he does for all of his \nother household expenses combined. He is a World War II vet, father of \nthree. He is a full-time caregiver for his wife. He hasn't had a \nvacation in 5 years. He has given up what he loves to do because he \njust can't afford them.\n  ``I am managing the cost, but I'm pretty nervous about it,'' he says. \nMedicare can do something to help. Yes, it can. That is our choice. Are \nwe going to do something to help these seniors facing the most \nexpensive medical conditions or are we going to give $6 billion to \nprivate HMOs in a Federal subsidy?\n  The last one I include is diabetes and its complications. I am sad to \nreport to you, those who are following this debate, diabetes is \nreaching epidemic proportions in America. Over 6 percent of the \nAmerican population suffers from some form of diabetes. In the late \nstages of diabetes, the complications become horrible: Amputations, \nblindness, severe problems.\n  Faced with this in your senior retirement years, depending on a \nprescription drug plan, do you really want to say to these people and \nthese families battling diabetes and its complications: We are going to \ncut you off. We would love to give you more but frankly we have to help \nthe HMO insurance companies. Those are the ones who really need a \nhelping hand.\n  You couldn't take that argument to any town in America. You couldn't \ntake it to any public meeting. You couldn't take it to any senior \ncitizens. You couldn't take it to any family with a loved one \nstruggling with one of these diseases.\n  So my friends on the floor of the Senate are going to have a choice: \n$6 billion in Federal subsidies for HMOs or $6 billion to help seniors \nstruggling with these terrible, life-threatening, expensive conditions, \nto pay their prescription drug bills. I think that choice is easy. I \nhope the majority of the Senate agrees.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume to address the issue of the amendment by the Senator from North \nDakota and his attempt to take money from the $12 billion that is the \nbipartisan compromise that is a major compromise on this amendment \nbetween Republicans and Democrats. The $12 billion is being divided: $6 \nbillion to make the marketplace provider organizations more \ncompetitive, to save money, and to get people into organizations that \nwill manage particularly chronic disease; and the other $6 billion to \ngo for Medicare demonstration projects to do the same, have about the \nsame result, to have chronic disease management.\n  The reason for this compromise is both approaches deal with the issue \nthat 5 percent of the sick people under Medicare are responsible for \nabout 50 percent or 55 percent of the cost of Medicare. It is a small \nsegment of people. If we were in business and we found 5 percent of our \nemployees, or a certain problem we had with our business that was just \n5 percent of it, but it was 50 percent of the cost of our business, we \nwould hone in on that problem with the particular business.\n  The Federal Government is in the business of providing health care \nfor our seniors. If we have 5 percent of our senior population who, for \nvarious reasons, are the cause of 50 percent of the costs of Medicare, \nthen quite obviously we ought to concentrate on that 5 percent. We have \nplans to do that. This is how we use this $12 billion, and we do it in \na bipartisan way.\n  Honestly, the Senator from North Dakota is very open about it; he has \na better idea how to use that money. He would take it to lower the \nmonthly premium paid by beneficiaries in the new Part D prescription \ndrug program.\n  I have at least two problems with that. First of all, the \nCongressional Budget Office's rule of thumb is that it costs around $5 \nbillion to lower the estimated $35-a-month premium by just $1. You \nspend $5 billion and reduce the monthly premium from $35 down to $34. \nSo if you take the $12 billion that is available in the Grassley-Baucus \namendment and use that to lower the premium for the people he wants to \nlower the premium for, instead of paying $35 a month they will be \npaying $32.50 a month.\n  My colleagues have to weigh that against the use of this money where \nwe want to focus in on fee for service as well as the new Medicare \nProgram, zeroing in on trying to save Medicare money by managing the \nchronic disease situations of the 5 percent of the most sick people \nunder Medicare.\n  So the underlying Grassley-Baucus amendment, I remind my colleagues, \nauthorizes the Secretary to establish a number of projects in fee-for-\nservice Medicare Programs that would provide these enhanced services \nand benefits for beneficiaries. These enhanced services or benefits \ninclude preventive services, chronic care coordination, and disease \nmanagement services. These are very worthwhile projects and have the \npotential to help many beneficiaries get better care and considerably \nreduce the cost in the Medicare Program.\n  I don't know how many Members on the other side of the aisle have \nworked with this issue we are trying to put $6 billion toward, chronic \ndisease management. A lot of people who have the same political \nphilosophy as the Senator from North Dakota are very concerned about \ndoing that. We are concerned on this side about doing it as well. That \nis why it is a bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I don't know how, in good conscience, the Senator from North Dakota \ncan take money that would reduce a monthly premium by $2.50, still \ncosting $32.50, away from chronic disease management and a lot of other \nthings that people on his side of the aisle are very concerned about.\n  It would not be possible to do these projects that we have in the \nunderlying amendment. It seems to me that the Grassley-Baucus amendment \nwith this bipartisan compromise of $6 billion enhanced membership in \nPPOs as well as $6 billion for chronic disease management in the older \nfee-for-service Medicare Program is preferable to the second-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  I urge my colleagues to not support the amendment by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  This is the second or third time I have heard that seniors have voted \non whether they like fee for service or Medicare+Choice, the argument \nbeing 89 percent of the people in this country are in fee for service. \nEleven are in managed care, Medicare+Choice, HMO, whatever you want to \ncall it. That is true for the Nation as a whole.\n  But remember that in the vast geographical part of America HMOs are \nnot available. In the State of Iowa, only 1 county out of 99 has an HMO \nfor our seniors to join. We have 4,000 Iowans in Medicare+Choice. No \nplace else in Iowa can my citizens get it. The Des Moines Register is \nalways editorializing why more of Iowa cannot have Medicare+Choice so \nthe seniors of our country have that opportunity.\n  But what is unfair about the 89 percent versus the 11 percent, and \nSenators making statements that it is so overwhelming that seniors do \nnot like Medicare+Choice, is the fact that if more had that choice more \nwould take it.\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\n  I use, as a basis for my statement, that in the larger cities of \nAmerica a much higher percentage of seniors have decided to join \nMedicare+Choice. They do it voluntarily. They can go in one year and \nget out the next, if they don't like it. They have voted by a much \nhigher percentage in favor of Medicare+Choice. They like it because \nthey get more for their money. First, they do not have to pay Medigap \ninsurance. Second, they might get things such as eye glasses and a \nbetter deal on prescription drugs than people who are in traditional \nMedicare fee for service. Where they have had a chance to have that \noption, a much higher percentage of seniors than 11 percent will join. \nAll you have to do is talk to people in my State who go to Arizona, \nCalifornia, and Florida for maybe the winter and find out about what \npeople in those States have when they join Medicare+Choice. They ask, \nWhy can't we have that in more places in the country?\n  A couple of speakers on the other side of the aisle have talked about \nwasting money with Medicare+Choice. I think you ought to ask the \nseniors who join and who like it. That is a much higher percentage than \n11 percent in a lot of the cities. It is not a fair comparison to imply \nthat since only 11 percent of the people in the country have it and \nbecause such a high percentage can't get it that Medicare+Choice is not \ndesired by seniors of America.\n  Our underlying legislation, the Grassley-Baucus bill, is going to \nmake that opportunity more available for people down the road as we \nbring in new options. What we want to do in the underlying bill is give \nour seniors the right to choose. Not enough of them have a right to \nchoose. They have a right to choose prescription drugs. They don't want \nto join for prescription drugs if they don't have to. They have a right \nto choose between traditional Medicare. If seniors say they are \nsatisfied with what they have, I can say to those seniors that they can \nkeep what they have. It is their choice. But it you want to go over \nhere and join something that has more options, you will have that right \nto choose. You should have that right to choose.\n  One of the complaints people made about the President's program was \nthat if you were going to get prescription drugs you had to go over to \na new type of Medicare. In traditional Medicare, you could not get \nprescription drugs--or at least not much of a program; at least not \nequal to what you could get over here in the new program.\n  That is where Senator Baucus and I disagree with the President of the \nUnited States. We believe in equal benefits. If you want prescription \ndrugs, if you want to join it voluntarily, and if you want to stay in \ntraditional Medicare fee for service, you can have prescription drugs. \nIf you want to go over here and choose a new form and have prescription \ndrugs with it, that is your choice.\n  The right to choose and fairness and equality and no pressure is the \nbasis for this bipartisan Grassley-Baucus legislation. That is the \nbasis for the compromise amendment that is before us which the Senator \nfrom North Dakota wants to detract from and use the money someplace \nelse.\n  I think we need to keep this balanced approach. We need to keep the \nfairness, the equality, and no pressure and the right to choose. \nSeniors should have options just as other people have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1108\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I will speak briefly because I have to go \nto another meeting and return for the vote.\n  I have great respect for the Senators from Iowa and Montana, but I \nstruggle to understand why we are giving a $6 billion subsidy to the \nHMOs in America. If they are so good, if they are so efficient, if the \nfree market is truly better than the Government-run Medicare system, \nwhy in the world do they need $6 billion worth of the taxpayers' money? \nYou know that of that $6 billion hundreds of millions of dollars are \ngoing to go to them in profits. We are literally subsidizing the \nprofits of these companies. We are creating this artificial environment \nthat suggests these companies can do just as good a job or better than \nMedicare with the $6 billion Federal subsidy to make it work.\n  I can't understand why my colleagues on the conservative side who are \nhidebound apostles of the free market system don't even wince when it \ncomes to sending $6 billion to the HMOs and the private insurance \nindustry in order to let them play on the field for health care for \nseniors in America. I don't get it. I certainly don't understand why \nyou wouldn't take that same money to protect the most vulnerable people \nin America--our senior citizens who are struggling with heart disease, \ncancer, Alzheimer's, and diabetes and its complications. Why is the \nmoney for the boardrooms of the HMOs a good expenditure of tax dollars \nand the money for the family rooms of senior citizens struggling with \nthese deadly diseases not a good investment with taxpayer dollars?\n  The underlying bill is the biggest breakthrough for the American \npharmaceutical industry since the establishment of patents in the \nConstitution. This amendment with $6 billion in flatout tax subsidies \nto HMOs is the answer to the prayers of the insurance companies in \nAmerica.\n  Is that what the Senate is all about? Are we supposed to come here to \nmake certain that the wealthiest corporations in America get wealthier? \nI don't think so. They are doing quite well. The rate of return for \npharmaceutical companies across America is 18 percent. The average for \nthe S companies is 3 percent. These companies are immensely wealthy \nand profitable. We help them even more with this bill. We know how well \nthe insurance companies are doing. We know the bonuses they give their \nexecutives and we are going to plow in $6 billion to make it even \nwealthier.\n  There is something else wrong. We know that a lot of average citizens \nin America--particularly senior citizens--are struggling. Pick up the \nmorning papers. Whether it is the Washington Post or the New York \nTimes, they go to speak to seniors in their real-life environment and \ntalk to them about how they survive. Some of them are well off. Some \nare lucky. They have saved a lot of money or they have a good and \ngenerous retirement but a lot of them do not. A lot of them are \nliterally struggling month to month, some even week to week, just to \nget by.\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\n  This morning in the Washington Post there was a story about a widow \nlady who said: At the end of the month, I'm lucky if I have a dollar \nleft over. At the end of the article she said: I wonder how many \nSenators have ever thought about trying to live on $1,100 a month.\n  I don't know how she does it. I don't know how a lot of people do it \nin my State. Why wouldn't we want to help these people? Why is it the \npharmaceutical companies and the HMOs are more important than the most \nvulnerable people in society? I don't get it.\n  Frankly, I think a lot of our colleagues, as I said earlier, ought to \ntake these arguments, which sound so good on the floor of the Senate, \nback to the real world of the State they represent, take them into the \ntown of their choice, the public meeting of their choice, and explain \nto people why HMOs need a subsidy but seniors do not need a helping \nhand. It just does not work.\n  So I will be offering an amendment that says we will take this $12 \nbillion and focus it on the elderly people who suffer from some of the \nworst and most demanding diseases.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I listened quite closely to the Senator \nfrom Illinois, as well as to the Senator from North Dakota. They are \neach offering a separate amendment, but they are both similar in an \nattempt, generally, to accomplish the same result.\n  I say to my good friend from Illinois, as well as my good friend from \nNorth Dakota, who is presently not in the Chamber, I am very \nsympathetic. If I had my way, we would be spending this newly found $12 \nbillion very much in the way the Senator suggested. In fact, there are \na lot of good ways. It is not only helping those with Alzheimer's, but \nit is also lowering the premium. There are a lot of ways we could be \nspending dollars to help get more drug benefits to more seniors. There \nis no doubt about that. But, unfortunately, we are 100 Senators.\n  The Senator from Illinois, the Senator from North Dakota, and I have \na view of how some of these dollars should be spent in a perfect world, \nbut the world is not perfect. This is a democracy. It is messy. As \nWinston Churchill once said--I will paraphrase very poorly, but the \nSenator knows this quote--basically, Winston Churchill said: A \ndemocracy, for all its fits and starts and delays and inefficiencies \nand herky-jerky jolting, and all that, is the world's worst form of \ngovernment, except for all the others.\n  Here we are, in a democratic process, trying to figure out how to get \nprescription drug benefits to seniors. We have 100 Senators. I don't \nknow of very many timid Senators. We don't have many Senators who don't \nspeak their views. I don't know very many Senators who don't \nhave strong views about subjects. I don't know of many Senators who are \nnot thoughtful, articulate, and fighting hard for their constituents. \nAnd we have, as it turns out, Senators from two political parties: 51 \nRepublicans, 48 Democrats, and 1 Independent; and at this time we are \nattempting to finally get prescription drug benefits to seniors.\n\n  This issue has been debated for 4 years, at least. It has been a \npoliticized issue for 4 years. There has been a lot of talk for 4 \nyears, a lot of rhetoric on both sides of the aisle for 4 years, and \nduring all the talking there has not been any action; it has been all \nwords, no deeds.\n  Well, here we are, at a time--after 4 years of just political \nposturing, to a large degree--where we are on the brink of getting \nprescription drug benefits passed for our seniors in our country.\n  Is it the best bill in the world? No. Could it be better? Yes. Do all \nSenators wish it could be better? Yes. But is it a good start? Is it a \nbeginning? Is it a platform on which we can begin to build? Absolutely.\n  If we go back and look at the history of health care and assistance \nby the Government in providing health care to the needy and to \nAmericans generally, it is a history of building, of starting \nsomewhere, building on it, and making it better and better all the \ntime.\n  Back in the 1930s it was the Wagner-Murray-Dingell legislation that \nwas introduced to provide national health insurance for Americans. That \nwas the idea: We need national health insurance for Americans.\n  Well, it was debated and debated. Not a lot more really happened. \nThen suddenly things changed in the 1960s. The idea of Medicare came \nalong: Why not help at least our seniors? If we can't get national \nhealth insurance, the very least we can do is help our senior citizens \nget a break with respect to their health care bills. That is a good \nplace to at least begin--by helping a good, solid segment of the \npopulation. And we did, back in 1965, by providing Medicare. And look \nwhat has happened since then. We have kept building on Medicare to make \nit better.\n  When Medicare was first enacted, 50 percent of a Part B premium was \npaid by the senior and the Government paid the other 50 percent of the \npremium for Part B. That is for doctor services. Now it is 25 percent. \nIt has been improved over time. We also have added more benefits, some \nscreening provisions. End-stage renal treatment has been added. There \nis a list of new additions to help our senior citizens.\n  Here we are now, on the brink of adding another major benefit: \nprescription drugs. After all these years, all the years of talking and \ntalking and politicking and giving statements and speeches, we are \nfinally on the brink of getting prescription drug benefits passed.\n  It has not been easy. Why has it not been easy? It has not been easy \nbecause there are two competing philosophies on the floor of the Senate \non how to get prescription drug benefits to seniors. Even though the \ntwo competing philosophies are very different from each other, Senators \non both sides of the aisle--most Senators, maybe even all Senators, but \ncertainly most Senators--still want to work as hard as they can to try \nto fit these competing philosophies together in order to pass \nlegislation this year to begin finally getting prescription drug \nbenefits to seniors.\n  Also, these two competing philosophies are very different. One is \ncompetition. The argument is: Let private companies, themselves, with \nassistance from the Government, design how they give prescription drug \nbenefits to our senior citizens, make them available at a big discount \nfor senior citizens. The other philosophy is: Medicare should be the \nagency that should be the way--traditional Medicare, basically--to \nprovide discounts for senior citizens to get drugs.\n  Essentially, the competing philosophies are 50-50. You have 51 \nRepublicans, 48 Democrats, and 1 Independent. What are we going to do? \nWell, all we can do, if we want to get this done, is to just try our \nbest to put these two together in a fair, balanced way--and the private \ncompetition model gets a break, gets a fair chance to see the degree to \nwhich it might work--so that senior citizens really do get the benefits \nand are not taken advantage of during our efforts to pass legislation.\n  It is a balance. It is trying to find the right way to accomplish \nthat balance. It has been extremely difficult. I do not have to tell \nthe Presiding Officer just how hard this has been. But we are right on \nthe brink.\n  We are limited to $400 billion in providing the drug benefits for \nseniors over the next 10 years. Why are we limited to $400 billion? \nWell, this body passed a budget resolution not too long ago--both the \nHouse and the Senate--saying we are going to set aside $400 billion for \nprescription drug benefits for seniors. We never set aside anything \nlike that in the past. So we have an opportunity now to use it. I don't \nthink Senators want to miss this opportunity. I think they want to use \nthe dollars that are there to get prescription drug benefits for \nseniors.\n  Well, as it turned out, when the Senate Finance Committee wrote this \nbill, trying its hardest to be balanced--and it is balanced; the best \nevidence of that is it passed by a large majority from both parties in \nthe Finance Committee--we found it actually cost only about $388 \nbillion. There was $12 billion remaining.\n  So the question before us is how we can spend that $12 billion. That \nis the question. In an attempt to maintain a balance and to work on two \ncompeting models and in an attempt to get the legislation passed so we \ncan provide a prescription drug benefit to seniors, we\n\n[[Page S8632]]\n\nhave decided to split it, 6 and 6; $6 billion to the PPOs, have it \navailable potentially for PPOs, if that is needed for the bidding \nprocess, beginning in the year 2009. I don't know how many Senators are \ngoing to be here in 2009, but at least beginning then. The other $6 \nbillion, beginning in 2009, will then go, under Medicare fee for \nservices, for disease management, chronic care, to help particularly \nseniors who really need that disease management and chronic care. It is \nreally needed because there is very little disease management today \nunder traditional Medicare. That is one of its shortcomings. That is \nwhat we have done.\n  Again it is a balance, a start, a beginning. I have a lot of sympathy \nwith my friends on this side of the aisle. If I had my druthers and I \nwere the only one writing this bill, I would take that $12 billion and \nspend it along the lines they are suggesting. But I am not the only \nSenator here. I am one of 100. It is my job and that of the chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Grassley, to try to find a balance--not for the \nsake of balance but for the sake of getting legislation passed so we \ncan finally get prescription drugs to seniors.\n  If the amendments offered by the Senators from North Dakota or \nIllinois were to pass, guess what would happen. First of all, those are \nkiller amendments. If those amendments were to pass, that would mean \nthis bill is in jeopardy of passage. That would mean senior citizens \nmay not get the prescription drug benefits we are all trying to get; \nalbeit just a first step, or it could also mean, on the other hand--and \nthis is perhaps even more likely--if that amendment were to pass, I \nwill bet you dollars to donuts--which is not a good phrase to use \nbecause we are trying to put dollars in the donut hole--the \nconservative part of this body, the Republican side of the aisle, would \nsay: We are going to take that $12 billion and spend it our way. And \nthey have the votes. They have the White House. So this amendment puts \nin jeopardy a very delicate, very balanced kind of deal between \ncompeting philosophies, fairly and evenly, so that we can get \nprescription drug legislation passed, so that we are just not talking \nabout it anymore and finally doing something about it.\n  If it were to pass or looked like it would pass, the other side, \nwhich has more votes than this side has, would say: We will spend it \nour way.\n  Then colleagues on my side of the aisle would be quite distressed. \nThey would be forced to ask themselves if they would support on final \npassage a bill way off to the right for competition instead of the bill \nwhich currently exists, particularly with the underlying amendment. I \nwish we could do more but at least it is a first step. If the history \nof Medicare is any guide, in future years we will continue to make it \nbetter. We will work on that donut hole. We will fill in the gaps. We \nwill make sure premiums are not too high. We will try to help with \nAlzheimer's and all the other measures we desperately need to pay \nattention to as the days and years go by.\n  I implore my colleagues to think a little bit. Resist the siren song \nof doing something that sounds good but which very well could put the \nbill in real jeopardy. This is fair. It has $6 billion which may or may \nnot be used for PPOs, depending upon what the bids are. This bill cuts \noff after a 5-year period; no more $6 billion can be spent. And $6 \nbillion for disease management under traditional Medicare which will be \nspent. That is the question. Do you want balance or do you want to try \nto get something else passed right now that you like in the short term \nbut could very well jeopardize the whole bill, which means another \nyear, year 5, Congress is talking about this issue, Congress is not \ndoing anything about it. Rather, we want year 1, we have finally got it \ndone.\n  We are very close to getting it done. It is not perfect, but we will \nkeep working on it over the years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I would like to make a \ncouple comments before we begin voting.\n  This legislation is historic. It is incredibly important. It is the \nfirst reform in a major way to the Medicare Program since we wrote it \nover 35 years ago in 1965.\n  To get this legislation adopted by the Congress and signed into law \nby the President, there obviously has to be a great deal of work, a \ngreat deal of legitimate compromise among the various parties that have \nput this package together. That is what this bill does.\n  There are some Members of Congress who argue the Federal Government \nshould do nothing with regard to Medicare--that the private sector \nshould do everything and that the Federal Government should do nothing. \nThere are others, on the other hand, who take the position that with \nregard to Medicare the Federal Government should do everything and the \nprivate sector should do nothing.\n  What we have been able to put together, under the leadership of the \nchairman and ranking member and many others who have worked so hard, is \na compromise that says let's combine the best of what the Government \ncan do with the best of what the private sector can do and put that \npackage together. That is why we have gotten to the point we are today.\n  We saw a bill come out of the Senate Finance Committee in a \nbipartisan fashion with 16 votes in favor; only five votes against it. \nI predict when the final vote comes on this bill, we will see the same \ntype of bipartisan representation with a significant number, maybe over \nthree-fourths of the Senate saying, yes, this has sufficient \nimprovement and reform in it for me to support it.\n  It has enough Government involvement to make sure it is paid for, \nenough Government involvement to make sure it is run properly but not \nmicromanaged, and it has enough private sector involvement to deliver, \nfor the very first time, through a competitive private delivery system, \nprescription drugs for all seniors regardless of where they are or in \nwhat program they happen to be.\n  It also says the private sector will offer, for the first time on a \nvoluntary basis, to seniors who want to move into a new system a \nprivate delivery system that will cover drugs, will cover hospitals, \nand will also cover physician charges under the program. This is a \nhistoric opportunity to combine the best of what Government can do with \nthe best of what the private sector can do.\n  There is going to be a very important amendment offered by Chairman \nGrassley and the ranking member, Senator Baucus. Because we were able \nto get a score that said there is $12 billion extra money available, \nthe question then became, How do we divide it? I never thought we would \nhave such a difficult time spending money. We normally get into fights \nwhen we do not have enough money. Lo and behold, we found there was $12 \nbillion in extra funds.\n  The question then for the Senate is how are we going to allocate that \nmoney? Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, working with Senator \nKennedy and others, came up with a plan that is fair.\n  It says to the Republican Members: Take half of it, and they want to \nutilize it for a demonstration program to determine whether PPOs or the \nprovider networks in the private sector will work. We are not certain. \nWe think they will. But let's do a test. And if it costs more, there \nwill be $6 billion available to pay for it starting in the year 2009. \nThat is what many Republicans thought was the right way to use half of \nthe money.\n\n  On the other hand, Members on my side said, We need to do more for \ntraditional fee-for-service. If they are going to experiment with the \npreferred providers in the private sector, we want to also know what \nwill happen if we are able to put in more money for preventive health \ncare and for people who want to stay in the old program.\n  What Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley did, working with Senator \nKennedy, was to say to people who are inclined to the Democratic \nperspective, we are going to let you use $6 billion for people who want \nto stay in the old program. Here is what you can do with it: You can \nuse the money to provide enhanced benefits for people who stay in \ntraditional Medicare. What we mean by that is to give them additional \ncare for chronic care coordination, for the chronically ill, to \ncoordinate better how they are getting their health care.\n  We have more money for disease management, which is incredibly \nimportant. When we are talking about saving money and giving people a \nbetter quality of life; disease management is important. Also, they can \nuse the money for other benefits and services that the Secretary \ndetermines will improve preventive health care for the beneficiaries.\n  What we have crafted is an effort to take the extra money and allow \nfor a legitimate experiment, a legitimate test of whether the preferred \nprovider system will cost less money--I think it will; they can provide \nservices that I think are better and at a better price, but we do not \nknow that for sure, so let's do some testing on it in certain regions \nof the country. If it saves money, hallelujah for everybody. But if it \ncosts money, they will have $6 billion to help pay for those extra \ncharges.\n  The Democrats, on the other hand, have the provisions to have $6 \nbillion over the period in order to provide disease management and \npreventive health care services in the traditional Medicare Program. \nThat is as fair as it can be in a divided Senate. If one side had their \nway, they would do it all with the preferred providers. If our side \nperhaps had their will, it would provide all the money to be put back \nin traditional Medicare, but we all know in a divided Senate that is \nnot possible.\n  So the best possible compromise has been crafted by the chairman, \nSenator Grassley; by the ranking member, Senator Baucus; and by Senator \nKennedy's involvement and many others who have worked on this issue.\n  This is a good amendment. It is an important amendment. We are on the \nedge of an historic day in being able to enact real Medicare reform \nwith prescription drugs for all of our Nation's seniors. We cannot let \nthat goal be lost while we fight over how to divide extra funds. I \nthink this division is as fair as it possibly can be, and I urge all of \nour Members to vote for it. In fact, I think the vote should be \napproximately like it came out in the Finance Committee. We lost a few \nwhat I would say were on the left, we lost a few what I would say were \non the right, of the political spectrum. But in the end the vast \nmajority supported this legislation in the committee and will do so on \nthe Senate floor.\n  I certainly ask them to support the Grassley-Baucus amendment when it \nis voted on as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1102\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McConnell \namendment No. 1102.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1108\n\n  Under the previous order, there will 2 minutes equally divided on the \nDurbin amendment No. 1108.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues, the \namendment we just agreed to did nothing. It did not add one penny or \none new benefit to any senior suffering from Alzheimer's. This \namendment I offer, along with Senator Harkin, will put $12 billion into \nproviding prescription drug coverage for the seniors we represent who \nsuffer from heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, diabetes and its \ncomplications. Take your pick--a $6 billion tax subsidy for HMO and \nprivate insurance companies or $12 billion for your seniors struggling \nto pay impossible prescription drug bills who will be cut off under \nthis bill. It is an easy choice for me. If you take it home to your \nState, you will find it is an easy choice, too.\n  I hope you will vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition. I want to stress my \nopposition is not because I do not understand or am not sympathetic to \nthe difficult situation beneficiaries who are afflicted with \ncardiovascular disease, cancer, or Alzheimer's disease experience.\n  But I also recognize there are millions and millions of other seniors \nwho suffer from diseases just as debilitating and life-threatening as \nthe ones my colleague has identified here. Under this proposal they \nwould be treated as second-class citizens because they do not suffer \nfrom the right disease.\n  The most basic, and really the most important, tenet of the Medicare \nprogram is to provide a universal benefit to all seniors. We have done \nthat under S. 1.\n  We crafted a prescription drug benefit that helps every senior and \nalso targets the most help to those who are less able to afford the \nappropriate care.\n  While I am sympathetic to my colleagues' desire to enhance the \nbenefit, I can't support a proposal that pits one group of seniors \nagainst the other based solely on this disease.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment so we can remain \nfaithful to the most basic tenet of the Medicare program, a universal \nbenefit, and to ensure that the Senate does not discriminate against \nseniors based on their disease.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided on the Dorgan second-degree amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the importance of this amendment is \nanswering the question, what to do with $12 billion. I propose we use \nthat $12 billion to reduce the premium that senior citizens will be \nrequired to pay for this prescription drug benefit, roughly $7 a month, \nfrom $35 to $28.\n  The rebuttal to my amendment has been: This really doesn't mean very \nmuch. Only in this Chamber would $12 billion not mean very much. \nFrankly, this means a great deal to senior citizens. The underlying \namendment represents the worst of all worlds. It says, let's give $6 \nbillion to insurance companies. And I guarantee, you dye that money \npurple, you will have purple pockets in the insurance industry. That is \nwhere it is going. Let's have $6 billion go to the insurance industry \nto conduct an experiment that we already know has failed.\n  I don't understand why that is the way we want to use billions of \ndollars. Why not use it to help senior citizens close the coverage gap \nor, as I suggest, to reduce monthly premiums which start at $35 a month \nin this bill and then ratchet up and up and up as prescription drug \nprices increase. Pass my amendment and help senior citizens reduce \nthese premiums.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, $12 billion is a lot of money; $6 billion of that \n$12 billion he wants to take away from this provision, this bipartisan \nprovision, that would be used for things he stands for. He has been \ntalking about chronic disease management. He has been talking about \nmanaging to a better extent people with chronic diseases. We have put \n$6 billion into demonstration projects like that to save the taxpayers' \nmoney. Why? Because 5 percent of the seniors cause 50 percent of the \ncosts to Medicare. That is why those demonstration projects are very \nimportant. That is why I hope you will vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes equally divided on the Grassley amendment.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, this is the key \namendment that will provide for the passage of this legislation and, \ntherefore, prescription drug benefits for seniors. It is the key \namendment.\n  Why do I say key amendment? Very simply because we have $12 billion, \nand we have to find a way, in an evenhanded, balanced way, to spend \nthat $12 billion. We have to marry two competing philosophies: private \ncompetition and Medicare.\n  We have, therefore, designed the solution that the $12 billion will \nbe evenly divided to keep the balance so that we can get this \nlegislation passed and, more importantly, so seniors get a prescription \ndrug benefit as quickly as possible.\n  If this amendment is not adopted, we are going to be in the soup. \nThere are going to be Senators from one side of the aisle who are going \nto want to spend all of it their way; there are going to be Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle who want it all spent their way; and we are \ngoing to be nowhere. We are going to be back where we have been the \nlast 4 years, talking about prescription drugs benefits but not doing \nsomething about it, not providing the benefits to our seniors.\n  This is a key amendment. This is the amendment which will allow \nbenefits to go to seniors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, to pick up on what Senator Baucus said, \nlet me tell you what this does. There will be $6 billion spent on our \nside of the aisle to do the things about which we are concerned. What? \nAllow the competitive model to work, allow the new blueprint for \nMedicare to be successful, starting in 2009, because that is when the \nmoney is available, but what Jon Kyl and so many others on this side of \nthe aisle have been concerned about is in this amendment. If my \ncolleagues want to give competition a chance, this is the amendment \nthey vote for.\n\n  On that side of the aisle, what is $6 billion? For chronic care and \ndisease management. Senator Kennedy has worked on this tirelessly. Five \npercent of Medicare recipients consume 50 percent of the Medicare \nbenefits. What we need in the fee-for-service plan is programs for \ndisease management and chronic illness management. As the Senator from \nMassachusetts said to me just a few minutes ago, nowhere else will we \nbe able to find $6 billion to do this very important, cost-saving, \nquality improvement to the basic Medicare system. It is what both sides \nwant.\n  We have come together and we hope we will get strong support for this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8638]]\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Who is recognized \nto speak in opposition to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader was recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, this amendment is the \nculmination of several days of debate where both Democrats and \nRepublicans have come together, again bringing different issues to the \ntable, but together it is a positive, strong amendment for the American \npeople and for seniors.\n  On the one hand, it invests $6 billion, that is not in the underlying \nbill, in preventive medicine, which almost does not exist in \ntraditional Medicare, and in chronic disease management. All of us know \n5 percent of the beneficiaries are responsible for 50 percent of the \ncost and we know we need to manage those people better. So we have $6 \nbillion for preventive medicine and chronic disease management.\n  In addition, there is $6 billion to support the concept of private \nenterprise, competition, the private entities, which we believe is not \nthe only salvation but critical if we are going to address the long-\nterm, 75-year unfunded liabilities that are incurred when we add a new \nprescription drug benefit.\n  For that reason, I urge our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nrecognize that we worked together, Democrats and Republicans, to come \nto this carefully negotiated agreement that will be to the benefit of \nseniors and individuals with disabilities.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. My understanding \nwas prior to a vote there was to be time divided between opponents and \nsupporters. We have just heard from three supporters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The agreement was the time was to be evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Evenly divided between whom?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota be given 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there does need to be opposition, it seems \nto me, for those of us who believe this is not the right way to use $12 \nbillion. The $12 billion was made available. Twelve billion is what we \ndiscovered. The CBO estimate was below the $400 billion available for \nthis program. So the question was: How shall the $12 billion be used?\n  We have spent all of our lives in this Chamber making choices. Too \noften we make the wrong choices in circumstances such as this. We come \nback with a plan that says let's use the $12 billion for two purposes, \nand both of them are for experiments. In both cases, we know the answer \nto the experiments. One, $6 billion to the insurance companies so we \ncan incentivize--subsidize--the insurance companies to see if they can \nprovide the prescription drug benefit at equivalent or less cost than \nMedicare does. We know the answer to that. That experiment has been \ndone.\n  Ask senior citizens all across this country what would you rather \nhave, better benefits or lower costs or would you like to have $12 \nbillion in demonstration projects? That is the choice. The choice has \nbeen presented to us at this point in this amendment to say let's \nbifurcate this into two $6 billion pots, both of which will be \ndemonstration projects, the answer to which we know in both cases. \nFirst, the circumstance with subsidizing the insurance companies, we \nknow the answer to that. They are going to provide this benefit at \nhigher costs. We know that. Second, does wellness and chronic care \nhelp? Yes, we know that. Why do we not take the $12 billion and use it \nto provide better benefits or lower costs for senior citizens? After \nall, that is why we started this process, to provide a prescription \ndrug benefit that works for senior citizens.\n  We come to the end of this process, and we have a group of people who \ngo into a closed room and come out with a deal that says we have \ndecided how the $12 billion should be used.\n  Ask senior citizens how they would like it used and I guarantee there \nis only one answer from every corner of this country: Use it to provide \nus benefits that were promised, deliver that which was promised to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment ensures that the \nMedicare prescription drug benefit we are debating is, in fact, truly \nuniversal. It is a principle we have all espoused over the years.\n  The underlying bill, which we are debating, precludes Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are eligible for Medicaid from enrolling in the \nMedicare drug benefit. That would be the first time ever that Medicare \nbeneficiaries would be, in fact, precluded from being Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  The group, which is referred to as dual eligibles, consists of those \nwho are the poorest seniors. They are those who have incomes below 74 \npercent of poverty. If my colleagues are interested, that income level \nis $6,645. That is their total gross income. The majority of them are \nsingle. The majority of them are women who are in poor health and more \nlikely to be over the age of 85.\n  Precluding these people is wrong, and my amendment would fix it. I am \nhappy to say the amendment is budget neutral. I will explain that in a \nminute.\n  Prescription drugs are optional as a benefit under Medicaid. We all \nknow that. States can limit the number of prescriptions they make \navailable. Some allow two or three prescriptions per year. They can cap \nthe benefits. They can charge any copayments they want. They can end it \naltogether.\n  So you have States, predictably, already in a situation with very \ndifferent Medicaid levels. Because of our financial situation \nnationally, and in our States, Medicaid is always going to be the very \nfirst benefit which will be cut. It has already happened, and will \nhappen substantially more over the coming years.\n  I remind, again, my colleagues these are the poorest of the poor, the \noldest of the old, and the sickest of the sick we are talking about.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to provide all of the seniors in their \nStates with the benefit of a real Medicare drug benefit by supporting \nthis amendment.\n  If a State gets to the position where it is simply unable to continue \nwith prescription drugs under the Medicaid program, and they virtually \neliminate it, that poor person, below 74 percent of poverty--which is \njust a little bit over $6,000 a year--has nowhere else to go. Always--\nincluding presently--that person can return to Medicare. This \nunderlying bill would preclude that from happening. My amendment would \nfix that in a budget-neutral fashion.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment which I consider one \nof the most moral and humane of amendments that has come before this \nbody on this issue.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nIn S. 1, beneficiaries who are enrolled in both Medicaid and Medicare \nwill continue to receive the generous drug coverage that they currently \nknow through the Medicaid program.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that by having dual eligibles \nremain in the Medicaid program, Congress is treating these vulnerable \nseniors as second-class citizens and subjecting them to a lower quality \nbenefit.\n  This is not the case. In fact, this letter from the Long Term Care \nPharmacy Alliance applauds S. 1 for keeping the duals in Medicaid.\n  Specifically, the letter states, ``This approach will preserve the \ntime-tested safeguards designed to prevent medication errors and ensure \nquality care for the majority of these beneficiaries in the \ninstitutional setting.''\n  The policy decision to cover the drug cost for dual eligibles in \nMedicaid was not made in vacuum. These vulnerable citizens deserve the \nbest benefit available, which is the benefit provided through Medicaid. \nI also remind my colleagues that the intent of this legislation is to \nexpand prescription drug coverage to our senior citizens who do not \nhave access to prescription drugs or who are faced with paying a large \nshare of their income for their drug coverage.\n  This does not describe the current coverage experienced by those who \nare dually eligible.\n  These seniors currently have a drug benefit through the Medicaid \nprogram. In fact, many advocates and beneficiaries describe and know \nthis benefit to be very generous.\n  Medicaid was created to assist individuals who do not have the means \nto pay for their share of health care costs. That is a responsibility \nshared between the Federal Government and the States. Medicaid pays for \nmany benefits that Medicare does not.\n  We all know that the purpose of S. 1 is to provide prescription drugs \nto seniors that do not currently have access to drugs or are paying \nextremely high drug costs.\n  However, recognizing the costs associated with covering the cost of \nproviding prescription drug coverage to the dual eligible population, \nS. 1 does provide nearly 18 billion in new Federal dollars to \ncompensate States for some of these costs.\n  This is because S. 1 provides minimum standards that ensure that \nevery aspect of the benefit provided through Medicaid is the same high \nquality that is provided through part D of the Medicare program.\n  I remind my colleagues that adoption of this amendment will not \nexpand coverage at all; it will simply shift the cost to the Federal \nGovernment and in time to the other Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In closing, I remind my colleagues that S. 1 helps to deliver care \nthat is consistent with current law and is familiar to vulnerable \nbeneficiaries.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Grassley: On behalf of the Long Term Care \n     Pharmacy Alliance, I appreciate this opportunity to express \n     our support for provisions of Medicare legislation you have \n     advanced to protect the nation's frail elderly beneficiaries \n     residing in nursing facilities. In particular, we are pleased \n     that your legislation would allow dual eligible beneficiaries \n     to retain their prescription drug coverage under Medicaid.\n       While most Medicare beneficiaries are able to walk into \n     pharmacies to pick up their prescriptions or to receive vials \n     of pills through the mail, a sizable percentage of \n     beneficiaries cannot do so and need special services that \n     retail and mail order pharmacies do not provide. Nursing home \n     residents have specific diseases and multiple co-morbidities \n     that require specialized pharmacy care.\n       To meet these needs, long-term pharmacies provide \n     specialized packaging, 24-hour delivery, infusion therapy \n     services, geriatric-specific formularies, clinical \n     consultation and other services that are indispensable in the \n     long-term care environment. Without such treatment, we cannot \n     expect positive therapeutic outcomes for these patients. \n     Failure to take into consideration the special pharmacy needs \n     of the frail and institutionalized elderly will lead to a \n     marked increase in medication errors and other adverse \n     events.\n       In recognition of these concerns, your proposed legislation \n     would retain the current system of Medicaid coverage to \n     provide specialized pharmacy services to dual-eligible \n     beneficiaries residing in nursing facilities. This approach \n     will preserve the time-tested safeguards designed to prevent \n     medication errors and ensure quality care for the majority of \n     these beneficiaries in the institutional setting. Medicaid \n     today provides generous benefits to dual eligible \n     beneficiaries and has experience in addressing the special \n     needs of nursing home patients. The proposed new Medicare \n     Part D benefit does not contemplate the impact on nursing \n     home residents which must be considered to protect these \n     patients.\n       We are encouraged that Section 104 of the Senate bill \n     requires the Secretary to provide recommendations to cover \n     dual eligible beneficiaries by the new Medicare Part D \n     benefit before statutorily mandating such action. \n     Nevertheless, we strongly recommend additional language to \n     address the special pharmacy needs of beneficiaries residing \n     in nursing facilities who are not dually-eligible for \n     Medicare and Medicaid. Such language would require the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to review the current \n     standards of practice for pharmacy services provided to \n     patients in nursing facilities and to report to the Congress \n     its\n\n[[Page S8641]]\n\n     findings prior to implementation of the new prescription drug \n     benefit. This report would include a detailed description of \n     the Department's plans to implement the provisions of this \n     Act in a manner consistent with applicable state and federal \n     laws designed to protect the safety and quality of care of \n     nursing facility patients. Such provisions were included in \n     legislation approved by the House Ways and Means and Energy \n     and Commerce Committees, and we would respectfully request \n     that you adopt similar language.\n       We appreciate your leadership in carefully considering the \n     multitude of complex issues related to the creation of a new \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit. We are grateful for the \n     chance to work constructively with you to protect patient \n     safety and to ensure the continued provision of quality \n     pharmacy services to the most vulnerable seniors.\n       If you have any questions or would like additional \n     information, please feel free to contact me. Again, thank you \n     for your efforts to ensure patient safety and promote quality \n     care for Medicare beneficiaries residing in nursing \n     facilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Paul Baldwin,\n                                               Executive Director.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. One of the great strengths of Medicare is that it is for \neveryone. Rich and poor alike contribute to the system. Rich and poor \nalike benefit from it.\n  At bottom, Medicare is a commitment to every senior citizen and every \ndisabled American that we will not have two-class medicine in America. \nWhen a senior citizen enters a hospital, Medicare pays the same amount \nfor their care whether they are a pauper or a millionaire. When a \nsenior citizen goes to a doctor, she has the peace of mind of knowing \nthat Medicare has the same obligation to pay for her treatment no \nmatter what her financial circumstances--and the doctor has no \nfinancial interest in rationing her care according to the contents of \nher bank account.\n  Through the Medicaid Program, we do try to provide extra help for \nthose who are poor. But the fact that Medicaid provides extra \nassistance for the poor does not reduce Medicare's obligation to \nprovide equal treatment for all. Medicare always has primary payment \nresponsibilities for the service it covers. Medicaid is always \nsupplementary.\n  Medicaid provides critical help to the poor and elderly, but it does \nnot provide the same reliable guarantees of equal treatment that \nMedicare does. Under Medicaid, States have limited the number of days \nof hospital care they would provide or the number of doctor visits they \nwill support. States have placed arbitrary limits on the number of \nprescriptions.\n  This legislation sets an undesirable precedent for treatment of poor \nsenior citizens who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. For \nevery other benefit, these senior citizens enroll in Medicare, and \nMedicaid supplements Medicare's coverage. But for this benefit, the \nbill says that the poor are excluded from Medicare. The only benefits \nthey get are from the Medicaid Program. Medicare is for all senior \ncitizens who paid into the program during their working years--not just \nsome senior citizens. And it should stay that way.\n  This amendment rights this wrong. It says we will not take away the \nMedicare that the poor have earned by a lifetime of hard work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from New \nMexico?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I request that the manager allot me 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1066\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to explain \namendment No. 1066, which is scheduled to be one of the amendments \nconsidered in this next block of amendments.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned that the prescription drug coverage \nincluded in S. 1 is not sufficient to fully meet the needs of our \nseniors and that those seniors who elect to participate in Part D and \nget this prescription drug benefit will be restricted from purchasing \nsupplemental coverage.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that in 2006--which is the \nyear this legislation really takes effect, this benefit occurs--the \naverage Medicare beneficiary will spend $3,160 per year on prescription \ndrugs. Under the current plan, those individuals will have $1,700 that \nsame year in out-of-pocket expenses in addition to the $420 they pay in \nPart D premiums. Therefore, the average Medicare beneficiary who elects \nPart D will have approximately $2,100 per year in out-of-pocket \nexpenses. This translates, of course, into $175 a month. That is a \nsignificant expenditure for a lot of individuals and couples on a fixed \nincome.\n  It would seem reasonable to allow these individuals who want to \nprotect themselves against unpredictable and increasing prescription \ndrug expenses to purchase supplemental insurance coverage that would \nallow additional prescription drugs to be purchased.\n  Medigap was designed to fill the gaps in Medicare. A sizable gap \nexists in the prescription drug benefit we are offering in this bill. \nYet the current bill specifically prohibits seniors from filling that \ngap with a Medigap policy.\n  Section 103 of S. 1, which is the bill we are considering, explicitly \nprohibits people who elect Part D prescription drug coverage from \npurchasing additional prescription drug coverage as part of any Medigap \nplan.\n  Let me give you the quotation out of the bill. It says:\n\n       No Medicare supplemental policy that provides coverage of \n     expenses for prescription drugs may be sold, issued, or \n     renewed under this section to an individual who is enrolled \n     under Part D.\n\n  So you essentially have a choice: Am I going to enroll in this new \nPart D and get this benefit and therefore forego any Medigap policy or \nam I going to stay out?\n  We are telling seniors whose cost burden, on average, will be $2,100 \na year, and 10 percent of whom are likely to have out-of-pocket \nexpenses of $4,000 or more per year, they will not be allowed to seek \nadditional prescription drug relief.\n  The amendment I am offering would give seniors the option of \npurchasing more prescription coverage as part of a comprehensive \nMedigap plan. The amendment calls on the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners to devise two new Medigap plans that would each \noffer prescription drug coverage to beneficiaries who elect Part D.\n  There are currently 10 standard Medigap plans. They are designated A \nthrough J, and they offer insurance to seniors. Of those, plans H, I, \nand J offer prescription drug coverage in addition to Part A and Part B \nwraparounds. Of these, H and J are the most commonly elected plans.\n  Under S. 1, the way it now stands, seniors who elect Part D would no \nlonger qualify for H, I, or J. However, if the amendment is adopted, \nthe two new policies designed by the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners would be similar to the current Medigap policies of H and \nJ, but their prescription drug coverage would be tailored to wrap \naround the Part D coverage. So seniors who are currently H or J \nsubscribers would have the option of electing Part D and still \nmaintaining a Medigap plan similar to what they have now.\n  The amendment would give the National Association of Insurance \nCommissioners 18 months to develop and report back on these two new \nplans. In my view, it would be a substantial improvement to the current \nbill.\n  As I said, my amendment will give the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners 18 months to develop and report back on two new \nplans. The NAIC is the appropriate body to develop these plans because \nthey have a system already in place for doing so with appropriate \nrepresentation from all interested and affected parties. The NAIC can \nbest determine how the benefits proposed in this amendment can be \ndesigned in order to avoid over-utilization and to coordinate with the \nexisting medigap benefit packages. They were the body employed to \ndevelop the current Medigap plans A through J and they are the body \nbest equipped to develop these two new plans.\n  This amendment is similar to language already included in the House \nversion of the bill and thus already has a great deal of support in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  This amendment also provides a provision to stabilize the Medigap \nmarket\n\n[[Page S8642]]\n\nduring this time of transition. The current bill states that seniors \nwho are enrolled in H, I, or J at the time when they elect Part D will \nbe displaced from their current Medigap plans and given open enrollment \ninto any other Medigap plan A-G offered in their State. Our amendment \nwill still guarantee them the option of enrolling in substitute \ncoverage without the risk of discrimination based on age, health \nstatus, utilization, etc. However, our amendment will reduce the chaos \nof this transition time by keeping the majority of Medigap subscribers \nwith their current carriers.\n  Let me explain. Beneficiaries displaced from H, I, or J will have the \noption of choosing any other Medigap plan--A-G--that their carrier \noffers or one of the two new plans. If their current carrier does not \nchoose to offer one of the new plans then they will have the option of \nswitching carriers in order to obtain a medigap policy that includes \nprescription coverage. Thus, the majority of seniors will be staying \nwith their current carriers and thus, those carriers will be better \nable to predict the affect of this shift and better able to ease the \ntransition for their subscribers.\n  This is a simple amendment that should elicit very little \ncontroversy. People may raise concerns because it will be difficult to \nconstruct a standardized wrap around benefit to compliment Part D when \nPart D is not standardized. But this is not a reason to deny people \naccess to supplemental coverage. Rather, we are giving the NAIC 18 \nmonths to put together such a plan.\n  Consumer groups such as the Consumer Union and Medicare Advocacy \nsupport our amendment because it provides much needed additional \ncoverage options for our Nation's seniors. Likewise, insurance carriers \nlike it because it allows them to continue to provide a service that \nthey have been providing up until this point and yet it does not force \nthem to offer these new plans if they do not see them as viable. The \ncost of the amendment should be negligible as it is not adding any \nadditional Government expenditure nor expediting a beneficiary's trip \nto the catastrophic threshold. This amendment simply gives seniors an \nopportunity to continue to seek the insurance industry an opportunity \nto meet the needs of our seniors not met by Medicare Part D.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to review this amendment before \nthey vote. I think it is an excellent amendment.\n  I ask them to join me in supporting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1011\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue \nthat will come before the Senate shortly. That is an amendment to \nstrike the language from this legislation which is found in section \n605, the legal immigrant child health provision. Let me give the \nbackground on section 605.\n  What this legislation would do would be to allow States on a State \noption basis to elect to provide health care for pregnant women for the \nperiod of their pregnancy, plus 60 days thereafter, and immigrant \nchildren. In both categories we are talking about legal immigrants, not \npeople who have arrived outside the system and undocumented. These are \nindividuals who have come to the United States under all of the \nprocedures that allow for legal immigration, with the most prominent \ncategory being for family reunification.\n  The restoration of this has already been considered by the Senate \nFinance Committee, first in 2001, then in June of 2002, and most \nrecently in the consideration of this legislation. This provision was \nsustained in the chairman's mark, as it had been placed by Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus, by a vote of 13 to 8. There has been both \nconsideration and approval of this provision by the Finance Committee.\n  It has been alleged that the provision of these services to legal \nimmigrants will encourage illegal immigration. We are talking \nexclusively about pregnant women and children who have entered the \nUnited States on a legal basis.\n  Prior to 1996, there was no restriction on health care benefits for \nlegal immigrants. We are now carving out from the current exclusion for \nhealth care two categories, which are both humane and very much in the \npublic interest, that pregnant women have adequate access to health \ncare and that children grow up with adequate health care.\n  It has been alleged that there are a number of benefits which have \nalso been made available to legal immigrants, including emergency \nmedical services, Head Start programs, foster care, school lunches, and \nfood stamps. Those can be debated on their own merits but they are no \nsubstitute for providing to legal immigrants, children, and pregnant \nwomen a place to get appropriate health care.\n  It has also been stated that this should be a responsibility of the \nsponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. May I have 30 seconds to close?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nhave 30 additional seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. The Immigration and Naturalization Service \nunder the current law has limited the kinds of public benefits that are \nrelevant to the so-called public charge finding. INS officers place no \nweight on the receipt of noncash public benefits when determining \nwhether an immigrant will be a public charge on society. This \nprovision, section 605, is consistent with current national immigration \npolicy. Therefore, I urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I believe our side has 2 minutes remaining. I ask \nunanimous consent for 4 minutes and yield the Senator from Alabama 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, included in the Medicare prescription \ndrug reform bill in section 605 is a Medicaid reform of welfare \nbenefits for noncitizens, reversing a policy adopted by this Senate in \n1996 by a vote of 74 to 24. Section 605 is a very substantial change in \nour current policy. It will cost, according to CBO estimates, $500 \nmillion over just 3 years. It is not to be taken lightly. Frankly, we \nhaven't had debate on it.\n  I have offered an amendment that would strike the existing language \nin section 605, along with a sense of the Senate that this matter go \nback to the Finance Committee for hearings this fall, the time when the \nFinance Committee plans to be addressing Medicaid welfare reform. That \nis what this is. This is Medicaid welfare reform, not Medicare senior \ncitizens reform.\n  This is clearly unconnected to the purpose of the bill. It was \nslipped in as some sort of compromise. We ought not to allow that to \nhappen, to erode a very important part of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. \nThe administration, which is very favorable to matters that would help \nimmigrants in this country, opposes this change. They say it should be \ndone, if at all, as part of the welfare reform of this fall.\n\n  That is why our sense of the Senate calls on the Finance Committee to \nreevaluate it as part of their requirement this fall on reform welfare. \nMillions of people come to this country legally. They come here with \nsponsors. Those sponsors say they will pay for the medical welfare \nneeds of those people they sponsor. That is by affidavit and it should \nbe honored, not undercut.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator Sessions for \nhis leadership. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Sessions \namendment to strike out this provision that does not belong in a \nMedicare bill.\n  This is a Medicaid provision. This is a welfare provision. We are \ngoing to reauthorize welfare later this summer. It should be considered \nat that time. This is part of the reforms that were made in 1996 when \nwe passed the welfare reform act, one of the most successful bills we \never passed. If we are going to undermine that, do it with a little \nconsideration. The administration opposes this because it doesn't \nbelong here, and it is bad policy. This turns immigration policy on its \nhead.\n  Let me read the current law on immigration policy. For a legal \nimmigrant who comes into this country, it is required that the sponsor \nof that immigrant sign an affidavit of support to the U.S. Department \nof Justice which states:\n\n       By signing this form, you, the sponsor, agree to support \n     the intending immigrant\n\n[[Page S8643]]\n\n     and any spouse or children immigrating with him or her, and \n     to reimburse any Government agency or private entity that \n     provides these sponsored immigrants with Federal, State, or \n     local means-tested public benefits.\n\n  This provision in the underlying bill would turn this law on its head \nand would basically take hundreds of millions of dollars away from \nMedicare recipients and give them to immigrants. So this is changing \nimmigration law and Medicaid law. It needs to be dealt with in the \nMedicaid bill and welfare reform bill. It doesn't belong in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Sessions amendment.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I rise to urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  In proposing this amendment, Senator sessions argues that the \nrestoration of health benefits to legal immigrants has not been fully \nreviewed or discussed. he also argues that SCHIP and Medicaid \nprovisions are welfare reform measures and therefore not germane to the \nprescription drug bill. The amendment also states that Congress \ndeliberately limited benefits available to legal immigrants when it \nremoved these benefits in 1996.\n  I respectfully disagree with all of these three assertions.\n  First of all, the Senate Finance Committee has already extensively \nreviewed this issue. In 2001, the Finance Committee held a series of \nhearings on health coverage for the uninsured, including legal \nimmigrants. During the TANF reauthorization mark-up in June 2002, there \nwas a full debate on the restoration of health benefits to legal \nimmigrants, and the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act passed \nas an amendment by a vote of 12 to 9. This year, during Finance \nCommittee mark-up of the prescription drug bill, there was once again \nfull debate on the restoration of health benefits to legal immigrants. \nSenator Nickles offered an amendment to strike the immigrant children's \nhealth provision from the chairman's mark and that amendment failed by \na vote of 8 to 13.\n  Second, I disagree with Senator Sessions' argument that Section 605 \nof the bill is not germane to Medicare prescription drug legislation. \nEvery time this sort of provision comes to a vote, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle question the vehicle. When the immigrant child \nhealth provisions came up in committee last year, as part of the TANF \nreauthorization mark-up, Senator Hatch remarked that, ``If we start \nplaying with health care policy, this bill isn't going to go through.'' \nThis year, Senator Sessions is saying that TANF reauthorization is the \nappropriate vehicle. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthen--which one is the appropriate vehicle?\n  In fact, the restoration of health benefits to legal immigrants is \nalso a major component of the effort to add a prescription drug benefit \nunder Medicare. Senators Grassley and Baucus realized this when they \nincluded this provision in the prescription drug mark as part of a \ncompromise agreement that included both Senator Kyl's undocumented \naliens provision to reimburse hospitals for the cost of treating \nundocumented aliens and Senator Graham's legal immigrants provision.\n  Finally, benefits to legal immigrants were cut in 1996 as a cost-\nsaving measure, not as a matter of welfare reform. Section 605 of the \nunderlying bill is also consistent with other policies approved by \nPresident Bush. Last year, the President signed legislation restoring \nfood stamp benefits for legal immigrant children. The immigrant child \nhealth provisions would make these same children eligible for Medicaid \nand SCHIP. In an interview with the Associated Press in May 2002, Tommy \nThompson, Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, \nstated that he had no ``philosophical objection'' to lifting the ban on \nproviding health care benefits to legal immigrants.\n  Senator Sessions' amendment also has significant dire consequences \nfor women and children, and could add costs to the Medicaid program, \nwhich I am certain that Senator Sessions did not intend. Current \nrestrictions prevent thousands of legal immigrant children and pregnant \nwomen from getting the same access to preventive health care services \nthat they would have if they were U.S. citizens. As a result of the \nrestrictions, immigrant children have fewer opportunities to see a \npediatrician and receive treatment before minor illnesses become \nserious and life-threatening. Families who are unable to get basic \npreventive care for their children have little choice but to turn to \nemergency rooms--the least cost-effective place to provide care--when \ntheir children become sick. Similarly, without prenatal care, a woman \nmay give birth to a baby with low-birth weight, placing the baby at \nrisk and resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in neonatal \nintensive care costs.\n  Frankly, I am saddened that we must fight over a bipartisan, \nthoughtful and extensively reviewed provision that will protect the \nhealth of children who legally came to our country and had no control \nover the length of time they were legal immigrants. We must ensure that \nit is defeated.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, with all deference to my colleague from \nAlabama, I strongly oppose this amendment to strike the provisions that \nwould allow States to cover legal immigrants under Medicaid and SCHIP. \nAs health care measures, these provisions are an appropriate addition \nto this legislation, and I am grateful that the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee included them in his bill.\n  Legal immigrants were banned from receiving Federal benefits under a \nnumber of programs, including Medicaid, for 5 years. The argument was \nmade that people shouldn't come to this country if they are going to be \na public charge.\n  But the reality is that legal immigrants don't come here for our \nbenefits. They come because they want to work so they can make better \nlives for themselves and for their children. They work hard and they \nmake a vital contribution to our economy. Many are forced to take low-\npaying jobs. And many of these jobs do not provide health insurance.\n  Immigrant families need access to health insurance just as much as \ncitizen families. They are also just as deserving of this coverage as \ncitizen families. Immigrants work hard. They pay taxes. They contribute \nto their communities. Immigrant children are also required to register \nfor the Selective Service when they turn 18. According to the American \nImmigrant Law Foundation, 60,000 legal immigrants are on active duty in \nthe U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Now, when an immigrant woman becomes pregnant, or her child gets \nsick, she has few places to turn except to emergency care, which is the \nmost expensive means of providing health care. Many States have \nrealized that this is not an acceptable way to address the health care \nneeds of these families. Some 20 States now provide health care \nservices to legal immigrants using their own funds. So the burden of \ncaring for these families has been transferred to States and hospitals.\n  To respond to this situation, Senator Graham introduced S. 845, the \nImmigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, or ICHIA, which simply \nallows States to use Federal Medicaid and SCHIP funding to provide \ncoverage for pregnant women and children who are legal immigrants. The \nchairman of the Finance Committee included this provision to give \nStates this option for fiscal years 2005, 2006, and 2007. This proposal \nhas strong bipartisan support in both the Senate and in the House. It \nwas adopted on a bipartisan basis last year in the Finance Committee, \nand a bipartisan group of Finance Committee members voted against \nstripping this provision from this bill this year.\n  The administration has suggested that this proposal would somehow \ncreate a new burden on the States. In fact, the proposal only gives \nStates the option to provide this coverage, and allows them to use \nFederal resources to do so, thus giving them significant fiscal relief. \nNo new burden would be imposed on the States. The National Governors \nAssociation and the National Conference of State Legislatures both \nsupport restoring these benefits. Even Governor Bush of Florida has \nindicated he supports this proposal.\n  More than 5 million children live in poor or ``near-poor'' noncitizen \nfamilies. That is more than one-quarter of the total population of poor \nor ``near-poor'' children. Almost half of all low-income immigrant \nchildren are uninsured and they are more than twice as likely to be \nuninsured as low-income citizen children with native-born parents.\n\n[[Page S8644]]\n\n  Many of these children will eventually become American citizens. By \ndenying all but emergency health care, we increase the risk that these \nchildren will suffer long-term health consequences, which could reduce \ntheir ability to learn and develop, and become productive, contributing \ncitizens.\n  It is also worth noting that the Medicaid/SCHIP ban also affects \ncitizen children living in immigrant families. As many as 85 percent of \nimmigrant families have at least one child who is a citizen. Although \nmany of these children are eligible for Medicaid and SCHIP, receipt \namong eligible citizen children of noncitizen parents is significantly \nbelow that for other poor children. Parents may be confused about their \nchildren's eligibility, or concerned that somehow claiming these \nbenefits will affect the status of other family members.\n  Making sure that pregnant immigrant women, and their children, have \naccess to health care, including preventive care, is an investment in \nthe future workforce of this Nation. I believe providing health care \nfor all of our citizens, including pregnant women and children who are \nimmigrants, is vital for our future economic strength. It is also the \nright thing to do. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know we have an agreement that the vote \nwill start at about 5 o'clock. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 975, as modified\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will divide my 2 minutes between two \nissues. First is the dual-eligible issue, concerning the amendment \noffered by the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller. I have a \nlot of sympathy for what he is trying to do. In fact, my preference \nwould be that low-income senior citizens get benefits under Medicare, \nnot Medicaid.\n  Regrettably, we tried to strike a balance at this time so that the \nmoney spent on the bill, the $400 billion, was spent more on seniors, \nother beneficiaries, so they get better benefits, rather than spending \nthe money in States to, in effect, bail out the States for their \nresponsibilities under Medicaid. When we go to conference, I plan to do \nwhat I can, along with the chairman, to work this issue out. I think \nthe Senator from West Virginia made a very good point.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1011\n\n  On the other issue, the Sessions amendment, this provision is a \nhealth care provision, not a welfare provision. It is whether legal \nimmigrants should get Medicaid benefits. That is all it comes down to.\n  My view is that it is the right policy. It is not neat and tidy, or \nperhaps not on the right bill, but it is something that should be done. \nIt is the right thing to do. I urge Senators to not vote in favor of \nthe Sessions amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we delay \nthe vote so I can do some amendments that have been agreed to--a \nbipartisan list of amendments--to get them out of the way at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1033, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send a modification of Senator \nMikulski's amendment to the desk on municipal health services and ask \nunanimous consent that it be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes evenly divided prior \nto the next vote.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, this next amendment has to do with \ndual eligibility. Never in the history of Medicare have we precluded \nMedicare beneficiaries from being Medicare beneficiaries. In the \nunderlying bill, for the very first time, we do.\n  The people I refer to are called dual eligibles. Their average income \nis $6,500 a year. They tend to be over 85, single women, and very sick. \nThey are on Medicaid. Medicaid, however, is optional according to the \nStates. We know the States to be broke. The fastest growing expense \nthey face is Medicaid. So they are cutting the benefits. They are \ncutting Medicaid. They will continue to do that. The States have no \nchoice but to cut Medicaid. Some will do it because they wish to, all \nwill do it because they have to.\n  When that possibility is gone, there is no place for these poorest of \nthe poor to go. They are then, under the underlying bill, precluded \nfrom being Medicare beneficiaries. That is wrong. In my budget-neutral \namendment I attempt to fix it. I hope my colleagues will support the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Two things for my colleagues to consider during the \nconsideration of how to vote on this amendment: No. 1 is the money that \nis available to pay for his amendment, an offset, is the very same \namount of money we, Senator Baucus and I, are using to offset the cost \nof a lot of demonstration projects that colleagues have asked us to do, \na lot of minor amendments they have asked us to do. If that money is \nnot there, there cannot be consideration given. That is not a threat; \nit is just a practical aspect of how the budget law works.\n  Secondly, remember, these dual eligibles are being taken care of very \nwell\n\n[[Page S8648]]\n\nin our underlying legislation. The point being, they will not be taken \ncare of better. It is just it is going to cost the Federal Government \nmore.\n  I hope you will take those things into consideration and vote down \nthis amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 2 minutes equally divided on the \nBingaman amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill before us has, in my view, a \nsignificant flaw in it. We are holding out this prescription drug \nbenefit. But the bill we are considering here says if you want to take \nadvantage of the benefit, you are thereby prohibited from buying any \nsupplemental insurance to cover prescription drugs. Today, people are \nable to buy Medigap policies that cover prescription drugs. In the \nfuture they will not be able to, if this bill becomes law as it is.\n  My amendment would merely give people the option of buying a \nprescription drug supplemental policy if they chose to do so. It \ndirects that two policies be developed that would accomplish that.\n  It is supported by the insurance industry. It is supported by the \nConsumers Union. Seniors would like to have this opportunity to reduce \ntheir risk of substantial out-of-pocket costs.\n  We ought to provide this benefit.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, let me make very clear \nthat we know that Medigap is very important as part of Medicare. We \nleave that untouched as it relates to 1965 model Medicare. In fact, \nmany of my Iowa constituents want to keep that. But we as a policy \nmatter have made it a very conscious choice to prevent the sale of \nwraparound Medigap plans for the new Part D drug benefit. This policy \nmakes sense considering drug plans could be different everywhere else \nin the United States.\n  It is impossible to standardize Medigap policies like we did about 15 \nyears ago so that seniors don't get ripped off. But the Congressional \nBudget Office tells us this new Medigap plan that is before us now will \nincrease the cost of our bill. The cost of this amendment is $1.5 \nbillion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nThat is because of the increased utilization that comes from having \nadditional insurance.\n  I share the Senator's concern with gaps in coverage. I wish we didn't \nhave any.\n  But we believe participating drug plans--especially drug plans \ndelivered by PPOs--will offer benefits in a comprehensive fashion, \nlessening the need for expensive supplemental policies.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, it is almost 6:25, and we \nhave just completed our 12th rollcall vote. We still have a fair amount \nof work to do. But in discussion with the managers of the bill and the \nDemocratic leader, it is our intent to finish this bill tonight. I \noptimistically think we can finish in 2 or 3 hours, or this bill can go \nuntil midnight, or 1, or 2, or 3 in the morning.\n  Part of the problem we are having now is that people are still coming \nup and submitting amendments, and because we have been working in good \nfaith over the last 2 weeks in the amendment process, we have not set \nstrict filing deadlines.\n  Now that we are in the last several hours of consideration, I want to \nmake the case and, in fact, plead with my colleagues that any \namendments that need to be considered--let us hear about them. Let the \nmanagers hear about them in the next 15 minutes. That is the only way \nwe can get a list to deal with them, and we will have rollcall votes on \nthose that are necessary.\n  There will be a certain number of those amendments looked at by the \nmanagers. The ones I encourage you to bring to them for consideration \nto be accepted need to be budget neutral and have bipartisan support, \nand they need to be scored by the CBO. People keep bringing amendments \nforward now. I\n\n[[Page S8649]]\n\nwill ask--and then I want the Democratic leader to comment--that \npeople, in the next 15 minutes or so, make sure the managers have the \namendments. That way we can move ahead. We will finish tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I hope we can do as the majority leader \nhas suggested. We have had a good debate. I think this has been an \nexcellent debate. The managers deserve credit for the way they have \nmanaged the legislation. We have had 12 rollcall votes today already. \nIt is likely that we will have 16 or 17 by the end of the day, if not \nmore; we had 9 yesterday. More than 50 amendments have now been \nconsidered.\n  I think it is time that we bring the debate to a close. There will be \nmany more opportunities to talk about prescription drugs and health \ncare with the array of legislative challenges that we face relating to \nhealth. I think we have been able to do a good deal, and I hope we can \nget cooperation now on both sides of the aisle. I hope the majority \nleader will hold to the commitment that we finish tonight. That would \naccommodate people's travel schedules tomorrow.\n  If we are going to do that--it is now 6:30--over the course of the \nnext 4 or 5 hours, we have a lot of work to do even with what we know \nwe have to vote on. I hope everybody will cooperate so we can minimize \nthe time required to consider amendments. I hope those who may have \nremarks to make will perhaps hold off until after final passage and \nmake those remarks after final passage. That would accommodate our time \nas well.\n  We will work with the majority leader to see if we can accomplish the \nschedule he has laid out. I hope we can do so well before the \nbewitching hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, when we finish this bill tonight, my \nexpectation would be that we would not have votes tomorrow. That is \nassuming we are going to finish. I encourage anyone who has an \namendment that needs to be considered to get it to the managers within \nthe next 15 minutes. If we can do that, we can finish tonight and we \nwill be able to consider each of those amendments, as the Democratic \nleader said.\n  I know some people want to talk for an hour but I ask Senators to \nkeep their comments to a few minutes and we can vote throughout the \nnight. We will have the opportunity after final passage tonight, or \nthrough tomorrow, to make statements--for those who wish to continue \nthe debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address this bill. I had hoped to \ndo it earlier in the day but, unfortunately, the managers of the bill \nwere unable to work the time in. I certainly regret taking time out of \nthe schedule, which is obviously crowded. I do think it is important to \nspeak up on the issue of this piece of legislation.\n  This is the most significant piece of spending legislation, and maybe \neven public policy legislation, outside of an international issue, that \nI expect I will vote on in my tenure in the Senate. Ironically, when I \nran for this job, after serving as Governor of New Hampshire, one of \nthe reasons I sought the job and one of the reasons I wanted to pursue \na term in the Senate was that I was concerned about entitlement \nspending. In fact, during my first few years, I aggressively pursued \nsetting up an entitlement commission to address entitlement spending, \nwhich I sponsored with Senator Kempthorne, who came in with me that \nyear, and Senator Coverdell and Senator Bennett, all of whom came in \nthe year I was elected, in a bill to end unfunded mandates, many of \nwhich were entitlement oriented.\n  I tried to lead an effort in passing legislation to address reform of \nthe Social Security system. I consider that to be a huge entitlement \nthat we confront. My basic reason for seeking entitlement reform and \nresponsibility was that I was concerned that it not only is what is \ndriving the deficits of our country--which they continue to do--but, \nmore importantly, as the demographics shifted in the Nation and we saw \nthe baby boom generation, which represents a huge population, moving \ntoward retirement, we, as a nation, were going to be placing on our \nchildren and our children's children an inordinate burden in the area \nof taxes in order to support the older generation--my generation--which \nwould be retiring. It is because all the major programs, whether they \nare Social Security or Medicare, are built on the theory that there is \na pyramid out there, that there will always be more people working and \na lot more people working than those people who are taking their \nretirement benefits out of the system. That, of course, is the way it \nbegan.\n\n  Back in 1950, there were 12.5 people working for every person who \nretired under Social Security. Today, we are down to 3.5 people working \nfor every 1 person retired on Social Security and under Medicare, and \nthat is stressing the system.\n  Unfortunately, when we hit the retirement situation for the baby boom \ngeneration, the largest generation in the history of our Nation, the \ngeneration born between 1946 and 1955, we go down to two people working \nfor every one person retired. We go from a pyramid to basically a \nrectangle, and the result is that we will end up putting an inordinate \namount of stress on those people who are working to support those folks \nwho are retired. So we need to address thoughtfully any entitlement \nexpansion, to say nothing of the entitlements that are already on the \nbooks.\n  That is what brings me to the Chamber today to address this \nlegislation because I believe very strongly that needy senior citizens \nshould have a drug benefit. Clearly, prescription drugs have become the \nnew way to treat disease and maintain public health in our Nation. We \nhave been able to move from a system where you had to have invasive \nactivity in the health care system, where you had to go through \nsurgery, to a system where people can, as result of the keen use of our \nscientific community, take a pharmaceutical and actually have a better \nlife than if they were to go under the knife, have surgery.\n  This is a revolution, and it is a revolution that is exploding and \ngrowing. Biotech activity, the nanotech activity, is only going to lead \nto more and more and better and better pharmaceuticals coming on the \nmarket to help people with their health.\n  It is absolutely unfair, in my opinion, that people who are in a low-\nincome situation, especially retired people who are on a fixed low \nincome, have to choose between their food and their housing and maybe \ntheir pharmaceuticals. That is not right in our society, and we can \ncertainly afford to have that addressed.\n  It was my hope as we brought forward a pharmaceutical drug benefit \nfor senior citizens that we would do it in a way that would address \nlow-income seniors. Equally important, it is important that a middle-\nincome senior should not have to spend all their assets for health care \nas a result of pharmaceutical costs. After a certain amount of \nspending, there should be catastrophic coverage that kicks in, \nrelieving that person of the full responsibility or a large portion of \ntheir responsibility for the pharmaceutical cost. That is the type of \nstructure at which we should be looking.\n  Putting in place this brand new drug benefit, we also have to look at \nthe underlying Medicare system which we all know is fundamentally \nbroken as we look out into the future. When the baby boom generation \nhits, it simply is not going to work. It is not going to support that \ngeneration. That is because it is a 1959 design, an automobile built in \nthe fifties driving on the highways of the year 2000 which, when it \ngets to 2015, is going to be too old to function effectively. It needs \nto have put in place forces which are going to cause it to be more \nefficient, to be more effective in addressing a person's approach to \ntheir health care. Those forces have to be basically marketplace \noriented. They cannot be price-control oriented.\n\n  My hope, my goal, my belief was that we would create a drug benefit \nthat would help low-income seniors and, at the same time, give \ncatastrophic coverage, and that would, fundamentally, reform the \nMedicare system so that we would end up with a more market-oriented \nsystem, something that was going to contain costs as we moved into the \noutyears.\n\n[[Page S8650]]\n\n  What did we get? What is before us today? Essentially, what we have \nbefore us today is a drug benefit that will plant a fiscal disease that \nwill afflict our children and our children's children. It is a drug \nbenefit that is going to put in place a fiscal disease that will \nafflict our children for the next 75 years. By afflict them, I mean \nthat our children and our children's children, under the benefit in \nthis bill, are going to have to pay $6 trillion. That is the estimate. \nThat may be the high end. It is somewhere between $4.6 trillion and $6 \ntrillion. When you get into those numbers, it is pretty hard to get \nvery definitive.\n  That is the burden this drug benefit in this bill puts on our \nchildren and our children's children to support my generation which is \ngoing to retire and take advantage of it.\n  That is a huge problem because what we are essentially saying to the \nperson who is working in a restaurant or working in a garage or working \non a computer line or working as a sales person, who is young and \ntrying to raise a family, is that they are going to have to pay an \ninordinate amount of tax burden to support people who are retired with \nthis drug benefit.\n  That would not be so bad if the drug benefit was not an income \ntransfer from that person working in that garage, working in that \nrestaurant, or working on that computer line to somebody who is a great \ndeal wealthier than they are potentially. That would not be so bad if \nit was a transfer from that person to people who are low income or \nwhose assets are about to be wiped out because of a drug expenditure.\n  That is not the way this bill works. The way this bill works is \nessentially to nationalize the entire drug delivery service for senior \ncitizens to take all the present programs which presently benefit \nsenior citizens for drug benefits--and there are a lot of them; there \nare a lot of seniors in this country today who already have a drug \nbenefit; something like 76 percent is the estimate--to take a large \npercentage of those people and move them from their private programs to \nthe public programs.\n  If you retired from a major corporation or even a smaller corporation \nin this country, it is very likely that in your retirement package, \ndepending on how aggressive your union was or how successful your \ncompany was, you received a drug benefit during your retirement. But \nwhen this bill passes, the incentive is going to be to take that drug \nbenefit which presently exists in the private sector under some sort of \ncontractual agreement which you had when you retired and move it out of \nthe private sector and throw it on the taxpayers of America.\n  Who are those taxpayers going to be? They are going to be our \nchildren and our children's children, people who are working for a \nliving, trying to buy their kids a better education, a better home, \nbetter food, or even just a nice car or a night out at the movies. \nTheir ability to do that is going to be undermined if this bill goes \nforward in its present form because so much will have to flow back to \nbenefit people who already have the benefit in the private sector and \nare now going to be migrated over to the public sector.\n  Mr. President, $4.5 trillion to $6 trillion is a huge amount of \nmoney, a huge burden to put on our children. It is hard to put it in \nterms that are realistic and are visible when we are talking those type \nof dollars, but every American child born tonight--and there are a lot \nof kids being born tonight in America--starts out with a $44,000 debt \nthey have to pay for Medicare for my retirement, for the retirement of \neverybody in this room, for the retirement of most of the people who \nare watching who are over the age of 45. They start out with a $44,000 \ndebt.\n  When this bill passes, they will have another $12,000 to $15,000 \nadded to that debt. So before they get through the first night of their \nlife, as a result of this legislation they are going to owe $60,000. It \nis not fair. It is not right. We are not doing it the correct way.\n  There are ways to do this where the system is not nationalized, where \nall the people who already have a drug benefit are told there is no \nincentive for them to keep it.\n  We do not say in the private sector to the people who bought Medigap, \nto the people who have reached contractual agreements in retirement, to \nthe people who have retained retirement coverage through the private \nsector, that there is no advantage to them keeping their program or, \nalternatively, the people who are giving them that program saying they \nare not going to give it to them anymore, and move those folks onto the \npublic dole, onto the public system. It makes no sense.\n  Then there is the issue of the underlying question of Medicare. Not \nonly is the drug benefit in this bill fundamentally flawed because it \nmigrates huge numbers of people off the private sector and into the \npublic sector, but the underlying purpose of the Medicare effort in \nthis bill is flawed. If we are going to put in place this huge new \nbenefit for seniors, and especially if it is going to be as grand and \nas pervasive, where we are basically saying to all seniors that they \nget a benefit here, no matter what their income is--if that is going to \nbe put in place, that ought to at least be coupled with some sort of \nreform of the underlying Medicare system to try to bring under control \nthose costs which are driving the outyear liability, which will be the \ntax burden for our children and their children.\n  The estimated outyear cost of Medicare that is unfunded is $13.3 \ntrillion. When the baby-boom generation starts to hit the system in \n2008, that is when it really starts to crank up, by the year 2020, \n2025, when there will be large retirement populations as a result of \nthis demographic shift, $13.3 trillion of unfunded liability.\n  Unfunded means it is just there. We have to pay it, but nobody has an \nidea of how they are going to do it. There is no trust fund for it. \nThere is no money out there to do it. So the only way it is going to be \ndone is to raise taxes or to cut the benefit, which is politically \nprobably impossible, so to raise taxes on the young people who are \nworking.\n  There is a third way, however, to do it, and that is to make Medicare \na more cost-sensitive, more thoughtful, more efficient system for \ndelivery of health care. Regrettably, under this bill that does not \nhappen. There is a representation that that might happen, something \ncalled a PPO, which is supposedly going to create an opportunity for \nthe private sector to come in and compete with the traditional Medicare \nsystem. The price control system will have a chance to compete with a \nmarketplace system. That is the thematic statement of the bill. \nUnfortunately, it is illusory. It will not happen under the bill. CBO \nsays maybe 2 percent of the people will migrate, will move over, to a \nPPO system. The administration says it is 48 percent. Logic tells us it \nis not going to fly, because the bill has been structured to defeat the \nprobability a PPO, a marketplace system, will be allowed to work. All \nthe little gimmicks in this bill are aimed at essentially undermining \nthat.\n  Classic was the amendment that we passed earlier, which had been so \ngerrymandered, which was an effort by Senator Kyl. So what are we told? \nWell, even though the bill has these fundamental flaws of having a drug \nbenefit that migrates a large number of people out of the private \nsector into the public sector and essentially causes low-income working \nAmericans who are young to have to support middle-income Americans who \nare retired and who had a private sector benefit, and even though the \nbill has this illusory marketplace representation, basically no real \nreform of Medicare, we are told we should vote for it because it is \ngoing to be improved in conference. At least that is what we are being \ntold on our side of the aisle. I do not know what is being said on the \nother side of the aisle. Maybe they are not getting that same message. \nWe are being told that by the administration.\n\n  The problem is, we are betting on the come. I mean, this is $6 \ntrillion of unfunded liability we are talking about passing on to our \nkids. It is massive. If this bill were to pass in its present form, or \nanything near to its present form, it would fundamentally extinguish \nthe torch which the Republican Party has allegedly--and I thought \npretty effectively--carried for years which was the torch of spending \nresponsibility.\n  That is why I came here, as I said when I began my statement. I came \nto try to do something about controlling the rate of growth of spending \nin the Federal Government, especially in the area of entitlements. I \nwas told by one of the finest legislators I have ever met\n\n[[Page S8651]]\n\nin my experience in 20 years in Government--a man named Barber \nConable--one time on the floor of the House when I was mumbling about \nthe fact that some bill was coming through that was a little expensive, \nyou have to understand, Judd, all Government moves to the left, and it \nis just a question of how many engines are on that train--think of it \nas a train--as it moves to the left, and our job as fiscal \nconservatives is to limit the number of engines that go on that train.\n  This bill, if it passes in its present form, is going to be all \nengine, and it is going to undermine our capacity to assure our \nchildren they have the opportunity to have the type of lifestyle which \nwe have, because it is going to put a huge and unfair tax burden on \nthem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, this morning one of the very able \nlegislative assistants who has worked on this legislation for almost 7 \nyears, going back to the time on the Medicare Commission when we first \nstarted doing Medicare reform, was on the floor working with me on \namendments in this legislation. She had to temporarily leave because at \n5:47 this afternoon she had a little baby girl. That is a very good \nexcuse to not be on the Senate floor. But my legislative director, \nSarah Walter, is doing fine. It is a baby girl. The name is yet to be \ndetermined, but I wanted to bring that to the attention of my \ncolleagues and all of her colleagues on the professional staff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That amendment was pulled up last night by the manager of the \nbill, Senator Grassley. I believe that amendment is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The amendment has been \ncalled up and is pending.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my intent within a few moments to \nwithdraw this amendment, but I thought I should speak to it tonight \nbecause I am disappointed at this time that we could not get the \nscoring from CBO we felt would produce a revenue-neutral bill, or a \ncost-neutral bill, going into the final hours of this debate.\n  This is an amendment that produces in this legislation, and hopefully \nto take up in conference, a consumer-driven health care plan under the \nnew MedicareAdvantage program all of us are talking about at this \nmoment. The Senator from New Hampshire gave a very impassioned speech \nfrom the depths of his heart, frustrated that this bill does not \nbalance out and provide enough of the incentives in the market that \nwill offset and create the kind of competitive forces being designed \nfor Medicare with the extension of prescription drugs in it offers.\n  For a few moments tonight, I did want to speak about that and explain \nit. As we get into conference with the House, the House has a consumer-\ndriven health care concept within their legislation that is critical. \nIt is something we ought to address.\n  First, the amendment before the Senate is designed to dovetail with \nand not disturb the overall MedicareAdvantage competitive dynamic. As a \ncomplement to MedicareAdvantage, consumer-driven health care plans \nwould be subject to the same competitive rules as preferred provider \norganizations.\n  Second, I emphasize this amendment is carefully crafted. We thought \nit would ensure budget neutrality. But CBO says tonight, no, and I am \nnot going to be too critical of them; we pushed them very hard in the \nlast good number of days to quickly analyze and bring forth estimates. \nI think they are simply swamped. We will continue to work with them. We \nbelieve what we are offering is budget neutral.\n  Additionally, the Finance Committee chairman, the majority leader, \nand the White House have expressed the kind of support for these \nconcepts in amendments. I appreciate it. As everyone begins to examine \nthis structure, they become increasingly enthusiastic that this could \nbecome a component of the MedicareAdvantage Program.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, let me describe for a moment the \nkey features of this amendment. The amendment establishes a new \ncategory of competition within Medicare Advantage designed to encourage \nparticipation by consumer-driven health plans. These plans would be \nsubject to the same requirements of PPOs in MedicareAdvantage, \nincluding prescription drug benefits and risk adjustment parameters.\n  Consumer-driven health care is one of the fastest growing innovations \nemerging in the employer health insurance market. Already 1.5 million \nAmericans are estimated to be in consumer-driven health care in the \nsummer of 2002, and that number is now growing very rapidly.\n  What is the consumer-driven health care? It harnesses market forces \nin ways similar to medical savings accounts. However, there are some \ndifferences between medical savings accounts and consumer-driven health \ncare plans. For example, enrollees in consumer-driven health care do \nnot have to make contributions to the account. In the private sector, \nthe employer or in my amendment if it were to pass, Medicare makes the \ncontribution to the personal care account. There would be no tax \nconsequence for the senior under this amendment. In other words, it \nwould not be viewed as income. Some in Congress might be familiar with \nthe account because the American Postal Workers Union of the AFL-CIO \nconsumer-driven health care plan is now available. It is in that bundle \nof choices that Federal employees have today to choose from. More and \nmore employees are signing up for this concept.\n  This is what the union Web site states: We believe that people who \nhave more control over how their health care dollars are spent are more \nsatisfied consumers and the APWU health plan consumer-driven option is \ndesigned to give that kind of control.\n  It is the very thing the Senator from New Hampshire was talking \nabout. It is what we ought to be striving for to balance off the \ndifferences and to create the competitive forces within the \nMedicareAdvantage program.\n  Benefits make sense in consumer-driven health care plans. I draw your \nattention to my chart. My amendment is designed to encourage market \nflexibility. The information on this chart is one example of what \nconsumer-driven health care plans can provide. Web site education and \ndecision support is one example. In other words, you can go to the Web \nsite, look at it, make choices and decisions based on the best \navailable information. 100-percent preventive care coverage--the \nvery kind of thing we want in modern medicine today. Preventive \nbenefits keep healthy people healthy instead of making the repairs \nafter the human body breaks down.\n\n  There are no more barriers to necessary care, including annual \nphysicals, mammograms, and preventive services. All are within this \nkind of health care plan. All are available today offered by the postal \nworkers.\n  Patient control of personal care accounts for routine health care \nservices are also included. Unused funds in these accounts then roll \nover into the next year.\n  High deductibles, that is true insurance, to protect against \nfinancial ruin in an acute health care crisis, in other words, \ncatastrophic coverage.\n  A limit on annual out-of-pocket spending is an especially important \nfeature. Traditional Medicare does not have an out-of-pocket limit and \ndrives many seniors into bankruptcy. In other words, it limits \nfinancial risk when it kicks in at a certain point.\n  It includes care coordination, disease management, and provider \nnetwork discounts. Consumer-driven health care gives control of health \ncare back to patients. That is why more and more are enrolling in it. \nWe know today, many who work in the health care area with our seniors \nknow they look at the details of their spending; they look at the \nbilling; they know more about their health care and what is being \ncharged than most people realize. Patients and their physicians, \nultimately, with this kind of insurance, join in partnerships to seek \nthe finest care at the most reasonable costs.\n  Consumer-driven care is especially suited for patients who like to be \npersonally involved in their health care decisions. More and more \nAmericans who can use the necessary information\n\n[[Page S8652]]\n\nwant that kind of personal involvement.\n  Consumer-driven care eliminates wasteful Medicare spending, it \nincreases patient awareness of health care costs, and encourages \nprudent purchasing of health care services. Any unspent funds in the \npersonal care account would be returned to the Medicare trust fund upon \nthe death or the disenrollment. That is a key factor. Federal dollars \ngo into the trust fund and, if there are dollars remaining, they flow \nback into the trust fund of Medicare upon disenrollment or the death of \nthe individual.\n  This amendment would be an important addition to the bill. I wish we \ncould get it into the bill tonight. But it would be unfair to the \nmanager of the bill at this time because it cannot get scored. I would \nnot want to drive the cost up of the already-fixed segment of the \nMedicareAdvantage side. Already, it is less competitive than we would \nlike it to be. I don't want to add to that disadvantage.\n  We believe ultimately that this will be a budget-neutral program. At \nthat time, it will be the right thing to offer as part of the dynamics \nthat we want to see in a modern health care delivery system and in an \nimproved Medicare with a prescription drug program.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. We will return with this when it \nis a final product. It may well make it into the conference between the \nHouse and the Senate. We will be working with our colleagues in the \nHouse because they have already provided that kind of a provision \nwithin the legislation which they are currently debating and voting \nupon.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw amendment No. 1086.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1086) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Since Medicare was established in 1965, people are \nliving longer and living better. Today Medicare covers more than 40 \nmillion Americans, including 35 million over the age of 65 and nearly 6 \nmillion younger adults with permanent disabilities.\n  Congress now has the opportunity to modernize this important Federal \nentity to create a 21st century Medicare Program that offers \ncomprehensive coverage for pharmaceutical drugs and improves the \nMedicare delivery system.\n  The proposal before the Senate would make available a voluntary \nMedicare prescription drug plan for all seniors. If enacted, Medicare \nbeneficiaries have access to a discount card for prescription drug \npurchases starting in 2004. Projected savings from cards for consumers \nwould range between 10 to 25 percent. A $600 subsidy would be applied \nto the card, offering additional assistance for low-income \nbeneficiaries defined as 160 percent or below the Federal poverty \nlevel. Effective January 1, 2006, a new optional Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit would be established under Medicare Part D.\n  This bill has the potential to make a dramatic difference for \nmillions of Americans living with lower incomes and chronic health care \nneeds. Low-income Medicare beneficiaries, who make up 44 percent of all \nMedicare beneficiaries, would be provided with prescription drug \ncoverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs. For these seniors, \ncopayments would not exceed 20 percent of the cost of the drugs.\n  For medical services, Medicare beneficiaries will have the freedom to \nremain in traditional fee-for-service Medicare for drug coverage, or to \nenroll in Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) or Preferred Provider \nOrganizations (PPOs), also called MedicareAdvantage, which offers \nbeneficiaries a wide choice of health care providers, while also \ncoordinating health care effectively, especially for those with \nmultiple chronic conditions. MedicareAdvantage health plans would be \nrequired to offer at least the standard drug benefit, available through \ntraditional fee-for-service Medicare.\n  The legislation which is pending has been worked on, now, for many \nyears. I congratulate the chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, \nand the ranking member, Senator Baucus, for the outstanding work which \nthey have done. This is an extraordinarily complex subject, and it is a \nvery complex bill.\n  We already know that there are many criticisms directed to this bill \nat various levels. Many would like to see the prescription drug program \ncover all of the costs without deductibles and without copays. There \nhas been allocated in our budget plan $400 billion for prescription \ndrug coverage. That is, obviously, a very substantial sum of money. \nThere are a variety of formulas which could be worked out to utilize \nthis funding. The current plan, depending upon levels of income, \nprovides a deductible, then a copay, then what is called a donut hole \nwhere the recipient pays the entire costs of their drug coverage, and \nwhen it gets to a certain high level, it is catastrophic and there is \ncoverage that pays almost all of it.\n  As I have reviewed these projections and these analyses, it is hard \nto say where the line ought to be drawn. It is a value judgment as to \nwhat deductibles ought to be, and for whom, and what the copays ought \nto be and for whom. I am seriously troubled by the so-called donut \nhole. But it is calculated to encourage people to take the medical care \nthey really need, and at lower levels of income to have certain copays, \nwhich it is projected will be affordable. Then, when the costs move \ninto the so-called catastrophic range, to have the plan pay for nearly \nall of the medical costs.\n  I think passage by the Senate would be a significant step forward. \nThe House of Representatives, as usual, has a different plan--as is \ncustomary, with our bicameral legislative approach. Then the bill can \nbe improved in conference.\n  The legislative process has the committee turning out a bill, and \nthen many amendments, which generally are not known to Members in \nadvance of brief debate and then votes. It is in the conference, after \nthe bill is analyzed, that another fresh look is taken at the bill to \nproduce the best legislative product in the public interest.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 983\n\n  I have already offered an amendment relating to end of life \ndirectives, number 983, which was adopted by unanimous consent.\n  Commenting on it very briefly, we find statistically that nearly 30 \npercent of Medicare expenditures occur during a person's last year of \nlife. We find, beyond the last year of life, a tremendous percentage of \nmedical costs occur in the last month, in the last few weeks, in the \nlast week, or in the last few days.\n  Nobody should decide for anybody else what that person should have by \nway of end-of-life medical care. What care ought to be available is a \nvery personal decision.\n\n  The living wills would give an individual an opportunity to make that \njudgment, to make a decision as to how much care he or she wanted near \nthe end of his or her life and that is, to repeat, a matter highly \npersonalized for the individual.\n  But if that decision was made to eliminate some of the very high \ncosts at the very end of life, there would obviously be substantial \nsavings to our medical system. As long as that comports with the will \nof the individual, that is something which ought to be considered.\n  The amendment directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ninclude in its annual ``Medicare And You'' handbook, to be provided to \neach beneficiary, a section that specifies information on advanced \ndirectives and details on living wills, durable powers of attorney for \nhealth care, and directs the Secretary of HHS, in the introductory \nletter to the ``Medicare And You'' handbook, to reference the inclusion \nof advanced directives.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1085\n\n  I have also submitted an amendment which is pending at the desk, \namendment No. 1085, which has not yet been acted upon but which I will \ncall up at an appropriate time.\n  This is an amendment which would update the Medicare physician fee \nformula. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The projections from \nthe Medicare payment formula called for a 4.4-percent reduction on \nMarch 1, which would have been very problematic. The fact is, the \nCenter for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, now projects a Medicare \nconversion factor figure of 4.2 percent will be projected for the year \n2004. This reduction threatens to destabilize an important element of \nthe\n\n[[Page S8653]]\n\nMedicare Program; namely, physician participation and willingness to \naccept Medicare payments. This instability is a result of the \nsustainable growth rate, a system of annual spending which targets \nphysicians' services under Medicare.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate amendment would provide that the conferees \non Medicare reform and prescription drug legislation should include in \nthe conference agreement a provision to establish a minimum percentage \nupdate in physician fees for the next 2 years, and should consider \nadding provisions which would mitigate the swings in payment, such as \nestablishing multiyear adjustments to recoup the variance and creating \ntolerance corridors for variations around the updated target trend.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1118\n\n  I have also submitted an amendment designated as amendment No. 1118, \nwhich provides for a lifestyle modification program demonstration. This \nis projected on the factor that heart disease kills some 500,000 \nAmericans each year. The costs of coronary disease currently relate to \nan expenditure of some $58 billion annually. There has been a test \nprogram of the Medicare lifestyle modification program operating in \nsome 12 States which has been demonstrated to reduce the need for \ncoronary procedures by 88 percent. This program could reduce \ncardiovascular expenditures by as much as $36 billion annually.\n  Lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise affect heart disease and \nheart disease outcomes by 50 percent or greater. This program has also \nbeen applied to men with prostate cancer, who have shown significant \nimprovements in prostate cancer markers using a similar approach in \nlifestyle modifications. My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate \nthat the Secretary of Health and Human Services should carry out the \nlifestyle modification program demonstration at the national level and \nthen provide it on a permanent basis, and include as many Medicare \nbeneficiaries as would like to participate in the project on a \nvoluntary basis.\n  I have submitted one additional amendment, which is No. 1128 and \nwhich relates to State pharmaceutical assistance programs for the \nelderly and disabled. Currently, 18 States have comprehensive pharmacy \nassistance programs which provide prescription drug coverage for more \nthan 1.1 million older and disabled Americans.\n  In my own State, Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract \nfor the Elderly, known as PACE, established in 1984 provides \nprescription drug coverage to 230,000 Medicare beneficiaries, the vast \nmajority of whom have incomes below 160 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. This enrollment is comprised largely of 70- and 80-year-old \nwidows who have multiple diseases and limited educational background \nwho have been enrolled in the PACE program for more than a decade.\n  There is a serious concern that if there is not a coordinated \nprogram, people will not be informed as to how to move from PACE to \nanother program. This affects not only Pennsylvania but, as I stated, \n17 other States.\n  The pending bill does not provide for coordination of benefits \nbetween State pharmaceutical programs and private insurers. Without a \ncoordination of benefits for State plans to facilitate enrollment in \nprivate plans, many of these State program beneficiaries will be unable \nto assess the new Medicare drug benefit.\n  This amendment provides for coordination of benefits between States \nand private insurance companies and facilitates the enrollment of State \npharmacy assistance beneficiaries in the private plans. Without this \namendment, the majority of seniors enrolled in their State pharmacy \nprograms will not be able to effectively access private plans.\n  I note the presence of other Senators who are seeking recognition. I \nattempted to be brief in my general statement about the bill and also \nin my descriptions of these four amendments, one of which has already \nbeen adopted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, there \nbe printed in the Record a summary of the end-of-life directive \namendment, a summary of the updating of the Medicare physician fee \nformula, a summary of the lifestyle modification program, and a summary \nof the State pharmaceutical assistance programs for the elderly and \ndisabled, and also printed in the Record at this point the amendments \nthemselves.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Summary on the End of Life Directive Amendment\n\n       The purpose of this amendment is to make it easier for \n     individuals to make their own choices regarding their \n     treatment when nearing the end of their life.\n       A health care advance directive is a document where a \n     beneficiary gives instructions about their health care if, in \n     the future, that beneficiary cannot speak for him or herself. \n     The beneficiary can give someone they name (``agent'' or \n     ``proxy'') the power to make health care decisions on their \n     behalf. They may also give instructions about the kind of \n     health care they do or do not want.\n       In a traditional Living Will, a beneficiary would state \n     their wishes about life-sustaining medical treatments if he \n     or she is terminally ill. In a Health Care Power of Attorney, \n     one appoints someone else to make medical treatment decisions \n     for the beneficiary if they cannot make them on their own.\n       Unlike most Living Wills, a Health Care Advance Directive \n     is not limited to cases of terminal illness. If the \n     beneficiary cannot make or communicate decisions because of a \n     temporary or permanent illness or injury, a Health Care \n     Advance Directive helps them keep control over important \n     health care decisions.\n       Observers have long noted that individuals incur the \n     majority of health care costs in the last few months of life. \n     Nearly 30 percent of Medicare expenditures occur during a \n     person's last year of life.\n       Your amendment directs the Secretary of HHS to include in \n     its annual ``Medicare and You'' handbook, which is provided \n     to each beneficiary, a section that provides information on \n     advanced directives and details on living wills and durable \n     power of attorney for health care; and directs the Secretary \n     of HHS, in the introductory letter to the ``Medicare and \n     You'' handbook, to reference the inclusion of advanced \n     directives information.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Summary on the Amendment to Update the Medicare Physician Fee Formula\n\n       Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation as part of \n     the Fiscal Year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill (H.J. Res. \n     2) that avoided an impending 4.4 percent cut in the Medicare \n     conversion factor. Although this change resulted in a \n     welcomed 1.6 percent increase in the Medicare conversion \n     factor for 2003, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \n     Services' (CMS) preliminary Medicare conversion factor figure \n     predicts a 4.2 percent reduction for 2004.\n       It is clear that this scheduled 4.2 percent reduction in \n     the physician reimbursement formula threatens to destabilize \n     an important element of the Medicare program, namely \n     physician participation and willingness to accept Medicare \n     patients.\n       The primary source of this instability is the sustainable \n     growth rate (SGR), a system of annual spending targets for \n     physicians' services under Medicare.\n       The sustainable growh rate (SGR) system has a number of \n     defects that result in unrealistically low spending targets, \n     such as the use of the increase in the gross domestic product \n     (GDP) as a proxy for increases in the volume and intensity of \n     services provided by physicians, no tolerance for variance \n     between growth in Medicare beneficiary health care costs and \n     our Nation's GDP, and a requirement for the immediate \n     recoupment of the difference.\n       Both administrative and legislative action are needed to \n     return stability to the Medicare physician payment system.\n       In its March 2003 report, the Medicare Payment Advisory \n     Commission (MedPAC) stated that if ``Congress does not change \n     current law, then payments may not be adequate in 2003 and a \n     compensating adjustment in payments would be necessary in \n     2004.''\n       With 17 percent of its population eligible for Medicare, \n     the Pennsylvania Medical Society has calculated that \n     Pennsylvania's physicians have already suffered a $128.6 \n     million loss, or $4,074 per physician, as a result of the \n     2002 Medicare payment reduction. If not corrected, the flawed \n     formula will cost Pennsylvania physicians another $553 \n     million or $17,396 per physician for the period 2003-2005.\n       Your amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the \n     conferees on Medicare reform and prescription drug \n     legislation should include in the conference agreement a \n     provision to establish a minimum percentage update in \n     physician fees for the next 2 years and should consider \n     adding provisions that would mitigate the swings in payment, \n     such as establishing multi-year adjustments to recoup the \n     variance and creating ``tolerance'' corridors for variations \n     around the update target trend.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Summary of the Amendment on the Lifestyle Modification Program\n\n       Heart disease kills more than 500,000 Americans per year. \n     The number and costs of interventions for the treatment of \n     coronary disease are rising and currently cost the health \n     care system $58 billion annually.\n\n[[Page S8654]]\n\n       The Medicare Lifestyle Modification Program (also known as \n     the Dean Ornish Program for Reversing Heart Disease) has been \n     operating throughout 12 states and has been demonstrated to \n     reduce the need for coronary procedures by 88 percent per \n     year.\n       The Medicare Lifestyle Modification Program is less \n     expensive to deliver than interventional cardiac procedures \n     and could reduce cardiovascular expenditures by $36 billion \n     annually.\n       Lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise effect heart \n     disease and heart disease outcomes by 50 percent or greater.\n       Intensive lifestyle interventions which include teams of \n     nurses, doctors, exercise physiologists, registered \n     dieticians, and behavioral health clinicians have been \n     demonstrated to reduce heart disease risk factors and enhance \n     heart disease outcomes dramatically.\n       The National Institutes of Health estimates that 17 million \n     Americans have diabetes and the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention estimates that the number of Americans who \n     have a diagnosis of diabetes increased 61 percent in the last \n     decade and is expected to more than double by 2050.\n       Lifestyle modification programs are superior to medication \n     therapy for treating diabetes. Individuals with diabetes are \n     now considered to have coronary disease at the date of \n     diagnosis of their diabetic state.\n       The Medicare Lifestyle Modification Program has been an \n     effective lifestyle program for the reversal and treatment of \n     heart disease.\n       Men with prostate cancer have shown significant improvement \n     in prostate cancer markers using a similar approach in \n     lifestyle modification. These lifestyle changes are therefore \n     likely to affect other chronic disease states, in addition to \n     heart disease.\n       Your amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services should carry out the \n     Lifestyle Modification Program Demonstration at the national \n     level on a permanent basis and include as many medicare \n     beneficiaries as would like to participate in the project on \n     a voluntary basis.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Summary of the Amendment on State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs \n                      for the Elderly and Disabled\n\n       Currently, 18 states have comprehensive pharmacy assistance \n     programs that provide prescription drug coverage to more than \n     1.1 million older and disabled residents.\n       The majority of these beneficiaries receive life saving \n     medications to treat high blood pressure, heart disease, \n     arthritis, diabetes, and eye disease.\n       Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the \n     Elderly (PACE), established in 1984, provides prescription \n     drug coverage to 230,000 Medicare beneficiaries, the vast \n     majority of whom have incomes below 160% of the federal \n     poverty level. This enrollment is comprised largely of 70 and \n     80-year-old widows who have multiple disease states, and less \n     than a tenth grade education, and have been enrolled in PACE \n     for more than a decade.\n       Currently, the pending bill the Senate does not provide for \n     `coordination of benefits', between state pharmaceutical \n     programs and private insurers.

I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia be recognized to speak on the \nbill for up to 20 minutes and that following his statement, the Senator \nfrom Florida, Mr. Graham, be recognized for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic whip \nfor his thoughtfulness and courtesies.\n  Mr. President, just last month we celebrated Older Americans Month, a \ntime of reflect on the contribution of older Americans to our society--\nto their families, their communities, and their Nation. For many \nseniors, these ``golden years'' are the most valuable time in their \nlives, a time when they may no longer have the day-to-day aggravations \nof work, and can concentrate their time and efforts on something else--\ngrandchildren, lifelong passions, learning new skills, acquiring \nknowledge, or participating in creative endeavors.\n  But that is not the case for many seniors. In too many instances, \nseniors who have worked and saved a lifetime find that today's cost of \nliving far exceeds the level they can afford. Despite planning and \nfrugality, today's costs simply have exceeded the means of many older \nAmericans, and they find that the visions of the secure life they had \nexpected post-retirement are now more a nightmare than a dream.\n  A big part of the problem is the value that our society places on the \nelderly--it is much too low!\n  Age discrimination is all too prevalent in the workplace. Long-held \nstereotypes--that seniors are slow, forgetful, less competent than \ntheir younger counterparts--limit opportunities for older workers and \nprevent businesses from benefiting from well-honed talents. Those \nstereotypical images are just plain wrong.\n  To be 65 today is not like it was to be 65 when I was a young man. \nThe idea of pushing senior citizens out of the door to make room for \nyounger workers is, itself, antiquated.\n  I grew up during the Great Depression when one had to work hard just \nto get a job and then work even harder to keep it. People of my \ngeneration, the generation Tom Brokaw has referred to as ``The Greatest \nGeneration''--I kind of like that term, ``The Greatest Generation,'' \nalthough I don't quite agree with it.\n  Seniors in the workforce can be a positive and inspiring force.\n  The reason I don't agree with it is that I think the greatest \ngeneration was that generation that produced the Constitution of the \nUnited States and produced this constitutional system of government \nthat we have today. We will talk more about that on a later day.\n  I grew up during the Great Depression when one had to work hard, as I \nsay, just to get a job and then work harder to keep it. People of my \ngeneration, coming from that experience, developed a work ethic which \ncan inspire young people today. Seniors in the workforce can be a \npositive, inspiring force. Moreover, better health care and healthier \nlifestyles have extended lifespans and led to a senior population with \nvigor and vitality.\n  But when the health of seniors does decline, this Nation does an \nembarrassingly poor job of dealing with their needs. Child care has \nbecome a booming business in this Nation. Millions are spent on bigger, \nbrighter, better child care centers--lively places, filled with happy \nactivities and stimulation. That is as it should be. But when the \nelderly need daily care, too often they are relegated to dim, \novercrowded centers, places that serve as little more than warehouses \nthat provide busy work for the hands, and little to fill the heart and \nsoul.\n  Inestimable numbers of scam artists focus on the elderly. The offices \nof Attorney Generals across the nation are besieged with complaints \nfrom seniors who were prey for some con artists and ended up losing \ntheir life savings. Newspapers carry stories about CEOs of big, once-\nprofitable companies who are awarded big bonuses, while the pensions of \nloyal retirees are squeezed. When this is how we treat our seniors, \nsomething is wrong with America.\n  Older citizens should rejoice in their long lives, in their collected \nexperiences, and in their accomplishments. But in America today, \nmagazines showcase images of young, vibrant models. Movies and \ntelevision shows feature youthful actors and actresses. No one wants to \nbe ``old'' anymore. It has become a tarnished word.\n  Older citizens today are generally not appreciated as either \nexperienced ``elders'' or possessors of special wisdom. Older people \nare respected only to the extent that they remain capable of working, \nexercising, and taking care of themselves. In American culture, \nincreasing age seems to portend decreasing value as a human being. It \nshould be just the opposite.\n  How did the American culture develop such blatant disregard and \ndisrespect for the elderly? Well, however we got to such a point, we \nare definitely here.\n  Senior citizens need to rise up and make their voices heard or else \nthey will be forgotten, especially when it comes to policy formation \nthat directly affects them, such as Medicare legislation before us \ntoday. The Senate is in the midst of an important debate on a major \nrestructuring of Medicare--a debate that will shape the health care \nchoices of millions of our Nation's senior citizen for years to come.\n  The Medicare program is in desperate need of renovation to meet the \nneeds of today'a older citizens living in a new era with dramatic \nadvancements in the delivery of health care. Medicare was designed to \nprovide health care benefits to the most vulnerable segments of the \npopulation, the elderly and the disabled.\n  When I voted, way back in 1965, to establish the Medicare program, \npharmaceutical treatments, then more of footnote in health care, were \nnot nearly as commonly available as they are now.\n\n[[Page S8656]]\n\nToday, they are a primary form of medical care and often substitute for \nmore costly treatments like hospitalization and surgery.\n  Today, 40 million Americans rely on Medicare to help provide for \ntheir medical needs. With more than one-third of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries lacking insurance coverage for the cost of needed \nmedications, finding affordable prescription drug coverage is a \ncritical issue for our Nation's seniors. Prescription drugs are an \nessential tool for treating and preventing many acute and chronic \nconditions, but Medicare fails to cover them on an outpatient basis. \nToo many seniors and disabled persons in this country, especially those \nliving on fixed incomes, are forced to choose each month between paying \nfor food and paying for shelter, or buying the essential medicines that \ntheir doctors have prescribed.\n\n  Our Nation's senior citizens are losing their patience. They are \nlosing their dignity. And they are fed up with fast-rising drug costs \nthat they cannot afford. Older citizens should not have to travel in \nbus loads to Canada and Mexico just to obtain the medications their \ndoctors prescribe. What does it say about this country and its values \nwhen we fail to take care of our elderly citizens whose lifetime of \nwork and sacrifice and dedication and industry helped to endow this \ncountry with the greatness it now enjoys?\n  Mr. President, I fear that the legislation before us today is a \nglaring example of how this Nation shortchanges our senior citizens. We \nare not taking care of our elderly citizens as they wrestle with the \nmost serious issue in their lives. We are offering a partial fix to \nassuage senior anger. This bill fails to go far enough to meet the \nneeds of our Nation's senior citizens. I am concerned that this measure \nwould force Medicare beneficiaries to rely on a private, untried, \nuntested, drug-only insurance market for their prescription drug \ncoverage, rather than the traditional Medicare program that they know \nand trust. We split drug benefit off from Medicare?\n  I am concerned that this administration and some Members of Congress \nplan to phase out the traditional Medicare program as an option for new \nbeneficiaries in the future. Some people have asserted that this \nlegislation is merely a Trojan horse designed to get rid of Medicare. I \nsincerely hope that this is not the case, but there is something very \nsuspicious about this particular horse.\n  I am worried that we may be endorsing the slow suicide of one of the \nmost popular and effective Government programs in history. I have been \ndown this tortured road before during my 50-year tenure in Congress. My \nconstituents and others around the Nation are reeling from public \nprograms that have been turned over to the so-called free market. \nUtility rates, cable rates, airline rates, you name it, the free market \nhas ensured exorbitant prices with diminished service, especially for \nrural areas such as West Virginia. Pensions and retirement security \nhave taken a similar beating.\n  The Medicare program, for which I voted in 1965, was originally \ncreated because the private sector did not offer affordable and \nreliable health insurance to the elderly and the disabled. Health care \nhas certainly changed in the past 38 years, but what has not changed is \nthe fact that the private market does not want to insure people who are \nold or disabled or likely to need care. Mr. President, what is the \nrationale for inventing some new hocus-pocus type of plan that exposes \nsenior citizens to the whims of private insurance companies which may \nbe more interested in profits than in providing comprehensive drug \nbenefits?\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation, as currently designed, does not even \nprovide sufficient prescription drug coverage. It would cover less than \na quarter of Medicare beneficiaries' estimated drug costs over the next \n10 years, and the complicated coverage formula has a large donut hole \nproviding zero coverage just when seniors might need it most.\n  This legislation also includes copayments, premiums, and deductibles \nthat may be unaffordable for man low- and middle-income seniors. The \n$35-per-month premium, the 50-percent copay, the $275 annual \ndeductible, and the $5,800 stop-loss amount that we have heard so much \nabout are only suggested amounts and certainly not a guarantee. A \ncloser look at the fine print of this legislation reveals that private \ninsurers could choose to charge senior citizens double or even triple \nthese amounts.\n  Let's fact it, the kind of prescription drug benefit that we have \nrepeatedly promised our Nation's elderly citizens, and that they now \nrightly expect, would cost at least $800 billion over the next decade. \nYet the administration and congressional Republicans have only \nallocated $400 billion for the next 10 years for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. And during this same period, drug costs for \nsenior citizens alone, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nare expected to total almost $2 trillion.\n  One of the primary reasons this legislation contains such glaring \ndeficiencies in the drug benefits being offered to seniors is not \ndifficult to understand--this administration and Congress have chosen \nto make tax cuts a higher priority than prescription drugs for senior \ncitizens. Since the Federal Treasury has already been raided, there is \nnot enough money to adequately cover prescription drugs. Senior \ncitizens ought to be outraged--outraged. Senior citizens ought to be \noutraged. I am a senior citizen, and I represent a State with a lot of \nsenior citizens, and I am outraged! I am outraged!\n  What is the rationale for waiting until 2006--conveniently right \nafter the next election cycle--to implement this legislation? Why wait? \nWhat are we so afraid of? We had Medicare up and running less than 12 \nmonths after creating it from scratch in 1965. So why can't we do it \nnow? Mr. President, it seems that this Congress is trying to pull the \nwool over the eyes of our Nation's senior citizens--hoping to claim \nvictory and keep senior citizens in the dark until they become \npainfully aware of the fine print--the fine print--of this legislation \nupon a visit to their local pharmacist in 2006.\n  Mr. President, this legislation, as it stands, does not provide the \nreal, guaranteed, defined benefit that our senior citizens desperately \nneed and does little to address the high cost of prescription drugs. I \nhad hoped we could improve this legislation through the amendment \nprocess, but that does not appear to be the will of this Senate in the \nmad dash--the mad dash--to reach final passage before the recess. We \nshould do better for our older citizens. We owe them so much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, this is a sad evening for me. I \nrise to oppose the prescription drug bill that we will be voting on \nshortly. No issue that we have debated over recent years has held so \nmuch promise, the promise that we could fundamentally reform Medicare \nfrom a program which today requires you to be sick enough to go to the \ndoctor or the hospital in order to get services to one that would have \nits focus on wellness, including the opportunity to participate in a \nvoluntary, comprehensive, universal, and affordable plan of \nprescription drugs.\n  Prescription drugs are, in today's health care system, a fundamental \npart of maintaining good health. I have spent the better part of the \nlast 5 years, as have so many of my colleagues--and in the case of \nSenator Byrd, many more than 5 years--attempting to deliver a \nmeaningful drug benefit for our Nation's seniors. I have learned some \nthings during this period. Unfortunately, what I have learned convinces \nme that the bill before us tonight is not worthy of America's seniors. \nBecause what we are about to deliver is a hollow promise and little \nelse.\n  Why do I believe this? Why have I come to the conclusion that this \nproposal is not worthy of using all of the years of enthusiasm and \ncommitment of America's seniors and many of those such as myself who \nrepresent a substantial number of those seniors? Why do we feel that \nthis path is not acceptable?\n  First, there are gaps in the benefit which are too large to overcome. \nI could not go home to Florida or to any other place in America and \ntell people that this legislation is a good deal. This is especially \nthe case for those with large out-of-pocket expenses. How do we tell a \nsenior who halfway through the first year in which this\n\n[[Page S8657]]\n\nwill be available, 2006, their drug costs will double but they will \ncontinue to pay the monthly premiums?\n  That would be analogous to car insurance which says: You will be \ncovered in case you have an accident from January to August but if you \nhave one from September to December it is out of your pocket. Who would \nbuy that automobile coverage?\n  The worst thing is that millions of seniors will never realize they \nhave bought in to such an inadequate policy until it is too late.\n  Second, this bill does not provide a universal drug benefit. Under \nthis plan, for instance, if you are a Medicare beneficiary but you are \nalso poor, you will not get the prescription drug benefits for \nMedicare. That is right. Seniors at 74 percent or below the poverty \nlevel would be excluded from the Medicare benefit. They would get their \nprescription drugs through Medicaid. This is a clear effort for the \nFederal Government to unload a substantial part of its prescription \ndrug expenses on the States, States which are already struggling with \nserious financial problems.\n  It is for that reason that the National Governors Association has \nopposed this design saying:\n\n       It is not good health policy. It is not good precedent.\n\n  The argument is made that this is all we can do. We cannot do better \nbecause we do not have the resources to do better. This is analogous to \nthe child who just has shot his mother and his father and now throws \nhimself on the mercy of the court claiming to be an orphan. We have \nmade the decision to be in the financial status that we are, and \nthe consequence of that decision, as we debated a few weeks ago when we \nadopted the Senate's budget for the year, is that we are going to have \nto have an unnecessarily and unacceptably low level of financial \nsupport for a meaningful prescription drug benefit.\n\n  Third, this plan will cost many seniors more than they can afford. \nFrom repeated surveys, seniors have stated that they need a plan with \nno deductible so that coverage starts from the first prescription. And \nthey need a premium of no more than $25 a month. Yet the sponsors of \nthis bill suggest a $275 deductible and an average premium of $35 per \nmonth, an average premium which could actually be higher because the \nprivate insurance companies will determine the level of the premium. \nYou can look through the over 600 pages of this bill and not find the \nnumber $35. That is a hope number but the actual number will be \ndetermined by the private insurance carriers.\n  Fourth, this bill would subject millions of America's seniors to a \ngiant experiment, a giant experiment in delivering prescription drugs \nthrough an untested delivery system, a system which is unheard of in \nthe private markets. It is stated that this system will be justified \nbecause it will be efficient and will use the power of competition to \nsuppress cost. If this was such a good system, why don't we provide it \nfor all Federal employees so they can get, we as Federal employees can \nget, the benefit of this greater efficiency and cost savings? The \nreason is because insuring drugs only is not an actuarially sustainable \nrisk. It has been analogized to buying a fire insurance policy just to \ncover the kitchen. No insurance company is going to sell you a policy \nfor the most vulnerable area of your house to actually experience a \nfire.\n  That is why no private insurance plan is available today which will \nprovide you a prescription-only coverage. That is the equivalent of the \nkitchen in terms of its intensity and potential for explosion of cost \nwithin health care. Yet we are about to say that some 40 million of the \nmost vulnerable and frail Americans are going to be the experiment for \nthis ideology.\n  I have said it before and I will say it again: There is simply no \nreason to subject our Nation's seniors to this grand experiment, \nparticularly when we already know what works. There is no reason to \npump extra dollars into private insurance plans.\n  A few hours ago we adopted an amendment which will pump in $6 billion \nfor additional benefits to HMOs. Those $6 billion could have been used \nto reduce the monthly premium, to close part of the gap of coverage. \nBut what did we decide to do? We are going to give it to the HMOs so \nthe Federal Government will be assuming more of the risk of coverage as \nopposed to these plans whose reason for being is to assume the risk \nand, therefore, have the incentive to provide the most efficient plans.\n  We are begging these HMOs to participate in the Medicare Program for \nthe sake of a private sector veneer, for the sake of an ideology \nuntested. We actually tried a version of this before. Guess what. It \ndidn't work. I speak from experience. Medicare HMOs have dumped \nhundreds of thousands of Floridians from their rolls as they have in \nvirtually every other State, and more are being dumped each day. But \nthis Congress, rather than look to the reality of past experience, has \ndetermined to embark on this collision course at the expense of seniors \nand at the expense of common sense.\n  Fifth, I fear that we will have difficulty in convincing healthier \nseniors to sign up for this prescription drug benefit. As it is with \nvirtually all insurance plans, it is critical that there be a mixture \nof those who have the greater likelihood of experiencing the risk with \nthose who have the lesser likelihood in order to create an actuarially \nsound balance.\n  One-third of our seniors would not break even under this legislation. \nThat is, one-third of seniors with drug spending of less than $1,135 \nper year would get no benefit should they voluntarily sign up for this \nplan. Therefore, how do we induce them to do so? One of the ways that \nwe had induced them in the past was to have a meaningful catastrophic \ncare provision, so that seniors who, today, are relatively healthy are \ninsuring themselves against the risk that they might have a disease or \nan accident that would put them into much higher prescription drug \ncosts.\n  Last year we determined that the level necessary to induce a large \nenough number of healthy seniors to participate was $4,000 in an annual \ndrug expenditure, and if their previous employer made a contribution, \nthat would be counted toward that $4,000. This bill increases the level \nat which a person would be eligible for catastrophic care to $5,800, \nand employer contributions would be excluded. This new level is \nsignificantly less of an inducement for healthy seniors to participate, \nand the effect is likely to be disappointing levels of participation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of today's front \npage article ``For Struggling Seniors, Medicare Drug Plan's Proof Is in \nthe Purse'' from the Washington Post be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. The reporter interviewed active, healthy \nseniors at centers in Cleveland, OH, and they were skeptical of the \ncost of the benefits that would be offered under this bill.\n  Sixth, the fact that this bill doesn't take effect until 2006 is \nanother brutal hoax on seniors, truly an abusive, shameful, misleading \nploy.\n  The fact is, many of those who most need prescription drug coverage \ntoday simply will not live long enough to get any benefits under this \nplan. As much as I have wanted to vote for a drug bill, for those \nreasons, I simply cannot vote for the one before us this evening.\n  We have lost our focus. The focus should be on the Medicare Program \nin reform and how to help our 40 million seniors and disabled persons. \nInstead, the focus is everywhere else--insurance companies, drug \ncompanies, and hiding the flaws which ought to be exposed.\n  This focus is often presented as the issue of choice. Choice has \ndifferent meanings. For the idealog, choice means a choice among \ndelivery systems. But for seniors, choice means doctors, hospitals, \nand, hopefully, prescription drugs. Yes, this gives seniors a choice \namong delivery systems. For instance, if you are one of the 89 percent \nof seniors in a fee-for-service Medicare Program, you will get a choice \nof between two or more prescription drug plans. If that fails, you will \nthen drop back into traditional Medicare.\n  The Stabenow amendment, which was defeated earlier in the debate, \nwould have given seniors at least real choice between a prescription \ndrug delivery system and fee-for-service Medicare as the delivery \nsystem.\n  The tragedy is that we know what we ought to be doing. What we ought \nto be doing is building on the strengths of\n\n[[Page S8658]]\n\nour current Medicare system--one of the most popular health care \nprograms in this Nation's history. We also ought to be seeing that we \nhave a plan that is affordable and comprehensive.\n  I think the dye is cast and this bill is likely to pass the Senate. I \nwill be hopeful that in conference it will improve but I think there is \nevery likelihood to suspect that it will get worse. It will be my \nintention to introduce legislation that will correct the flaws of this \nlegislation which, among other things, will provide for a patients' \nbill of rights, so that as we herd more seniors into HMOs, at least \nthey will know the standards by which they will be asked to operate \nwithin that.\n  We are beginning to hear the first rumblings of dissent. Today's \nMiami Herald looked at the legislation before the two Houses and this \nis what they had to say:\n\n       House and Senate bills attempting to offer prescription \n     drug cost relief to Medicare seniors can be summed up with \n     the movie title, Dumb and Dumber.\n       Both bills promise dubious benefits without providing the \n     security that seniors want and have, with traditional \n     Medicare health coverage.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that editorial be printed in \nthe Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Medicare has served our seniors superbly. And \nwhere it has not, as in the area of prescription drugs, it has been \nbecause Congress has not allowed it to do so.\n  I hope when this bill comes back from conference, it will be better \nbut I doubt that will be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I will vote no today in the \nhopes that soon we will have an opportunity to pass a prescription drug \nbill that will fully meet the needs and expectations of older \nAmericans.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From The Washington Post, June 26, 2003]\n\n   For Struggling Seniors, Medicare Drug Plan's Proof Is in the Purse\n\n                           (By Ceci Connolly)\n\n       CLEVELAND--As the Medicare drug package moving through \n     Congress takes on an air of inevitability, Washington \n     politicians are already jostling for credit. But in this \n     working-class city 370 miles from Capitol Hill, prospects for \n     the plan's eventual success may lie deep inside the handbags \n     of women such as Marie A. Urban.\n       Stashed in there are her monthly Social Security statement, \n     a half-dozen prescription discount cards and insurance \n     letters rejecting several recent medical claims. The scraps \n     of paper--creased and scribbled on--document a life near the \n     financial edge.\n       After working 24 years as the secretary at St. Paul's \n     Shrine, Urban, 72 collects $843.70 a month in Social \n     Security. After housing and Medicare payments, she has $459 \n     for utilities, food, car insurance, taxes and medication. \n     ``Some months I have 87 cents to live on,'' she said. With \n     her drug bills this year already exceeding $1,500, she said \n     she probably will try to cobble together the money to buy the \n     prescription coverage that lawmakers plan to offer Medicare \n     recipients.\n       ``I don't know,'' she said. ``My finances right now are \n     very tight. I guess I'd have to go with it.''\n       In interviews at two senior centers here, Urban and other \n     retirees expressed deeply mixed feelings about the voluntary \n     prescription drug benefit scheduled for votes in Congress as \n     early as today. They exhibited a visceral distrust of \n     Washington, voicing skepticism that elected officials would \n     deliver a package that fits their health needs and budgetary \n     constraints--in time for them to use it. They were \n     disappointed that in most cases, benefits would not begin \n     until a person spent nearly $1,000 a year on prescription \n     drugs. And they were annoyed--but not totally surprised--that \n     the program would not begin until 2006.\n       ``They've been kicking this ball around for a while,'' said \n     Carrie Adams, 66. ``If they wanted to solve this, they would. \n     The people with the ball are not relating to the people out \n     here.''\n       Ruby Bogus, 83, was a bit more sanguine. ``We just have to \n     live longer, girls,'' she said.\n       Both the House and Senate plans would require seniors to \n     pay about $35 in monthly premiums and an annual deductible of \n     $250 to $275 before receiving any subsidy. The Senate plan \n     would cover half of a person's annual drug expenditures \n     between $276 and $4,500. The recipient would pay the next \n     $1,300 in prescription costs. If the person's total drug \n     costs rose above $5,800 in a year, subsidies would resume.\n       The House bill would offer retirees an 80 percent subsidy \n     on drug bills between $251 and $2,000 and no coverage for the \n     next $1,500 worth of medications. The ``catastrophic \n     coverage'' would begin when costs reached $3,501.\n       Asked whether either plan was attractive, Emily Eckert \n     pulled a tiny notebook from her purse. It listed her daily \n     medications: two pills to control sugar, one for high blood \n     pressure, another to regulate potassium. Using her People's \n     Drug Mart discount card--also tucked in her pocketbook--\n     Eckert spends about $100 a month on prescriptions, plus $22 \n     for diabetes test strips.\n       At 79, she has outlived two husbands, but at a high cost. \n     Caring for her first husband, who had cancer, and the second, \n     who had diabetes, wiped out $7,000 in savings and two life \n     insurance policies valued at $3,000. Eckert has been in \n     bankruptcy and worries about helping her three children, 10 \n     grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.\n       ``If it wasn't for this center, I'd be starving,'' she \n     said, referring to the Senior Citizens Resources facility in \n     the Old Brooklyn neighborhood. She wants to buy the drug \n     coverage proposed for Medicare but isn't certain she will be \n     able to pay the premiums.\n       The situations of Marie Urban and Emily Eckert may sound \n     dire, but in many respects they are typical for the millions \n     of senior citizens and disabled people who rely on Medicare \n     for their health care. Not poor enough to qualify for \n     Medicaid, yet not fortunate enough to have substantial \n     savings or a lucrative retirement package, such people have \n     clamored for years for help with the rising cost of \n     medication.\n       Assuming the House and Senate pass their spending bills and \n     then resolve their differences, Congress hopes to answer \n     those demands by spending nearly $400 billion on drug \n     coverage over 10 years. The legislation would mark the \n     largest Medicare expansion in the program's 38-year history \n     and could provide a political boost to President Bush and \n     fellow Republicans who campaigned on the promise of \n     alleviating drug costs.\n       However, as the conversations in Cleveland illustrated, \n     many older Americans are watching with guarded optimism and \n     could revolt if the final package fails to meet expectations. \n     That would dash Republicans' hopes of taking away an issue \n     that has been mostly associated with Democrats for decades.\n       Their elderly residents' fundamental question is whether \n     they would save money under the new plans. The answer isn't \n     easy.\n       Urban is torn. Most years she spends about $800 on \n     medicine, so a benefit that does not begin paying off until \n     after $1,000 in out-of-pocket spending looks like a money \n     loser for her. But this year, a mysterious infection and \n     several hospitalizations pushed her drug bills to $1,500, and \n     the federally subsidized insurance would have saved her \n     money. Urban drives 30 minutes to several pharmacies in the \n     Cleveland suburbs to shop for the best deals. She gets \n     agitated thinking about the complex math of the new proposal.\n       Howard Bram, 77, also complained about the complexity of a \n     program that will involve choosing a plan, tracking out-of-\n     pocket expenses and knowing when the coverage kicks in, \n     lapses and then resumes in severe cases, all according to a \n     sliding scale of benefits.\n       ``It's just gonna blow their minds,'' he said. Bram is \n     trying to figure out whether the drug plan would put a \n     significant dent in the cost of the eight medications he \n     takes.\n       Carrie Adams and Jean Nagorski are precisely the sort of \n     customer-patients that Medicare will need--comparatively \n     young, healthy and with some retirement income. Yet both \n     women doubt they would buy the Medicare drug coverage because \n     they believe they get a better bargain with the current \n     supplemental insurance plans. Without clients such as Adams \n     and Nagorski, policymakers worry, the new Medicare package \n     will draw the oldest, sickest and poorest patients, leading \n     to skyrocketing costs.\n       Despite the plan's limits, Adams predicted many friends \n     will sign up for any program that might lower their drug \n     bills. ``They're gonna jump on this like white on rice,'' she \n     said.\n       Zev Harel, 73, agreed.\n       ``There are always those who hope for a revolution, but \n     what has worked in the United States is evolution,'' said \n     Harel, a professor at Cleveland State University and board \n     member of the Western Reserve Area Agency on Aging. Many of \n     his friends will be disappointed with the limits of the drug \n     coverage, he said, but he considers it ``a major improvement \n     over the current situation.''\n       If analyzed in the context of other types of insurance, the \n     Medicare drug plan is a reasonable approach, Harel said. \n     ``This follows on the principle of purchasing protection.''\n       But many others said the fundamental promise of Medicare--a \n     system they supported through payroll taxes throughout their \n     careers--has always been health care for all, and in today's \n     world, that should include prescriptions.\n       ``The politicians seem to say it's better than nothing, and \n     we should be grateful,'' Urban grumbled.\n       To some retirees here, who chip coupons and follow the \n     news, Washington's Medicare is just the latest example of the \n     doings of out-of-touch elitists.\n       Nagorski reached into her purse and retrieved a recent \n     newspaper clipping detailing the personal riches of the \n     United States' elected leaders. The article identified \n     several millionaires, including Sens. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.), \n     Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Ohio's senators, Mike DeWine \n     and George V. Voinovich, both Republicans.\n       ``Do you really think they care about the average person \n     with what they earn?'' Nagorski asked. ``I don't think any of \n     them are ever going to have to live on $1,100 a month.''\n\n[[Page S8659]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                 [From the Miami Herald, June 26, 2003]\n\n      The Wrong Prescription--Congress Considers Inadequate Bills\n\n       U.S. House and Senate bills attempting to offer \n     prescription-drug cost relief to Medicare seniors can be \n     summed up with a movie title: Dumb and Dumber. Both bills \n     promise dubious benefits without providing the security that \n     seniors want, and have, with traditional Medicare health \n     coverage.\n       With election-year politicking started already, the bad \n     news is that a bad bill may actually be enacted after years \n     of waiting. The politicians may easily be miscalculating. \n     Most seniors, who faithfully turn out to vote, want \n     prescription-drug coverage through Medicare--not the private \n     insurers that the GOP-controlled Congress and White House are \n     pushing.\n       Further, an increasing number of Americans--32 percent \n     today versus 16 percent in 1999--says that neither the \n     Republican Party nor the Democratic Party is doing a good job \n     on the issue of prescription-drug benefits for the elderly, \n     according to a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation \n     and Harvard School of Public Health. The proposed \n     congressional legislation can only deepen that sense.\n       Each bill would cost about $400 billion over 10 years and \n     suffer from complexity and coverage gaps. Under the Senate \n     bill, for instance, a senior would pay the first $275 in drug \n     costs (the deductible), then half of the costs--up to $4,500. \n     They would then get no benefit until the bills total $5,800 \n     (an out-of-pocket expense of $3,700), after which 90 percent \n     of the cost would be covered. Have you got that?\n       It gets worse. Beyond the deductible and co-payments, \n     seniors would pay a monthly premium--even while getting no \n     benefits when they are in the coverage gap. Although the \n     premium is ``estimated'' at $35 a month, it's actually \n     subject to a drug-cost inflator that, at the moment, is four \n     times higher than inflation. It's also subject to \n     interpretation by private insurers, who presumably would \n     contract with the government to administer this plan--an \n     uncertain assumption.\n       The Senate bill also provides for a ``fallback'': if a \n     region doesn't attract two competing private insurers, the \n     government may contract with pharmacy-benefit managers, firms \n     that actually manage the prescription-drug programs of most \n     large health-insurance plans. So why contract with the \n     private insurers in the first place when these pharmacy-\n     benefit managers have the expertise to drive down drug costs \n     by leveraging Medicare's enormous volume-buying power?\n       That the pharmaceutical companies are trying to strip this \n     fallback provision does indicate who wants the benefits \n     here--and we're not talking about Medicare seniors.\n       The House GOP measure, indeed, has no fallback provision--\n     which could leave large areas of the country without access \n     to the Medicare drug benefit. It has the same premium problem \n     and a bigger coverage gap. But it would provide more generous \n     benefits: A $250 deductible and 80 percent cost coverage up \n     to $2,000.\n       Neither bill offers the drug-price relief, simplicity and \n     security that seniors need. But what do you expect from a \n     Congress and White House that already have spent $1.7 \n     trillion on tax cuts since 2001? Seniors, and critical \n     Medicare and Social Security concerns, apparently only matter \n     as talking points for an election year.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Arizona is here to \nspeak. He will speak for 10 or 15 minutes, is my understanding.\n  We are at a point where we have very few amendments left. We have a \ncouple that may take a little debate but I think most of them will be \ndisposed of with minimal debate. I hope everyone understands we are \nmoving this along as quickly as possible. The managers have worked for \n2 weeks on this matter.\n  After the Senator from Arizona finishes his statement, we should be \nin a position to have a number of votes lined up for later this \nevening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the passage of the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefits legislation is a difficult vote for me. It is \nunacceptable that in a country as wealthy as ours seniors across the \ncountry are struggling to afford the high cost of prescription drugs. I \nhave supported adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare because I \nbelieve no beneficiary should have to choose between life-sustaining \nprescription medications and other vital necessities. Far too many \nAmerican seniors face those choices every day. Many ration their \nsupplies of medication, skip dosages, or cut pills in half.\n  In Arizona, busloads of seniors depart from Phoenix and Tucson every \nweek, heading south to Mexico to purchase lower cost prescription \ndrugs. The story is similar across the northern border, where seniors \nmake daily trips to Canadian pharmacies. Throughout the country, an \nincreasing number of seniors are looking to online pharmacies, selling \nreduced-priced prescriptions imported from other countries, oftentimes \nwith questionable safety.\n  That said, I also recognize, as does every other Member of Congress, \nthat Medicare is on a fast track toward bankruptcy. The most recent \nTrustee's Report adjusted down the year Medicare will reach financial \ninsolvency by 4 years, to 2026. Clearly, it is incumbent upon us to \ninclude comprehensive reform of the system in any Medicare prescription \ndrug package in order to ensure that Medicare is financially sound for \ncurrent beneficiaries as well as future generations.\n  Medicine has changed substantially since the creation of the Medicare \nsystem in 1965. Advances in medical technology and pharmaceuticals have \nled to more prescription-based treatments. The simple fact is, \nAmericans now consume more prescriptions than ever before. In 1968, \nsoon after the enactment of Medicare, American seniors spent about $65 \na year on a handful of prescription medications. Today, seniors fill an \naverage of 22 prescriptions a year, spending an estimated $999.\n  The bill before us represents one of the largest enhancements to \nMedicare since its creation, setting up an entirely new bureaucracy and \nestablishing a sizable new entitlement program. I believe this bill \naddresses a real problem, the need to help struggling middle and low-\nincome seniors. However, we must have no illusions. There are dangerous \ncomplexities and potential unintended consequences associated with this \nbill.\n  First, we must be realistic about the cost of this new entitlement \nprogram. For anyone who believes this bill will cost a maximum of $400 \nbillion over the next 10 years, I have some oceanfront property in Gila \nBend, AZ, to sell you.\n  Medicare and Social Security, together, represent an enormous \nunfunded liability for our Nation. In a few short years, millions of \nbaby boomers will hit retirement age and the system will quickly become \ninsolvent.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. Medicare currently has an unfunded \nliability of $13.3 trillion. Some have estimated the unfunded liability \nof the package before us in the $6 to $7 trillion range. A scholar at \nthe American Enterprise Institute Scholar estimated that if passed, the \nSenate's prescription drug benefit legislation will result in a $12 \ntrillion unfunded liability. Social Security and Medicare, with a \nprescription drug benefit, will together consume an estimated 21 \npercent of income taxes by the year 2020.\n\n  Long after the Members of this Congress and administration have left \noffice, our children and our grandchildren, and a future Congress and \nadministration, will be struck with the burden of cleaning up the mess \nwe have created.\n  In the past 2 years, we have passed two large tax cuts. Government \nspending, however, has continued to increase well above the inflation \nuse. Much of that spending is unnecessary, and represents a lack of \nfiscal discipline more common in times of federal budget surpluses. Yet \nour current budget deficit and national debt have risen dramatically. \nSecurity concerns in the post 9/11 era necessitate substantial \nincreases in spending on defense and homeland security. We cannot \nsustain this level of fiscal profligacy indefinitely.\n  This extraordinary large new entitlement we are debating will impose \nan equally extraordinary burden on taxpayers. The money has to come \nfrom somewhere, and none of the ``somewheres'' are desirable. The \nreality is, this new benefit will be funded by raiding other \nentitlement trust funds, or by increasing our national debt, or by \nsubstantially increasing taxes.\n  Despite the enormous cost of this bill, this new entitlement will not \nprovide the prescription drug coverage many seniors expect to receive. \nNor does it enact significant reform measures needed to ensure the \nlong-term solvency of the Medicare system.\n  Those seniors who think this bill will solve their financial problems \nwill soon learn that there are substantial limitations to the benefit. \nWhen it does pass, the new prescription benefit will not be available \nimmediately. In fact, it will take several years just to establish the \nnew bureaucracy which will administer the prescription benefits.\n\n[[Page S8660]]\n\n  Low-income seniors will benefit from this package, and I am pleased \nthat they will. Many other seniors, however, will not receive a \ngenerous benefit, and might not even get out of the system what they \nwill pay in deductible sand premiums. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that 37 percent of employers currently providing coverage to \nMedicare eligible seniors, will drop coverage if this bill passes. Last \nweek, the Wall Street Journal quoted one analyst who called this bill \nthe ``automaker enrichment act,'' because companies such as the \nautomakers who currently provide their retired employees with a \nprescription drug benefit are unlikely to continue doing so if the \nFederal Government assumes part of the burden for them.\n\n  I am concerned that we are about to repeat--I emphasize repeat--an \nenormous mistake. I have been around here long enough to remember \nanother large Medicare prescription drug entitlement program we enacted \nin 1988, Medicare Catastrophic. The image of seniors outraged by the \nhigh cost and ineffectiveness of that package should be a cautionary \ntale to all of us.\n  Moreover, I am not confident that the Medicare Advantage portion of \nthis new scheme, which establishes regional PPO options for seniors, \nwill succeed. Many in the insurance industry have expressed skepticism \nand concern that such plans will not be profitable. In the end, the \nFederal Government, which acts as a fallback if no private plans are \navailable, might end up covering the majority of the country. Not \nexactly the reform we all had hoped for.\n  The American people should be aware that this new benefit has \nsubstantial cost to seniors, and to current and future generations of \ntaxpayers, who will bear the majority of a crushing financial burden. \nThere will be unintended consequences of our actions. We can be sure of \nthat. Moreover, we should be honest about the cost of this measure--\n$400 billion is merely a down payment for what we are creating. Given \nthe fiscal realities we face, realities that will become more dire with \nevery passing year, Congress and the administration should have \ncommitted to addressing the acute need for a drug benefit to alleviate \nthe impossible choices confronting lower income seniors. And, most \nimportantly, begun to seek consensus among responsible Members of both \nparties for the reforms we all know are necessary to save Medicare.\n  I recently heard a good assessment of this package: it is ``an effort \nto do too much with too little, and thus doing nothing very well at \nall.''\n  There are several good amendments that have been adopted during this \ndebate. I am encouraged that a bill Senator Schumer and I worked on for \nthe last 4 years, might finally be enacted into law as part of this \npackage. Our amendment will increase competition in the pharmaceutical \nindustry and ensure that all Americans have access to lower cost \ngeneric drugs. That amendments, which would not have been possible \nwithout the leadership of Senator Gregg and the support of Senator \nKennedy, will reduce the cost to the government of any Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  I was happy to cosponsor an important amendment with Senators \nFeinstein, Nickles, Chafee, and Graham, which I believe will add some \nfiscal discipline to the bill and the Medicare program. The amendment \nwill add means testing to Medicare Part B--increasing co-payments for \nwealthier seniors.\n  I am also pleased that several measures which I have supported and \ncosponsored as separate bills, have been adopted as part of this \npackage, including the Immigrant Children's Health Improvement Act, the \nBlind Empowerment Act, and funds to reimburse hospitals for the \nuncompensated cost of caring for undocumented immigrants. Additionally, \nthere have been several good amendments that I think will improve \noverall health care in our country. In particular, I believe Senator \nGrassley's amendment which requires agreements between brand and \ngeneric pharmaceutical companies to be reported to the Federal Trade \nCommission and the Justice Department will shine some much needed light \non potential collusive agreements.\n  Despite these welcome improvements, and recognizing that this \nlegislation will address the crisis faced by lower income seniors, the \ncosts of this entitlement remain, simply put, beyond the means of this \ncountry absent real reform of Medicare. Therefore, after much thought, \nI regret that I cannot vote for this legislation. I have reached this \nconclusion, not because I believe our seniors and disabled do not need \nor deserve prescription drug coverage, but because I do not believe our \ncountry can sustain the cost of this benefit, which will not, despite \nit's staggering expense, provide the assistance many beneficiaries will \nexpect.\n  As I noted, Congress and the administration should have addressed the \nacute need for assistance of lower income seniors. And before we \nconsider extending that assistance to other seniors, we should save \nMedicare first by instituting the reforms we all know are necessary, \nbut which we apparently prefer to defer until we have retired from \npublic service. I know that those reforms pose a very difficult \npolitical challenge to us, and that the bipartisanship we have \ncommended in the drafting and consideration of the legislation before \nus today would be put to a far more severe test should we genuinely \nattempt to save the Medicare system from insolvency. However, should we \nsimply add another huge, new unfunded liability to an already fiscally \nunsound entitlement, imposing a breathtakingly heavy tax burden on our \nchildren and their children, with devastating consequences for their \nprosperity and the national economy, we will have done the one thing no \npublic servant should want to be remembered for, we will have left the \ncountry worse off than we found it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, has \nbeen extremely patient. He has been waiting for us to get a unanimous \nconsent for his amendment. We are very shortly going to get that, but \nprior to that being announced, the Senator from Michigan is going to \noffer amendment No. 1111. He is going to speak for 10 minutes. Senator \nStabenow will speak for 5 minutes, and Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus will speak for up to 10 minutes in opposition, if they need to. \nThe leaders will arrange a vote at some time that they have agreed \nupon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1111\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment which I will be offering is \ndesigned to ensure that the CBO estimate of 37 percent of current \nretirees who now get their prescription drug coverage from their former \nemployer and who will lose that coverage as a result of this bill will \nat least have the option of a prescription drug coverage under the \nMedicare fallback.\n  There are a number of problems which have been identified with this \nbill. Some of them are significant problems which cause many of us, who \nvery much favor having a prescription drug benefit available to our \nseniors, great pause before we support this bill. For instance, there \nis a so-called yo-yo effect in this legislation. Some have called it \nthe revolving door effect. The problem there is that seniors who are \noffered two private plans in their service area must pick one of those \nprivate plans. They cannot use the Medicare fallback. There will not be \na Medicare fallback with a guaranteed premium because if two or more \nprivate companies offer a prescription drug program, with whatever \npremium they decide upon, then the seniors in that service area must \npick one of those two private plans.\n  What happens then if the senior says, okay, I am going to pick that \nprivate plan A, and then a couple of years later the private sector \ndecides to pull out of that service area? At that point, the senior \nwill be offered the Medicare fallback.\n\n  Then what happens if the private insurance folks decide to come back \ninto\n\n[[Page S8661]]\n\nthat service area? Could the senior keep the Medicare fallback plan? \nNo. They are kicked out of that plan even if they want it. They have to \ngo into one of the private plans again. Then that can be repeated over \nand over again. Each time private insurance companies decide to pull \nout of an area, the seniors then can get into a Medicare fallback, but \nwhen private companies come into the service area again, they are \nremoved from the Medicare Program and have to go back to one of the \nplans. It is confusing, uncertain, unfair. It is the yo-yo effect, what \nothers call the revolving door. It is a real problem with this plan. We \nought to give much more certainty to that.\n  Another problem identified is the so-called donut hole problem. We \nhave heard quite a bit about that problem where once a senior is told \nher drug spending reaches $4,500 for a year, she will have to pay 100 \npercent of the costs of the prescriptions until the total drug spending \nreaches $5,800. Now, premiums will continue to be paid during that \nperiod, but the gap in coverage will be there, so from $4,500 to \n$5,800. There is not a 50/50 deal between the plan and the senior; it \nis 100 percent burden of the senior during that period. That is a real \ngap in coverage. That is a gaping hole in coverage. I don't know of any \nother insurance program that is so unfairly structured. That is another \nproblem which has been identified. There have been efforts made to \ncorrect that, without success.\n  Another problem identified is that the private insurance plans that \nmay come into a service area do not have a cap on the premium; it is an \nunlimited premium. That is a problem which has been identified. The \neffort to put a cap on the premiums has failed.\n  But of all the flaws that have been identified, the weaknesses in \nthis program, the one that troubles me most and that troubled seniors \nmost is the fact that it has been estimated by the CBO and by the \nHealth and Human Services folks who operate Medicare that 37 percent of \ncurrent retirees who have a prescription drug program through their \nformer employer are going to lose their prescription drug benefit \nfollowing the enactment of the plan before the Senate; that is, a \nsituation where we are actually going to see 37 percent of our \nseniors--that is the estimate--who currently have a benefit being worse \noff as a result of what we do.\n  There is a debate here as to whether the plan before the Senate is \ngoing to be good for seniors because of the donut hole or because of \nthe fact there is no cap on premiums or because of this yo-yo effect, \nthis revolving door effect. Is it a good plan? Is it not a good plan? \nWill seniors who don't have health insurance, a prescription drug \nprogram now, actually want to opt into this program? That people can \ndebate. But, at a minimum, we should do no harm. At a minimum, we \nshould not have millions of seniors who will lose an existing \nprescription drug program as a result of our enacting a plan. That is \nthe time bomb in the bill before the Senate. We should not leave people \nworse off than they otherwise would be.\n  During the markup of this bill, we had some experts who testified. \nOne was Tom Scully, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services at HHS:\n\n       Among employees who have employer-sponsored insurance, our \n     estimate is consistent with 37 percent having their coverage \n     dropped.\n\n  A little later on, page 6 of the transcript of the markup of the \nFinance Committee:\n\n       TOM SCULLY: Thirty-seven percent of those retirees who have \n     employer-sponsored coverage . . . [will lose their coverage].\n\n  Then, a little later on in the markup of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Conrad was going to ask a question of Mr. Holtz-Eakin, our CBO \nDirector, about this issue, and the majority leader posed a question.\n\n       Senator FRIST: Senator Conrad, could I--on that last--I'm \n     over here--on this employers dropping it, can I just ask a \n     follow-up question just real quick.\n       Senator CONRAD: Yeah. Absolutely.\n       Senator FRIST: You said--is it 37 percent of employers are \n     going to drop----\n       TOM SCULLY: Yes.\n\n  Colleagues, Senator Frist said something which I hope will \nreverberate in this Chamber.\n\n       Senator FRIST: This has huge implications.\n\n  Then the Director of the CBO said the following:\n\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thirty-seven percent of employees--of \n     retirees with such employee insurance.\n\n  Then there was a voice, unidentified by the reporter:\n\n       MALE VOICE: As I understand it, this 37 percent is the \n     effect of our legislation.\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN: Correct.\n\n  Colleagues, Senator Frist is correct. This has huge implications. And \nwe ought to address it. The least we can do is to direct Health and \nHuman Services to make available to designate a Medicare backup plan \nfor the 37 percent of our current seniors who have a prescription drug \nprogram through their previous employer to make available to them the \nMedicare backup program so they at least know there will be a Medicare \nbackup for them if they lose their current prescription drug program, \nas is projected by the Congressional Budget Office and by Health and \nHuman Services. It seems to me that is the least we can do.\n  It still will be harmful because it is very unlikely for most of the \npeople that the Medicare backup will be as good as their current \nprescription drug program. It is unlikely. But at least we can say, for \nthose people, there will be a Medicare backup plan designated by HHS \nwhich will have the criteria established by HHS and the premium \nestablished by HHS. That is the least we can do for those who are going \nto lose their prescription drug benefit that they currently have \nfollowing the enactment of this legislation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 1111.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Michigan, \nSenator Stabenow, be listed as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the excerpts from the quoted \ntestimony be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Senator ROCKEFELLER. Okay. Actual dollars in the plan that \n     are spent on, number one, the drug benefit itself, provider \n     add backs and that's all I can see. I don't need the third \n     one I've written down.\n       TOM SCULLY. These are figures that were in the table. We \n     issued it to the Committee. Since this table was put \n     together, there were some modest modifications to the drug \n     benefit. In particular, putting the cap at $4,500.00 instead \n     of $4,725.00. That changes the estimate on the drug benefit \n     from $408 billion to $402 billion over ten years.\n       Senator ROCKEFELLER. Four hundred two?\n       TOM SCULLY. Four hundred two. Six billion dollars lower. \n     And, the provider add backs are listed on pages 2 and 3--or, \n     pages 1 and 2----\n       Senator ROCKEFELLER. Could you give them to me?\n       TOM SCULLY. There's a long list of them, and simply adding \n     them up is not that--they interact in many ways.\n       Senator ROCKEFELLER. [Unintelligible].\n       TOM SCULLY. [Unintelligible].\n       Senator ROCKEFELLER. Next one is, percent of employers who \n     drop retiree coverage. And, the number and percent of \n     beneficiaries who will lose retiree coverage under this plan \n     so far.\n       TOM SCULLY. We don't have an estimate of the number of \n     employers. But, among employees who have employer-\n     sponsored insurance, our estimate is consistent with 37% \n     having their coverage dropped. Of that 37% of those who \n     have such coverage, about 11% of beneficiaries overall.\n       MALE VOICE. Could you repeat that? I didn't get the--you \n     might pull the microphone up a little closer to you.\n       TOM SCULLY. Thirty seven percent of those employees who \n     have employer-sponsored coverage, it's 11% of beneficiaries \n     overall.\n       Senator ROCKEFELLER. And, what percent would drop it?\n       TOM SCULLY. We don't know the number of employers who would \n     drop coverage. We know the number of employees who are \n     effected.\n       MALE VOICE. I thought you gave an estimate--excuse me--this \n     is Senator Rockefeller's time, and I just want to make sure \n     I----\n       TOM SCULLY. Let me repeat so it's----\n       MALE VOICE. Just repeat what you said.\n       TOM SCULLY. Underlying our estimate are that 37% of \n     employees who have beneficiaries who have employed-sponsored \n     insurance, retirees who have such employer-sponsored \n     coverage, 37% will lose their coverage. And, that is 11% of \n     total beneficiaries.\n\n[[Page S8662]]\n\n       MALE VOICE. Could I also add into this, Senator \n     Rockefeller? What we also need to know is, what percentage of \n     the figure you said might drop--or, case would be dropped \n     even\n       Or, they could drop it entirely.\n       In those latter two cases, they can use the additional \n     resources to provide other kinds of employee compensation.\n       What we've done is examine the literature to the extent \n     that we can find it on employer responses to the shape of \n     compensation packages in shaping our estimate of the number \n     that would drop.\n       Senator CONRAD. Okay. Let me go to something that I have \n     found difficult to follow. And, I'd like, if I could, to have \n     the attention of the Chairman.\n       Senator FRIST. Senator Conrad, could I--on that last--I'm \n     over here--on this employers dropping it, can I just ask a \n     follow up question just real quick.\n       Senator CONRAD. Yeah. Absolutely.\n       Senator FRIST. You said--is it 37% of employers are going \n     to drop----\n       TOM SCULLY. Yes.\n       Senator FRIST. This has huge implications.\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. Thirty seven percent of employees--of \n     retirees with such employee insurance.\n       Senator FRIST. Okay.\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. And, that's 11% of overall Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       MALE VOICE. Okay. If we did nothing, how many would be \n     dropped over the next ten years? If you look at these curves, \n     the employees--yours are getting out of the business, \n     anyway--not out of the business, but the curve is going \n     down.\n       What would it be ten years from now?\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. We don't have an estimate of that. We \n     isolated our estimate on the impact of the bill above the \n     baseline. That's a question about the baseline estimate, and \n     I don't have that.\n       MALE VOICE. Okay.\n       MALE VOICE. It's 37%, just so we're clear with each other. \n     As I understand it, this 37% is the effect of our \n     legislation.\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. Correct.\n       MALE VOICE. I think the question Senator Frist has is, in \n     your baseline you have an assumption that there will be \n     changes, though, correct? Or, don't you?\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. No, we do not.\n       MALE VOICE. And, would you suggest that that's an \n     inaccurate baseline?\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. In reality----\n       MALE VOICE. Its reality is not that. And, I can have a few \n     of my retirees in Pennsylvania give you a call if you have \n     any questions on that subject.\n       I mean, I think that's an unfair--I mean, baselines are \n     supposed to be real, but not supposed to be artificial. \n     That's artificial.\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. The baseline issue that we--that is most \n     important, that we capture is new retirees not having such \n     coverage.\n       This is a provision that would induce existing retirees who \n     have such coverage to have their coverage dropped or modified \n     by the their employer.\n       MALE VOICE. I understand what this provision does. I just \n     want you--I just want an understanding of what would happen \n     without this being calculated into the baseline.\n       MALE VOICE. Senator Santorum, we've looked at the \n     literature and the surveys of the employee benefits \n     consultants of retiree offerings.\n       What we understand is mainly happening is that, for current \n     workers who are newly hired, they are--employers are no \n     longer putting as part of their compensation package a \n     guarantee of retiree healthcare.\n       As far as we can tell, the base of people who are near \n     retirement or retired are not having their healthcare--\n     there's not that much erosion going on.\n       MALE VOICE. I'll have the people from Bethlehem Steel and \n     about seven other steel companies in Pennsylvania that I can \n     just think of off the top of my head give you a call, and let \n     you know that their retiree health benefits have been \n     eliminated. I mean, it's happening all over the place.\n       Senator Rockefeller, would you like to join into this? I \n     mean--so, I just--I think you need to look at your \n     baseline, please.\n       And, then give us an understanding of maybe looking back \n     over the last few years and projecting forward given the \n     trends what--how the baseline would be affected. And, I think \n     that would much--be a much fairer score as to what the impact \n     of this bill would be.\n       Senator CONRAD. Mr. Chairman?\n       The CHAIRMAN. Senator Conrad.\n       Senator CONRAD. Let me just say that I agree entirely with \n     Senator Santorum. We know that people are dropping--employers \n     are dropping their plans.\n       And, I understand your answer to this question is the \n     effect of this bill.\n       I think one of the things we've got to do--Senator Frist \n     said it well--this has got major implications; 37% having \n     their healthcare plans dropped. That means it's going from \n     being on the company's nickel to being on our nickel; that \n     dramatically increases the cost.\n       So, if we can find ways to hold that number down, that's in \n     our interest and we should pursue it.\n       Let me go----\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. If we could, before we----\n       Senator CONRAD. Yes, sir.\n       Mr. HOLTZ-EAKIN. I understand the policy interest, and * * \n     *.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I am very proud to be joining with my \ncolleague on this very critical amendment. Can you imagine, you are \nsomeone who has worked hard all of your life, you have been fortunate \nenough to have a good-paying job with benefits, you are now retired and \nyou are fortunate to have good health benefits and you find yourself in \na situation that, as a result of an action taken here--and certainly \nthere is an effort to move forward and provide people with prescription \ndrug coverage--but if those who already have coverage find, as a result \nof an action we take, there is an incentive for their employer to drop \ntheir coverage, how would you feel about that?\n  I know how I would feel about that. This amendment is about making \nsure those who have worked hard all of their lives, who have retired \nand have had the confidence and the security to know that those health \ncare benefits, retirement benefits they have worked so hard to have in \ntheir retirement, would be secure--to make sure if someone is covered \nright now for prescription drugs that he or she not lose the ability to \ncontinue, at least to know that if their employer changes their \nbenefit, they would have immediately the security of the backup \nMedicare prescription drug plan.\n  This is very critical in a State such as Michigan where we have 37 \npercent of our retirees who have insurance, who right now are fortunate \nenough to have health care insurance and prescription drug coverage.\n  While there are positives in this bill so there are those who will \nreceive help as a result of being low-income seniors, or those with \nvery high prescription drug costs who will receive help under this \nbill, one of the glaring omissions and great concerns that I have \nrelates to what Senator Levin was just speaking about, the unfairness \nof saying to a group of people who have been fortunate enough to have \ninsurance and prescription drug coverage that, as a result of something \ndone by the Congress, they would potentially lose that coverage. That \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  What our amendment is saying is if, in fact, their employer would \nhave the incentive to change or drop their coverage, they should be \nguaranteed that something else is right there, that Medicare as a \nbackup should be there.\n  My preference would be that we change the formulas so there is not \nthe incentive to drop anyone. That was one of the reasons I strongly \nsupported Senator Rockefeller's amendment and other amendments that \nhave been on the floor. Because my first choice is we take away any \nincentive for anyone to lose their prescription drug coverage. But \nunfortunately those amendments were not successful. We did not have the \nsupport to do that here.\n  Given that, we are now coming in and saying if, in fact, an employer, \nbecause of the incentives, makes a determination to drop coverage, that \nat a minimum, out of a sense of decency and fairness, at a minimum that \nretiree needs to know that Medicare prescription drug coverage, through \nMedicare, is available without wading through tons of insurance forms \nor picking through plans or going through all the ups and downs that \nhave been described so many times in this Chamber. They need to know, \nafter having coverage, having it available, having it dependable, that \nanother plan is right there for them. That is the least we can do.\n  I hope we will join together in a bipartisan way this evening to \nagree to this very important amendment, and let us send a message to \nthose fortunate enough to have health care insurance and prescription \ndrug coverage that we remember them, we care about them, and we are \ngoing to make sure no harm is done to them in the process of putting \ntogether this prescription drug plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8663]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is the greatest and most prosperous \nNation in history. Nobody has worked harder to make this country great \nthan our senior citizens. And few things weigh more heavily on their \nminds than the soaring cost of prescription drugs.\n\n  You would think such a great, prosperous Nation would honor its \nelders, by making sure they get the medicines they need. That is why a \ncomprehensive, meaningful and voluntary drug benefit for our senior \ncitizens has been among my highest priorities.\n  Over the last several weeks, this Senate has worked hard to achieve \nthat. In the process, many of us who shared that goal have disagreed \nabout how to react it. In the end, we wound up with a bill that is not \nhow I would have created a prescription drug benefit. But it is a \nstart.\n  I am voting for this bill, because I believe some benefit is better \nthan none. I am voting for it because of people like Shirley Rosamond \nof Sparks, NV. Shirley, who is 78 years old, raised eight children in \nthe Sierra Nevada. She currently spends $400 a month on medicine, and \nhas less than $400 left over to live on. This bill would reduce her \nmonthly costs to less than $20 in medicine. And it would provide a \nsimilar level of assistance for tens of thousands of Nevada seniors.\n  I am voting for this bill in the hope it will be like the camel's \nnose under the tent--a foot in the door for our senior citizens.\n  I'm hoping we will pass this bill today, and then improve it in the \nfuture. And, yes, there is plenty of room for improvement.\n  For example,this bill will do little to help seniors whose income is \n$15,000 a year or more. Even if they spend more than $100 a month on \nprescription drugs. That is why I voted to make the program more \ngenerous.\n  This bill doesn't take effect soon enough. That is why I voted for \nand cosponsored the Lautenberg amendment to move the start date up to \n2004, instead of 2006.\n  There are gaps in the coverage this bill provides. That is why I \nvoted for Senator Boxers' amendment to close the coverage gap, and \nSenator Graham's amendment to cancel premiums while coverage is \nsuspended.\n  There were other amendments that were very good but were not agreed \nto. Finally, this plan is just plain confusing--which means it won't \ngive our senior citizens the peace of mind they deserve.\n  I voted to address all of these issues. I wish we had succeeded, and \nthat this bill would provide the kind of coverage our senior citizens \nneed. We didn't and it doesn't.\n  We have to be honest with our senior citizens, and with the American \npeople. This isn't the best we can do for our senior citizens, but it \nis the best we can do tonight.\n  I will vote for this bill today, because it provides a start toward \nfulfilling our promise to senior citizens. It a start, and I won't stop \nfighting until we finish the job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are waiting for some completion \non negotiations on an amendment. As I understand it, no one is seeking \nrecognition to continue work on other amendments. So I will speak for a \ncouple of minutes until somebody is prepared to come to the floor to \ncontinue our work. I don't want to delay the business of the Senate but \nI want to express myself, as the distinguished Democratic whip has been \ndoing with regard to the legislation.\n  I, too, intend to support this bill. I am thinking of the old joke \nabout a camel being a horse designed by a committee. Oftentimes, I \nthink of that as we work our will on legislation. In many respects, \nthis is the legislative version of a committee horse, a camel.\n  It is not the kind of bill I would write. It is not the kind of bill \nI would cosponsor. It is not the kind of bill I would enthusiastically \nendorse.\n  I look at some of the concerns we have about this legislation--\nconcerns about an unlimited volatility in the premium, uncertainty \nabout the benefit package, uncertainty with regard to the deductible, \nuncertainty with regard to the backup, uncertainty with regard to the \nway the provisions can be provided in rural areas. There are many \nissues. Mostly I think there is far greater confusion than there is \nunderstanding with regard to the benefits themselves as seniors attempt \nto determine whether they will be assisted by this bill.\n  The confusion and the uncertainty will be issues that we have to \naddress at some later date. But having said that, I must say that the \nrural provisions--the effort made by our two distinguished managers to \naddress the rural needs to overcome the inequities that exist today--\nalone merit consideration and I would suggest support for this \nlegislation. The help for low-income seniors--tens of thousands of \nSouth Dakotans will get help they are not getting today in part because \nof this bill. The possibility that seniors could access generic drugs \nwith far more regularly and successfully, and the possibility that we \ncould reimport drugs at a lower price from Canada, all are reasons why \nI think this bill merits our support.\n  As I look to the balance and look to all of those things I wish were \nbetter, my response is that we are going to make them better. It may \ntake months, if not years, but we are going to continue to work to make \nthis a better bill and a better program.\n  There are so many ways that I hope we as Senators--Republican and \nDemocrat--can work together to make this a better bill in future years.\n  There is a warning and a hope as we complete our debate tonight. The \nwarning is that if this legislation comes back from conference in a \nsignificantly different form we will not be in the same position we are \ntonight. This bill will enjoy broad bipartisan support tonight. But if \nwe fail, if we endorse a bill with some of the provisions of the House, \nthen I daresay this legislation may still be in trouble.\n  My hope is that we can do what I have just suggested--that over the \ncourse of the next several years we can take a very close look at ways \nto make this legislation better and that we can address what I would \nconsider to be serious shortfalls, especially the benefits shutdown \nthat exists after a person pays $4,500. We are talking about a sickness \npenalty that, frankly, cannot be sustained. We have to find a way to \naddress that serious shortcoming in this legislation. I hope it is done \nsooner rather than later.\n\n  I come to the floor with my gratitude for the work that has been \ndone. This is the fifth year we have made an effort to pass meaningful \nprescription drug legislation. We can wait no longer. We simply can't \nallow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. We have to take what we \ncan do and move to build upon something that we will do in future years \nto make it more meaningful, make it a better piece of legislation, and \nmake it a law that we can be enthusiastic about someday.\n  I vote tonight with that expectation and that hope. I am hopeful that \nthere will be many on both sides of the aisle who will share that \nperspective and that expectation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9:15 \ntonight the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Levin \namendment, No. 1111, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Hagel-\nEnsign amendment, No. 1026, with no second degrees in order to the \namendments prior to the votes and with 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to each vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that prior to the vote Senator Ensign \nbe recognized for up to 15 minutes and Senator Hagel, for up to 10 \nminutes, and the two managers be given up to 5 minutes each; further, \nthat it be in order for the Hagel-Ensign amendment to be modified up to \nthe beginning of the stacked votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I suggest \nthat we make them perhaps 10-minute votes as well to expedite our \nvotes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let us make it 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1026\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the amendment \non which Senator Hagel and I have been working actually for the last \nseveral years. This amendment received bipartisan support in the last \nCongress as a\n\n[[Page S8664]]\n\nstand-alone bill. We actually made some improvements to it. We think if \nthis amendment is adopted, it will dramatically improve what the \ncommittee has attempted to do to add a prescription drug benefit to \nMedicare. The only portion of the bill we are modifying in substantial \nform is the prescription drug part of it.\n  Let me talk about what our amendment exactly does. It would say to a \nperson who is below 200 percent of poverty, they would pay the first \n$1,500 out of pocket. After that, the Government is going to pay for \nthe rest of their drug costs, other than a 10-percent copay the person \nwould pay.\n  However, if a person is up to 160 percent of poverty, we will give \nthem, in a pharmaceutical benefit account, $500 per year, which they \ncan use to go to a local pharmacy to buy their prescription drugs or \nthey can use that money and negotiate the price of their prescription \ndrugs through a pharmaceutical benefit manager and mass buy them with \ntheir drug discount card. If they want to use their local pharmacist, \nthey can do that. And this $500, if they did not spend it that year, \nwould be rolled over to the next year where it would cover the first \npart of their deductible. So if you are below 160 percent of poverty, \nthe most you are going to pay out of pocket is less than $100 per \nmonth.\n  There are several benefits to our plan. First of all, with the \ncommittee mark, you pay a monthly premium of $35. You also have a \ndeductible of $275. With our bill, you have no monthly premiums, you \nhave a one-time annual fee of $25, and for low-income people, we waive \nthat.\n  Our plan is completely voluntary. It also gives the most help to \nlower income seniors and gives progressively less help the more money \nyou make.\n  So between 200 percent and 400 percent of poverty, $3,500 is your \nout-of-pocket expenses. Above that amount, the Government pays 90 \npercent. And from 400 percent to 600 percent of poverty, $5,500 is your \nout-of-pocket expenses. Above that amount, 20 percent is your \ndeductible before catastrophic coverage kicks in.\n  For all of these people, though, who want to sign up for the plan, \nthey get a drug discount card where they will save between 25 to 40 \npercent on their prescription drug costs. It is a completely voluntary \nprogram. And in this program, we have several benefits that we think \nare better than the committee's underlying bill.\n  One is, under our bill, States that have already enacted programs \nwill be encouraged to keep their programs. Under the committee mark, \nevery State that has a program for low-income seniors is going to drop \nthose. There is no debate about that. As a matter of fact, the \nSecretary of HHS was before us. The person who oversees Medicare was \nbefore us. Both of them said there is nothing in this bill that will \nsay to the States: Don't drop your plans. And they agreed they will \nprobably drop their plans.\n  Our bill works with the States that have those programs, States such \nas my State of Nevada, and encourages those programs to be kept.\n  A couple of other advantages that our bill has: I want to illustrate \nthose with a couple of examples. These are real-life cases. This is a \nfictitious name, of course, to protect this woman's identity, but this \nis a real person. We call her Doris Jones. She is 75 years old. She has \nan income of about $17,000 a year. She is being treated for diabetes, \nhypertension, and high cholesterol. She is taking medications that are \nvery typical of what this type of a disease management would require. \nHer out-of-pocket expenses right now are $3,648.\n\n  Let's compare how our amendment, the Hagel-Ensign approach, would \naffect her out-of-pocket expenses versus the bill on the floor if our \namendment is not accepted.\n  Under our bill, she would have $1,700 out-of-pocket expenses a year. \nUnder the committee bill that is before us today, she would have $2,383 \na year. So it is a savings of almost $700 under our approach.\n  Another person: James is 68 years old. He has an income of about \n$16,000 a year. He is being treated for diabetes, a pretty severe case \nof diabetes, and he has all these different medications--very common \nmedications today for a diabetic. His total out-of-pocket expenses \ntoday are $5,700.\n  How does he compare under the two provisions?\n  Under the Hagel-Ensign approach, about $1,900 would be his out-of-\npocket expenses for the year; under the bill that is before us today, a \nlittle over $4,000 in out-of-pocket expenses a year. So the difference \nis almost $2,200 to this senior who is sick. And we certainly would not \ncall him a rich person. I would call this person certainly a low- to \nmoderate-income senior.\n  Now, Betty is another example. These are real-life examples taking \nreal medicine, prescribed by real doctors. She is 66 years old. She has \nan income of $15,500. She is being treated for breast cancer and she is \ntaking commonly prescribed medications for that. She is on low-dose \nradiation. She pays about $8,000 for her prescription drugs a year.\n  What would happen to her under the two different scenarios?\n  Under our scenario, she would pay about $2,100 out of pocket. Under \nthe bill that is before us today, she would pay $4,300.\n  What we have done with our amendment is we have said: Let's help the \nseniors who need it the most. And we put the dollars to them. Under our \namendment, people who are sick, with low and moderate income, they \nreally get help. For people above that, they are treated about the same \nbetween our amendment and the bill. The out-of-pocket expenses for \npeople between 200 and 400 percent of poverty are about the same.\n  When you start getting to the wealthier seniors, there is no \nquestion, the committee bill is more generous. For very low income \nseniors, the committee bill is slightly more generous. But for those \nwho are really sick, our amendment is much better.\n  Also, there are a couple of other advantages.\n  In the future, to control costs, our amendment says: The person \nreceiving the medication has something at stake. They are paying out of \ntheir own pocket for the first dollars, so they are going to shop. They \nare going to go around and see: Do I need generics? First of all, do I \nneed the drug? Could I take a generic, which may be less expensive? Are \nthere perhaps other alternatives for treatment that may be cheaper and \njust as effective? They will have that conversation with their doctor \nbecause they have something at stake.\n  I would argue that what the committee is doing--and I applaud what \nthey are doing, trying in a bipartisan fashion--I believe our amendment \nwould strengthen the committee's bill dramatically because it would \ntarget the dollars, those precious taxpayers' dollars, to the people \nwho need it the most. It will also, though, in the future, control \ncosts and, therefore, be more responsible to the next generation.\n  The committee mark, especially for very low income people, pays 97.5 \npercent of their drug costs, maybe a $1 to $2 copay. Well, there is \ngoing to be a tremendous amount of overutilization in that group.\n  Our amendment gives that group help by putting $500 of their first \ncosts into an account. They will use that to go shop because if they do \nnot use it, it gets rolled over to the next year where it covers more \nof their deductible. So they have something to benefit by if they do \nnot use it.\n  So I implore our colleagues to look and compare. If you look and \ncompare, you will see there truly is a difference.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I commend Senator Hagel and Senator Ensign because they \nhave been working very carefully over the last few years to help move \nthis process along. They have had a different approach than I have had. \nI have had what I call a comprehensive, universal, voluntary approach. \nThey have\n\n[[Page S8665]]\n\nhad one that is more targeted toward low-income people and toward \ncatastrophic. We deal with that in our legislation, but we are very \ncomprehensive. We are very universal. I don't attack their attempt, but \nit is just not as good as what is before the Senate. S. 1 already \nreflects the influence of their plan by providing a drug discount card \nwhich will give seniors access to discounted drug prices.\n  I would like to point out a few things. The Hagel-Ensign plan has two \nlaudable objectives: to protect seniors against catastrophic costs and \nto ensure that low-income seniors are fully protected.\n  I am happy to report that S. 1 already meets these goals. S. 1 \nprovides a generous protection for low-income beneficiaries, very \ngenerous. It also covers fully 90 percent of beneficiaries' out-of-\npocket costs beyond $3,700. Most seniors don't have catastrophic drug \ncosts and thus would not see any benefit from the coverage in the \nHagel-Ensign plan. S. 1, on the other hand, would provide a significant \nbasic benefit to most seniors each year. Passing a drug bill that most \nseniors would see no benefit from is a prescription for disaster. I am \nafraid of that.\n  So S. 1 already meets the main goals of the Hagel-Ensign plan, but it \nprovides additional value to a much broader group of beneficiaries as \nwell, the underlying bill, the one that they amend, the one they would \ndecimate.\n  Another thing S. 1 does very well is use competition to maximize \nvalue to the taxpayers. There has been some concern that S. 1 doesn't \nhave as much competitive reform as many of us would have preferred. But \nthe Hagel-Ensign plan has far less reform and is much more government \nrun.\n  I would like to explain: First, this amendment would rule out any \ntrue competition in the delivery of Medicare drug benefits. S. 1 would \nlet private drug plans assume a modest amount of financial risk, giving \nthem an incentive to drive hard bargains and keep taxpayers' costs \ndown. It seems to me that is very significant--the difference between \nthe underlying bill and their bill. We are going to drive drug prices \ndown more through competition.\n  The Hagel-Ensign plan, it is pretty obvious from my point of view, \nallows for no such exemption, specifically mandating that the \nGovernment--in this case we are talking about the taxpayers--bears all \nthe financial risk for delivering the benefit, much as Senator Bob \nGraham's did the last year when we debated this very issue.\n  Under this amendment, the benefit would be delivered just like other \nMedicare benefits are today--by contractors that merely pay the claims \nthat come in without any effort whatsoever, no effort to contain costs.\n  Second, the Hagel amendment doesn't include any of the improvements \nto the Medicare Program that President Bush has proposed and our bill \nincludes. It does not include the role for private preferred provider \norganization plans to deliver an improved Medicare benefit package. It \ndoesn't make modern innovations such as disease management services or \nrational cost sharing available to beneficiaries who choose them. It \nsimply dumps a catastrophic drug benefit on to the 1965 vintage \nMedicare system.\n\n  What the people of this country need is improvement in Medicare, \nstrengthening of Medicare, voluntary, universal, comprehensive. The \nEnsign plan wouldn't improve S. 1, but it would make it substantially \nworse.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to clear up something. We don't \ntouch any of the other Medicare reforms in your bill. The whole thing \nwith the PPOs, we touch the prescription drug part of the underlying \nbill.\n  You mentioned competition. I practiced veterinary medicine, built, \nowned, and operated two different animal hospitals. Why do I bring that \nup? It is because in veterinary medicine people pay out of their own \npocket. Veterinarians are in an incredibly competitive field because we \nknow that if somebody brings a case to you, they are going to shop \nabout half the time based on price. So veterinarians have to be very \ncompetitive and price sensitive to that, so they work to become more \nefficient, to keep their costs down, because individuals shop.\n  In our health care system today, individuals do not shop because we \nhave low deductible policies, and a lot of times the doctors waive \nthose deductibles. Senator Frist will be able to tell you about that. \nThe hospitals waive the deductibles. So the person receiving the care \nis not accountable for the care, and so they don't shop. The doctor \ntells them, go get this service or this drug, and they don't think \nabout it. They have modest, low copays, and they don't think about it.\n  The cost control, the competition, is established by 40 million \npeople on Medicare, 40 million people receiving drugs. If they are \npaying out of their own pocket or low-income people have the $500 in a \npharmaceutical benefit account, they have something at stake, so they \ngo shop.\n  They ask the questions: Do I need the drug in the first place? Maybe \nI can get a generic. So they do the shopping. Also, we have \npharmaceutical benefit managers in the bill. That is what the whole \ndrug discount card is about. So those pharmaceutical benefit managers \nhelp lower the costs as well.\n  We have several reforms in this bill that are true reforms, that \nintroduce competition to keep the costs down. That is why our bill \nactually scored lower.\n  Because of that, we were able to add a couple other things. When \nSenator Hagel arrives, he will modify the amendment. For instance, we \nwill allow Medicaid, the dual eligibles that people have been talking \nabout today, to give States help in handling those dual eligibles \nthrough Medicare because our prescription drug cost to the taxpayer was \nless. It is because we have more reform on the prescription drug part \nof it than the underlying bill. It just a difference of philosophy of \nhow you do it.\n  I come to this based on my experience in the private sector and how \nhealth care can be delivered by individuals shopping.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be equally charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, in the last 2 weeks the Senate has engaged \nin an historic effort to reform and strengthen Medicare. When we opened \nthis debate 2 weeks ago, I said that what we would do here debating \nthis bill would affect every American and future generations.\n  Health care is a defining issue for our Nation and future \ngenerations. Just a reminder: When Medicare was enacted in 1965, the \nFederal Government's lead actuary at that time projected that the \nhospital program, Medicare Part A, would grow to $9 billion by 1990. In \nfact, the program, in 1990, had then cost the taxpayers $66 billion. So \nwe have some sense of how these programs can get out of hand if not \ndefined clearly at the front end.\n  In addition to the internal problems of the changing realities of \nhealth care, Medicare is facing a looming external problem. The largest \ngeneration in American history, the baby boomers, are aging. These \nAmericans--over 75 million of them--will be added to the Medicare rolls \nover the next few years. The baby boom generation has changed and \nshaped every market it has ever entered. Medicare will be no exception. \nWe have a responsibility to address this demographic pressure now or \nrisk the system collapsing under its own weight in the future.\n  Senator Ensign and I have come to the floor to offer an amendment to \nsubstitute only title I of the Finance Committee's bill, providing a \nprescription drug benefit for seniors. We believe any Medicare drug \nbenefit must be sustainable for future generations. The benefit must \ndeal with the realities that people are living longer and better and \nhave higher health care expectations than ever before. We believe we \ncan do better with our amendment.\n\n[[Page S8666]]\n\n  Our amendment is a simple amendment. Seniors will be able to \nunderstand it clearly. Unlike the underlying bill, our amendment \ncontains no premiums, no deductibles, and no gaps in coverage. Our \nmodified amendment addresses three of the major issues we have tried to \ndeal with in constructing this plan. First, it helps low-income \nseniors, those who need it the most. Two, it protects seniors from high \nout-of-pocket expenses, and it eases the burden prescription drug costs \nhave placed on the States.\n  Our modified amendment would replace the prescription drug benefit in \nthe Finance Committee plan with, No. 1, a prescription drug discount \ncard for all seniors on Medicare with $30 billion in added funds for \nlow-income seniors; No. 2, catastrophic coverage for all seniors; No. \n3, $35 billion in cost-sharing for catastrophic drug costs with the \nStates for the lowest income seniors eligible for both Medicare and \nMedicaid.\n  We give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the discretion to \ndivide $65 billion for seniors and for help with drug costs at the \nState level. With our amendment, the Secretary will provide low-income \nseniors with money on a drug discount card to help defray their drug \nexpenses.\n  States would also benefit under our amendment, and $35 billion is \navailable to help States cover the catastrophic drug expenses for the \ndual eligibles. These are the very poorest of seniors.\n  These modifications to the amendment make it stronger by targeting \naid to those who need it the most. This bill has been scored. We fall \nwithin the $400 billion budget number that is required.\n  This is a commonsense plan that is workable and responsible, and it \naddresses prescription drug concerns in the right way.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1026, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I have a modification at the desk to \namendment No. 1026. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1026), as modified, is as follows:\n\n              TITLE I--MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISCOUNT\n\n     SEC. 101.

I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the prescription drug bill, Medicare \nreform bill combination that we have before us today, as we all know, \nis a freight train coming through this place and there is no stopping \nit.\n  What is very unfortunate is that we have a very legitimate amendment \non\n\n[[Page S8673]]\n\nthe floor today that is getting 20, 30 minutes' worth of debate. I put \nup some examples on the chart here of how this amendment we are \noffering is superior. I have tried to be objective, to say that above \n200 percent of poverty, between 200 and 400 percent of poverty they are \npretty equal plans. For the very low income, our amendment is slightly \nless generous, but it keeps the low-income people with something at \nstake so they will shop. We have heard nothing about that from the \nother side. There has been no debate, in other words. It is because \nthere is an agreement to defeat any substantive amendment. It is \nunfortunate.\n  This is probably the most important vote, as far as an entitlement \nprogram, that any of us in our careers will ever take, and this bill is \nbeing rushed through so that we can get a ``bill'' to conference, where \nall of the improvements are going to be made.\n  We have an amendment before us that I believe should be debated. If \nyou disagree, fine, but let's debate it and vote on it up or down. But \nI don't think this kind of a process is healthy for the Senate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time we have in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Of whose time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Off of the chairman, Senator Grassley's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I start off by commending the authors of \nthe amendment for a real serious effort to try to improve the bill. But \nI rise in opposition because there is not any segment of the senior \npopulation that you could not isolate and target and say we can make, \nfor this particular group, a better deal than they have in this bill. \nThat is not the purpose of this legislation.\n  The purpose of Medicare is that it is universal. It is not a welfare \nbill. It is not just for low-income individuals. It is for every \nAmerican citizen who has reached the age of 65, or older, and qualifies \nfor the program. That is one of the greatest features of the Medicare \nProgram--that everyone is essentially treated equal.\n  So it is easy, if you want to isolate a low-income group and say we \nare going to give them a better deal. But when you are looking at the \nentire population of almost 40 million Americans with whom we have to \ndeal, that, indeed, is the real challenge, and that is why the content \nof this bill is far superior than to narrowly isolate only low-income \npeople and say we can do a better deal for them. Of course, but you are \nnot going to be able to do that in keeping with the general theme of \nwhat Medicare is all about and taking care of all Medicare seniors with \nthe best possible deal.\n  I think that is what the goal of this Congress should be, and that is \nwhy what we have in the provisions here to give them prescription \ndrugs, which would be within the Medicare Program, that people can \nvoluntarily continue to accept the traditional Medicare or, if they \nwould like, move into an expanded Medicare Advantage and get all of the \nbenefits through a private, competitively delivered system.\n  What we have is the beginning of a program that can be improved upon \nand will be. But we have essentially an insurance-type program, similar \nto what we have as Federal employees, which can be improved upon. But \nit is for everybody. We, too, give special attention to lower income \nindividuals, and maybe they can do it better, but it is going to have \nto come from somewhere else, and the somewhere else is the vast number \nof other seniors who would have some of their benefits diluted and \nreduced in order to make this a little better than what is in this \nbill.\n  The goal is to try to create a universal program across the board, \nand one that is fair to everyone. I think that is what is in the bill \nas it now stands.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator agree that there wasn't, in the original \nprogram set up as an insurance program, which you would pay into during \nyour working life under the Part A part of the insurance program, with \nthe concept that when you retired, you would have paid for your health \ninsurance. That is why everyone is covered under it. But is it not also \ntrue that under this drug benefit as proposed, nobody will have paid \ninto the Medicare insurance plan for the purposes of this drug program? \nThis drug program will be a new entitlement, and therefore it is \nreasonable that since it is going to be borne not by the people who \nworked for it but by the people who are working--it is going to be \nborne by them rather than the recipients--then it should be set up in a \ndifferent structure along the lines that are proposed, which is you \nbenefit the low income and you benefit people who have a catastrophic \nevent rather than have a program that puts the benefit out to everyone \nand forces 37 percent of the population off private insurance plans and \non to a public plan.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I am not sure whose time this is on. I will respond to \nthe Senator's question. We have a health delivery system supervised by \nthe Federal Government, and the beneficiaries are going to contribute \nto it. Those benefiting from it are going to have an average premium of \n$35 a month, a $275 deductible, and 50 percent copayment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Parliamentary inquiry: Will the Chair inform the Senate \nas to the time allowable on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 4 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining. No time remains in opposition.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I wonder if I can get consent to speak for 1 minute on \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, two points: One, this amendment is totally \nnew. We have not seen the language. We have been asking for the \nlanguage for days. It has been filed in various forms. This is new \nlanguage. The Senate has no idea what is in this amendment. We saw it \nfor the first time maybe 15, 20, 30 minutes ago. It is impossible to \nknow what this amendment does.\n  Point No. 2, essentially what we can tell by a cursory glance at the \namendment is the amendment enters a whole new concept in Medicare that \nhas not been done before, and that is means testing. It means tests \nthose at the catastrophic levels.\n  I do not think we want to begin to go down that road tonight. It \nmakes more sense to stay with the underlying bill which essentially \ngives a 44-percent rate to those beneficiaries with lower income.\n  The problem is it does not help, as our bill does, up to \ncatastrophic, and then catastrophic is means tested. That is not the \nright thing to do, certainly at this hour after looking at it 30 \nminutes ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for whatever time \nI consume from Senator Hagel's time to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I understand I have 4 minutes 20 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I yield to my colleague whatever time he requires from my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, means testing and universal have been \nmentioned. The Senator from New Hampshire mentioned that this is a \nbrand new benefit, and that is why we are only talking about the \nprescription drug part--a brand new benefit for which young people in \nAmerica are going to be paying for years and years. It seems to make \nsense that we try to control those costs.\n  Yes, our bill means tests. So does the underlying bill. To sit up \nhere and say their bill does not means test is completely disingenuous. \nThey have several levels in the low-income areas they means test. They \nare just means testing in a different area. If you\n\n[[Page S8674]]\n\nmeans test one, why is calling our bill means testing when their bill \nmeans tests as well? How can they say our bill means tests and theirs \ndoes not? That is disingenuous.\n  It is critical that we have this debate. There was a complaint that \nthey just saw this amendment tonight. Part of the reason is that we are \ntrying to rush this bill through what is supposed to be the most \ndeliberative body in the world, and we have this false deadline that we \nmust get this bill passed before the July break. I submit, this \ndeserves more debate. The debate cannot happen when it goes to \nconference because most of the Senate is cut out then and there is no \ndebate when it comes back here.\n  With all due respect, I think we have a superior portion of the \nprescription drug plan, and I hope our colleagues vote for this plan.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, in addition to what my colleague from \nNevada has said in response to the distinguished Senator from Montana, \nthere is nothing new about this bill except two features.\n  This bill, the Hagel-Ensign bill, last year received more bipartisan \nvotes on the floor of this Senate than any other bill. There is nothing \nnew in this bill except two features. One is the $30 billion for low-\nincome seniors' additional coverage, and the other is the $35 billion \nin cost sharing for catastrophic drug costs with Medicare and Medicaid \nto dual eligibles. That is what is new in the bill.\n  To say this is new and we have just sprung this on the Senate is a \nbit disingenuous. This bill has been around for almost 4 years in its \ncurrent form.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I yield back all of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1111\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided on the \nLevin amendment No. 1111. Who yields time on the Levin amendment No. \n1111?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is my understanding the sponsor, Senator Levin, is in \nthe Chamber.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I have already spoken on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1111.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) and the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg).

Before we can go to the next amendment, we \nwill have to have order in the Senate.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided. Who seeks recognition? The \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will use 30 seconds and Senator Hagel \nwill use 30 seconds on this side.\n  The Hagel-Ensign amendment corrects several problems in the bill. Let \nme go over those real briefly.\n  We have no monthly premiums. We do not make middle-class taxpayers \npay for prescription drugs for wealthy seniors. We preserve the State \nand the private plans that are already out there, which the underlying \nbill does not do. We give most of our help to low- and moderate-income \nseniors but we still control costs in our bill.\n  I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, to summarize our amendment is simple: It \nhelps those who need it most. It helps the States provide a discount \ndrug card. It is affordable, with no monthly premiums, no deductibles, \ncatastrophic coverage, and accountable market-based tools. It is a \ncomplete, affordable, discount drug plan that the next generation of \nthis country can support. We can be proud of what we are doing for our \nseniors.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the major fatal problem with this \namendment is it dispenses with the underlying principle of the \nunderlying bill. That is universality. We are, in the legislation \nbefore us, providing for universal benefits.\n  This amendment violates that principle by saying no, not across the \nboard for Americans but, rather, it introduces a whole new means \ntesting provision for catastrophic. I just think it fatally violates \nthe spirit of the legislation we are about to pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing the amendment No. 1026, as modified. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) and the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, we have \nmade tremendous progress today, and we are on the final leg. In \nconversations with the managers, it appears we will have one more \nseries of stacked votes tonight and that will include final passage. \nThat series will be it. The bill will be done.\n  We need somewhere between 45 minutes and an hour--hopefully 45 \nminutes, and hopefully people can yield back their time--before we can \nbegin those votes. I think that is all we can say at this juncture, \nworking in good faith. There are a lot of details. We are waiting for \nsome of the final wording to come through in terms of the managers' \npackage. Once we have that, we will be able to proceed with the voting.\n  I don't know how many amendments it will be. It could be two \namendments; it could be four amendments; it could be one amendment or \npassage. But it is going to be probably two or four amendments \nbeginning in about 45 minutes to an hour.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. On the preceding rollcall vote, 28 minutes were required. \nOn this rollcall vote, 22 or 23 minutes were required. So we have over \n50 minutes on two rollcall votes. Now, time is worth a little something \naround here to many of us who don't have much time left. I wonder if we \ncan't do better than that.\n  I think the Senate ought to treat itself better than that. Senators \nowe to it other Senators to not just lag and cause rollcall votes to \nlast so long. Twenty-eight minutes on a rollcall vote? Why can't we go \nover to tomorrow? We are going to be here anyhow. Why can't we go over? \nHere it is 15 minutes after 10. Do I have the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we can do better, and I think we ought to \ndo our best to try to do maybe 10 minutes on the last series. It is \nlate at night. We have all been working about 12, 13 hours nonstop. It \nis an important bill. We set out this morning to finish tonight. People \nare here. They are ready to finish it. It is late. After talking to the \nmanagers and the leadership on both sides, there is a general consensus \nthat we ought to push ahead, get this bill done for the American \npeople.\n  We can do it. Things have gone very well. We have had adequate time \nfor debate and amendment. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \ntold me from day one: My advice to you as the majority leader is to \nmake sure you give time for debate and amendment. He did forget to tell \nme that it is sometimes hard dealing back and forth as you are waiting \nfor language to come, as you are trying to get the order for amendments \nin these last hours on a very complex bill, a bill that is as big as \nany bill we have passed this year and as complex, and it has taken a \nlittle bit more time.\n  I would have liked to have finished at 9 o'clock tonight. I think at \nthis juncture, if we proceed over the next 45 minutes--let's do those \nrollcall votes in 10 minutes--we will be out of here. People will be \nable to leave tomorrow or stay and come to the floor and talk. I think \nthat is the general sense of where we should go.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator is happy to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we are falling into this way of doing \nthings. Three-day work weeks. I will tell you, Mr. Leader, one night I \nam going to get the floor and Senators will be planning on finishing \nand going home the next day. They won't get to do that. I have seen \nthis happening over and over and over more recently. Three-day work \nweeks, and we don't come in on Friday and work and vote.\n  If the Senator will continue to yield, just briefly?\n  Mr. FRIST. If the Senator will yield for a couple more minutes \nbecause we do have people who want to get on to the business. I \ncertainly do yield for a few more minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I don't want to overtax the leader at this \npoint or overtax other Senators. Just suffice it to say, we had better \nget out of this habit of just having 3-day workweeks, staying here \nuntil 10, 11, 12 on Thursday night so that people can go out on Friday. \nI started this thing of having a week at home every 4 weeks, but we \nworked the 5 days. We worked 5 days in each of the 3 weeks in between, \nand we started voting early on Mondays and we voted a full day on \nFriday. I know things have changed. I am not majority leader. I don't \nmean to be a problem to the majority leader. But this is getting to be \na problem with some of us.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me just reply and say: Last Friday, you \nand I were on the floor at 3 in the afternoon. Just because we are not \nvoting doesn't mean we are not working. Some of us do have constituents \nwe go back to and spend time with. Some of us are working on bills and \nreading. Just because we are not voting does not mean we are not \nworking.\n  Mr. BYRD. I understand that.\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, I suggest that we go back so we can work and debate \nand get these two or four amendments finished. I would be happy to talk \nto the Senator. I understand he wants us to be efficient and work 5 \ndays a week. I would like to work 6 days a week.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have a wife at home and she needs me there. I ought to be \nthere. I have stopped early on two occasions lately just to go be with \nher and let the Senate run its course. There is going to come a time \nwhen this Senator is going to keep the Senate in session a while. He \ncan still do it.\n  I say this in the very best of spirit to the leader--and he is doing \nthe best he can--there comes a time when some of us have duties \nelsewhere and we would like to keep our rollcall records clean. Soon I \nwill have cast 17,000 rollcall votes. So I have been here for my share \nof the votes. I am getting a little bit fed up staying around here. \nThis last rollcall vote was 23 minutes and the one before that was 28 \nminutes. There is a lot of hooping and hollering. What do the American \npeople think of us? It is time we went home if we don't work.\n  I hope, Mr. Leader, that those of you who are so good at working out \nthese things can get people to have voice votes or maybe cut down the \ntime on their amendments.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest that, since we have our \ncolleagues here and ready to work, we go back to work now. I think the \nSenator made his point. I am listening and I will heed that advice and \ncounsel. I suggest we go back to work so we can get home tonight to our \nfamilies as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe we are in the process of trying \nto wrap up debate on a few amendments. I believe momentarily Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Chafee and I will be discussing our amendment. I \nwill make my comments very brief. I know Senator Feinstein wishes to \nspeak on it. I hope we can conclude debate. I think there will only be \ntwo more amendments. I urge colleagues to make their comments brief and \nlet's vote and finish action on this bill. I will defer my comments on \nthe amendment because I believe the Senator from California is ready to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1060, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1060, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment, as modified, \nis now the pending business.\n  The amendment (No. 1060), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end of title IV, insert:\n\n                       Subtitle D--Part B Premium\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, this amendment is presented on behalf \nof myself, Senators Nickles, Chafee, Lindsey Graham, Alexander, and \nMcCain.\n  This amendment provides that Medicare beneficiaries with an annual \nadjusted gross income of over $200,000, or above, pay the full cost of \nthe Medicare Part B premium. The amendment uses a sliding scale to ramp \nup the beneficiary's share of the Part B premium.\n  The amendment we are offering would hold Medicare beneficiaries with \nannual adjusted gross incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 a year \nresponsible for 50 percent of the cost of the premium. In 2003, this \namounts to $116.40 a month, or $1,396 annually, rather than $58.20 \nmonthly, or $698 annually, which is what the beneficiary pays today for \nthe benefit.\n  Medicare beneficiaries with incomes between $150,000 a year and \n$200,000 a year--that is $300,000 to $400,000 for a couple--would be \nresponsible for 75 percent of the total cost of the Part B premium. In \n2003, this amounts to $174 or $2,095 annually.\n  Medicare beneficiaries with annual incomes above $200,000--that is \n$400,000 for couples--would be responsible for 100 percent of the total \ncost of the premium. In 2003, this amounts to $232.80 a month, or \n$2,793 annually. Now, for a beneficiary with an annual income of \n$200,000, this amounts to less than 1.4 percent of their annual income. \nFor the vast majority of Medicare beneficiaries, some 37 million of the \n38 million beneficiaries, Part B premiums would remain the same as they \nare today.\n  According to the Census Bureau, about 98 percent of all Medicare \nbeneficiaries have annual incomes below $100,000. So the amendment we \nare proposing will affect about 2 percent of the most affluent and well \noff Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Let me be clear. This amendment does not deprive any Medicare \nbeneficiary of any benefit. What this amendment says is that if you can \nafford to pay the price for the Medicare Part B premium, you should. \nThose Medicare beneficiaries who have annual incomes below $100,000 a \nyear will still be able to receive a 75-percent Government subsidy for \ntheir premium.\n  Now, I strongly believe the time has come to begin to income-relate \nsome of these benefits. The Federal Government should not be \nsubsidizing the Part B premiums of those beneficiaries who can afford \nto pay for the cost of the premiums themselves.\n  Much has changed since the creation of Medicare in 1965. People are \nliving longer, due in large part to improved diagnostic tools and \ntreatment. There is no way Congress could have predicted the number of \npeople who would come to rely on Medicare or the rate at which medical \nexpenses would grow. When Medicare was established in 1965, the Part B \npremium was set at a level to cover about 50 percent of program costs. \nWith medical inflation, the dollar amount of the premium has declined \nto cover only 25 percent of program costs.\n  The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 established the \nMedicare Part B premium to equal 25 percent of the program cost from \n1996 to 1998. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 permanently established \nthe Part B premium at 25 percent. The bill to balance the budget in \n1997 that passed out of the Senate Finance Committee included a \nprovision to income relate the Medicare Part B premium. So this is \nnothing new.\n  The provision included in 1997 would have had beneficiaries with \nincomes over $50,000 for an individual and $75,000 for a couple paying \na greater share of the premium. This provision was stripped out during \nconference.\n  Well, we were in a different financial situation when Congress made \nthe decision to set the beneficiary's share of the Part B premium at 25 \npercent in 1997. At that time, we had only a $22 billion deficit. The \nnext year the budget was in surplus to the tune of $69 billion.\n  With a Federal budget deficit of over $400 billion in the year 2003 \nand an increase in the Federal debt of $5.3 trillion, for a total of \n$12 trillion in debt expected by 2013, I believe that now is the time \nto rethink the premium structure of Medicare Part B.\n  As the baby boomers age, there will be an increasing reliance on and \ndemand for the Medicare Program.\n  The number of people age 65 and older will more than double over the \ncoming decades, rising from 37 million today to 70 million in 2030 and \n82 million in 2050. Over the next 75 years, the Medicare program will \ncost 71 percent more than that provided under current law in order to \nmeet its needs.\n  It is predicted the Medicare hospital trust fund will be insolvent by \n2030. The CBO projects Medicare spending will nearly quadruple by 2075 \nin order to meet the growing need for the program, with budget outlays \nof $277 billion in 2003. This means spending for the program could \nreach $1.1 trillion by 2075.\n  With the legislation currently before the Senate, Congress is \nproposing some major changes to the Medicare Program. I am in full \nsupport of adding a drug benefit, but Congress should also rethink the \nfinancing mechanisms of the program, and this bill is short in that \ndirection. High-income beneficiaries can afford to pay a larger share \nof Medicare's costs, at least of\n\n[[Page S8678]]\n\nthe premium. They can afford to pay for the benefits they receive.\n  In light of the fact the Federal Government has just provided tax \ncuts in the range of $1,841 for people with incomes between $77,000 and \n$154,000 and up to $30,000 for people with incomes above $374,000, it \nseems to me people with annual incomes above $200,000 can afford to pay \n$2,793, which is the annual premium for Medicare Part B this year.\n  We should focus funding so that 98 percent of Medicare beneficiaries \nwho have an annual adjusted gross income of less than $100,000 can \ncontinue to access benefits. I think it is reasonable to ask those who \ncan afford it to pay a greater share of the premium. We are still \nwaiting for an official cost savings score from CBO, but I believe this \namendment could save billions of dollars.\n  Once again, Mr. President, this amendment affects less than 2 percent \nand only those with incomes of more than $200,000 a year adjusted gross \nincome would pay the full premium of about $2,900 a year. We think this \nis a reasonable proposal. It is scaled up. It impacts no one below \n$100,000 adjusted gross income a year, and at the maximum for people of \nover $200,000 a year in adjusted gross income, the premium would be \njust $2,900.\n  The income limits would be indexed to medical inflation and, \naccording to current population survey data from 2002, only 2 percent, \nor about 1 million people of the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries, \nhave incomes of over $100,000 a year. This would protect the tax \nsubsidy for people who need it by encouraging those who have the \ndollars simply to pay either a greater share of the premium cost or the \nfull premium cost.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I join with Senator Feinstein, Senator \nNickles, and others in presenting this amendment this evening. I \nbelieve this income-related Part B premium for only the wealthiest of \nseniors, a little over 1 percent of the entire Medicare population, is \nnecessary to sustain the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program.\n  I wish to make just three points on this issue. First, as Senator \nFeinstein has said, previous Congresses have worked on this issue. In \n1997, the Senate voted 70 to 30 to do exactly what we are doing here, \nand most of those Senators are still here today.\n  Second, many of these seniors can afford this added premium. Most \nseniors, it is safe to say, who are making over $100,000 a year have \nalready paid off their mortgages. They have paid off their loans. They \nhave educated their children. They can afford these higher premiums \nwhich would go from only $1,400 a year to $2,800 a year, at the most, \ndepending on the income they make. So seniors who are making $100,000 \nat the most will pay only $1,400 a year, and those making $200,000 will \npay $2,800 a year. I do not think that is too much to ask to help keep \nthis program solvent.\n\n  Finally, if we do not do this today, some other Congress is going to \ndo it. In 1997, the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of \nMedicare was created to resolve the long-term insolvency facing the \nsystem. That was in 1997 and it was known as the Breaux-Frist \nCommission. They did not report their work to Congress. They fell short \nof the votes necessary to report their work to Congress.\n  However, it is interesting to note that one of the reasons they \nfailed to get the votes to report to Congress was the President at the \ntime, President Clinton, called for putting aside 15 percent of budget \nsurpluses the next 15 years to pay down the debt and to shore up \nMedicare. Fifteen years of budget surpluses--when will we see those \nagain?--to shore up Medicare. Because the Breaux-Frist plan did not \ninclude that, they did not get the votes necessary.\n  Mr. President, now is the time to adopt this amendment. If we do not \nadopt it, future Congresses will have to wrestle with this dilemma.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, I \nam going to make a couple comments on this amendment. There may be an \namendment by the Senator from Pennsylvania that will require a vote on \nor in relation to Senator Corzine's amendment. I think we are close to \nfinishing. I hope we can. I just make those comments.\n  I compliment Senator Feinstein and also Senator Chafee, Senator \nAlexander, Senator McCain, and others for supporting this amendment. \nSenator Chafee mentioned we passed the income-related Part B premium \nseveral years ago with 70 votes. I believe the majority of people, a \nstrong majority--looking at the people who voted for it--are still \nhere. I hope we vote for it again.\n  Medicare has some big problems long term. The bill before us has a \nlot of new subsidies but does not have a lot of reform to make it \naffordable for future generations.\n  Part B right now is subsidized by general revenues 3 to 1 Federal \nGovernment and individuals. The amendment before us on Part B says if \nindividuals have income above $100,000, they should pay at least 50 \npercent. If they have income above $200,000, they should pay it all. \nFor couples, that would be $400,000. A couple could make $400,000 \nbefore they pay all their Part B premium.\n  Surely we can do that. Why should we ask our kids and/or our \ngrandkids, who might have incomes of $20,000 or $30,000, to be \nsubsidizing individuals to that degree?\n  I compliment my colleagues for this amendment. I will read from the \nannual report of the board of trustees of the HI trust fund. It says:\n\n       Similarly, SMI general revenues in the year 2002 were \n     equivalent to about 7.8 percent of personal and corporate \n     Federal income tax collected in that year. If such tax is to \n     remain at the current level relative to the national economy, \n     then SMI--\n\n  That is Part B--\n\n     general revenue financing in 2077 would represent roughly 32 \n     percent of total income taxes.\n  That is almost one-third of total income taxes. That is not \naffordable. That is not sustainable. So I think the amendment we have \nbefore us by Senator Feinstein and Senator Chafee and others is a small \nstep in the right direction to try to make this system more affordable \nfor future generations.\n  I compliment my colleagues for this amendment. I urge our colleagues \nto support this small step toward reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, a few moments ago we were made aware that \nat 9:45 tonight a close friend, a confidant, a colleague to most of us \nin this body, Strom Thurmond, passed away.\n  It was a century ago when Mark Twain was alive and Teddy Roosevelt \nwas President that James Strom Thurmond was born in South Carolina and \nat that time began a life unmatched in public service. Just about all \nof us in this body have had the real privilege of serving alongside \nStrom Thurmond. A long-time friend of Senator Thurmond, Hortense \nWoodson, once said of him:\n\n       Everything he's done has been done in the full. There's no \n     halfway doings about Strom.\n\n  Indeed, Strom Thurmond will forever be a symbol of what one person \ncan accomplish when they live life, as we all know he did, to the \nfullest. To his family and his friends, we offer our sincerest \nsympathies.\n  It was unexpected that he would die this evening while we are in the \nmiddle of completing a very historic bill, and it would be clearly \nappropriate for us to make recognition of his passing for a moment now, \nwith plans, either after completion of the bill tonight or tomorrow, \nfor people to make more extended statements.\n  Again, we extend to his family our deepest sympathies and our \ncontinued prayers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join with the majority leader in \nexpressing\n\n[[Page S8679]]\n\nour heartfelt condolences to the family and to the State of Strom \nThurmond. In many respects, he was a legend. Many of us had the good \nfortune to serve with him as a Senator. He was a Governor, a \nPresidential candidate, a soldier, a father, a citizen. In many \nrespects, he fought, lived, contributed, and legislated in a way that \nwill be written about and commented on for years and decades to come.\n  Much more will be said, but I think as we consider his contribution \ntonight we can say, as we consider the opportunity that we had to serve \nwith him, Republicans and Democrats, that it was our privilege to do \nso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my friend and colleague of 36 years in \nthe Senate is gone. A giant oak in the forest of public service has \nfallen.\n  I started with Senator Thurmond as a young law student in 1946 when \nhe first ran for Governor and have been more or less with him over \nthese many, many years. I will have a real recount of our work together \nlater. That is the way it was even though we ended up on other sides of \nthe aisle. There was never any doubt about the interests of South \nCarolina.\n  We have all this argument going on now with respect, for example, to \njudges. He and I got together very early. We agreed when his President \nwas in office from his particular party that he had the appointment, \nbut he always asked me about it and, of course, I in turn asked him \nabout it. We checked with each other. That is the kind of way we worked \ntogether over the some 36 years.\n  I can say just a living legend of South Carolina now has been \nterminated. But I want to give Nancy and the children my heartfelt \ncondolences. Peatsy and I have known them and been with them over the \nmany, many years. I will have more to say at a later time. I thank the \nleadership for their recognition. I hope, perhaps, when we complete our \nwork tonight, we might adjourn out of respect for our colleague.\n  Mr. FRIST. Why don't we take just a moment of silence in honor of \nStrom Thurmond.\n  (Moment of Silence.)\n  Mr. FRIST. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1132.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To allow eligible beneficiaries in MedicareAdvantage plans to \n        elect zero premium, stop-loss drug coverage protection)\n\n       On page 343, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n       ``(f) Zero Premium Stop-Loss Protection and Access to \n     Negotiated Prices For Eligible Beneficiaries Enrolled in \n     MedicareAdvantage Plans.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any provision of this \n     part or part D, a MedicareAdvantage plan shall be treated as \n     meeting the requirements of this section if, in lieu of the \n     qualified prescription drug coverage otherwise required, the \n     plan makes available such coverage with the following \n     modifications:\n       ``(A) No premium.--Notwithstanding subsection (d) or \n     sections 1860D-13(e)(2) and 1860D-17, the amount of the \n     MedicareAdvantage monthly beneficiary obligation for \n     qualified prescription drug coverage shall be zero.\n       ``(B) Beneficiary receives access to negotiated prices and \n     stop-loss protection for no additional premium.--\n     Notwithstanding section 1860D-6, qualified prescription drug \n     coverage shall include coverage of covered drugs that meets \n     the following requirements:\n       ``(i) The coverage has cost-sharing (for costs up to the \n     annual out-of-pocket limit under subsection (c)(4) of such \n     section) that is equal to 100 percent.\n       ``(ii) The coverage provides the limitation on out-of-\n     pocket expenditures under such subsection (c)(4), except that \n     in applying such subsection, `$5000.00' shall be substituted \n     for `$3,700' in subparagraph (B)(i)(I) of such subsection.\n       ``(iii) The coverage provides access to negotiated prices \n     under subsection (e) of such section during the entire year.\n       ``(C) Application of low-income subsidies.--Notwithstanding \n     subsection (f) or section 1860D-19, the Administrator shall \n     not apply the following provisions of subsection (a) of such \n     section:\n       ``(i) Subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph \n     (1).\n       ``(ii) Subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), and (D) of paragraph \n     (2).\n       ``(iii) Clauses (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of paragraph \n     (3)(A).\n       ``(2) Penalty for enrolling in a zero premium stop-loss \n     protection plans after initial eligibility for such \n     enrollment.--In the case of an eligible beneficiary that \n     enrolled in a plan offered pursuant to this subsection at any \n     time after the initial enrollment period described in section \n     1860D-2, the Secretary shall establish procedures for \n     imposing a monthly beneficiary obligation for enrollment \n     under such plan. The amount of such obligation shall be an \n     amount that the Administrator determines is actuarially sound \n     for each full 12-month period (in the same continuous period \n     of eligibility) in which the eligible beneficiary could have \n     been enrolled under such a plan but was not so enrolled.

Mr. President, one of the key components that many \nMembers on this side of the aisle would like to see accomplished is to \ndraw as many people as possible into the competitive model set up in \nthis bill. We believe it is the more efficient, higher quality delivery \nof health care services, the Medicare Advantage plan.\n  Unfortunately, through negotiations, a lot of the incentives the \nPresident has to encourage people to get into those plans and thereby \nmake them work have been taken out in the current version on the floor. \nThat is to the great consternation, I know, of the White House and many \nMembers on this side of the aisle.\n  For quite some time I have been trying to think how they can create \nincentives--carrots, if you will, as opposed to sticks--to encourage \npeople to get into these kinds of plans. Originally, I intended to \noffer a differential benefit--in other words, a benefit that would have \nwhat I call a standard benefit in the fee-for-service option and an \nenhanced benefit in the Medicare Advantage option. I was fairly \nconvinced, in discussing with the people on my side of the aisle, we \nprobably would not have a chance to succeed; that there were people who \nhad made commitments that a differential benefit was not something for \nthis time.\n  I went about trying to figure out, could we create incentives to \npeople to come into Medicare Advantage, which I believe is the future \nof Medicare and the best way to run the system without creating a \ndifferential benefit. The amendment before the Senate does that. The \namendment before the Senate creates an option for beneficiaries who \nparticipate in Medicare Advantage. It is a pharmaceutical option. \nInstead of just having no pharmaceutical benefit, which you could if \nyou do not get into the Medicare Advantage Program, we have the \nstandard benefit which is required if you participate in the PPOs, \nHMOs, and POSs that will be created here.\n  What I will do with this amendment is create another option for \nseniors who select Medicare Advantage. That option would be a zero \npremium catastrophic benefit. So you could choose between the standard \nbenefit, the $35 premium, and the 50 percent copay, and the donut hole, \nand all the things described over and over again, or if you did not \nwant to pay a premium but wanted some catastrophic coverage,\n\n[[Page S8680]]\n\nwanted some benefit, no premium, no cost, you could join this.\n  The CBO scored this as attracting twice as many people into the PPOs \nand HMOs as the underlying bill. It would make those plans much more \ndesirable for beneficiaries. I believe that should be one of the goals \nof this legislation, to make the new and improved and stronger plan a \nmore robust plan.\n  Unfortunately, according to the Congressional Budget Office, when \npeople move from the fee-for-service plan into the Medicare Advantage \nplan, the Congressional Budget Office assumes those plans will be more \nexpensive. And because they will be more expensive, this amendment \ncosts money. It doubles the participation but costs $20, to $25 \nbillion, which is the back of the envelope. And God bless the CBO; that \nis the best they could do at this late hour.\n  I firmly believe this is a reasonable compromise between those who \nwould not want to have the differential benefit and those who would \nbecause it is unfair to the fee-for-service participants and those who \nbelieve we need to have an incentive for people to get into the \nMedicare Advantage Program. This strikes the compromise. This is where \nwe could go.\n  There are all sorts of things we have done to eliminate adverse \nselection and all the other problems inherent in offering two different \nbenefits. We believe we actually address the vast majority of those \nproblems in this amendment. Nevertheless, we have run into the \nroadblock that this bill has run into the entire time when it comes to \nthe competitive model and CBO and their estimation of costs.\n  For the record, the White House does not see it that way. The White \nHouse sees the competitive model as saving money. Under their scoring, \nthis would probably actually save money and move people into a higher \nquality, more efficient system.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1132 Withdrawn\n\n  As a result of the fact of the score which is $20 to $25 billion, and \nwe do not have that, I am going to withdraw my amendment and hope this \nidea which I believe is in the center here is a compromise between two \ncompeting ideas of how to structure this bill.\n  It will be considered in conference as a way of trying to bring the \ntwo sides together in something that does not disadvantage the fee-for-\nservice plan but creates an opportunity for incentives to go to the \nMedicare Advantage plan.\n  Mr. President, with that I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my colleague from Pennsylvania. Especially \nthis late at night, when a lot of us are thinking about our departed \nfriend and colleague, Senator Thurmond, I appreciate his withdrawing \nthis amendment.\n  For the information of our colleagues, I think we are very close to \nfinishing this bill. We may have one or two rollcall votes. I think we \nare just about ready to vote on the Feinstein-Chafee amendment and \npossibly one other amendment, and I think we are very close to be able \nto vote on final passage, for the information of our colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1060\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment to address the \namendment of the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and her \ncolleagues, in terms of means testing the Medicare system. That is what \nwe would be doing, changing what is effectively an insurance system \ninto a welfare system. There is, really, no question about that.\n  The fact is, the Part B of the Medicare system is basically a \nprogressive system as it is at the present time. Wealthy people are \npaying a great deal more into that system than they are taking out.\n  My concern is, if this passes, it is only a question of time before \nthe healthiest individuals who can qualify under the Part B premium are \ngoing to leave the Medicare system and it is going to deteriorate into \na general welfare system. The kind of Medicare system seniors relied \non, day in and day out, would be destroyed. Make no mistake about it.\n  That is why the AARP is strongly opposed to it, as well as the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security.\n  I hope this amendment is not accepted. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 990, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 990, previously adopted, be modified with language I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

or\n       (B) directly causes an unreasonable increase of \n     expenditures under the medicare program for the provision of \n     such services that is directly attributable to such \n     clarification;\n       (2) the specific data evidencing the amount of any increase \n     in expenditures that is a directly attributable to the \n     demonstration project (expressed both in absolute dollar \n     terms and as a percentage) above expenditures that would \n     otherwise have been incurred for home health services under \n     the medicare program;

The report shall \n     include an evaluation of patient outcomes under the \n     demonstration project, as well as an analysis of the cost \n     effectiveness of the demonstration project.\n       (e) Waiver Authority.--The Secretary shall waive compliance \n     with the requirements of title XVIII of the Social Security \n     Act to such extent and for such period as the Secretary \n     determines is necessary to conduct the demonstration project \n     under this section.\n       (f) Funding.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall provide for the \n     transfer from the Federal Supplementary Insurance Trust Fund \n     established under section 1841 of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395t) of such funds as are necessary for the costs of \n     carrying out the demonstration project under this section.\n       (2) Budget neutrality.--In conducting the demonstration \n     project under this section, the Secretary shall ensure that \n     the aggregate payments made by the Secretary do not exceed \n     the amount which the Secretary would have paid if the \n     demonstration project under this section was not implemented.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1058\n\n (Purpose: To restore the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to the \n  financial position it would have been in if a clerical bookkeeping \n                        error had not occurred)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE STRUCTURE OF \n                   MEDICARE REFORM AND THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   BENEFIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's seniors deserve a fiscally-strong Medicare \n     system that fulfills its promise to them and future retirees.\n       (2) The impending retirement of the ``baby boom'' \n     generation will dramatically increase the costs of providing \n     Medicare benefits. Medicare costs will double relative to the \n     size of the economy from 2 percent of GDP today to 4 percent \n     in 2025 and double again to 8 percent of GDP in 2075. This \n     growth will accelerate substantially when Congress adds a \n     necessary prescription drug benefit.\n       (3) Medicare's current structure does not have the \n     flexibility to quickly adapt to rapid advances in modern \n     health care. Medicare lags far behind other insurers in \n     providing prescription drug coverage, disease management \n     programs, and host of other advances. Reforming Medicare to \n     create a more self-adjusting, innovative structure is \n     essential to improve Medicare's efficiency and the quality of \n     the medical care it provides.\n       (4) Private-sector choice for Medicare beneficiaries would \n     provide two key benefits: it would be tailored to the needs \n     of America's seniors, not the government, and would create a \n     powerful incentive for private-sector Medicare plans to \n     provide the best quality health care to seniors at the most \n     affordable price.\n       (5) The method by which the national preferred provider \n     organizations in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     Program have been reimbursed has proven to be a reliable and \n     successful mechanism for providing Members of Congress and \n     federal employees with excellent health care choices.\n       (6) Unlike the Medicare payment system, which has had to be \n     changed by Congress every few years, the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program has existed for 43 years with minimal \n     changes from Congress.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that Medicare reform legislation should:\n\n[[Page S8684]]\n\n       (1) Ensure that prescription drug coverage is directed to \n     those who need it most.\n       (2) Provide that government contributions used to support \n     Medicare Advantage plans are based on market principles \n     beginning in 2006 to ensure the long and short term viability \n     of such options for America's seniors.\n       (3) Develop a payment system for the Medicare Advantage \n     preferred provider organizations similar to the payment \n     system used for the national preferred provider organizations \n     in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n       (4) Limit the addition of new unfunded obligations in the \n     Medicare program so that the long-term solvency of this \n     important program is not further jeopardized.\n       (5) Incorporate private sector, market-based elements, that \n     do not rely on the inefficient Medicare price control \n     structure.\n       (6) Keep the cost of structural changes and new benefits \n     within the $400 billion provided for under the current \n     Congressional Budget Resolution for implementing Medicare \n     reform and providing a prescription drug benefit.\n       (7) Preserve the current employer-sponsored retiree health \n     plans and not design a benefit which has the unintended \n     consequences of supplanting private coverage.\n       (8) Incorporate regulatory reform proposals to eliminate \n     red tape and reduce costs.\n       (9) Restore the right of Medicare beneficiaries and their \n     doctors to work together to provide services, allow private \n     fee for service plans to set their own premiums, and permit \n     seniors to add their own dollars beyond the government \n     contribution.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 989, as modified\n\n   (Purpose: To increase medicare payments for home health services \n                       furnished in a rural area)\n\n       At the appropriate place in subtitle C of title IV, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PAYMENT REDUCTIONS UNDER \n                   MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fees Medicare pays physicians were reduced by 5.4 \n     percent across-the-board in 2002;\n       (2) recent action by Congress narrowly averted another \n     across-the-board reduction of 4.4 percent for 2003;\n       (3) based on current projections, the Centers for Medicare \n     & Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that, absent legislative \n     or administrative action, fees will be reduced across-the-\n     board once again in 2004 by 4.2 percent;\n       (4) the prospect of continued payment reductions under the \n     Medicare physician fee schedule for the foreseeable future \n     threatens to destabilize an important element of the program, \n     namely physician participation and willingness to accept \n     Medicare patients;\n       (5) the primary source of this instability is the \n     sustainable growth rate (SGR), a system of annual spending \n     targets for physicians' services under Medicare;\n       (6) the SGR system has a number of defects that result in \n     unrealistically low spending targets, such as the use of the \n     increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) as a proxy for \n     increases in the volume and intensity of services provided by \n     physicians, no tolerance for variance between growth in \n     Medicare beneficiary health care costs and our Nation's GDP, \n     and a requirement for immediate recoupment of the difference;\n       (7) both administrative and legislative action are needed \n     to return stability to the physician payment system;\n       (8) using the discretion given to it by Medicare law, CMS \n     has included expenditures for prescription drugs and \n     biologicals administered incident to physicians' services \n     under the annual spending targets without making appropriate \n     adjustments to the targets to reflect price increases in \n     these drugs and biologicals or the growing reliance on such \n     therapies in the treatment of Medicare patients;\n       (9) between 1996 and 2002, annual Medicare spending on \n     these drugs grew from $1,800,000,000 to $6,200,000,000, or \n     from $55 per beneficiary to an estimated $187 per \n     beneficiary;\n       (10) although physicians are responsible for prescribing \n     these drugs and biologicals, neither the price of the drugs \n     and biologicals, nor the standards of care that encourage \n     their use, are within the control of physicians; and\n       (11) SGR target adjustments have not been made for cost \n     increases due to new coverage decisions and new rules and \n     regulations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) \n     should use its discretion to exclude drugs and biologicals \n     administered incident to physician services from the \n     sustainable growth rate (SGR) system;\n       (2) CMS should use its discretion to make SGR target \n     adjustments for new coverage decisions and new rules and \n     regulations; and\n       (3) in order to provide ample time for Congress to consider \n     more fundamental changes to the SGR system, the conferees on \n     the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003 \n     should include in the conference agreement a provision to \n     establish a minimum percentage update in physician fees for \n     the next 2 years and should consider adding provisions that \n     would mitigate the swings in payment, such as establishing \n     multi-year adjustments to recoup the variance and creating \n     ``tolerance'' corridors for variations around the update \n     target trend.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 960\n\n    (Purpose: To Require a Streamlining of the Medicare Regulations)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I rise to make a brief \nstatement, like my colleague from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, \nabout the passing of Senator Thurmond. This is something I really don't \nknow how to put in words. All of us from South Carolina knew Senator \nThurmond in so many ways. But his colleagues in this body, the vast \nmajority of you, have served with him for many years. You have great \nadmiration and fondness for Senator Thurmond but I stand before you as \nhis successor. I often state back home that we change Senators every 50 \nyears and that so many people have been waiting to take Senator \nThurmond's place. The jokes just go on and on about what a rich life he \nhas lived.\n  Tonight his family is mourning his passing. Whether a person lives to \nbe 100 or 200, it is difficult to lose your father. If you lose someone \nyou love, it is always difficult. But when you think about Senator \nThurmond, you always have a smile on your face.\n  He lived a rich life. He lived at times a controversial life. But the \nbiggest testament I can give to Senator Thurmond is that he changed. He \nchanged with the times.\n  Those of you who embraced him during difficult times your love was \nmuch appreciated. Recently people have tried to freeze Senator Thurmond \nin time which is unfair to him or anyone else. Those who knew him best \nunderstood that he changed with the times. And his legacy in my State \nacross party lines, across racial lines, and across regional lines was \nthat he was the go-to guy. If you had a problem with your family or \nwith your business, the first thought in your mind, if the Government \nwas involved, or if somebody was treating you unfairly, was get on the \nphone and call Senator Thurmond. You would get a phone call back, and \nhe would go to bat for you. Whether you owned the company, or you were \nthe janitor, whether you were black, white, rich or poor, his office \nand he as a person had a reputation of going to bat for individuals. To \nme, that is his greatest legacy.\n  I stand before you as his successor--but not only that, as his \nfriend. He embraced my campaign in 1995. He came to campaign for me \nwhen he was 93 years of age. And I was worried to death about if he \ncould make it through the day. Three days later I was glad to see him \nleave because he about killed me.\n  He had enthusiasm and passion like no one I have ever met in my life. \nHe did things he didn't have to do. He was a sitting judge in South \nCarolina in his 40s. He left the judgeship to go volunteer for the \nArmy. He landed in a glider on D-Day, he was shot up, the pilot was \nkilled, and he fought the Germans until they quit, and then he went \nover to Japan and fought until they quit.\n  This man, your friend, my friend, South Carolina's favorite son, is \ngone but he will never be forgotten. His biggest legacy is in the small \nthings he did--not the large things he did. There are so many large \nthings he accomplished. But he lives on in families.\n\n[[Page S8686]]\n\nGreat relationships were established, and good constituent service. He \nwon his last election by getting more African-American votes than any \nRepublican in the South.\n  All I can say about Senator Thurmond is that we pray for his family, \nwe mourn his loss, but we thank God that He provided us a great public \nservant.\n  Well done, Senator Thurmond.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, is there no discussion necessary on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would just like to say that we have \nhelp for our teaching hospitals in the managers' amendment. It is not \nmuch. But I am working with all of the managers, the ranking member as \nwell as the chairman, to try to increase funding for teaching \nhospitals.\n  I want to point out our teaching hospitals must have the support that \nis in this bill at a higher percentage if we are going to keep the \nyoung physicians trained and if our country will keep the greatest \nhealth care system in the world.\n  I thank the managers for helping me put that in the managers' \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8687]]\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I oppose the managers' amendment because \nof an amendment that is in the managers' amendment, the Corzine \namendment which provides three States the opportunity to basically opt \nout of the Medicare Program for prescription drugs and have an \nentitlement flow of funding going to the States for the States to \ndevelop their own stand-alone drug benefit. As a result of that, States \nlike mine and two others will not have the advantage of an integrated \ndrug benefit which I fought very strongly for on this floor and which I \nbelieve will also lead potentially to this unlimited entitlement flow \nof funds to the States because of the way this language is drafted, the \npotential for lots of mischief in respect to double dipping, inter-\ngovernment transfers, disproportionate share payments. We could be \nopening a virtual Pandora's box. Yes. For my States and two others. But \nI think, frankly, it is not good policy and does not do the kind of \nimprovement of the overall Medicare program which my State should \nparticipate in as well as the other States represented here.\n  There is no Federal oversight by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices for this plan.\n  There are a host of other problems with this amendment. It is my \nunderstanding that the managers gave a commitment that this amendment \nbe included in the package. And so to honor the chairman's commitment, \nI will not object to this amendment nor call for a vote to strike the \namendment. But I, unfortunately, will have to vote against this bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed \nto.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1133) was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Amendments En Bloc Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \npending amendments.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 953, 958, 934, 964, 965, 980, 979, 973, 986, \n990, 977, 993, 962, 1004, 1019, 1020, 1021, 999, 954, 1037, 1039, 1051, \n1012, 1061, 1075, 1076, 1077, 1024, 1073, 1088, 1089, 1090, 1091, 1110, \nand 1041) were withdrawn.\n\n\n                             Adult Day Care\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, during consideration of this bill in the \nFinance Committee, I submitted language regarding adult day care which \nI and my staff were told by Finance Committee staff was acceptable and \nincluded in S. 1, the Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of \n2003, as part of the base bill to be considered on the Senate floor. I \nwas very thankful for your consideration and approval of my language, \nChairman Grassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, Senator Bunning, I remember your submitted \nlanguage regarding Adult Day Care.\n  Mr. BUNNING. After we voted to pass S. 1 out of the Finance \nCommittee, I have since learned that the adult day care language \naccepted and made part of the bill is not the language I submitted at \nall, but instead it is language based on a bill introduced by Senator \nSantorum related to the same issue.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, this is true, and I apologize for the inaccurate \ninformation and misunderstanding provided to you and your staff from \nthe Finance Committee on this issue. The language included in the base \nbill instead is based on Senator Santorum's bill.\n  Mr. BUNNING. While Senator Santorum's adult day care proposal and my \nadult day care language are different, they both share the same goal of \nproviding services to those special and needy adults who require extra \nattention and care. However, I have some differences with Senator \nSantorum's proposal, and he has some differences with my proposed \nlanguage.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Yes, we do share the same goal on this adult day care \nissue, and we do have some fundamental differences with one another's \nproposals and language on the matter.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, that is my understanding, as well.\n  Mr. BUNNING. I am hopeful that once this bill gets to conference, we \nand our staffs can work out our differences on this adult day care \nissue and find a solution that is amenable to all of us. It is also my \nunderstanding the current version of the House of Representative's \nprescription drug benefit bill includes the adult day care language \nwhich is identical to my language.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am willing to work on this matter further, and do \nagree that since the Senate's and House of Representative's versions on \nthe adult day care language will be different, we will have to find a \nsolution to our differences on this important issue.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will be happy to work with both of you and our staffs \nto rectify this problem. Adult day care is an important issue, and \nbeing that the Senate and House of Representatives will have different \nlanguage on this issue, it must be conferenced in a way to ensure that \nall with interests in this matter, including interested provider and \nsenior organizations, are involved and approving of the final adult day \ncare language. I am looking forward to further working with both of you \non this matter.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Santorum. I \nappreciate both your willingness to revisit this matter and your \nleadership on this important legislation for our seniors.\n\n\n                            fee for service\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I believe in assuring the ability of \nseniors who choose to do so to add their own funds on top of the \ngovernment contribution in order to participate in private fee-for-\nservice plans under Medicare. I also believe that private fee-for-\nservice plans should be able to provide an unmanaged form of the \nsubsidized prescription drug benefit.\n  Accordingly, I am committed to ensuring that the bill reported from \nthe conference committee that will consider S. 1 and H.R. 1 \nincorporates the functional equivalent of those provisions in H.R. 1 \nthat permit private fee-for-service plans to provide the subsidized \nprescription drug benefit as an unmanaged benefit whose premium amount, \njust like the premium amount such plans charge for the core Medicare \nbenefit under current law, is not subject to governmental review or \napproval.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree.\n\n\n                         repeal of therapy caps\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I will withdraw my amendment to repeal the \narbitrary beneficiary caps on therapy. However, I would urge my \ncolleague from Iowa, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, to work in \nconference to find a way to delay this law. As you know, the \nbeneficiary caps will have one of three results--beneficiaries will \neither: (1) pay 100 percent out-of-their own pocket once the caps are \nexceeded; (2) self-ration therapy care; or (3) forgo medically \nnecessary care altogether. Mr. President, I recognize that the Chairman \nhas been a voice to eliminate these caps and hope that a final Medicare \nbill further delays implementation of them.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I would like the opportunity to join my \ncolleague from Nevada to speak in support of repealing the caps on \noutpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language \npathology.\n  The current therapy cap discriminates against the most vulnerable of \nMedicare beneficiaries. While the majority of enrollees will not exceed \nan annual $1,590 limitation on rehabilitation services, approximately \n13 percent of seniors and individuals with disabilities covered by \nMedicare will be forced to pay for medically necessary services out of \npocket.\n  This is a particularly burdensome situation for beneficiaries living \nin rural communities. Most likely to be harmed are beneficiaries who \nhave experienced a stroke or hip fracture or who have Parkinson's \ndisease or other conditions that require extensive rehabilitation \nfollowing injury or illness.\n  I urge the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee to \nwork with me and my colleague, the Senator from Nevada, on repealing \nthis cap or at least suspending it for 1 or 2 years. My colleague and I \nhave sponsored legislation (S. 569) to permanently repeal this cap. Our \nbill has\n\n[[Page S8688]]\n\nbeen cosponsored by 41 members of the Senate.\n  Again, I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleagues from Nevada \ntoday. It is my sincere hope, Mr. President, that we will be able to \naddress the issue of the burdensome $1,590 cap on outpatient therapy \nservices.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank both the Senator from Nevada and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas for their comments and for withdrawing the amendment. As \nyou may know, I asked CMS Administrator Scully at the Finance Committee \nmarkup to further delay implementation of these beneficiary caps. \nUnfortunately, as a result of the Senate Budget Resolution constraints, \nI do not have Medicare dollars to repeal the beneficiary cap on therapy \nservices. I agree that this arbitrary limit does not make sense and \nhave sought to address this issue in the past. I will work in \nconference to enact a therapy cap moratorium and appreciate your hard \nwork and passion on this issue.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I appreciate the Chairman's leadership on this issue and \nI thank my colleague for agreeing, at a minimum, to work toward another \nmoratorium on implementation of the therapy cap. I would also like to \nthank the Senator from Arkansas for her words of support. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this full statement be included in the \nRecord as if read.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Kyl's sense of \nthe Senate resolution to S. 1. His resolution asks Congress to rectify \nproblems with the formula that is used to update Medicare physician \nreimbursement.\n  Due to flaws in this formula, payment rates for physicians and other \npractitioners are predicted to fall by 4.2 percent in 2004. This cut in \nphysician compensation would be the fifth since 1991 including a 5.4 \npercent decrease in 2002. According to Medicare's own conservative \nestimates, between the years 1991 and 2003, reductions for physicians \nand other health professionals resulted in Medicare physician \nreimbursement that equates to 14 percent below their actual practice \ncosts. The 2004 reduction would decrease Utah physician income by $13 \nmillion which translates to $3003 per physician in 2004. And this is in \naddition to the $9 million decrease in reimbursement that Utah \nphysicians received in 2002. Furthermore, unless we correct this \nformula, it is estimated that more cuts will occur in 2005, 2006, and \n2007.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, has stated that \nthese reimbursement reductions are the result of a problem with the \nSustained Growth Rate that is used as part of the calculation to adjust \nrates each year. The SGR expenditure target is linked to gross domestic \nproduct. Therefore, the formula may decrease Medicare reimbursement for \nphysicians and other practitioners when health care volume increases \noutstrip increases in the gross domestic product. The problem is \nmagnified when gross domestic product decreases. Essentially, the \nformula penalizes physicians for factors over which they have no \ncontrol.\n  It is true that as the population of our country ages, the volume of \nMedicare health care services consumed increases. However, physicians \nhave no control over this and our Medicare system penalizes them \nbecause of it. As a result, some physicians no longer take new Medicare \npatients, some decline to participate in the Medicare program \naltogether, and young people are considering other professions.\n  I would submit that as the baby-boomer generation ages and increasing \nnumbers of Americans become Medicare beneficiaries, we need physicians \nand other health care providers more than ever. If anything, we should \nbe rewarding our physicians, not penalizing them.\n  An additional problem with the Sustained Growth Rate calculation is \nthat it does not account for many changes in health care that improve \nquality but increase physician work also. The federal government \nactively promotes new coverage decisions, quality improvement \nactivities and other initiatives that benefit patients but are not \ntaken into account by the Sustained Growth Rate calculation.\n  MedPAC's recommendation to Congress is that annual updates in \nphysician payments should reflect increases in the Medicare Economic \nIndex or MEI rather than the gross domestic product. Using the Medicare \nEconomic Index would eliminate the penalty that physicians and other \npractitioners currently experience when the volume of health care \nservices increases due to factors that they are unable to control.\n  What we have before us is a flawed formula that is threatening the \nhealth of Americans and the future of our country. Congress has \naddressed this problem before, but it seems that we were only putting a \nbandage over the wound; we never cured the disease that caused it. The \nwound continues to fester and it will continue to do so until we cure \nthe problem. And the cure, it seems, is to revise the formula.\n  I for one, am tired of applying bandages to this wound. I believe \nthat it is time to address this problem directly and definitively. I \nurge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this resolution and in \nworking to correct this problem.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I joined my colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, in offering an amendment to promote \nbetter care for frail elderly and disabled. This amendment will allow \nthe Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \ndesignate health plans that disproportionately serve special needs \nbeneficiaries as specialized Medicare Advantage plans.\n  A number of States have successfully chosen to serve seniors and the \ndisabled by combining Medicare and Medicaid services through a waiver \napproved by the Department of Health and Human Services that integrates \nservices under Medicare and Medicaid capitated financing arrangements. \nThese programs provide beneficiaries with a comprehensive benefit \npackage that combines the services traditionally provided by Medicare, \nMedicaid, and home and community based waiver programs.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Partnership Program is \none such success, a community-based program that has improved the \nquality, access, and cost-effectiveness of the care delivered to its \nbeneficiaries. Perhaps most important to the beneficiaries, these \nprograms help the disabled and the frail elderly remain in their own \ncommunity, and avoid institutionalized care. Wisconsin is lucky to have \nfour such programs across our State: Elder Care and Community Living \nAlliance of Dane County, Community Care for the Elderly of Milwaukee \nCounty, and Community Health Partnership Eau Claire, Dunn, and Chippewa \nCounties.\n  In order to qualify for these programs, a person must be Medicaid-\neligible, have physical disabilities or frailties of aging, and require \na level of care provided by nursing homes. Through programs such as the \nWisconsin Partnership Program, these frail elderly and disabled \nbeneficiaries are able to receive quality preventive care upfront, \nwhich allows more beneficiaries to stay in their communities and \nreduces the rate of hospitalization.\n  In Wisconsin, about 26 percent of all Medicaid recipients age 65 or \nolder are in nursing homes. This rate drops dramatically for those \nenrolled in the Wisconsin Partnership Program, where only 5.9 percent \nof recipients age 65 or older are in nursing homes.\n  While the Wisconsin Partnership Program is a success, we must ensure \nthat the Federal Government continues to support these State-based \nsolutions to our long-term care needs and other specialty managed care \nprograms that focus on frail, chronically ill seniors. Last year I \nintroduced the Frail Elderly Act of 2002, which promoted specialty \nmanaged care programs and helped those already in existence to continue \nto operate. This amendment will work to accomplish both goals by \nproviding a population-based designation that allows plans to be \nrecognized for specialization in services for special needs \nbeneficiaries. By establishing this specialized designation, we hope to \nbe able to more easily move specialized plans from demonstration status \nto mainstream provider status, helping to promote a more effective way \nof caring for the frail elderly and disabled.\n  Mr. President I also want to point out that this amendment does not \nchange payments, does not change administrative rules, and therefore \ndoe not have a fiscal effect.\n  Fundamental long-term care reform is vital to any health care reform \nthat\n\n[[Page S8689]]\n\nCongress may consider. As part of these reforms, we must support State \nand local efforts to encourage care for the most vulnerable \npopulations. We must provide our seniors and disabled with real \nchoices. They are entitled to the opportunity to continue to live in \nthe homes and communities that they helped build and sustain. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment that will help provide a measure \nof support for the most frail elderly and disabled to allow them to \nstay in their own homes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters of support \nfor this amendment, from the Community Health Partnership and Elder \nCare of Dane County be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                         Community\n\n\n                                     Health Partnership, inc.,\n\n                                    Eau Claire, WI, June 26, 2003.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am writing to express my support \n     for the amendment you will be offering with Senator Gordon \n     Smith to create a designation for Medicare Advantage plans \n     that target special needs beneficiaries. Community Health \n     Partnership, Inc. (CHP) is one of four Wisconsin Partnership \n     Program demonstration sites that has developed innovative \n     models of care specifically for frail seniors and people with \n     physical disabilities that would benefit from a specialty \n     designation.\n       The Wisconsin Partnership Program (WPP) is an integrated \n     program of acute and long-term care services designed to \n     improve access to needed care, reduce fragmentation of care \n     across providers and settings, and help people remain \n     independent in the community, while achieving cost savings. \n     The target populations for WPP include both elderly and \n     physically disabled individuals who meet nursing home level \n     of care criteria. CHP serves both populations in a 3 county, \n     rural area. Participants must be Medicaid eligible or dually \n     eligible for Medicare and Medicaid services. A hallmark of \n     this program is the use of an inter-disciplinary care team \n     comprised of a physician, nurse practitioner and social \n     worker that help coordinate beneficiaries' care across all \n     health care settings. The WPP also participates in the \n     Medicare/Medicaid Integration Program, a demonstration to \n     test strategies for integrating Medicare and Medicaid \n     services. The goal of this program is to create a seamless \n     system of care for beneficiaries and to reduce costs related \n     to duplication of services and administrative functions \n     across programs.\n       Like a number of other specialty Medicare+Choice programs, \n     the WPP currently operates under demonstration authority, \n     which expires at the end of next year. And, like virtually \n     all Medicare demonstration programs, there is no mechanism \n     for transitioning from demonstration status into the \n     mainstream of Medicare. I understand that The Medicare \n     Prescription Drug and Reform Act of 2003 begins to address \n     this problem by establishing a special designation for \n     specialized Medicare Advantage plans that exclusively serve \n     special needs beneficiaries. Your amendment would allow the \n     Secretary also to designate as specialized Medicare Advantage \n     plans those that disproportionately serve special needs \n     beneficiaries.\n       The expansion of the specialized Medicare Advantage \n     designation would provide CHP and other WPP members \n     additional flexibility in expanding our unique program to \n     other beneficiary groups such as those who are eligible for \n     Medicare, but not Medicaid and ``pre-duals''--those who are \n     at risk of spending down to Medicaid based on health status \n     and/or income limitations. Targeting healthy beneficiaries \n     before they become frail or disabled would reduce long-run \n     Medicare and Medicaid costs by preventing or delaying health \n     care decline and the need for costly medical or long-term \n     care services. Your amendment also would offer CHP a \n     mechanism to serve non-special needs beneficiaries as a \n     strategy for expanding our membership under a mainstream \n     model or reducing our risk through a more representative \n     cross-section of Medicare beneficiaries in West Central \n     Wisconsin.\n       Your compassion for seniors, disabled and other special \n     needs beneficiaries has been evident since you served as the \n     Chair of the Senate Aging Committee in the State of \n     Wisconsin. The amendment you are offering to the Senate \n     Medicare bill only provides further evidence that you \n     continue to be hard at work on behalf of Wisconsin's most \n     vulnerable populations. Thank you for all of your work on \n     behalf of Wisconsin's seniors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Karen A. Bullock,\n     CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Elder Care of Dane County,\n\n                                       Madison, WI, June 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Feingold: I am writing to express my support \n     for the amendment you will be offering with Senator Gordon \n     Smith to create a designation for Medicare Advantage plans \n     that target special needs beneficiaries. Elder Care of Dane \n     County is one of four Wisconsin Partnership Program \n     demonstration sites that has developed innovative models of \n     care specifically for frail seniors and people with physical \n     disabilities that would benefit from a specialty designation.\n       The Wisconsin Partnership Program (WWP) is an integrated \n     program of acute and long-term care services designed to \n     improve access to needed care, reduce fragmentation of care \n     across providers and settings, and help people remain \n     independent in the community, while achieving cost savings. \n     The target populations for WWP include both elderly and \n     physically disabled individuals who meet nursing home level \n     of care criteria. Elder Care Partnership serves frail elderly \n     beneficiaries. Participants must be Medicaid eligible or \n     dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid services. A \n     hallmark of this program is the use of an inter-disciplinary \n     care team comprised of a physician, nurse practitioner and \n     social worker that help coordinate beneficiaries' care across \n     all health care settings. The WWP also participates in the \n     Medicare/Medicaid Integration Program, a demonstration to \n     test strategies for integrating Medicare and Medicaid \n     services. The goal of this program is to create a seamless \n     system of care for beneficiaries and to reduce costs related \n     to duplication of services and administrative functions \n     across programs.\n       Like a number of other speciality Medicare+Choice programs, \n     the WWP currently operates under demonstration authority, \n     which expires at the end of next year. And, like virtually \n     all Medicare demonstration programs, there is no mechanism \n     for transitioning from demonstration status into the \n     mainstream of Medicare. I understand that The Medicare \n     Prescription Drug and Reform Act of 2003 begins to address \n     this problem by establishing a special designation for \n     specialized Medicare Advantage plans that exclusively serve \n     special needs beneficiaries. Your amendment would allow the \n     Secretary also to designate as specialized Medicare Advantage \n     plans those that disproportionately serve special needs \n     beneficiaries.\n       The expansion of the specialized Medicare Advantage \n     designation would provide Elder Care and other WWP members \n     additional flexibility in expanding our unique program to \n     other beneficiary groups such as those who are eligible for \n     Medicare, but not Medicaid and ``pre-duals''--those who are \n     at risk of spending down to Medicaid based on health status \n     and/or income limitations. Targeting healthy beneficiaries \n     before they become frail or disabled would reduce long-run \n     Medicare and Medicaid costs by preventing or delaying health \n     care decline and the need for costly medical or long-term \n     care services. Your amendment also would offer Elder Care a \n     mechanism to serve non-special needs beneficiaries as a \n     strategy for expanding our membership under a mainstream \n     model or reducing our risk through a more representative \n     cross-section of Medicare beneficiaries in Madison.\n       Your compassion for seniors, disabled and other special \n     needs beneficiaries has been evident since you served as the \n     Chair of the Senate Aging Committee in the State of \n     Wisconsin. The amendment you are offering to the Senate \n     Medicare bill only provides further evidence that you \n     continue to be hard at work on behalf of Wisconsin's most \n     vulnerable populations. Thank you for all of your work on \n     behalf of Wisconsin's seniors.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Karen Musser,\n                                                              CEO.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Gregg-Schumer \namendment which was adopted last week. This amendment was based on a \npiece of legislation, S. 1225, the Greater Access to Affordable \nPharmaceuticals Act of 2003, reported by the HELP Committee on June \n11th.\n  I want to take this opportunity to explain why I cast the lone vote \nagainst this amendment. It is my hope that when my colleagues consider \nmy explanation that they may be open to making additional changes to \nthis very important amendment as the process moves forward.\n  Let me start by commending Senators Gregg, Schumer, McCain, and \nKennedy for their work in developing this provision which I believe is \na significant improvement on legislation that was adopted by the Senate \nlast Congress, S. 812.\n  The Gregg-Schumer amendment relates to a complex and often admittedly \nconfusing law I coauthored with my friend, Representative Henry Waxman \nof California in 1984 the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act.\n  I chaired a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee in May of 2001 \nthat helped document some abuses that were occurring in the law. Since \nour last hearing on this issue, much has happened.\n  Both the Federal Trade Commission and the Food and Drug \nAdministration played a constructive role in attempting to end several \nmechanisms by which some research-based and generic\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\ndrug firms were attempting to game the system put in place by the 1984 \nand subsequent court decisions to avoid competition in the marketplace.\n  The FTC succeeded in achieving several widely-publicized consent \ndecrees with a variety of offending firms under the existing antitrust \nstatutes.\n  In addition, the FTC conducted an exhaustive survey and study of how \ncertain provisions of the 1984 Waxman-Hatch Act affected competition in \nthe pharmaceutical industry.\n  The FTC study contained two major recommendations. The first \naddressed the use of the statutory 30-month stay granted by the 1984 \nlaw in situations where patents are challenged by generic competitors. \nThe FTC recommended that the law:\n\n       Permit only one automatic 30-month stay per drug product \n     per ANDA to resolve patent infringement disputes over patent \n     listed . . . prior to the filing date of the generic \n     applicant's ANDA.\n\n  This was precisely the position that I suggested in testimony before \nthe HELP Committee on May 8, 2002 and argued for last year during the \nSenate debate on the Edwards-Collins substitute amendment to the \nMcCain-Schumer legislation.\n  I would note that the 30-month stay provision in the McCain-Schumer \nbill last year, S. 812, and in the Edwards-Collins substitute, were \nboth at variance with this central recommendation of the FTC report.\n  The second major FTC recommendation responds to those situations in \nwhich R and generic firms were entering into agreements not to impede \ngeneric competition. The FTC recommended that Congress:\n\n       Pass legislation to require brand-name and first generic \n     companies applicants to provide copies of certain agreements \n     to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n  Senator Leahy, working very closely with the FTC, developed \nlegislation, the Drug Competition Act, S. 946, that squarely addressed \nthis second recommendation.\n  During the 107th Congress, I worked with Senator Leahy on refining \nthat bill. I supported it in committee, and worked with him to pass it \nthrough the Senate late last year. I supported his efforts to have it \nattached to the Medicare vehicle earlier this week. I expect that the \n108th Congress will adopt this measure.\n  The FTC study served an important purpose of cataloging the facts \nsurrounding certain abuses of the 1984 act. In formulating public \npolicy, the facts should matter and a legislative or regulatory \nresponse should be tailored to fit the problem.\n  Unfortunately, the timing of the issuance of FTC study did not allow \nthe report to get the attention it deserved by the Senate. The FTC \nreport was published only one day before the Senate adopted S. 812, the \nGreater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act of 2003, last July \n31st.\n  The GAAP Act, developed by Senators McCain and Schumer, was \nsubstantially altered by the Edwards-Collins substitute, with active \ninvolvement of Senator Kennedy.\n  While there is no question my colleagues were motivated by their goal \nof making drugs more affordable for seniors and all Americans, and \ndespite the fact that it garnered 78 votes in the Senate, there were \nsignificant shortcomings in the bill.\n  Let me briefly review a few of the most troublesome provisions of the \nEdwards-Collins substitute to S. 812. The proposed legislation would \nhave created for the first time a private right of action in the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The last thing the already \noverburdened FDA staff needs is a bunch of trial lawyers bringing the \nagency to a screeching halt by second-guessing its judgment calls.\n  The bill that passed last year would have resulted in the waiver of \npatent rights apparently against even third parties--if pioneer drug \nfirms did not file its patents with the FDA and, if challenged by a \ngeneric drug applicant, pursue expensive litigation within tight time \nframes.\n  In sharp contrast to the FTC recommendation, S. 812 basically made \nany patents listed with the FDA after a month from the date the pioneer \ndrug application was approved by the FDA ineligible for the 30-month \nstay. In most cases, this is at least four years earlier than what I \nand the FTC recommended--freezing the Orange Book to patents listed \nbefore a generic drug application was filed.\n  The American Intellectual Property Law Association opposed S. 812. \nThe patent-dependent biotech industry worked against the bill. The \nPatent and Trademark Office found that ``S. 812 would forfeit \nunnecessarily the core right of patent holders--the right to exclude \nothers from practicing the inventions for the entire patent term. After \nyears of research and development and significant investment, the \npatent right is extinguished for the mere failure to satisfy an \nadministrative task or respond in a timely manner.''\n  Here is what the July 18, 2002 Statement of Administration Policy \nsaid about the Edwards-Collins-McCain-Schumer legislation:\n\n     . . . the Administration opposes S. 812 in its current form \n     because it will not provide lower drug prices. S. 812 would \n     unnecessarily encourage litigation around the initial \n     approval of new drugs and would complicate the process of \n     filing and protecting patents on new drugs. The resulting \n     higher costs and delays in making new drugs available will \n     reduce access to new breakthrough drugs. Moreover, the new \n     cause of action is not necessary to address patent process \n     abuses. Clearly, the bill would benefit from consideration by \n     the Senate's experts on Hatch-Waxman law on the Judiciary \n     Committee, the proper committee of jurisdiction for this \n     bill.\n\n  While S. 812 passed by a very wide margin, it was certainly not \nwithout its critics.\n  Comes now S. 1225. This bill emerged from the HELP Committee. Once \nagain, it is entitled the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals \nAct. Once again, it is cosponsored by Senators McCain, Schumer, and \nKennedy.\n  Due in large part to the leadership of Chairman Gregg, there are \nsignificant changes in the bill compared with last year's legislation.\n  While I have significant concerns over certain aspects of S. 1225 as \nadopted in its amended form on June 19, 2003, I must acknowledge \nChairman Gregg and Majority Leader Frist for their roles in working \nwith the cosponsors of last year's bill to make substantial \nimprovements in the legislation.\n  Likewise, I commend Senators Schumer, McCain and Kennedy for \nabandoning many of the troublesome features of a bill that garnered 78 \nvotes last Congress.\n  I can only believe that the factual presentation, analysis, and \nrecommendations contained in the FTC report and subsequent public \nnotice and comment process surrounding the recently-issued FDA final \nrule on patent listings and the application of the statutory 30-month \nstay both played a constructive role in helping to form the basis of \nthe Gregg-Schumer legislation.\n  It is appropriate to recognize the efforts of the Bush administration \nfor tackling the problem of multiple, successive 30-months stays \nthrough rulemaking. Secretary Thompson, Commissioner McClellan, and FDA \nChief Counsel Dan Troy, should be saluted for their roles in so \npromptly completing a rulemaking regarding patent listing that \ngenerally embraced the one-and-only-one 30-month stay policy \nrecommended in the FTC Report. Chairman Muris and the FTC staff deserve \ncredit for a report that helped shape a more carefully targeted policy \nresponse.\n  There can be no doubt that this year's vehicle, S. 1225, is superior \nto S. 812. This new Gregg-Schumer bill, S. 1225, embraces exactly the \ntype of one-and-only-one 30-month stay policy that I suggested to the \nHELP Committee last May, argued for on the floor last July, and was \nultimately recommended by the FTC.\n  The Gregg-Schumer legislation, S. 1225 in the form adopted by the \nSenate, also addresses some problems that the FDA rule perhaps did not \nresolve satisfactorily. As FDA Chief Counsel Dan Troy stated at the \nJune 17th Judiciary Committee hearing:\n\n       We tried as best we could to cut down on all opportunities \n     for gaming. We did not succeed in cutting down all \n     opportunities for gaming, because nothing, no legislation is \n     so good, no rule could be so good as to cut down all \n     opportunities for gaming, because there are unforeseen \n     circumstances and unintended consequences.\n\n  I think Mr. Troy is correct about the nature of the inherent \nlimitations of regulatory and legislative fixes for complex problems \nwhere there are powerful incentives to game the system to gain \nfinancial advantage. We need to\n\n[[Page S8691]]\n\nkeep this in mind as we analyze further the amendment the Senate \nadopted last week.\n  As I stated at the June 17th hearing, it was unfortunate that the PTO \nwas unable to present a witness. Admittedly, the invitation was issued \non short notice. I have asked PTO for its formal comments on the Gregg-\nSchumer amendment. I would also be interested in the PTOs comments on \nwhatever language the House adopts. We would also be wise to hear from \nthe Office of the United States Trade Representative if USTR finds that \nthe legislation raises any concerns for international trade and \nintellectual property under the TRIPS provisions.\n  It is my understanding that FDA and FTC staff provided a great deal \nof what is known as ``technical assistance'' on the Gregg-Schumer \namendment, a good deal of it between the markup on June 11th and the \ntime the amendment was offered on June 19th. I am not aware whether PTO \nor USTR were consulted.\n  PTO and USTR should understand that this is a fast moving train, so \nthey should be prepared to give us any comments they may have in short \norder. President Bush and the congressional leadership have made it \nplain that they expect the conference report on the Medicare bill to be \ncompleted as soon as possible.\n  One special area of concern to me as Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee is that one provision of the amendment overwhelmingly adopted \nby the Senate raises significant issues with respect to civil justice \npolicy, including a constitutional concern. Specifically, proposed \nsection 271(e)(5) of title 35, would make the failure of a patentee to \nfile a patent infringement action within a specified time frame \nsufficient to establish ``an actual controversy'' for the purpose of \nestablishing subject matter jurisdiction for a declaratory judgement \naction by a generic drug firm challenging a patent.\n  Whether the Congress can, or should, by statute grant subject matter \njurisdiction for a declaratory judgment based on the failure to bring a \nsuit raises some interesting questions, particularly in light of manner \nin which the U.S. Courts of Appeals, including the Federal Circuit, \nhave developed and applied the ``reasonable apprehension'' test. At our \nJune 17th hearing, DOJ did not present the Judiciary Committee with its \nfinal opinion on the matter but Mr. Sheldon Bradshaw, Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, noted, ``that the actual \ncase of controversy requirement is constitutionally compelled rather \nthan statutorily required. And as a result, Congress can't simply \ncreate a case or controversy by statute but the plaintiffs must \nestablish the constitutional requirement for bringing the case.'' The \ncommittee has received a spirited correspondence that takes differing \nviews on the case or controversy provision of the Gregg-Schumer \namendment.\n  I have requested the Department of Justice for its formal views on \nthis language. At this point, I think it premature to embrace this \nlanguage. It is my understanding that the bill that the House will take \nup does not contain the controversial case or controversy language. I \nstand prepared to work with the sponsors of the amendment, DOJ and \nothers on this important issue.\n  Yet another improvement of S. 1225 over the bill adopted by the \nSenate last year relates to the manner in which the 180-day rule is \naddressed. In short, I am pleased that the policy embraced last year, \nthe rolling exclusivity policy, was replaced in favor of a ``use it or \nlose it'' approach. I have long stated a preference for the consumer \nfriendlier ``use it or lose it'' rule over the too open-ended rolling \nexclusivity.\n  The Waxman-Hatch law provides an incentive for generic firms to \nchallenge patents. To encourage generic competitors to pursue patent \nchallenges in a vigorous fashion, the 1984 law provided 180 days of \nmarketing exclusivity in situations where a generic drug firm could \nshow the pioneer's patents were invalidated or not infringed. For many \nyears it was thought, as intended, that this valuable 180-day period of \nexclusive marketing would be granted to the first generic firm to \nsuccessfully invalidate or invent around the pioneer's patents.\n  FDA regulations issued in 1994 required that the first generic \napplicant had to defend successfully against a patent claim made by a \nbrand name company to receive the 180-day exclusivity. In a 1998 D.C. \nCircuit case, Mova v. Shalala, the court construed the plain language \nof the statute to strike down the successful defense requirement. As a \nresult FDA now makes 180-day exclusivity decisions by applying the \nliteral words of the statute. This results in a system that rewards \nfirst filers, not necessarily successful challengers.\n  The Gregg-Schumer amendment retains the preference for first filers. \nI believe that re-instating the successful defense requirement may \nprove preferable than intentionally sanctioning a first filer regime.\n\n  Frankly, I am uncertain of the policy justification for S. 1225's \nretention of granting the 180-day reward to the first filer rather than \nthe first successful defendant. I believe that there is a lot to be \nsaid for giving the reward to the actual winner in court or the first \nnot to be sued, not just the first one to enter the Parklawn Building \nwith an application.\n  The amendment places a high premium on being a first filer. At our \nhearing last week, FTC Chairman Muris characterized the rush to be a \nfirst filer as ``the shantytown problem of people in line to file.'' \nFDA Chief Counsel Troy described that ``. . . right now, there are \nsometimes limousines, sometimes vans, sometimes cars, sometimes even \ntents in the Metro North parking lot that come days, weeks, and in some \ncases even months in advance of a particular date. Why we should reward \nsomeone because they camp out longer in the parking lot is a good \nquestion?''\n  I am concerned that the language that passed the Senate could allow \nsome unintended and, in fact, counterproductive, results. Changes in \ncurrent law with respect to the court decision and commercial marketing \ntriggering mechanisms for the 180-day exclusivity provision demand \ncareful attention and analysis. The amendment does not appear to adopt \nall the FTC recommendations in this area.\n  Other questions should be raised. What if, for example, the generic \napplicant that successfully challenges the validity of the patent is \nnot also a first filer? Why should such a non-first filing but \nsuccessful invalidity challenger not be granted the 180 days \nexclusivity? Stated another way, why should the first filer--or in \nChairman Muris' ``shantytown'' situation, a whole group of first-day, \nexclusivity-sharing, first-filers, gain while the actual successful \nchallenger waits out the 180-days? I am not sure that such an outcome \nis fair or even rational. Moreover, such a system may not result in the \nmost efficient or aggressive pursuit of patent challenges.\n  One thing is for sure: You can expect a lot more first filers to \nappear at the door of the FDA building on the first day that successful \ndrugs become eligible for patent challenges. As I pointed out at the \nJudiciary Committee hearing, some have already suggested that the first \nto file system might result in an increase in willful infringement \ncases. In fact, there was a decision last month by a Federal court in \nChicago that ruled against a generic firm which filed a generic drug \nchallenge before obtaining the opinion of outside counsel on either \nnon-infringement or invalidity.\n  Another type of potential problem could arise, and frankly I am not \ncertain how it can be avoided, if a non-first filing generic drug \nchallenger wins a court decision on grounds of non-infringement. Unless \nI am wrong in my understanding of the Gregg-Schumer amendment, a \ngeneric challenger that prevailed on a non-infringement theory would \nhave to wait for the 180-days granted the first filer, or a group of \nfirst-day, first-filers, to expire before the non-infringing firm could \nenter the market. Such an outcome only hurts consumers by needlessly \ndelaying introduction of the non-infringing generic product for 180 \ndays.\n  Unlike a determination of patent invalidity, a finding of non-\ninfringement does not accrue to third parties. It is important to \nunderstand that there are two ways for a generic firm patent challenger \nto be awarded the 180-day exclusivity under the law. First, the generic \nchallenger can show that the pioneer's patent is invalid. And second, \nthe generic challenger can demonstrate\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\nthat its product will not infringe a pioneer's patent.\n  These are two very different theories. Al Engelberg, a highly \nsuccessful and highly respected attorney engaged by generic drug firms \nto attack pioneer patents, has made the following observation about the \ndifference between invalidity and non-infringement challenges:\n\n       In cases involving an assertion of non-infringement, an \n     adjudication in favor of one challenger is of no immediate \n     benefit to any other challenger and does not lead to multi-\n     source competition. Each case involving non-infringement is \n     decided on the specific facts related to that challenger's \n     product and provides no direct benefit to any other \n     challenger. In contrast, a judgment of patent invalidity or \n     enforceability creates an estoppel against any subsequent \n     attempt to enforce the patent against any party. The drafters \n     of the 180-day exclusivity provision failed to consider this \n     important distinction.\n\n  As one of the drafters of the 1984 law, I must accept a measure of \nresponsibility for this problem. It is not clear, however, that S. 1225 \nhas addressed this issue in a satisfactory fashion. The language \nadopted in the Gregg-Schumer amendment does not appear to solve the \nproblem created by the 1998 Mova decision that effectively eliminated \nthe successful defense requirement.\n  Frankly, I think we need further thought on how best to address the \nimplications of the distinction between invalidity and non-infringement \nclaims in the context of Hatch-Waxman patent challenges and 180-day \nexclusivity awards. Specifically, I question the appropriateness of \ncontinuing to group together patent invalidity and patent non-\ninfringement challenges, particularly in light of the fact that the \nlatter may in practice extend longer than the purported 180-day award. \nFrom what I know now, there are strong arguments to prefer the \nreinstatement of the successful defense requirement over the \nestablishment of a new system based on first filing.\n  Let me close by once again commending Senators Gregg, Schumer, \nMcCain, and Kennedy for all their hard work in reaching the compromise \namendment that was so overwhelmingly adopted by the Senate. The Gregg-\nSchumer amendment represents significant improvement over the \nlegislation passed by the Senate last year. I am pleased that the \namendment adopts the one-and-only-one 30-month stay policy that I, and \nthe FTC, advocated last year.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate has adopted Senator Leahy's Drug \nCompetition Act, which also addressed a major recommendation of the \nFTC. I have worked with Senator Leahy to perfect and pass this measure.\n  As a co-author of the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term \nRestoration Act, I support efforts to bring affordable and innovative \ndrugs to the American public. While I support the spirit and much of \nthe letter of the Gregg-Schumer amendment, for the reasons I have set \nforth, I was unable to fully support this measure at this time.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, during consideration of S. 1, an \namendment was introduced by Senators Santorum and Schumer dealing with \npayments to the Medicare+Choice program. This amendment would have \nincreased payments to the M+C plans over the next 2 years, to make sure \nthey are still viable when the MedicareAdvantage program takes effect \nin 2006.\n  I realize the amendment was withdrawn because of the lack of funding \nin the Senate bill, but it is still an important issue I would like to \nlend my support to.\n  The Medicare+Choice program already provides a good prescription drug \nbenefit to many seniors across the county, and gives these seniors \nanother option to the Medicare fee-for-service program.\n  Unfortunately, many Medicare+Choice plans are pulling out of the \nprogram because their reimbursement levels are too low. This is leaving \nmany seniors scrambling for a new Medicare+Choice plan or having to go \nback into fee-for-service Medicare which doesn't offer them the same \ntypes of benefits as their old M+C plan.\n  In fact, it seems like every year, more and more Medicare+Choice \nplans leave the market.\n  I am concerned if we do not provide these plans with enough funding \nover the next two years while the MedicareAdvantage program is being \nimplemented, these M+C plans will continue to leave the program and \nmore seniors will be left in the lurch.\n  This isn't fair to our seniors.\n  I had hoped we could provide some additional funding for the \nMedicare+Choice plans over the next 2 years so the plans currently in \nthe program will remain and we might actually attract new plans to \nother areas that have not been served.\n  In Kentucky, we have a limited number of Medicare+Choice plans. In \nfact, only seniors in certain counties in Northern Kentucky and around \nLouisville have access to these plans. With higher payments to \nMedicare+Choice plans, we might actually get some more plans to come \ninto our state and cover more counties.\n  We shouldn't give up on the Medicare+Choice plans, or the seniors \nenrolled in them. I hope this is an issue we can resolve during the \nconference with the House, and I commend Senators Santorum and Schumer \nfor bringing this issue before the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that late last night the \nSenate again supported lowering drug prices and maintaining a fair \ngeneric drug approval process by adding the Drug Competition Act of the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003, S. 1. Last \nNovember, the Drug Competition Act passed the Senate by unanimous \nconsent. On Monday, Senator Grassley and I, along with Senators \nCantwell, Durbin, Feingold, Kohl, and Schumer, offered our bill as an \namendment to the larger Medicare bill. I hope that in this Congress it \nis actually enacted into law as part of the larger effort to improve \nthe health care of millions of Americans. Prescription drug prices are \nrapidly increasing, and they are a source of considerable concern to \nmany Americans, especially senior citizens and families. Generic drug \nprices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the comparable brand-\nname versions.\n  While the Drug Competition Act is small in terms of length, it is \nlarge in terms of impact. It will ensure that law enforcement agencies \ncan take quick and decisive action against companies that are driven \nmore by greed than by good sense. It gives the Federal Trade Commission \nand the Justice Department access to information about secret deals \nbetween drug companies that keep generic drugs off the market. This is \npractice that hurts American families, particularly senior citizens, by \ndenying them access to low-cost generic drugs, and further inflating \nmedical costs.\n  Last July, the Federal Trade Commission released to comprehensive \nreport on barriers to the entry of generic drugs into the \npharmaceutical marketplace. The FTC had two recommendations to improve \nthe current situation and to close the loopholes in the law that allow \ndrug manufacturers to manipulate the timing of generics' introduction \nto the market. One of those recommendations was simply to enact our \nbill, as the most effective solution to the problem of ``sweetheart'' \ndeals between brand name and generic drug manufactures that keep \ngeneric drugs off the market, thus depriving consumers of the benefits \nof quality drugs at lower prices. Indeed, at a hearing just yesterday \nin the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Timothy Muris of the FTC praised \nthe Drug Competition Act in his testimony and urged its passage. In \nshort, this bill enjoys the unqualified endorsement of the current FTC, \nwhich follows on the support by the Clinton administration's FTC during \nthe initial stages of our formulation of this bill. We can all have \nevery confidence in the commonsense approach that our bill takes to \nensuring that our law enforcement agencies have the information they \nneed to take quick action, if necessary to protect consumers from drug \ncompanies that abuse the law.\n  Under current law, the first generic manufacturer that gets \npermission to sell a generic drug before the patent on the brand-name \ndrug expires, enjoys protection from competition for 180 days--a head \nstart on other generic companies. That was a good idea, but the \nunfortunate loophole exploited by a few is that secret deals can be \nmade that allow the manufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-\nday grace period to block other generic drugs from entering the market, \nwhile at the same time, getting paid by the brand-\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\nname manufacturer not to sell the generic drug.\n  Our legislation closes this loophole for those who want to cheat the \npublic but keeps the system the same for companies engaged in true \ncompetition. I think it is important for Congress not to overreact and \nthrow out the good with the bad. Most generic companies want to take \nadvantage of this 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs \nat much lower cost for consumers. We should not eliminate the incentive \nfor them. Instead, we should let the FTC and Justice look at every deal \nthat could lead to abuse, so that only the deals that are consistent \nwith the intent of that law will be allowed to stand. The Drug \nCompetition Act accomplishes precisely that goal, and helps ensure \neffective and timely access to generic pharmaceuticals that can lower \nthe cost of prescription drugs for seniors, for families, and for all \nof us.\n  The effects of this amendment will only benefit the effort to bring \nquality health care at lower costs to more of our citizens. The Drug \nCompetition Act enjoyed the unqualified support of the Senate last \nyear, and I am pleased that my colleagues have recognized that it fits \nwell within the framework of the Prescription Drug and Medicare \nImprovement Act of 2003. It is a good complement to the larger bill and \ndoes nothing to disrupt the bill's balance. I sincerely hope that this \ncommonsense legislation is a part of any final agreement with the House \non the larger Medicare prescription drug bill.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to express my enthusiastic \nsupport for the amendment Senators Schumer and Santorum offered to \nincrease funding for the Medicare+Choice Program in 2004 and 2005. This \namendment addresses a critically important issue that has far-reaching \nimplications affecting the health care benefits of millions of low-\nincome and minority seniors. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment to ensure that this urgently needed funding increase is \nincluded in the Medicare bill.\n  I believe we must take bold action to address the fact that Congress \nhas not provided adequate funding for the health care of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who select HMOs and other private sector health plans. In \nmany parts of Massachusetts, and in other parts of the country, funding \nfor Medicare+Choice plans has been limited to annual increases of only \n2 percent in most years since 1998. These increase are inadequate at a \ntime when health care costs are rising by 8 to 10 percent annually. \nThis level of inadequate funding is unfair to the 170,000 Medicare \nbeneficiaries in Massachusetts who have selected private health plan \noptions. I am a strong supporter of the wonderful health plans we have \nin Massachusetts--Harvard, Tufts, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and Fallon \nCommunity Health Plan. We must step up to the plate to help these \nplans--nonprofit plans in my State--in their time of need.\n  The Schumer-Santorum-Kerry amendment takes important steps to address \nthis problem. By providing funding now to stabilize existing private \nhealth plan options for Medicare beneficiaries, we can help ensure that \nthe proposed Medicare Advantage Program will be successful in the \nfuture. Our amendment lays the groundwork for successful long-term \nefforts to provide beneficiaries with high-quality health care choices.\n  As the Senate continues to debate changes in Medicare, it is \nimportant for us to remember that, for more than 4.5 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries across America, Medicare+Choice is an essential program \nthat provides high-quality, comprehensive, affordable coverage that is \nnot always available, or affordable under the Medicare fee-for-service \nprogram. These seniors and disabled Americans have voluntarily chosen \nto receive their health coverage through Medicare HMOs and other \nprivate sector plans because they recognize the value they offer.\n  Seniors in Massachusetts have come to rely on the high-quality health \ncare they receive through their Medicare+Choice plans. Prescription \ndrugs coverage, disease management services, physician exams, vision \nbenefits, and hearing aids are examples of the additional benefits that \nare routinely offered by their Medicare+Choice plans.\n  These additional benefits are valued by all seniors, but they are \nparticularly important to low-income seniors who cannot afford other \nMedicare supplementary plans that might provide them such benefits but \nat a greater cost.\n  As the Medicare debate moves forward, it is important for Congress to \nremember that Medicare+Choice serves as a vital safety net for many of \nour Nation's most vulnerable seniors. For millions of beneficiaries who \ncannot afford to purchase a Medigap policy, Medicare+Choice is their \nonly hope for obtaining comprehensive health coverage.\n  The Schumer-Santorum-Kerry amendment focuses on protecting this \nimportant option for seniors who have nowhere else to turn for the \nquality health coverage they need. I urge my colleagues to support the \nadditional funding that is urgently needed to strengthen the \nMedicare+Choice Program for seniors. This should be among our highest \npriorities in this year's Medicare debate.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, when I ran for the U.S. Senate, I promised \nDelawareans that I would work in a bipartisan fashion to provide a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit for our Nation's seniors. I pledged \nthat I would seek consensus around what is right with competing \nRepublican and Democratic plans. Along with my Democratic colleagues, I \nwould support voluntary coverage that is available and affordable for \nall seniors. Along with my Republican colleagues, I would support \nchoice and competition to constrain costs. And to the extent we found \nourselves constrained by limited resources, I would seek to provide the \ngreatest assistance to those with the greatest needs.\n  The bill before us today achieves some of that vision. It is \nbipartisan. It will provide a benefit available to all seniors on a \nvoluntary basis. It will harness market forces to strengthen the \nintegrity of the Medicare Program for the future. And it will provide \ncomprehensive health security to our most vulnerable, low-income \nseniors.\n  Still, the bill we have before us today is not everything I would \nhave hoped for. The overriding priority of the current majority here in \nCongress has been to make dramatic reductions in Federal revenues \nwithout corresponding reductions in Federal spending. As a result, \nthere is insufficient money in the budget under which we are currently \noperating to provide the kind of comprehensive coverage that all \nseniors--not just low-income seniors--truly deserve. This is an \nunfortunate choice of priorities, I think, but it is the choice that \nthis President and this Congress have made.\n  Unfortunately, the consequences of the majority's misguided \npriorities are evident in this legislation. When Medicare was created, \nthe idea was to provide seniors with health coverage that was similar \nto the coverage available to most working Americans through their \nemployers. This is what seniors expect when we say that we are \nproviding them with a Medicare prescription drug benefit. However, the \nmajority has only set aside for this bill about half of what it would \ntake, according to the Congressional Budget Office, to provide seniors \na benefit comparable to standard employer-provided coverage. Thus, \nthere is a very noticeable gap in this bill's coverage, reflective of a \nsubstantial hole in our Nation's budget.\n  When seniors reach $4,500 in prescription drug costs, the coverage in \nthis bill gives out. It does not kick back in until total spending \nreaches $5,800. It is widely acknowledged that this makes no sense. It \nmakes no sense from an insurance perspective. It certainly is not \nreflective of the standard either in private employer-provided coverage \nor in the coverage provided to those of us who are fortunate enough to \nserve as Members of Congress. Nobody likes this gap in coverage. \nNobody, so far as I can tell, defends it. However, because the root of \nproblem is the majority's failure to set aside sufficient resources for \nthis program, efforts to deal with the problem have only created new \nand potentially more serious difficulties.\n  For example, the authors of this legislation have attempted to narrow \nthe coverage gap by not allowing employer contributions to count \ntowards the calculation of seniors' out-of-pocket\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nspending in the gap. To see how this works, we need to understand how \nthe coverage gap works. Once seniors reach $4,500 in total drug costs, \nthey fall into the coverage gap. They then have to spend a certain \namount of their own money--in the final bill reported out of the \nFinance Committee it is $1,300--before their coverage resumes, or they \nget out of the coverage gap.\n  The effect of not allowing seniors to count payments made by their \nretiree health plans toward this out-of-pocket requirement is to ensure \nthat seniors will remain in the gap longer and fewer will get out of \nit. This allows the level of spending at which the gap ends to be set \nat a lower level than would otherwise be possible for the same \nbudgetary cost. The problem with this, however, is that it also \nprovides an unintended incentive for employers to drop or scale back \ntheir retiree drug coverage.\n  Thankfully, contributions from State prescription drug plans, like \nour Delaware Pharmacy Assistance Program, count toward the out-of-\npocket requirement, which should encourage States to ``stay in the \ngame.'' Employers, though, are effectively barred from wrapping their \ncoverage around Medicare in the way that would be most beneficial for \ntheir retirees, which would be by filing Medicare's coverage gap.\n  In the course of our consideration of this legislation here on the \nfloor of the Senate, I have urged my colleagues to address these \nshortcomings in the bill, even if that means reconsidering the \nmajority's budget plan and the resource allocation for this program. I \nsupported an amendment by Senator Boxer to eliminate the gap in \ncoverage. And I cosponsored an amendment offered by Senator Rockefeller \nto allow employer-provided coverage to wrap around the Medicare benefit \nand thus to eliminate the incentive for employers to drop coverage for \ntheir retirees.\n  The majority has made clear, however, that they are unwilling to \nreorder their priorities or to emplore the possibility of finding the \nnecessary resources elsewhere in the budget to fix what they \nacknowledge are shortcomings in this legislation. Thus, the rest of us \nare left to choose between a prescription drug benefit that provides \nsome, but not all, of the assistance that seniors deserve, or no \nprescription drug benefit at all.\n  Congress has been debating this issue for more than a decade. In many \nways, it has been debating the issue since Medicare was first created \nback in 1965. I ran for the Senate in part because I was frustrated at \nthe inability or unwillingness of the parties in Washington to come \ntogether to do what they could to solve problems and get things done. I \nam unwilling to walk away from the table this year with nothing for \nDelaware's seniors. They have waited too long and the need is too \ngreat.\n  In light of the budgetary priorities of the Republican majority, I am \nalso very concerned about our future prospects. Should we let the \npresent opportunity pass us by? I am concerned that if we do not act to \nget started with prescription drug coverage this year, even the limited \nresources that now remain may go out the door for other purposes--most \nlikely another round of top-heavy, upper bracket tax cuts.\n  This is a first step. It is a downpayment. Just as I pledged when I \nran for the Senate to work in a bipartisan fashion to get results, I \npledge today to continue to work to build on these results. I continue \nto believe that we should provide our seniors with quality coverage \nwithout caps or gaps. I will work to ensure that filling the gap of \ncoverage that exists in the present bill is given greater priority in \nfuture budgets than it was in this year's Republican budget. I also \nbelieve that it is a mistake to shun rather than welcome employer \nefforts to wrap around the new Medicare benefit, and I will work to \nrectify that mistake as we move toward implementation of this program \nover the next few years.\n  Mr. President, it is often said that politics is the art of the \npossible. The bounds of the possible are a bit narrower now than they \nneed, thanks to our Republican friends. But, as the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee has said, this may be the best bill that could be \nwritten under the constraints of the Republican budget. For that \nreason, I commend the authors of this legislation--Chairman Grassley \nand Senator Baucus, among others--for their work. I urge my colleagues \nto support this compromise as an important, if limited, first step \ntoward addressing what clearly is a pressing priority, not just for our \nelderly population, but for our Nation as a whole.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we debate the Prescription Drug and \nMedicare Improvement Plan of 2003, I would like to take a few minutes \ntoday to speak in support of the overall bill, but I would also like to \nhighlight several provisions in the bill that are of particular \nimportance to me and my State of Vermont.\n  Over the last several days, we have focused much of our discussion on \nthe aspects of this bill related to prescription drugs and the Medicare \nAdvantage Program. These are clearly among the most important \nprovisions of this bill and these issues warrant the attention and \ndebate they are receiving. I especially appreciate the close \nrelationship this bill has to last year's tripartisan effort--which \neffectively is the parent of the current bill Last year, my friends--\nSenators Grassley, Snowe, Hatch, and Breaux--and I set out to design a \nbill that provided a prescription drug benefit along with other \nimprovements, what we called ``enhancements,'' to the basic operations \nof the Medicare Program. The tripartisan bill was good legislation--\nsomething all of its original cosponsors were very proud to work on \ntogether.\n  This year, I am pleased to say that the Grassley-Baucus bill is even \nbetter than our effort from last year, and I commend Chairman Grassley \nand Ranking Member Baucus for their leadership and initiative in \nbringing it to the Senate floor.\n  One of the most important reasons that the Prescription Drug and \nMedicare Improvement Act is stronger than the tripartisan plan from \nlast year is because it includes provisions that begin to resolve \nlongstanding inequities in payments to rural doctors, hospitals, and \nother provisions. This problem can be stated simply. Rural health care \nproviders are paid less than providers in more densely populated areas \nfor the same exact services. Earlier this year, I joined with my \ncolleagues, Senators Hatch, Grassley, Lincoln, and Bingaman, in \nintroducing the legislation that addressed geographic inequities for \nphysician services by changes to the physician reimbursement formulas.\n  As many of our colleagues are aware, Senator Grassley fought to \ninclude these rural provisions in the recent tax bill that was signed \nby the President. And although I strongly disagreed with enacting \nfurther tax cuts, I was doubly disappointed to see the rural health \nprovisions stripped out in the conference with the House. These unfair \ngeographic differences in reimbursement rates have gone on far too \nlong, and I am especially pleased to see reimbursement issues for rural \nproviders getting the attention they deserve--including the commitment \nfrom the President to my friend from Iowa pledging his support for \nrural health relief as part of the effort we have underway. I am, \ntherefore, very pleased to see that these provisions are included in \nthe chairman's mark and are now part of this bill.\n  I am also glad that Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Baucus have \nworked with me to address another inequity in the system. Critical \naccess hospitals provide care in the most remote regions of my State of \nVermont and all other rural States. These hospitals are small, yet \nserve as critical resources to their communities. The managers have \nagreed to include a provision in their amendment that will make a \ntechnical correction to current law, allowing hospitals like the Mt. \nAscutney Hospital in Windsor, VT, to expand access to psychiatric and \nrehabilitative services to the most vulnerable citizens in that \ncommunity.\n  I would also like to speak today in support of a provision in this \nbill that establishes Medicare demonstration programs to improve health \ncare quality. I heard my friend from Montana speak yesterday about \nquality and geographic disparities, and I know how committed he is to \nimproving the quality of services delivered under Medicare. Earlier in \nthis Congress, I was pleased that Senators Frist, Beaux, and Gregg \njoined me in introducing S. 1148, the Medicare Quality Improvement Act. \nI want to thank Chairman\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\nGrassley and Ranking Member Baucus for including this provision in this \nbill.\n  I became concerned about the issue of health care quality after \nreading the work of Dr. Jack Wennberg of Dartmouth, which has shown \nthat higher levels of Medicare spending do not lead to better health \noutcomes. Let me repeat this finding. Higher levels of Medicine \nspending do not lead to better health outcomes. Instead, spending tends \nto vary by region--generally reflecting the availability of physicians \nand hospitals--rather than the health or needs of the population.\n  I have followed Dr. Wennberg's work for a very long time. One of his \nearly studies looked at rates of surgical procedures at Vermont \nhospitals. He found that communities in Vermont that had many more \nmedical procedures were not necessarily healthier. I saw how this \nresult led Vermont health care providers to join with the business \ncommunity in achieving high quality, supportable outcomes. I also saw \nhow our State government used this effort to improve health care across \nour State. Today, I am happy to say that Vermonters enjoy some of the \nhighest quality health care in the United States, at a cost that is \namong the lowest in the country.\n  As we prepare to vote for the bill before us, I think it is \ncritically important for us to consider some of the lessons learned \nfrom Vermont. Some of my colleagues have expressed concern about the \ncosts of the bill before us. Others have expressed concern that the \nbill does not go far enough. The quality demonstration program in this \nbill will give us some of the answers we need to these funding \nquestions.\n  The need for these demonstrations is critical. RAND Health published \na study today in the New England Journal of Medicine that describes the \nproblems with overuse and underuse of needed medical care services in \nthe United States. The RAND study will make it clear that every \nAmerican is at risk--not only for failing to receive needed medical \ncare, but also for receiving care that is not needed and may even be \nharmful. This is a problem that belongs to each and every one of us, \nand we must find ways to fix it.\n  The legislation before us closes a significant gap in the health \nbenefit package available to our Nation's seniors. However, providing \ncoverage for health care services is not enough. We must do a better \njob of ensuring that people are getting the care they need, and also \nthat they need the care they get.\n  In closing, I would like to urge my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle to support this bill as we move forward. This bill will establish \na drug benefit that is universal, comprehensive, affordable, and \nsustainable. This bill restores necessary and long-needed fairness to \nour physicians and providers in rural areas. And, the bill will improve \nthe quality of care offered under Medicare.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, over the last 2 weeks the Senate has \ndebated the most significant changes to the Medicare Program since it \nwas created in 1965. Today, we passed this legislation by a 76 to 21 \nvote, and I would like to take a few minutes to explain why I supported \nthis bill.\n  This bill will, for the first time, provide the option of modest \nprescription drug coverage for nearly 39 million Medicare \nbeneficiaries, including about 103,000 beneficiaries in North Dakota. \nIt is also intended to give Medicare beneficiaries more choices of \nhealth plans. And it takes significant steps towards equalizing the \nMedicare payments that rural health care providers receive, compared to \ntheir urban counterparts.\n  There is no question that, if Medicare were being created today, it \nwould include prescription drug coverage. Prescription medicines are a \nvital part of modern medicine. Last year alone, pharmaceutical \ncompanies introduced 26 new prescription medicines into the \nmarketplace. But these advancements in medicine mean little if \nAmericans cannot afford to access them. That is especially true for \nsenior citizens who have reached their declining income years.\n  For years now, Congress has been debating proposals to add a \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare. Unfortunately, however, in past \nyears we have not been able to reach agreement on just how to do this. \nWith each passing year, older Americans continue to struggle to pay for \ntheir medicine. In North Dakota, about 48,000 Medicare beneficiaries \nhave no prescription drug coverage, and many more have limited drug \ncoverage. I hear from North Dakota seniors regularly who tell me that \nthey have to choose between taking the medicines their doctor \nprescribed for them and other necessities such as food and heat.\n  These older North Dakotans say that they want and need Medicare drug \ncoverage, and they want and need it now. If Congress doesn't enact \nlegislation this year, chances are that several more years will go by \nbefore there is another serious opportunity to consider this issue. In \nother words, we could pass the legislation before the Senate today or \nwe could do nothing for yet another year. In my judgment, doing nothing \nis not an option.\n  The prescription drug benefit in this bill is not as helpful to \nseniors as I would like or as generous as I think Medicare \nbeneficiaries deserve--but it is a start.\n  Frankly, I think our budget priorities have been wrong. If I had my \nway, Congress would have reduced the size of the tax cuts for the very \nwealthy and instead set aside more money for improving and modernizing \nMedicare. During the Senate's debate earlier this year on the budget, I \noffered an amendment to set aside a total of $620 billion over the next \n10 years for a Medicare prescription drug benefit. This is the amount \nof funding I felt was needed to provide a more generous and reliable \nbenefit. Unfortunately, the majority in the Senate rejected my \namendment, so we are limited to a package of just $400 billion over 10 \nyears. When you consider that Medicare beneficiaries are projected to \nspend $1.8 trillion on prescription drugs over the next 10 years, it is \nimpossible to develop a robust benefit within the $400 billion budget \nconstraint, in my judgment.\n  The benefit provided for in this legislation is better than that \nwhich President Bush proposed in several key respects. Most \nimportantly, this bill will not force seniors to leave the traditional \nMedicare Program--and the doctors they depend on--in order to get the \nprescription drug coverage they also need. I could not support a bill \nthat coerces seniors out of the traditional Medicare Program that \nvirtually all of North Dakota's Medicare beneficiaries rely on.\n  In addition, this bill provides extra assistance above the basic drug \nbenefit for those older or disabled beneficiaries who have low incomes \nor very high drug expenses. Medicare beneficiaries with incomes below \nabout $14,400 for individuals and $19,400 for couples--about 40 percent \nof North Dakota's beneficiaries--would qualify for extra assistance. \nAnd those with the highest drug costs--totaling more than about \n$5,800--would qualify for the catastrophic drug coverage. About 7 \npercent of North Dakota Medicare beneficiaries would reach this \nthreshold.\n  Despite these improvements over the President's proposal, there are \nother concerns that I worked to address during the Senate's debate. In \nsome instances, we were able to make changes to address these concerns, \nand in other cases, those efforts were rejected. In those instances \nwhere concerns still exist, I intend to continue working to fix them in \nconference with the House of Representatives.\n  For instance, as I have already mentioned, I am concerned that this \ncoverage is not as generous as it should be, and in fact, there are \nsome holes in the coverage. Under this benefit, seniors will have to \nreach a $275 deductible before their Medicare drug coverage starts. In \naddition, seniors whose drug expenses reach $4,500 will have to pay 100 \npercent of their drug costs between $4,501 and $5,800. Then, when their \ndrug spending reaches $5,800, the catastrophic drug coverage will kick \nin and Medicare will pay 90 percent of their drug expenses after that. \nThis means that there could be periods--in some cases as much as 3 \nmonths--when Medicare beneficiaries will have paid a premium for drug \ncoverage but will be getting no benefit.\n  That makes no sense to me. No other insurance plans that I am aware \nof include such gaps in coverage. I supported various amendments on the \nSenate floor to close these coverage gaps or at least ensure that \nseniors\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\ndon't have to pay premiums for the periods when they aren't receiving \ncoverage. Regrettably, however, those efforts were rejected.\n  I am also concerned that rural Medicare beneficiaries may not receive \na benefit that is as stable or as generous as other beneficiaries \nreceive. This bill envisions that seniors will basically have two \noptions for receiving drug coverage. First, this bill creates a new \nMedicare Advantage Program through which beneficiaries could choose to \nget their drug coverage, as well as the rest of their medical care, \nthrough an HMO or a PPO. Frankly, however, I am very skeptical that \nHMOs or PPOs will want to serve rural areas, and even if they do, I \ndon't think most North Dakota beneficiaries will want to leave the \ntraditional Medicare Program.\n  Those seniors who want to remain in the traditional Medicare Program \nwill be able to do so and get their prescription drug coverage through \nprivate ``drug only'' insurance plans. Budget experts estimate that \nMedicare beneficiaries who sign up for these drug-only plans will pay \nan average monthly premium of about $35. However, this is only an \nestimate, and the actual premium that seniors pay could vary \nsubstantially from area to area. That is already the case in the \ncurrent Medicare HMO program--for instance, a Medicare HMO with drug \ncoverage currently charges $99 per month in Connecticut and only $16 a \nmonth in Florida. I am worried that it would be rural seniors who would \npay the highest premiums, even though they paid the same Medicare \npayroll taxes as other beneficiaries.\n  To address this concern, I supported an amendment by Senator Daschle \nthat would have limited the variation in premiums to only 10 percent \nabove the national average, no matter where beneficiaries live. In \nother words, insurance companies could charge beneficiaries a lower \npremium but they couldn't charge them more than 10 percent above the \nnational average. Unfortunately, however, Senator Daschle's amendment \nwas rejected.\n  In areas where there are not at least two private drug-only plans \noffered to Medicare beneficiaries in any given year, Medicare would \nstep in and ensure that there is a ``fallback'' plan available. This is \na vital guarantee for beneficiaries in rural States like North Dakota \nwhere I believe it is unlikely that there will be two stable drug-only \nplans available. But even with this fallback plan, seniors could still \nbe bounced back and forth between different plans, depending on how \nprivate plans move in and out of an area.\n  I supported an amendment that would have addressed this concern by \nallowing all Medicare beneficiaries to choose the fallback option, no \nmatter how many private plans are available where they live. When that \namendment failed, I cosponsored an amendment with Senator Conrad that \nwould at least allow seniors who have the fallback option to remain in \nthat plan for 2 years, not just 1 year. That amendment was also \nrejected.\n  Even though this bill doesn't require Medicare beneficiaries to leave \ntraditional Medicare, I know there are some concerns that Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be getting their drug coverage through private \nplans. I, too, would strongly have preferred that all seniors be able \nto choose from a Medicare-administered benefit.\n  However, let me say this if I felt that by structuring the drug \ncoverage the way it is in this bill, we were undermining the entire \nunderlying Medicare Program, I would not support it. Medicare has been \na wonderful success, and in our efforts to modernize it, we should \nexercise extreme caution not to undermine it. However, virtually all of \nthe major Medicare prescription drug proposals would have used a \nprivate entity in some way to provide the drug benefit. Indeed, the \ntraditional Medicare Program currently contracts with private insurance \ncompanies to pay the millions of Medicare claims that come in each \nyear. Furthermore, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that only \n1 to 2 percent more beneficiaries will choose the new Medicare \nAdvantage option, so it seems clear that the vast majority of seniors \nwill continue to rely on the traditional Medicare Program for the bulk \nof their medical care.\n  One area where we had some success in improving the bill during the \nSenate's debate is in the area of reducing drug costs. This bill relies \nlargely on private insurance companies to negotiate lower drug prices. \nHowever, we have seen from prior experience that insurance companies \nhave not been able to keep drug spending from increasing by nearly \ndouble digits every year 9.7 percent in 2002, 17 percent in 2001, 18.8 \npercent in 2000, and 16 percent in 1999.\n  To help put downward pressure on drug prices, I offered an amendment \nthat was passed by the Senate by a 62-to-28 vote to allow for the \nreimportation of lower-priced, FDA-approved medicines from Canada. As \nmany North Dakotans know first hand, the same FDA-approved prescription \ndrug that costs $1 in the United States costs only 62 cents in Canada, \neven though it is the exact same drug, in the same bottle, made by the \nsame manufacturer.\n  It is not my intention with this amendment to require Americans to go \nto Canada in order to get lower drug prices. Rather, by allowing U.S. \nlicensed pharmacists and drug distributors to do the importing for \nthem, Americans can stay at home, and by breaking the monopoly that the \ndrug companies currently have on drug pricing in this country, we will \nforce a repricing of drugs here in the United States.\n  I also supported an amendment that will help to make more affordable \ngeneric drugs more readily available. Generic drugs are safe, \neffective, and lower priced alternatives to heavily advertised brand-\nname prescription drugs. Unfortunately, however, some of the big brand-\nname drug companies use loopholes in the patent laws to keep generic \ndrugs off the market for longer than intended. This amendment, which \npassed the Senate by a 94-to-1 vote, will close these loopholes and \nthereby speed consumers' access to generic medicines.\n  I am also pleased that this bill improves Medicare's coverage of \npreventive services, especially by including a provision that I \nauthored to provide for a cholesterol screening benefit for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I have felt for a long time that Medicare needs to do a \nbetter job of preventing disease, rather than just paying to treat it. \nIn the case of cholesterol screening in particular, high cholesterol is \none of the major, changeable risk factors for heart attacks, stroke and \nother cardiovascular diseases. Yet when Americans turn 65 and enter the \nMedicare Program, their coverage for cholesterol screening stops unless \nthey already have cardiovascular disease. That makes no sense, and I am \nglad the Senate has taken steps to provide this coverage.\n  Finally, I am very happy that this bill includes a range of \nprovisions that will make Medicare reimbursement more fair and \nequitable for our rural hospitals, physicians, and other health care \nproviders. It is simply not right that Medicare has historically \nreimbursed urban health care providers at a much higher rate than their \nurban counterparts. This inequity in Medicare reimbursement has very \nreal consequences for hospitals and clinics in rural States like ours. \nThey have to reduce services, have greater difficulty recruiting staff, \nare less able to make capital improvements, struggle to give their \npatients access to the latest innovations in medical care, and in same \ninstances, they even have to close.\n  I have been fighting for a long time to correct this inequity. In \nfact, some of the provisions in this bill are similar to legislation \nthat I introduced in the Senate earlier this year, and I am glad they \nhave been included in this bill.\n  I know there will be some who feel that this bill should have been \nrejected by the Senate because it relies too heavily on private plans \nand others because it does not place enough emphasis on enrolling \nseniors in private plans. Others will feel that the Medicare benefit is \nnot generous enough, and some feel its coverage is too liberal. I agree \nthat this legislation isn't perfect--far from it, in fact. In the \ncoming months and years, I will continue working to improve it. But it \nis a start in the right direction, and that is why I have supported it.\n  The House of Representatives is also expected to pass its version of \nMedicare legislation this week. The House and the Senate will now need \nto have a conference committee to work out the differences between the \ntwo bills. I\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\nhave some serious concerns about the House-passed bill. I hope these \nconcerns and the concerns that I have with the Senate bill can be \nresolved in the final bill, so that we can send a bill to the President \nfor his signature this year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on S. 1, the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003. I applaud my \ncolleagues in working toward enactment of legislation to provide \nprescription drug coverage under Medicare. However, I am deeply \nconcerned that the bill before us today would not ensure an affordable, \nguaranteed benefit that would cover seniors' outpatient prescription \ndrug expenses.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services would temporarily issue prescription drug discount cards \nfor seniors until the drug benefit begins in 2006. At that time, all \nMedicare beneficiaries would receive a standard prescription drug \nbenefit whether they remained in traditional fee-for-service or in a \nprivate plan. For a $275 deductible and an estimated $35 per month, 50 \npercent of a beneficiary's drug costs would be covered up to $4,500. A \nbeneficiary would receive no coverage for drug costs between $4,501 and \n$5,800, though they are still responsible for paying the monthly \npremium during this coverage gap. Furthermore, any assistance provided \nby employer-sponsored plans or third parties on behalf of the \nbeneficiary does not count toward the out-of-pocket costs. After drug \nexpenses reach $5,801, the plan would cover 90% of drug expenses.\n  The bill creates a new Medicare Advantage program, which would \nreplace Medicare+Choice, and create a new agency, the Center for \nMedicare Choices, CMC, with authority parallel to the existing Centers \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services. The CMC would administer the \nMedicare Advantage program and the prescription drug plans. The drug \nplans would be administered through private plans, but when no private \nplans exist, the government would provide a fallback plan for seniors \nin fee-for-service. However, if a new private plan decides to enter an \narea, beneficiaries would again be forced to receive their coverage \nthrough that plan.\n  If this sounds terribly confusing, it is. One hundred Senators and \ntheir staffs found it difficult to work through this bill and \nunderstand exactly how the benefit would work. Seniors who don't sign \nup as soon as they are eligible are subject to a penalty similar to the \npenalty imposed on those who delay enrollment in Part B. It is unfair \nto expect seniors and their families to work through this web to make \nan informed decision.\n  The complexity of this drug plan is only one of numerous flaws with \nthis bill. S. 1 does not provide a national fixed premium. The bill \nsets out an estimate of a $35 monthly premium, but there is no \nguarantee for seniors that they will not have to pay much more than \nthat estimate.\n  The bill has the serious potential to cause a number of retirees to \nlose existing employer-sponsored prescription drug coverage. CBO \nestimates that as many as 37 percent of Medicare beneficiaries would \nlose existing coverage. This is an unacceptable consequence of \nlegislation that is supposed to make life easier for seniors. This \nserious deficiency is the number one concern of constituents who have \ncalled into my office about this bill.\n  The bill before us leaves a large gap in coverage and forces seniors \nto continue premium coverage during that gap period. Seniors may have \nto face months without any assistance, waiting to reach the limit where \ncatastrophic coverage begins. The seniors who fall into this coverage \ngap are among the most ill, with severe chronic conditions and \nprescription needs. It is difficult to support legislation that would \ncease coverage for prescription drugs for seniors at the very time when \nit is needed most.\n  Finally, because this proposal relies on private plans to deliver the \ndrug benefit, seniors could be forced to shift from plan-to-plan, year-\nto-year as they did when Medicare+Choice HMOs pulled out of the \nMedicare program a few years ago. In my own State of Maryland, \ninsurance companies left the Medicare program, abandoning more than \n100,000 seniors.\n  This legislation makes our Nation's seniors the subject of an \nexperiment to which none of us should be willing to subject our parents \nand grandparents. We don't know what the benefit is under this bill. We \ndon't know how much it will cost. We don't know how private plans will \nparticipate and make a profit. We don't know how many seniors would \nlose existing coverage. What we know is we are prepared to spend \napproximately $400 billion over 10 years to create an inadequate drug \nbenefit, a new bureaucracy, and subsidies for private insurance \ncompanies.\n  With modest additional resources, we could have closed the coverage \ngaps in this bill. Amendments offered by my colleagues to provide \nstability for seniors, move up the start date of the drug benefit, \neliminate beneficiary premiums during the coverage gap period, and \nimprove a variety of shortcomings have been defeated. We have lost so \nmany opportunities to make this bill something all Medicare \nbeneficiaries can support. I am hopeful that in the future we can \nimprove upon this and create a system that is easier for seniors to \nunderstand, more affordable, and more reliable than what is offered \ntoday.\n  I want to highlight one amendment that would have provided Medicare \nbeneficiaries with a substantial, reliable and straight-forward \nprescription drug benefit. I cosponsored and voted for this amendment \noffered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. His alternative \nwould have provided a Medicare-delivered drug benefit that allows the \nSecretary of HHS to employ negotiating strategies used by the VA and \nother government entities to bring down drug prices. Under Senator \nDurbin's plan, seniors would have no deductible, pay only 30 percent of \ncosts until reaching the catastrophic limit, and face no coverage gap. \nIn addition, employer contributions would count toward out-of-pocket \nlimits so there would be much less risk of employers dropping retiree \ncoverage. This was the proposal we should be working from today, but \nunfortunately the Durbin alternative was defeated by a vote of 56 to \n39.\n  Those opposed to providing a richer benefit argue we don't have the \nmoney. The selective amnesia of these so-called fiscal conservatives is \nbaffling. Not too long ago, this body passed a tax cut that primarily \nbenefited the wealthiest Americans. Where was their sense of fiscal \nresponsibility then? As my colleagues Senators Durbin and Harkin noted \nyesterday, this is about priorities. I'm sure others have raised this \nvery good point as well. We can risk greater budget deficits to give \nhuge tax cuts to Americans who are already prospering, but we cannot \nprovide the necessary resources for millions of Medicare beneficiaries \nto get an affordable, reliable drug benefit that they can understand?\n  I have long been a strong supporter of providing older Americans and \ndisabled individuals who rely on Medicare an affordable, comprehensive, \nreliable and voluntary prescription drug benefit. However, I want to \nensure we do so in a way that does not worsen the situation in which \nmany seniors find themselves as they face rapidly rising drug costs. As \nwe consider proposals to expand our Nation's major health entitlement \nprograms, it is appropriate to follow a guiding principle in the \npractice of medicine--do no harm. Our seniors deserve a drug benefit \nthat is a real improvement, not a complex experiment that may cause \nmore trouble than it's worth. We must not enact a law intended to help \nthat might eventually harm millions. The American people deserve \nbetter.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, for over 35 years, Medicare has been a \nsavior for our seniors citizens. It has helped pay their doctor bills, \ntheir hospital bills, and their home health bills.\n  But it has not paid for their prescription drug bills, and millions \nof seniors across the country have been waiting a long time for the day \nwhen prescription drug coverage is offered through Medicare. That day \nis getting closer.\n  I am supporting--and the Senate will soon pass--a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Let me tell you why this is important. In California, four million \npeople are enrolled in Medicare. Every day, far too many of them are \nforced into the difficult choice of paying for their prescriptions or \nputting food on the table.\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\n  I want to tell you a few of their stories.\n  I recently heard from a California woman who told me she struggles to \nsurvive on $950 a month income. She cannot, she says, afford all of her \nprescription drugs. She is, unfortunately, all too typical.\n  A constituent from San Marcos, CA told me that her annual costs for \nprescription drugs this year will top $10,000.\n  Another constituent from Indio, CA told me that she has made five \ntrips to Mexico over the last several years to purchase her \nprescriptions. She drives all day long to Mexico in order to purchase \naffordable heart medication. She wanted me to remind my colleagues that \n``thousands of seniors are forced to do this.''\n  A retired physician from Marina Del Rey told me that a pill he takes \nfor his heart disease has gone up 600 percent from $15 per month to \n$85.\n  These seniors--all of our seniors--need and deserve to have Medicare \nhelp pay for their prescription drugs. We need to end this situation \nwhere seniors are cutting their pills in half or forgoing their \nmedications altogether or skipping meals in order to pay for their \nprescription drugs. That is unacceptable.\n  Today, we are making a prescription drug benefit a part of Medicare. \nAnd that is why I am supporting this bill--because, at long last, it \nputs a Medicare prescription drug benefit on the books.\n  But, this bill is wanting. It has problems. And I have voted for \namendment after amendment to fix those problems.\n  I offered an amendment to close the benefit shutdown. Under this \nbill, even when seniors have paid and continue to pay premiums, \nMedicare stops covering prescription drugs, forcing seniors to pay the \nentire cost. When that failed, I offered an amendment to ensure that \nseniors with cancer would never have their benefit stopped.\n  I supported an amendment by Senator Stabenow to ensure that all \nseniors could get prescription drug coverage from Medicare itself--the \ntried and proven system--rather than from a private insurance company.\n  I supported an amendment by Senator Graham to stop charging seniors \npremiums when they are not getting any benefits.\n  I supported an amendment by Senator Lautenberg to start this benefit \nnext year not 2 and a half years from now.\n  I supported an amendment by Senator Dodd to encourage employers not \nto drop their retiree health coverage so seniors who have good coverage \ncan keep it. And the Levin amendment, which I also supported, would \nhave ensured that if employers did drop such coverage, Medicare would \nbe there to provide prescription drugs.\n  I supported an amendment by Senator Dorgan to reduce the premiums \nthat beneficiaries must pay each month. And I supported an amendment by \nSenator Daschle to limit the disparities in premiums so that seniors in \ndifferent parts of the country are not paying different premiums for \nthe same benefit.\n  These amendments would have made the Medicare drug benefit a better \ndrug benefit for seniors. Unfortunately, none of them passed.\n  But we should not--and I will not--stop trying to make it the best \nbenefit it can be.\n  The good news is that Medicare will soon, for the first time ever, \ncover prescription drugs. The better news will be when we fix the \nproblems with this bill and improve the coverage for our seniors. I \nlook forward to the day when enough of my colleagues will join me in \nthat effort.\n  Finally, let me say that I hope the conference report on this bill--\nthe final version of the bill before it goes to the President--does not \ncome back to the Senate in a way that would provide even less help to \nseniors or in a way that would undermine the entire Medicare program.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, senior citizens are facing a crisis--a \ncrisis in affording health care and a crisis in affording prescription \ndrugs.\n  I have been in communities all over Maryland. Listening to seniors \nwho are desperate. Listening to their families in the diners--who want \nto help their parents, yet face stresses of their own. Listening to the \nemployers in the boardrooms--who want to help their retirees, but can \nno longer afford to.\n  Here is what they tell me. They say: We need a prescription drug \nbenefit in Medicare. We need a safety net for seniors and families. \nCongress must enact a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and must do \nit now.\n  I absolutely agree. It is time Congress made Medicare prescription \ndrug coverage a national priority.\n  For so many years, Congress has talked about prescription drugs and \nMedicare. Talk, talk, talk. You can't talk yourself out of high \ncholesterol; you need Lipitor. You can't talk your way out of diabetes; \nyou need insulin.\n  The problem with the Senate is--when all gets said and done--more \ngets said than gets done. Finally--the Congress is acting.\n  Here are my principles. These principles are the yardstick by which I \nmeasure any proposal.\n  The benefit must be for seniors, not for insurance companies. That \nmeans the cornerstone must be Medicare. This bill does that. It does \nnot force seniors to give up the Medicare they love to get the drugs \nthey need.\n  It must help the majority of Marylanders. I work for Marylanders. So \nI did the numbers--570,000 Marylanders are on Medicare. According to \nJohns Hopkins, 68 percent of these seniors would benefit from this \nlegislation. That means 394,000 would benefit from this bill.\n  It must be voluntary. And the answer is, yes, this bill is voluntary. \nNo one should be coerced or forced into a private program or forced to \ngive up coverage they currently have.\n  It must be affordable. I am not so sure. I am concerned about the \nsignificant deductible--$275 a year and the hefty premiums--almost $400 \na year. It also has a coverage gap. Once you spend $4,500 a year--you \nget no help until you spend $5,800. This will cost too much. That is \nwhy I supported the Durbin amendment, which would have provided a \nbetter benefit at less cost to seniors.\n  It must be accessible. It must be available to all seniors, \nregardless of where they live. This bill does that.\n  It must be meaningful. It must cover the kind of drugs your doctor \nsays you need, not what an insurance executive thinks you should get. \nThis bill does that by creating a medical necessity override. This \nmeans your doctor has the final say on which drugs you get, not an \ninsurance company. I feel pretty good about that.\n  I tried to improve the bill. I voted for amendments to improve the \nbill. For example: For the Durbin substitute which would have created a \nstronger, more comprehensive benefit at a lower cost to seniors.\n  For an amendment to get rid of the coverage gap. This would guarantee \nthat seniors would have continuous coverage for their prescription drug \ncosts.\n  For an amendment to provide seniors with a guaranteed prescription \nplan that is under Medicare. This would allow seniors to stay in a \nprescription drug plan that is operated by Medicare and not have to \nmove in and out of private plans and a Medicare fallback plan that is \nonly available when the private plans leave the market.\n  For amendments to protect the benefits of retirees who already have \ndrug coverage. These amendments would help employers to continue to be \nable to offer quality health care to their retirees.\n  For an amendment to implement the drug benefit next year--instead of \nwaiting until 2006 to start these benefits.\n  I am sorry all these amendments failed on party line votes.\n  This legislation is a beginning. It is something we can build on. \nWhat it comes down to for me is--will it help the majority of seniors \nin Maryland? The answer is, yes; it will help over 394,000 people. For \npeople who spend at least $1,110 a year on prescription drugs--it will \nhelp. For someone who is facing a catastrophic disease like cancer and \nhas very high drug costs--it will help. So I will vote for this bill. \nIt is not the bill I want. Yet we can't let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good. We can't do nothing--as seniors struggle to pay for the drugs \nthey need.\n  But let me be very clear, this is as far as I will go. If this bill \ncomes back from conference and it is a benefit for insurance \ncompanies--say goodbye to my vote. If it increases costs for seniors, \nsay goodbye to my vote. If it cuts benefits, say goodbye to my vote.\n\n[[Page S8699]]\n\n  So I will vote for this legislation tonight because I don't want to \nsay goodbye to this opportunity to provide a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nPrescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003.\n  The Senate has spent the last 2 weeks debating how to help our \nNation's senior citizens afford their prescription drugs. The Kaiser \nFamily Foundation estimates that average annual out-of-pocket drug \nspending for Medicare beneficiaries grew from $644 3 years ago to $999 \nthis year and will reach $1,454 by the time this bill takes effect in \n2006. As a result, 25 percent of seniors without drug coverage declined \nto fill a prescription and 27 percent of seniors without drug coverage \nskipped doses to make their prescriptions last longer. This is \nunacceptable. These citizens deserve affordable, comprehensive, and \nreliable drug coverage. Unfortunately, the legislation now before us \nfails to provide sufficient coverage.\n  From the outset this proposal will confuse seniors. Enrollees in \nprivate plans better not get too comfortable because their plans could \nbe gone in 2 years if the HMOs find them unprofitable just like they \nhave with Medicare+Choice in my state of South Carolina. The same goes \nfor enrollees in fallback plans. They will be kicked out of their plan \nin as early as a year if enough private plans enter their area. This \nvolatile system could force seniors to move in between three separate \nplans, with three separate formularies, in 3 years. This bill should \ncreate a sense of stability in the system and reduce the confusion over \ncoverage. That is why I supported first the Stabenow amendment and then \nthe Lincoln-Conrad amendment, which would have extended the \navailability of fallback plans to ensure that seniors will have access \nto stable drug coverage.\n  Senior citizens will need to hire an accountant just to comprehend \nthe benefits available to them under this legislation. Once seniors \nselect their Medicare drug plan, they will have to maneuver a maze of \npremiums, deductibles and copayments for benefits that contain huge \ngaps in coverage. On top of their premiums, which will vary from region \nto region and plan to plan, seniors will get no help for the first $275 \nof their drug costs, pay half of costs from $276 to $4,500, pay all the \ncosts from $4,501 to at least $5,813, and then pay a tenth of costs \nabove $5,288. With a breakeven point of $1,115, many healthier Medicare \nbeneficiaries will opt not to participate. With a coverage gap of \n$1,302, many of the sickest patients will still have to continue paying \npremiums even though they may have to resort to rationing their care \nuntil they can spend their way out of the ``doughnut.''\n  Once again, the Senate defeated a number of amendments that I \nsupported that would have brought much needed simplicity and fairness \nto the bill including the Boxer amendment, which would have closed the \ncoverage gap for all seniors, and the Daschle amendment, which would \nhave limited the regional variation among premiums to 110 percent of \nthe national average. Finally, we chose to provide $13 billion in new \nsubsidies to PPOs and HMOs instead of using that money to reduce \npremiums or fill in the coverage gap for cancer or Alzheimer's \npatients. All in all, the bill provides Medicare beneficiaries with a \nbenefit valued at about $1,000 less than the drug coverage available to \nFederal employees.\n  This is a plan only Washington could dream up. It should come as no \nsurprise that the authors of this convoluted mess and their friends in \nthe White House have decided to wait until after the 2004 election \nbefore allowing Medicare beneficiaries to see what they are in for.\n  I should also note that this Nation is more than $6.6 trillion in \ndebt. This bill is part of budget resolution and economic plan that \nwill run up an average deficit of $600 billion a year for the next 10 \nyears. Make no mistake about it, we will borrow every red cent to pay \nfor this program. And what do we get in return? Massive subsidies for \nHMOs, spotty drug coverage for senior citizens, and a lack of attention \nto the factors driving the rapid increase of health care costs in this \ncountry. If we are going to borrow from future generations to pay for \nthis benefit, we should get it right.\n  Now that we have disposed of all amendments and final passage appears \nimminent, I have concluded taxpayers and Medicare beneficiaries would \nbe better served if we go back to the drawing board. We should come \nback with a proposal with affordable premiums and cost sharing \nrequirements with no gaps in coverage that is administered in a manner \nthat gives seniors the same sense of security they receive under the \ncurrent Medicare program. I have heard many of my colleagues say this \nis an important first step and it is important that we get something on \nthe books. Nonsense. Thirty months will pass before the first \nbeneficiary receives coverage. That was enough time to draft and ratify \nthe Constitution. It was enough time to complete the Manhattan Project. \nThirty months should be more than enough time for us to create a real, \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit for our senior citizens.\n  I hope this body will have the wisdom to vote no and do this right.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote for passage of the Medicare \nprescription drug bill that has been debated over the past several \nweeks.\n  I do so, however, with great reservations about many of the \nprovisions in the bill.\n  I am voting for this measure for two principal reasons.\n  First, I believe that we owe our seniors a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. I believe such a benefit is long overdue for our Nation's \nseniors. For years we have promised them we would give them the crucial \nhelp they need with their skyrocketing prescription drug costs. And I \nbelieve that it is finally time to deliver on that promise.\n  It has taken Congress too many years to act on this pressing need. We \nhave been debating for years about the best way to provide this \nbenefit, and I am afraid that if we do not take the opportunity in \nfront of us today, it will take us even longer to provide seniors the \nhelp they deserve. Our seniors cannot wait any longer.\n  The costs of prescription drugs are soaring, and the financial toll \nthey take on our seniors means that too often seniors must choose \nbetween eating and taking the medication that will help them live \nproductive, healthy lives. Our seniors should not have to make that \nchoice. They contributed to the Medicare system over their lifetimes. \nThat system, which is supposed to provide health care to all seniors, \nneeds to be able to help them obtain the prescription drugs they need \nto preserve their health.\n  The second reason I am voting for this benefit is that it takes a big \nstep in addressing what I see as one of the biggest flaws of the \ncurrent Medicare system--the geographic inequities within the Medicare \nreimbursement system. We need to end Medicare's continued \ndiscrimination against Wisconsin's seniors. As I have previously \ndiscussed on this floor, Wisconsin seniors already receive the short \nend of the stick when it comes to Medicare. Wisconsinites pay the same \npayroll taxes to Medicare as all American workers do, but receive fewer \nbenefits in return. Instead, Wisconsinites' Medicare dollars are used \nto subsidize higher reimbursements in other parts of the country.\n  Wisconsin Medicare beneficiaries receive on average $4,318 in \nMedicare benefits per year, the eighth lowest in the country. By \ncontrast, beneficiaries in the State with the greatest per capita \nreimbursement receive $7,209. This distribution of Medicare dollars \namong the 50 States is grossly unfair to Wisconsin. I thank the \nleadership of the Finance Committee for including provisions to begin \nto address this inequity in this prescription drug bill. But I know \nthat we still have more to do to reverse the Medicare discrimination \nagainst States like Wisconsin.\n  I am pleased that key provisions have been accepted that greatly \nimprove this bill. The Senate adopted the Gregg-Schumer-McCain-Kennedy \namendment, which I was proud to cosponsor and support, which will bring \nmore competition to the prescription drug market by preventing \npharmaceutical companies from blocking generic drugs from entering the \nmarket. This amendment is one of the only provisions that will help to \nbring cost savings to seniors.\n\n[[Page S8700]]\n\n  By adopting Senator Dorgan's amendment relating to the reimportation \nof prescription drugs from Canada, the Senate will help seniors obtain \naffordable prescription drugs. This legislation helps both consumers \nwho buy prescription drugs and businesses which sell them. I supported \nthis provision, both in its earlier legislative form and in this \namendment, because it is the right thing to do. Our seniors and other \nAmericans in need of affordable prescription drugs deserve no less.\n  I also supported Senator Enzi's amendment, which passed \noverwhelmingly, that will make sure that community pharmacies, like the \nones in my home State of Wisconsin, can still operate within this new \nprescription drug program. Smaller pharmacies will be protected from \nbeing shut out by larger pharmacies through this amendment, and that \nmeans helping seniors to access the prescription drugs they need in \ntheir own communities.\n  I also worked with Senator Allard on an amendment to provide \nregulatory relief for home health care providers that the Senate \nadopted. Our amendment enables home health care providers to spend more \ntime with patients and less time on paperwork. This is particularly \nimportant at a time when some home health care providers are leaving \nthe home health industry because of burdensome paperwork requirements.\n\n  And I am pleased that an amendment I offered to bring some clarity to \nthe Medicare Program for our seniors was adopted. The Medicare Program \nis already full of bureaucratic red tape, often creating barriers for \nseniors looking for basic information about their health care options. \nThis prescription drug benefit is the biggest expansion of the Medicare \nProgram since its inception in 1965. We are adding an entire new part \nto the program, and we need to help guide our seniors through it.\n  My amendment is simple. It establishes a Medicare Beneficiary \nAdvocate Office within the Department of Health and Human Services, \nwith the sole function of providing clear information to all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The office will serve as a one-stop information source \non all of Medicare for our seniors.\n  This new office will provide a toll-free phone number, a regularly \nupdated website and regional publications that will give our seniors \nall of the information they need to make informed health care \ndecisions.\n  That is the good news. But as I said earlier, I have many \nreservations about this bill. This is not the bill I would have \nproposed.\n  This bill does not go far enough to deliver on our promise to give \nseniors a meaningful prescription drug benefit. It fails to provide any \nassistance after a senior's prescription drug costs total $3,450, until \nthey spend another $1,850 on prescription drugs, or $5,300 total. And \nit adds insult to injury by making beneficiaries continue to pay a \npremium even during the time they receive no benefit.\n  I am also troubled that this bill does not provide clear, uniform \nbenefits and premiums for all seniors. Many aspects of the benefits \nprovided in the bill remain uncertain, and will continue to remain \nuncertain after the plan goes into effect. Under this bill, the \npremiums are not defined. The premiums for the Medicare prescription \ndrug plan will be dictated by the private insurers who will offer the \nplans. The only thing we know for sure is that the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that the national average for premiums will be $35. \nHowever, those premiums may vary dramatically. Just look at Medicare \nHMO premiums. Medicare HMO premiums in Connecticut are $99, but in \nFlorida they are only $16.\n  Who will offer the plans is also uncertain. There is no guarantee \nthat plans will be offered in regions where there may not be enough \nprofit. History again shows us that private companies do not always \nfind rural and smaller urban areas profitable enough to move in. All \ntoo often, private companies that do move into less desirable Medicare \nmarkets end up deciding to leave the region, leaving Medicare \nbeneficiaries scrambling to figure out where they will turn for \ncoverage.\n  Furthermore, my understanding is that this plan only offers a \nguaranteed Medicare-administered plan, or ``fallback plan,'' if there \nare less than two private plans in a region. This means that, if only \none private plan offers a prescription drug benefit in the region that \nincludes Almena, WI, a Medicare beneficiary living in Almena may \ninstead choose the Medicare-administered fallback plan. While on the \nfallback plan, my Almena constituent would become familiar with the \nmedications that are included in their formulary and the cost of their \npremiums. If a second private plan subsequently decides to move into \nthat region, my understanding is that my constituent will be dropped \nfrom the Medicare fallback plan, and forced to join one of the private \nplans even if those plans have higher premiums, or do not include their \nprescriptions in their formularies.\n  Further, my Almena constituent can be forced to leave the plan that \nhe or she has come to know, if that plan leaves the region. This leads \nto instability and uncertainty for seniors.\n  Benefits are also uncertain under this proposal. Again, benefit \npackages will be determined by the private insurers who offer the \nplans. And we can assume, from experience with the Medicare+Choice \nProgram, that the benefits will vary widely. I am concerned about what \nthis may mean for States like my home State of Wisconsin, States that \nhave had a difficult time attracting and keeping private Medicare \nplans. Some Medicare prescription drug plans may be able to offer more \nbrand name drugs at a lower cost to beneficiaries, while others in less \nprofitable areas may limit the amount of brand name drugs they can \noffer at affordable rates.\n  I fear that as with Medicare HMOs, Wisconsin seniors may be faced \nwith little choice with Medicare prescription drug plans.\n  And I am concerned that the uncertainty in this bill regarding \nmonthly premiums, the possible differences in benefits packages and the \nstability of private plans that will deliver these benefits may lead to \nmore inequity for Wisconsin seniors.\n  I was disappointed that Senator Durbin's amendment, the MediSAVE Act, \nwas not adopted in the Senate. Senator Durbin's amendment, which I \nstrongly supported, would have fixed most of the errors that exist in \nthis bill. The MediSAVE Act would have made this benefit one that would \ntruly help all seniors with all of their prescription drug benefit. \nSenator Durbin's proposal offered a meaningful, enhanced prescription \ndrug benefit that would have covered all seniors regardless of whether \ntheir prescription drug costs are high, low, or somewhere in between.\n  The MediSAVE Act not only put forth cost controls so that taxpayers \nas well as seniors could save money, but it also would have given \nseniors certainty. Seniors would have known exactly what their premiums \nand benefits were and would have the certainty of knowing that a \nMedicare-administered prescription drug benefit would be available to \nthem, no matter what private plans were offered to them. Most \nimportantly, the MediSAVE Act provided the certainty that a senior \nwould have assistance with their prescription drug costs year-round and \nwould never be caught in the so-called ``donut hole'' of coverage that \nthis bill provides.\n  I am voting for this bill because something, some help for our \nseniors with their pressing prescription drug costs, is better than \nnothing. I will support this legislation with the intention of working \nwith my colleagues over the next 2 years to improve this bill and \nfinally deliver on our promise to give seniors a meaningful \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this bill is a landmark piece of \nlegislation the most significant modernization of the Medicare Program \nsince its inception in 1965. Its passage by the Senate is a major \naccomplishment on the path toward enacting a prescription drug benefit \nfor our Nation's seniors. It is the result of years of bipartisan, I \nmight even say tripartisan, effort and it puts in place many long-\nsought changes. It has many significant features for the citizens of my \nhome State of Vermont. It provides a sustainable, universal, and \ncomprehensive prescription drug benefit. It guarantees access to \ntraditional Medicare for all beneficiaries. It allows Medicare \nbeneficiaries to participate, if they choose, in new systems of care \nthat better reflect today's dynamic health care environment. The bill \nrecognizes the high cost of providing quality care in rural settings \nand closes the reimbursement\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\ngap between rural providers and their urban counterparts. Finally, it \ncontains a provision that will allow us to better understand how to \nprovide quality health care--not care driven by using more and more \nresources, but instead one based on ensuring quality patient outcomes.\n  Over the past 2 weeks, I have applauded the work of my colleagues who \nhave labored over this bill. Today, I have the pleasure of \ncongratulating them on their success and thanking them for their \nefforts.\n  I have worked for more than 3 years with my good friends, Chairman \nGrassley and Senators Snowe, Breaux, and Hatch. In many meetings over \nmany months, we delved into the details of what came to be called the \nTripartisan Bill. This has been one of the finest experiences of my \nmany years in Congress. I am very proud to have been a part of that \ngroup and that our efforts led the way to our success today.\n  I especially want to salute the efforts of Senator Baucus and Senator \nKennedy without whose hard work and commitment to working through an \nagreement we would not have accomplished this remarkable victory, and \nthey deserve our accolades.\n  A bill such as this is the result of great effort on the part of many \ndifferent people who are not elected to this body, but upon whom we all \nrely. I would like to recognize the staff members who have worked so \nhard on this bill and deserve much of the credit for its successful \npassage.\n  On Senator Grassley's staff: Ted Tottman, Linda Fishman, Colin \nRoskey, Mark Hayes, Jennifer Bell, and Leah Kegler, and on Senator \nBaucus' staff Jeff Forbes, Liz Fowler, Jon Blum, Pat Bousliman, Kate \nKirschgraber, and Andrea Cohen deserve considerable recognition for \ntheir tireless efforts. Catherine Finley, Tom Geier, and Carolyn Holmes \nfrom my friend Senator Snowe's staff; Patricia DeLoatche and Trecia \nKnight of Senator Hatch's office; and most especially Senator Breaux's \nlegislative director Sarah Walters deserve enormous credit for this \nbill. Finally, we would not be claiming a victory today if it were not \nfor the contributions of Senator Kennedy's staff, especially, David \nNexon and Michael Meyers.\n  On my own staff, I particularly want to recognize the contributions \nof Paul Harrington during the last Congress, and most especially the \nwork of Sean Donohue who took up that effort on the tripartisan bill \nand who has continued to see it through to today's success, with the \nrecent assistance of Daniel Crimmins, our Robert Wood Johnson Health \nPolicy Fellow. Each and all have worked tirelessly to gather the input, \nanalyze the issues, and build a consensus toward achieving this final \nproduct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support making a prescription drug \nbenefit available to seniors. Most Members of the Senate do. However, \nthere are honest disagreements about how to get it done and whether the \nbill before us will strengthen or weaken Medicare.\n  My principles are simple. The benefit should be voluntary, \nguaranteed, universal, and affordable.\n  Perhaps my greatest concern with the bill before us is the effect its \npassage is likely to have on retirees who currently have prescription \ndrug coverage provided by their former employers. Many retirees \ncurrently enjoy good prescription drug coverage from their former \nemployer. However, the Congressional Budget Office has indicated that \nif we adopt the legislation before us approximately 37 percent of \nretirees who are currently receiving prescription drug coverage from \ntheir former employers will lose that coverage. Specifically, on June \n12, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, Mr. Douglas \nHoltz-Eakin, who previously served for 18 months as chief economist for \nPresident Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, testified at a Finance \nCommittee markup that 37 percent of retirees would be dropped from \ntheir former employers coverage. At that same markup, the Administrator \nof HHS' Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, Mr. Tom Scully, \nstated that for current retirees ``who have employer-sponsored \ninsurance, our estimate is consistent with 37 percent having their \ncoverage dropped.'' During the debate so far, amendments to strengthen \nincentives for employers to maintain their prescription drug coverage \nfor their retirees have failed.\n  Also very troubling is what I call the yo-yo effect. To participate \nin the proposed plan, a senior in any service area where two or more \nprivate plans are offered, no matter what the premium, would only have \nthe option of purchasing private insurance. The reason is that only if \nthere are not two private plans offered in the region is the so-called \nMedicare fallback plan available. So let's assume that there are two \nplans offered in 2006 in a particular service area and a senior opts \nin. Assume further that in 2008, one of the two insurance companies \npulls out of the service area and the so-called Medicare fallback plan \nis then available. So the senior opts for the Medicare fallback plan. \nHowever, if two private plans become available a later time, say 2009, \nthe Medicare fallback plan is no longer available to the senior and she \nwould then be required to again enroll in one of the private plans to \nretain coverage. This yo-yo effect could be repeated forcing seniors to \ndeal again and again with different programs with different costs and \ndifferent benefits and lots of paperwork. This is totally unacceptable. \nSeniors want stability and continuity in their Medicare Program. They \nwant a program on which they can trust and rely.\n  In addition, the legislation we are considering has a large gap in \nthe prescription drug coverage. Once a senior's total drug spending \nreaches $4,500 for the year, she will have to pay 100 percent of the \ncost of their prescriptions until her total drug spending reaches \n$5,800. This has come to be called the donut hole. This coverage gap \nwill leave many seniors to pay the full cost of prescriptions at a time \nwhen they most need assistance. I know of no other insurance program \nthat is so unfairly structured in that way. There is a gaping hole in \ncoverage but no gap in the requirement to pay premiums. That obligation \ncontinues even during the period that benefits are halted.\n  The bill before the Senate also has an unspecified premium that could \nfluctuate from service area to service area as well as from year to \nyear. Premium amounts are left up to the insurance companies. I believe \nthere should be a cap on those premiums. The effort to adopt one \nfailed.\n  Adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare is one of the most \nimportant things Congress can do this or any other year. We spend more \non prescription drugs than we do on hospital costs. Members of Congress \nhave been promising for years that we would pass a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit for seniors. The only way to assure that the \nbenefit will be available reliably and without complications to our \nseniors is to make it a guaranteed part of Medicare. The bill before us \nfalls short of that. We should at least do no harm. When CBO estimated \n37 percent of seniors currently receiving a prescription drug benefit \nfrom their former employer are going to lose the benefit because of \nthis legislation, that is real harm.\n  I hope the major flaws of this bill are somehow corrected in \nconference so I can vote for a conference report. But I cannot vote for \nthe version before us.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I was pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Boxer, Coleman, Landrieu, Kohl & Murray in offering an \namendment to authorize a Medicare demonstration project on pancreatic \nislet cell transplantation to help advance this tremendously important \nresearch that holds the promise of a cure for more than 1 million \nAmericans with Type 1 or juvenile diabetes.\n  As the founder and cochair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have \nlearned a great deal about this serious disease and the difficulties \nand heartbreak that it causes for so many Americans and their families \nas they await a cure. Earlier this week, I had the privilege of \nchairing a hearing featuring young delegates from the Juvenile Diabetes \nResearch Foundation's Children's Congress who had traveled to \nWashington from every State in the country to tell Congress what it is \nlike to have diabetes, just how serious it is, and how important it is \nthat we find a cure.\n  Diabetes is a devastating, lifelong condition that affects people of \nevery age, race, and nationality. It is the\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\nleading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, and amputations \nnot related to injury. Moreover, a study released by the American \nDiabetes Association earlier this year estimates that diabetes cost the \nNation $132 billion last year and that health spending for people with \ndiabetes is almost double what it would be if they did not have \ndiabetes.\n  The burden of diabetes is particularly heavy for people with juvenile \ndiabetes. Juvenile diabetes is the second most common chronic disease \naffecting children. Moreover, it is one that they never outgrow.\n  In individuals with juvenile diabetes, the body's immune system \nattacks the pancreas and destroys the islet cells that produce insulin. \nWhile the discovery of insulin was a landmark breakthrough in the \ntreatment of people with diabetes, it is not a cure, and people with \njuvenile diabetes face the constant threat of developing life-\nthreatening complications as well as a drastic reduction in their \nquality of life.\n  Thankfully, there is good news for people with diabetes. We have seen \nsome tremendous breakthroughs in diabetes research in recent years, and \nI am convinced that diabetes is a disease that can be cured and will be \ncured.\n  I am encouraged by the development of the Edmonton Protocol, an \nexperimental treatment developed at the University of Alberta involving \nthe transplantation of insulin-producing pancreatic islet cells, which \nhas been hailed as the most important advance in diabetes research \nsince the discovery of insulin in 1921. Of the 257 patients who have \nbeen treated using variations of the Edmonton Protocol, all have seen a \nreversal of their life-disabling hypoglycemia, and 80 percent have \nmaintained normal glucose levels without insulin shots for more than 1 \nyear. Amazingly, many of the transplant recipients have even reported a \nreversal of some of their complications, such as improved vision and \nless pain from neuropathy.\n\n  Earlier this year, I joined with my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Patty Murray, as well as my colleague and cochair of the Senate \nDiabetes Caucus, Senator John Breaux, in introducing the Pancreatic \nIslet Cell Transplantation Act of 2003, which will help to advance this \nsignificant research that holds the promise of a cure for the more than \n1 million Americans with juvenile diabetes. The amendment we are \nintroducing today is based on one of the provisions of that bill, which \ncurrently has 43 Senate cosponsors.\n  Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure, accounting for \n40 percent of new cases, and a significant percentage of individuals \nwith Type 1 diabetes will experience kidney failure and become \nMedicare-eligible before they are 65. Medicare currently covers both \nkidney transplants and simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants for \nthese individuals. To help Medicare decide whether it should cover \npancreatic islet cell transplants, the amendment authorizes a 5-year \ndemonstration project to test the efficacy of pancreatic islet cell \ntransplantation for individuals with Type 1 diabetes who are eligible \nfor Medicare because they have end-stage renal disease, ESRD.\n  The cost of this demonstration would not be high. The Health \nStrategies Consultancy LLC, a highly regarded independent health policy \nfirm, estimates that the net Federal cost of the proposal would be \nabout $6.2 million in 2004 and about $84 million over 10 years.\n  The cost of the demonstration project is low because the number of \nislet cell transplants that could be performed is limited. Islet cells \nare extracted from a donated pancreas, and the number of pancreas \ndonors is extremely small when compared to the number of Medicare \nbeneficiaries who could benefit from islet cell transplants. In 2002, \nthere were 1,875 pancreas donations, but there were over 27,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries who have diabetes as the primary cause of their \nend-stage renal disease and who might potentially benefit from islet \ncell transplants.\n  The Health Strategies' cost estimate does not include the financial \nbenefits that would accrue to Medicare for the reduced medical care \ncosts that would occur for beneficiaries who receive islet cell \ntransplants and, as a result, suffer fewer diabetes-related \ncomplications such as kidney failure, heart disease, blindness and \namputation. Since diabetes currently accounts for one out of every four \nMedicare dollars, I believe that this amendment actually holds much \npromise for reducing Medicare spending in the future.\n  I understand this demonstration project has been included in the \nMedicare prescription drug legislation that is being considered by the \nHouse. I hope that the Senate demonstrates similar wisdom, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to oppose S. 1, the Prescription Drug \nand Medicare Improvement Act. This bill is good for drug companies, \ninsurance companies, and people who make TV ads for politicians--but it \nis not good for Wisconsin seniors.\n  I know that many of my colleagues will vote for this legislation and \nthat it will pass the Senate. I know that many of my colleagues believe \nthat this is a first step, if an imperfect one. I would like to agree \nwith them. I would like to vote for a bipartisan compromise that \ndelivers even a part of the drug benefit our seniors rightly demand. \nBut this is not that bill. This is, instead, an empty promise of \nstraightforward help for seniors struggling with crippling drug costs. \nWhen they figure out the details--when they see the costs--when they \nunderstand the limited benefit provided--when they work through the \ncomplicated formulas determining whether they ought to sign up--when \nthey see the drug industry continue to raise their prices and reap \nrecord profits--they will--rightly, rightly--revolt.\n  I warn my colleagues, this is no bird in the hand--it is a vulture. \nAnd I cannot support it.\n  I cannot support a so-called benefit that asks many seniors, for \nmonths at a time, to pay premiums but receive absolutely no help with \ntheir drug costs. I cannot support a ``benefit'' that could cause up to \n37 percent of retirees to lose their retiree health plans, leaving \ntheir former employees worse off than before we passed this bill. And I \ncannot support a ``benefit'' which is denied to low-income seniors \neligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. A ``benefit'' of no benefit \nfor seniors above average drug costs, for seniors with decent retiree \nplans, for seniors who are poor.\n  I also cannot support a plan that neither I nor anyone in this body \ncan explain because its details depend on the vagaries of a private \nmarket that doesn't exist yet. Under this system, seniors could be \nforced into a different plan, pay a different premium, and have \ndifferent medicines covered every year. Insurance companies can come in \nand out, leaving seniors lost and confused in a maze of paperwork and \nchoices every year. And we know that for those insurance companies that \ndo participate, premiums are sure to increase because there is no \nlimitation on premiums in this law.\n  I also cannot support a plan that relies so heavily on the private \nsector to offer something they have never been willing to offer before. \nDrug-only plans are virtually nonexistent in today's marketplace. And \nthe Medicare+Choice experiment, which also uses private insurance \ncompanies, has not worked in Wisconsin and in many other States. I \ncannot support a plan that has to pay insurance companies huge \nsubsidies in order to offer a drug benefit. Not only is there no \nguarantee that they will participate; but precious Medicare dollars \nthat could be used to pay directly for medicines are wasted, funneled \nto a drug industry that, last I checked, was not in need of a Federal \nhandout. Even worse, this plan does not take advantage of the potential \nfor controlling drug costs by utilizing the purchasing power of the \nmillions of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I do not want to point out that aside from the Medicare drug benefit, \nthere are several provisions that I strongly in this bill. I am very \npleased that the bill includes long-needed reforms that will finally \ntake a strong step toward fixing the distorted Medicare system we have \ntoday--a system that penalizes Wisconsin health care providers by \npaying them less than other States, and a system that penalizes \nWisconsin seniors by offering them fewer benefits than seniors in other \nStates enjoy. Not only is this unfair for people in the Medicare \nsystem; it also increases costs for Wisconsin businesses, employees, \nand families, who pay higher costs\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\nto make up the Medicare shortfall. The bill before us changes many of \nMedicare's payment systems, especially for rural areas, and goes a long \nway toward making Medicare fair for seniors and providers, no matter \nwhere they live.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes provisions to make generic \ndrugs more available to all Americans. It will close loopholes in our \ncurrent law that keep generics off the market and keep drug prices too \nhigh for too long. The CBO estimates that this provision will save \nAmericans $60 billion over 10 years.\n  I hope, but don't expect, that these two important provisions will \nsurvive the upcoming conference with the House of Representatives. And \nwhile I continue to hope that the conference will come back with a \nbetter Medicare drug benefit, I regret that it is unlikely to be the \ncase. The House bill is in many ways even worse than the Senate bill \nbefore us.\n  Mr. President, I regret that none of the amendments that I supported \nduring this debate prevailed. These amendments would have greatly \nimproved this bill and provided a real prescription drug benefit to \nseniors--a benefit we could all have been proud of. Instead, this bill \nis an empty promise to seniors and the disabled on Medicare. This is \nnot the kind of plan they have been asking for or have a right to \nexpect. We could and should have done better. But at minimum, we could \nand should be able to hold our work here to the standard set in the \nHippocratic Oath: do no harm. And we have failed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the \nFinance Committee for including provisions in S. 1 that will provide a \nmeasure of relief to rural health care providers, and in particular to \nhome health agencies serving patients in rural areas. I am concerned, \nhowever, that the underlying bill does not go quite far enough and have \nfiled an amendment with Senator Bond to increase the rural add-on \npayment for home health agencies to 10 percent. This was the amount of \nthe payment prior to its expiration on April 1, and I believe it is the \namount that is necessary to ensure that Medicare patients in rural \nareas continue to have access to the home health services that they \nneed.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled--and often technically \ncomplex--services that our Nation's home health agencies provide have \nenabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older persons to \navoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be--\nin the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  Surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services in rural \nareas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the \nextra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, \nhigher transportation expenses, and other factors. Because of the \nlonger travel times, rural caregivers are unable to make as many visits \nin a day as their urban counterparts. Saundra Scott-Adams, the \nexecutive director of the Visiting Nurses of Aroostook in Aroostook \nCounty, ME, where I am from, tells me her agency covers 6,600 square \nmiles with a population of only 72,000. Her costs are understandably \nmuch higher than the average agency due to the long distances her staff \nmust drive to see clients. And, her staff is not able to see as many \npatients.\n  Agencies in rural areas are also frequently smaller than their urban \ncounterparts, which means that their relative costs are higher due to \nsmaller scale operations. Smaller agencies with fewer patients and \nfewer visits mean that fixed costs, particularly those associated with \nmeeting regulatory requirements, are spread over a smaller number of \npatients and visits, increasing overall per-patient and per-visit \ncosts.\n  Moreover, in many rural areas, home health agencies are the primary \ncaregivers for homebound beneficiaries with limited access to \ntransportation. These rural patients often require more time and care \nthan their urban counterparts, and are understandably more expensive \nfor agencies to serve. If the rural add-on payment is not reinstated, \nagencies may be forced to make decisions not to accept rural patients \nwith greater care needs, and access will suffer further.\n  The loss of the rural add-on has already caused many agencies to \nreduce their service areas. Some are eliminating services altogether in \nremote areas. There are some counties in Montana, for example, that \nhave no home health services. And agencies in my home State of Maine \nhave had to eliminate delivery of services to some of our outlying \nislands.\n  If the 10 percent rural add-on payment is not restored, it will only \nput more pressure on rural home health agencies that are already \noperating on very narrow margins and could force more of these agencies \nto close. Many home health agencies operating in rural areas are the \nonly home health providers in a vast geographic area. If any of these \nagencies are forced to close, the Medicare patients in that region will \nlose complete access to home care.\n  There is strong support in the Senate for restoring the rural add-on. \nEarlier this month, 55 Senators joined me in sending a letter to the \nchair and ranking member of the senate Finance Committee urging that \nthey extend the 10 per cent rural add-on for home health agencies, and \nI ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee and his staff have been working \nwith us to try to accommodate my amendment, and I am very appreciative \nof their efforts. I am hopeful that we will be able to work this out so \nthat we will be able to ensure that Medicare patients in rural areas \ncontinue to have access to the home health services that they need.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley, Chairman,\n     Hon. Max Baucus, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on Finance, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Grassley and Baucus: Home health has become \n     an increasingly important part of our health care system. The \n     kinds of highly skilled and often technically complex \n     services that our nation's home health agencies provide have \n     enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older \n     persons to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just \n     where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their \n     own homes.\n       By the late 1990s, home health was the fastest growing \n     component of Medicare spending. The rapid growth in home \n     health spending understandably prompted the Congress and the \n     Administration--as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--\n     to initiate changes that were intended to slow this growth in \n     spending and make the program more cost-effective and \n     efficient. These measures however, produced cuts in home \n     health spending far beyond what Congress intended. Home \n     health spending dropped to $10 billion in FY 2002, nearly \n     half the 1997 amount, and it is clear that the savings goals \n     set for home health in the Balanced Budget Act have not only \n     been met, but far surpassed.\n       According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the \n     post-Balanced Budget Act reductions in home health spending \n     totaled more than $72 billion between fiscal years 1998 and \n     2002. This is over four times the $16 billion that the CBO \n     originally estimated for that time period and is a clear \n     indication that the Medicare home health cutbacks have been \n     far deeper than Congress intended.\n       As a consequence of these cutbacks, over 3,400 home health \n     agencies nationwide have either closed or stopped serving \n     Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, the number of Medicare \n     patients receiving home health care nationwide has dropped by \n     1.3 million--more than one-third. Which points to the central \n     and most critical issue--cuts of this magnitude simply cannot \n     be sustained without ultimately affecting patient care.\n       On October 1, 2002, home health agencies received an \n     additional across-the-board cut in Medicare home health \n     payments, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n     has dramatically reduced projections for home health spending \n     under the Medicare program over the next ten years. We are \n     concerned that any further cuts in payments for home \n     health services simply cannot be sustained without \n     affecting patient care, particularly for those Medicare \n     beneficiaries with complex care requirements.\n       As you begin consideration of a Medicare modernization \n     package, we urge that you avoid any further cuts in payments \n     for home health services and preserve the full market basket \n     update for payments for home health services for 2004. In \n     addition, we urge that you extend the 10 percent add-on \n     payment for home health services in rural areas that expired \n     on April 1, 2003. Surveys have shown that the delivery of \n     home health services in rural areas can be as much as 12 to \n     15 percent more costly because of the extra travel time \n     required to cover long distances between patients, higher \n     transportation expenses, and\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n     other factors. Extension of this add-on payment will \n     therefore help to ensure that Medicare patients in rural \n     areas continue to have access to the home health services \n     they need.\n       Thank you for your consideration, and we look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that elderly and disabled \n     Americans continue to have access to quality home health \n     services.\n           Sincerely,\n         Susan M. Collins; Christopher S. Bond; Wayne Allard; \n           Gordon Smith; Robert F. Bennett; Richard Lugar; Jack \n           Reed; Russell D.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of S. 1, \nthe Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act of 2003. However, I \ndo so with great trepidation. While I intend to vote for the bill that \nis presently before the Senate, I believe that drastic changes are \nstill necessary to make the benefit created by this legislation one \nthat meets the needs of our senior citizens.\n  I am also deeply concerned that Members on the other side of the \naisle--as well as those in the House of Representatives, and the \nadministration--will attempt to move this bill in a destructive \ndirection during conference. Let me reiterate what I said in an earlier \nstatement on this issue: we must not approve any Medicare reform \nmeasure that would force seniors to join private plans in order to \nreceive a more generous prescription drug benefit. Such a measure would \nsignal an end to the Medicare Program as we know it and should be \nrejected out of hand. I urge my colleagues to protect the Medicare that \nour seniors have come to rely on, and I urge the President not to sign \nany bill that privatizes Medicare. If such changes are made, I will not \nhesitate to oppose the conference report.\n  Given these concerns, it is reasonable to ask why I am supporting \nthis bill. The answer is quite simple--seniors in my home State of \nConnecticut and across the country have been waiting far too long for a \nprescription drug benefit under Medicare. And it is time that we in \nCongress heard them.\n  Over the past month I had the opportunity to convene a series of \nforums on senior health care in Connecticut in an attempt to frame the \nscope of this debate. At these forums I heard from my constituents on \nmany matters regarding their health care. But the present lack of \ncoverage for prescription drugs under the Medicare program was by far \nthe issue raised most often.\n  At these forums I heard from seniors who literally could not afford \nto fill prescriptions called for by their doctors. I heard from elderly \nMedicare beneficiaries forced to choose between purchasing groceries or \nfilling their prescriptions. I heard from seniors who were forced to \nskip dosages of their medicines in an attempt to stretch their limited \nsupplies of needed medicines. I heard from Medicare beneficiaries \nrequiring more than 10 prescribed medicines a day unable to afford even \nhalf of these prescriptions. Clearly, what I heard from hundreds of \nConnecticut's more than 500,000 Medicare beneficiaries is their grave \nconcern over the present lack of a prescription drug benefit under the \nMedicare Program.\n  I believe that the legislation about to be approved by this body \noffers an answer to those concerns. It is not the most complete answer, \nbut it is a start--based on which we can improve in the future. It is a \nstart because it will make so many seniors better off than they are \ntoday. And that should be our ultimate goal as legislators--to make \npeople's lives better. Often this must be done incrementally, in steps. \nThis bill is a positive first step.\n  What do I mean when I say that it will make people better off? In \nConnecticut, one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries have incomes below \n160 percent of poverty. For many of these seniors, drug costs can be \ncrippling. They are forced to choose between putting food on the table, \nand buying the medicines that they need to live healthy lives. With the \npassage of this bill, these seniors will no longer have to make this \nchoice. The new Medicare prescription drug benefit will cover most, if \nnot all, of their drug costs. I congratulate Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus, and other members of the Senate Finance Committee for \nincluding in this bill such a generous benefit for those low-income \nseniors.\n  This legislation is not as clear cut for those seniors who have \nincomes above 160 percent of poverty. However, I believe that the \nmajority will be helped by passage of this bill. The break even for \nthis benefit--the point where an individual is better off with the \nbenefit rather than just paying for all prescription drugs our of their \nown pocket--is about $1,100 in total annual drug costs. The average \nMedicare beneficiary spends approximately $2,300 on prescription \nmedicines today. That number will undoubtedly be higher when this new \nbenefit goes into effect in 2006. With the benefit created by this \nbill, that average beneficiary will realize nearly $600 in savings. The \nsavings will be even greater for the 11 percent of beneficiaries who \nspend more than $5,000 per year on prescription drugs. These are the \nseniors facing the most sever health problems, and most in need of \nfinancial assistance. That is what this bill provides--even if it is \nnot to the extent that many of us would have liked.\n  I am voting for this bill because so many seniors in Connecticut and \nthroughout the country stand to benefit. However, no bill is perfect \nand S. 1 clearly still leaves much room for improvement even as it \nmoves toward final Senate passage. I am particularly disheartened that, \ndespite numerous attempts over the past 2 weeks, we have failed to \naddress concerns over the present bill's lack of adequate provisions to \nensure that those companies presently providing their retirees with \nprescription drug coverage receive adequate Federal support for their \nlaudable efforts. While the creation of a prescription drug benefit \nunder the Medicare program is laudable, it should not come at the price \nof displacing the employer-based benefits that so many seniors have \ncome to rely on.\n  Additionally, I remain concerned that the gap in coverage in the \npresent bill, the so-called donut hole, will leave many Medicare \nbeneficiaries facing high prescription drug costs with no assistance at \nthe very time when it is most needed. Over the past 2 weeks, I have \nboth offered and supported amendments designed to provide assistance to \nthose with prescription drug costs within the hole, especially those \nwith lower incomes who can least afford any gap in coverage, that have \nfailed to win support by the Senate. Failure to close this gap, in my \nview, constitutes a glaring failure, one that I hope can be reversed as \nthis bill moves into conference.\n  I also am concerned that S. 1 fails to adequately protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries form the very understandable confusion and uncertainty \nthat may surround them just as they begin to navigate the intricacies \nof a brand-new program. Specifically, if enacted the underlying bill \nwill require Medicare beneficiaries choosing a prescription drug plan \nto stay with that plan for a minimum of 1 year. With the enactment of \nsuch broad and weeping changes to the Medicare program, I am fearful \nthat many Medicare beneficiaries will face great uncertainty trying to \nfind the best plan to meet their particular needs. For this reason, I \noffered an amendment to S. 1 that would have simply granted Medicare \nbeneficiaries navigating this new benefit for the very first time the \nability to switch plans as they seek to determine which plan fits their \nparticular health care needs in the first 2 years of the bill's \nbenefit. Unfortunately, this amendment was not agreed to and I remain \nconcerned that without its protections, senior Medicare beneficiaries \nwill be unfairly locked into plans that do not meet their needs.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that S. 1 represents a significant \ndeparture from\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\nprevious plans supported by the administration that would have required \nMedicare beneficiaries to leave the traditional fee-for-service \nMedicare Program in order to receive coverage for their prescribed \nmedicines. Such a move would be unconscionable as 89 percent of all \nMedicare beneficiaries today are in the traditional program. To force \nthese beneficiaries to leave their present system of coverage, and most \nlikely the doctor that they have come to know and trust, would not only \ncreate great disruption, it would also for the first time since the \nprogram's inception create a tiered benefit system under Medicare that \nwould more greatly reward those who choose to join a private preferred \nprovider organization, PPO, or health maintenance organization, HMO.\n  And while I am pleased that the bill before us soundly rejects a \ntiered benefit system, I am deeply concerned that the plan presently \ntaking shape in the House of Representatives appears to rely on such a \nflawed plan. As I said earlier, such a measure should be soundly \nrejected.\n  So it is with great caution that we come to the final moments of \ndebate on this important issue. Medicare's nearly 41 million \nbeneficiaries clearly need assistance in affording their needed \nmedicines. The result of our efforts over the past 2 weeks, and more \nimportant, the result of the coming conference committee on this \nlegislation will greatly determine to what extent we assist our \nNation's Medicare beneficiaries to afford their needed medicines.\n  Clearly, a great opportunity is presently before us. As the \nunderlying bill moves to conference committee. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to ensure that we seize this opportunity by \nstrengthening the underlying bill. With passage of the bill presently \nbefore us, we now face a choice. We can insist on the good start that \nwe have made here with passage of S. 1, and work to strengthen its \nprovisions. Or, conversely, we can accede to the House legislation that \nin my view unfairly jeopardizes the traditional Medicare Program by \ntilting the system in favor of risky privatization schemes and against \nseniors.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in working to ensure that any \nMedicare prescription drug legislation passed by this Congress is at \nleast as strong as the bill we are about to vote on. A tilt toward the \nHouse-drafted language would signify not a strengthening of Medicare, \nbut rather a weakening of this vital program's foundation and must be \navoided at all costs.\n  Nearly 38 years ago on July 9, 1965, this body passed the legislation \ncreating the Federal Medicare Program sending it to a conference \ncommittee with the House. On that day, President Lyndon Baines Johnson \nremarked, ``This is a great day for older Americans. And it is a great \nday for America. For we have proved, once again, that the vitality of \nour democracy can shape the oldest of our values to the needs and \nobligations of today.'' Nearly four decades later, we are on the cusp \nof a similar challenge. Let us move Medicare toward the future without \nthreatening its proven ability to provide for the health and well being \nof this Nation's senior citizens.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to mark this extraordinary day \nby coming to the floor of the Senate to celebrate the imminent passage \nof a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. This is a triumph not for \na party or a President, but for America's seniors and their families. \nThis is an incredibly hopeful day for all Americans who long for a \nnational government that can get things done for people.\n  Thirty-eight years ago Congress voted to create a health care program \nthat would be the primary source of health insurance for this Nation's \nseniors. Most people would agree that this program has served us well \nfor almost four decades. However, the practice of medicine has changed. \nDrug therapies, medical devices, and human genome research all hold \ngreat hope for breaking through physical limitations that hinder many \nseniors' ability to enjoy the later years of life.\n  The question we now ask is what level of care are we going to provide \nour seniors and is the current system equipped to provide the type of \ncare our seniors need and deserve.\n  The benefits provided under Medicare, considered generous at its \ninception in 1965, pale in comparison to those enjoyed by Federal \nemployees and most workers in the private sector today. A recent report \nsubmitted by the Joint Economic Committee found that Medicare has the \nleast generous benefit package among leading forms of insurance. \nMedicare covers 56 percent of total health care expenses, while typical \nemployment-based health insurance covers 70 percent.\n  Seniors need prescription drug coverage. Seniors need better access \nto preventative care and disease management. Seniors need more choices \nin their health care options than they have today. Without updating, it \nmay take years to add this kind of care to the current program--after \nall, it has taken over 30 years to add a prescription drug benefit.\n  The Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement bill is a step toward \nmeeting the needs of this Nation's seniors.\n  This bill provides a solid drug benefit that will provide assistance \nto every senior struggling to pay for prescription drugs as well as the \nsecurity of knowing they are covered for unforeseen drug expenses.\n  Under this plan, the average senior's annual drug costs will be \nreduced by 53 percent each year. That amounts to $1,677 each year back \nin the pocket of our seniors. And seniors with the greatest needs will \nreceive additional assistance through increased cost-sharing, and \nreduced or waived monthly premiums and deductible.\n  Equally important, this plan provides seniors with the security of \nknowing that they are covered in the event something happens and they \nfind themselves facing exorbitant drug costs. At $3,700 in out of \npocket drug costs, stop-loss coverage kicks in and the senior is only \nresponsible for 10 percent of costs beyond this amount.\n  This bill is also about expanding options for this generation and \nfuture generations of seniors. The incremental improvements to the \nMedicare program have largely been the result of legislative action \nover the last 40 years. The legislative process, however, is not a \nquick process, and it is simply not possible to keep the program \ncurrent in the first parcel environment we currently live.\n  The Medicare Advantage program included in this bill offers seniors \nthe choice of receiving their health care benefits in a Preferred \nProvider Organization, PPO, the same type of health plan enjoyed by \nmany families.\n  Under this health care option--not mandate--seniors will have \nincreased access to the latest advances in care such as desire \nmanagement and better preventive screenings. Additionally, seniors who \nchose this option will also have a lower deductible for inpatient and \nhospital care than those in traditional Medicare.\n  This bill lays the foundation for a Medicare program that is better \nable to respond to an evolving health care system by harnessing the \nefficiencies of the health care market, while preserving traditional \nMedicare for those seniors who are satisfied with their current \ncoverage.\n  This bill is about expanding options for seniors so our parents and \ngrandparents have access to the type of care best suited for them.\n  Is this bill everything everyone wants? Of course not. Are there \ndecisions still to be made as it is implemented and we see how it \nactually works in the marketplace? Certainly. But this bill says we are \nnot going to let the lack of perfection stop us from doing real good \nfor people as soon and as effectively as we practically can.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't express my appreciation to Senators \nGrassley and Baucus for their leadership in including many provisions \nin this bill to strengthen rural health care.\n  The availability of health care in rural areas in Minnesota is \nabsolutely critical to the stability and viability of many communities.\n  The provisions in this bill to improve payments to hospitals in rural \nareas and reduce the geographic disparity in physician payments are \ncritical to ensuring that these hospitals that threat not only seniors, \nbut entire communities continued to receive care.\n  I am pleased that we did not allow perfect to be the enemy of good as \nwe considered this package.\n  This is a substantial and dependable benefit for America's seniors. \nAgain,\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\nit's not everything everyone wants. There are still decisions to be \nmade as it is implemented and we monitor how it works in the \nmarketplace. But today we are delivering on a promise to provide \nquality care to our seniors.\n  I am hopeful that with bipartisan support this landmark legislation \nwill pass the Senate and the House of Representatives by the July 4th \nholiday. When it does, there may not be any fireworks and parades but \nmillions of seniors will be able to declare their independence from \nworrying about getting the prescription drugs they need to live a \nquality life.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, after many years of preparation and \ndeliberation, and following weeks of debate and discussion on the floor \nthis year and last, we in the Senate are about to vote on a bill \nproviding some prescription drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries \nthat is widely expected to pass.\n  Seniors have been demanding prescription drug coverage for many years \nnow. They need it and they deserve it, and I believe what we should be \npassing here today is a bill that will bring the American people the \ntype of prescription drug benefit they have been seeking--one that is \neasy to understand and use, one that covers a substantial portion of \nall their costs, and one that is affordable.\n  But to the many Medicare beneficiaries who will read the details of \nthis bill and say, ``there isn't much in here for me and it will cost \nme more than I am now paying for drugs,'' I would say: I hear you. This \nbill is not enough, not nearly enough.\n  I have a lot of concerns about this bill. There is no uniformity from \nregion to region in the benefit package or beneficiary payments. \nSeniors in the East could be paying far higher premiums than their \nrelatives in the Midwest.\n  The drug plan relies on private insurance companies to provide a type \nof insurance policy that they have already said they are unwilling to \nsell. I am skeptical that these private plans will stay, and that could \nmean seniors will have no stability in their coverage. The bill does \nallow traditional Medicare to step in and fill the gap but seniors \nmight have to move back to a private drug plan if new ones come to the \nregion.\n  There is also a gap in coverage which I think is unfair and will \nsurprise a lot of people.\n  Finally, the bill falls short in its efforts to induce employers not \nto abandon their retiree prescription drug coverage, a situation that \ntoo many retirees have already faced in recent years.\n  In summary, I view this bill not as a situation where we would say \nthat the glass is half full and half empty; to my thinking, the glass \nis only about one-quarter full. In 2003, prescription drugs are as \nimportant in medical care as surgery; consequently, it seems logical to \nme that if Medicare pays for the bulk of the cost of a heart bypass \noperation for all beneficiaries, it should similarly pay the bulk of \nthe cost of the drugs used to lower the cholesterol, and which would \nprevent the need for the bypass operation, for all beneficiaries. This \nbill does not achieve that commonsense goal. Not even close.\n  But we need to start somewhere. This is the first step in gradually \nmoving the health plan that covers nearly 40 million seniors and \ndisabled individuals into the 21st century. And it is, very frankly, \nthe best that we can expect to pass this Congress and that the \nPresident will sign.\n  There are some good provisions in this bill. All Medicare \nbeneficiaries will have access to a prescription drug plan. Individuals \nwith low incomes, below 160 percent of Federal poverty level, will have \naccess to prescription drug coverage at very little cost. Those with \nvery high prescription drug expenses, in the many thousands of dollars, \nwill have stop-loss protection to help protect them against \ncatastrophic drug costs. And no one is forced to abandon the \ntraditional Medicare Program for their basic health care, with which \nthey are so familiar, in order to obtain prescription drug coverage.\n  During the Senate deliberation on this bill, I have voted for \namendments that would improve the prescription drug coverage and \ndecrease the cost to beneficiaries. Almost all of these amendments were \nnot adopted, mostly with the rationale that there was not enough money. \nI do not feel constrained by some arbitrary $400 billion cost limit on \nthis bill. I never agreed to such a limit. In fact, my sense of values \ntells me that prescription drug benefits are a high priority, and I \nwould be willing to spend more than $400 billion for a good \nprescription drug plan, while cutting budget items of lower priority, \nsuch as tax cuts for the very wealthy.\n  In the end, I decided to vote for this bill, despite its severe \nlimitations. Given the many past years of fruitless discussions on this \nmatter, I feel it is critical to put something into law now that can \nserve as a starting point for development of a true prescription drug \nplan. But that is not to say that I will accept any lesser of a bill, \nand my colleagues should not count on my continued support, if the \nfinal version of this bill that comes out of negotiations with the \nHouse of Representatives undercuts the Medicare Program or moves toward \nreducing protections for beneficiaries.\n  We also need to remember, this bill comes with a warning to all of \nus: the public is a lot smarter than they are sometimes given credit \nfor, and if we do not work diligently to improve what we have begun, \nthey will rightly take out their anger on us. We need to ensure that \nthis bill is the first step, not the last step.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Are we now ready \nfor third reading?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \ncommittee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \npassage of S. 1, the bill be held at the desk; further, when the Senate \nreceives from the House the companion measure to S. 1 the Senate \nproceed to its consideration, all after the enacting clause be \nstricken, and the text of S. 1 as passed be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthe bill then be read a third time and passed with the motion to \nreconsider laid upon the table; further, that the Senate then insist on \nits amendments and request a conference with the House, and the Chair \nbe authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio of 5 to 4; finally, \nwith that action, I ask unanimous consent that passage of S. 1 be \nvitiated and the bill be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to return to \nthe basics of what this bill is all about. Let's keep our eyes on the \nball.\n  We are working here to make a meaningful improvement in health care \nfor seniors. We are working to bring prescription drug coverage to \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Too many seniors do without drug coverage. The Congressional Budget \nOffice reports that roughly a quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have no \ndrug coverage. Ten million people. They have to pay all of their drug \ncosts out of their own pockets. They pay full price.\n  Lack of coverage means poorer health. Seniors who get along without \ndrug coverage get fewer of the healing benefits that prescription drugs \nprovide. CBO reports that when seniors do not have drug coverage, they \nfill about a quarter fewer prescriptions, on average, than do those who \nhave coverage.\n  But whether seniors have coverage or not, they still need a \nsignificant amount of prescription drugs. CBO says that in 1999, \nMedicare beneficiaries who had coverage filled an average of 32 \nprescriptions a year. Those without coverage still filled an average of \n25 prescriptions a year.\n  These prescriptions cost seniors a good deal of money. The average \nMedicare beneficiary spends about $2,500 a year on prescription drugs. \nThat's a big number--especially as the median income for all elderly \nhouseholds in 2001 was less than $19,000.\n  Those costs are rising fast. CBO projects that the average Medicare \nbeneficiary's drug costs will rise at a\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nrate of more than 10 percent a year over the next decade. That is far \nfaster than the cost of living. That means that without this \nlegislation, seniors will need to devote larger and larger shares of \ntheir income to paying prescription drug bills.\n  So we are here to try to make prescription drugs more affordable for \nseniors. And we are here to extend coverage to the roughly 10 million \nseniors who have no prescription drug coverage at all.\n  We are here to try to end seniors' painful choice between filling \nprescriptions and buying food. Seniors should not have to choose among \nthe necessities to maintain their health. We are here to do something \nabout that today.\n  Let me review what this bill would do.\n  This bill would make available prescription drug insurance to all \nseniors.\n  This bill would ensure that 44 percent of Medicare beneficiaries--\nthose with the lowest incomes--would have truly affordable prescription \ndrug coverage with minimal out-of-pocket costs. For these lower-income \nseniors, with incomes up to 160 percent of the poverty level, \ncopayments would never exceed 20 percent of the cost of drugs.\n  Let me take some examples. Let's look at what this bill would do for \nbeneficiaries with what will likely be average drug spending of $3,155 \nin 2006.\n  For seniors with average drug expenses, even with higher incomes, \nthis bill would save them $1,677. That is a 40 percent savings in out-\nof-pocket costs.\n  The savings would be greater for lower income seniors. For an \nindividual making $14,000 or a couple making $19,000 a year, with \naverage drug spending, they would save $2,842. That is a 90 percent \nsavings in out-of-pocket costs.\n  For an individual making $12,000 or couple making $16,000 a year with \naverage drug spending, they would save $2,842 in out-of-pocket costs. \nThat would be a savings of 96 percent in out-of-pocket costs.\n  This bill would thus ensure that those who have been least able to \nreceive the healing benefits of prescription drugs would now be able to \ndo so. Millions of people would have a better quality of life. Lives \nwould be saved.\n  This bill would create a strong Government fallback. Seniors would \nhave access to at least two private plans for a prescription drug \nbenefit, or the Government would provide a standard fallback plan. If \nthere is not true competition, then traditional Medicare would provide \na fallback.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services would continue to oversee \nthese plans. The plans would operate within tightly controlled limits. \nThis bill includes strong consumer protections.\n  And this bill does not tilt the playing field. This bill does not \nmake private plans a better deal than traditional Medicare.\n  This bill would make a nearly $400 billion expansion of a major \nentitlement program. This is a historic opportunity to make a \nfundamental change for the better for millions of Americans.\n  In so doing, this bill would finally do something that the \noverwhelming majority of industrialized nations have already done.\n  This is a broad compromise. This is not a bill of the left or a bill \nof the right. This is a weaving together of approaches, in the finest \nAmerican tradition.\n  This is a historic opportunity. Let us finally seize that \nopportunity, and improve health care for our seniors. Let us finally \nseize the opportunity, and bring prescription drug coverage to all.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are about to take a historical vote.\n  Since 1965, Medicare hasn't covered prescription drugs. Now, 38 years \nlater, we're changing that--on a strong bipartisan basis.\n  Because of this bill, on January 1, 2004, seniors across America will \nhave immediate help with prescription drug costs. Moreover, on January \n1, 2006, seniors will have access to affordable, comprehensive drug \ncoverage as a permanent part of Medicare.\n  No longer will seniors have to make hard choices when it comes to \npaying for prescription drugs.\n  This bill also strengthens and improves Medicare, giving seniors more \nchoices and better benefits than they have today.\n  At the same time, it brings long overdue Medicare equity to the \npeople of Iowa and to other rural States.\n  We are on the verge of a major victory.\n  I urge my colleagues to support S. 1.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are about to vote. I want to thank all \nSenators for their tremendous patience. It is not an easy task. I \nparticularly thank the chairman of the committee but also all Senators.\n  Second, I thank the staff who have not had any sleep in the last two \nor three weeks. I don't know how they are still standing. A lot of \npeople have been working on this bill. My thanks. I know I speak for \nall the Senators in thanking all the staff that worked so hard to help \nachieve this end.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill having been read the third time, \nthe question is, shall it pass?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) \nand the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kerry) would vote ``nay''.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair, in my capacity as a Senator \nfrom the State of Alaska, moves to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, because of urgent business back in my \nState of Oklahoma, I will be unable to be in attendance to vote on S. \n1. It makes no difference, however, because I would have voted against \nit.\n  Last week, I addressed this Chamber regarding S. 1, the Prescription \nDrug and Medicare Improvement Act. At that time, I said I could not \nsupport the legislation in its current form and expressed my hope that \nit could be improved on the floor. Unfortunately, that has not \noccurred. I am restating my opposition to this legislation.\n  This is simply another Federal entitlement program designed to \nballoon past expected costs of $400 billion. For\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\nexample, in the past, Medicare expenses have soared nearly five times \nthe projected costs. I remember that well because I remember in 1965 \nwhen it was passed. This trend will only escalate if we continue to add \nunfunded obligations without ensuring the long-term solvency of the \nentire program.\n  We must examine the necessity of such obligations prior to placing \nthe burden on the backs of the future taxpayers. And is a full \nprescription drug benefit necessary? Currently, 76 percent of seniors \nalready have some form of prescription drug coverage. A recent Zogby \npoll found that three-fourths of seniors thought the coverage offered \nunder this plan would be no better than what they currently have. In \nfact, less than one-half would even purchase the option if given the \nchoice. However, with the passage of S. 1, those individuals may not be \ngiven that choice. CBO estimates that one-third of Medicare \nbeneficiaries with employer-sponsored coverage will lose those benefits \nonce the bill takes effect. Seniors who currently have private coverage \nthat they like will be forced to buy the Government-sponsored benefit \nsimply because it is the only thing that will be available.\n  There is something wrong with that picture. The Government should not \nbe replacing coverage that already exists. However, this legislation \nopens the door for continued Government intervention. With the \ninclusion of the fallback provision, this benefit has the potential to \nbecome fully federalized if private plans do not surface. Once again, \nwe are placing more and more expense at the door of the taxpayers, our \nchildren, and our grandchildren.\n  I am concerned about the effect this bill could have on the future of \nthe entire Medicare Program. I have worked with my colleagues to \nsupport improvements to this legislation. I and many of my colleagues \nhave signed letters to both Senator Frist and President Bush outlining \nthe principles that need to be included in the final version of this \nbill. I also cosponsored an amendment with Senators Ensign, Hagel, and \nLott to provide a more reasonable prescription drug benefit that does \nnot create a massive entitlement program. I believe the House of \nRepresentatives is on the right track with this issue.\n  I am hopeful that with the passage of S. 1, the conferees will work \nto see that the final legislation adheres to the principles stated in \nthe letters to President Bush and Senator Frist and the proposal \nsupported by the House. At that time, I will look forward to supporting \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for years Congress has debated providing \nprescription drug coverage to seniors and how to strengthen and improve \nthe Medicare Program. Tonight we have acted. Tonight America is one \nstep closer to being a more caring society for millions of seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities. Tonight seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities, through this bill, will get relief from high prescription \ndrug costs and outdated, often inadequate medical care. Tonight we are \none step closer to providing real health care security to seniors all \nacross the Nation.\n  We stand on the shoulders of many in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives who have labored mightily to improve the Medicare \nProgram. We have reached this point of success because of the \ncommitment of the leadership in the House as well as the Senate. Above \nall, we are indebted to the bold leadership of the President of the \nUnited States without whom we would not be transforming or improving \nthe system.\n  Indeed, the bill we have just passed is nothing less than historic. \nBy dramatically expanding opportunities for private sector innovation, \nit offers genuine reform that will dramatically improve the quality of \nhealth care for all seniors. At the same time, the legislation \npreserves traditional Medicare so that those who wish can remain in \ntraditional Medicare and keep exactly what they have today.\n  This bill combines the best of the public and private sectors and \npositions Medicare to evolve with the medical treatments of the future. \nIt is entirely voluntary.\n  I am very pleased by the overwhelming majority of this body who \ntonight voted to move this legislation towards a more competitive \nprivate model but a partnership between the public and private sector.\n  I am also pleased that the amendment maintained the balance that has \nbeen so important in what I set out a few weeks ago, to be a truly \nbipartisan effort. The bill devotes increased resources and expands \nopportunities within the traditional Medicare Program for chronic care \ncoordination, for disease management, for preventive care.\n  As many people have stated, it is not a perfect bill, but we will \ncontinue to move this legislation forward now to conference once, later \nin the evening or in the hours of the morning, after the House passes \nits legislation, we will have the opportunity to make the private \nsector provisions more flexible, indeed more competitive, and more like \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. All of us in this body are \nfamiliar with the impressive record of that plan, the Federal employees \nplan. Every Member of Congress and over 8 million other Federal workers \nand retirees enjoy the ability to choose the plan that best suits their \nmedical needs.\n\n  Indeed, as we go through conference and once the bill is signed by \nthe President of the United States, all seniors will have that same \nopportunity to voluntarily choose the plan that best meets their \nmedical needs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to improve this legislation and to make sure that it does not \ninadvertently displace good private health care coverage that exists \ntoday--options that are available to millions of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, including employer-sponsored health coverage.\n  Compromise and debate are the cornerstone of this great democratic \nsystem of government. I commend my colleagues for their admirable show \nof bipartisan spirit. Thanks to the leadership of our colleagues in the \nSenate and the commitment of President Bush, America's seniors will \nfinally receive the health coverage they need and the security they \ndeserve.\n  I want to take a brief moment to thank all of my colleagues for their \nhard work and dedication over the last several weeks. It has been about \n3 months ago that I set out that we would address Medicare for these 2 \nweeks--the 2 weeks prior to the July 4 recess. Many people said we were \ntrying to do too much in too short a period of time. Others said it is \nsomething that has been debated for weeks and months, and indeed years, \nand there is no way we can finish it before July 4.\n  Yet through the hard work of our colleagues--again, on both sides of \nthe aisle--we have fulfilled that vision. Again, it is a first step, a \nstep that will be improved in that conference before us. Nevertheless, \nwe succeeded in what we set out to do with the legislation that is \nbuilt upon the work of many Members of the Senate, as well as the House \nof Representatives and, in particular, the members of the Senate \nFinance Committee. I do want to thank especially Senators Hatch, \nNickles, Lott, Snowe, Kyl, Thomas, Santorum, Smith, Bunning, and Breaux \nfor their hard work and leadership.\n  In particular, of course, I thank Chairman Grassley and Senator \nBaucus, the managers, who for the last 2 weeks have so capably managed \nthe bill on the floor. Their cooperation and their leadership has been \ninvaluable. Without it, we would not be here so close to the finish \nline.\n  I would like to recognize all of the staff who have contributed to \nthis effort:\n  First, I would like to thank my chief of staff, Lee Rawls: my policy \ndirector, Eric Ueland; and my health policy director, Dean Rosen. Paul \nJacobson, Bob Stevenson, Nick Smith, Bill Hoagland, and Amy Holmes of \nmy Leadership office also made important contributions. I also would \nlike to recognize the other members of my health team who worked so \nhard to help make possible the passage of this legislation: Elizabeth \nScanlon, Craig Burton, Susan Goelzer, Shana Christrup, Allison Winnike, \nand Jennifer Romans.\n  The Majority Whip's staff deserves special recognition, especially \nKyle Simmons, Michael Solon, and Amy Swonger, for the long hours they \nput in and for the guidance they provided to our Finance Committee \nChairman and our entire Republican leadership team.\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\n  As I have said, passage of this legislation was made possible in the \nUnited States Senate because of the genuine spirit of bipartisan \ncooperation. Both the Republican and Democratic staff of the Senate \nFinance Committee worked incredibly hard, long hours these past several \nweeks and months. Their expertise, support, and stamina has been \ninvaluable.\n  I would like to thank Kolan Davis, Ted Totman, Linda Fishman, Colin \nRoskey, Leah Kegler, Mark Hayes, Jennifer Bell, and Alicia Ziemiecki of \nChairman Grassley's staff.\n  And I would also like to thank Jeffrey Forbes, Elizabeth Fowler, Bill \nDauster, John Blum, Pat Bousilman, Kate Kirchgraber, and Andrea Cohen \nof Senator Baucus' staff for their contributions.\n  Hazen Marshall, Stacey Hughes, and Megan Hauck of the Senate Budget \nCommittee staff are also commended for their efforts.\n  Thank you to you all.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Grassley and our colleagues \nin the House of Representatives to produce a conference report that can \npass both Houses and be signed by the President in a timely manner \nlater this year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Madam President, the Senate is poised to adjourn, but \nbefore we adjourn, I want to call us away from the onrushing press of \nSenate business and impending airline schedules to pay tribute to \nIndependence Day. Next Friday is the glorious Fourth of July, that most \npatriotic and star-spangled of holidays. With the Fourth of July \nholiday, summer is at its Halcyon best, with temperatures still \nenjoyable, skies richly blue, and trees and lawns still lush and green, \nand gardens coming into bewildering abundance. In fields and along the \nroadsides, wildflowers bloom in profusion, and wild blackberries earn \nour forgiveness for their thorns by offering the tender treasures of \ntheir glossy berries.\n  It is a golden period of enjoyment for students on summer holiday, \nthe respite still feels luxuriously long, full of golden days of \nenjoyment.\n  The Fourth of July this year falls on a Friday, easily making a long \nweekend for summer pleasure. With luck, the Fourth will be clear and \ncooler, comfortable for marching bands and hometown parades, bathed in \nglorious sunshine for family picnics and perfect for evening symphonies \nand fireworks to compete with the glittering stars above.\n  If the weather is sweltering, however, then we might be better able \nto empathize with the Delegates to the Second Continental Congress, who \nmet in Philadelphia in the spring and summer of 1776. In hot and muggy \nsummer weather, clad in heavy styles that were designed for a cooler \nEuropean summer, the Delegates debated and amended, reportedly fending \noff flies from a nearby stable that swarmed the Hall and bit the \nDelegates through the silk hose on their lower legs. But they \npersevered in their momentous task.\n  On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia offered a motion to \ndeclare independence from England. His resolution declared:\n\n       These United Colonies are and of right ought to be free and \n     independent States.\n\nHis resolution passed on July 2 by a 12-0 vote, with New York \ntemporarily abstaining.\n  The next day, on July 3, John Adams wrote to his wife, Abigail, \nrejoicing over the decision to secede. To Abigail, he wrote:\n\n       The 2nd of July will be a memorable epoch in the history of \n     America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by \n     succeeding generations as the Great Anniversary Festival.\n\nHe further suggested that it ought to be commemorated as the day of \ndeliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.\n\n  This is John Adams speaking. This is not some rustic boob like I was \nwhen I came to the House more than half a century ago. Listen to him \nagain:\n\n       It ought to be commemorated as the day of deliverance by \n     solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty.\n\n       It ought to be solemnized with pomp, shows, games, sports, \n     guns, bells, bonfires, illuminations, from one end of this \n     Continent to the other, from this time forward, forever.\n\n  How remarkably prescient. Adams was off on the date, as we celebrate \nthe approval of the Declaration of Independence rather than of the \nadoption of the motion, but he certainly knew how Americans like to \ncelebrate. As well, he accurately predicted the explosive growth of an \nembryonic nation into a continent-spanning colossus.\n  That vision took great courage, coming as it did on the eve of \nputting his signature to a document that could easily become his death \nwarrant. Every signer of that Declaration of Independence committed \ntreason against England, against the King of England, against the \ncrown. Every signer could have been arrested, put in chains and sent by \nboat to England; tried, convicted, and hanged. The delegates to the \nContinental Congress had, with this act, committed treason against the \ncrown and set their nascent nation-state on the road to war. After the \nfailed Jacobite uprising against England in 1745 under Bonnie Prince \nCharles, only 31 years before the delegate met in Philadelphia, the \nScottish leaders had been beheaded in public ceremonies.\n  One Delegate to the Congress, John Witherspoon, put it thus:\n\n       There is a tide in the affairs of men, a nick of time. We \n     perceive it now before us. To hesitate is to consent to our \n     own slavery. That noble instrument upon your table, that \n     insures immortality to its author, should be subscribed this \n     very morning by every pen in this house. He that will not \n     respond to its accents, and strain every nerve to carry into \n     effect its provisions, is unworthy of the name of free man. \n     For my own part, of property, I have some; of reputation, \n     more. That reputation is staked, that property is pledged on \n     the issue of this contest; and although these grey hairs must \n     soon descend into the sepulcher, I would infinitely rather \n     that they descend thither by the hand of the executioner than \n     desert at this crisis the sacred cause of my country.\n\n  What beautiful words. The signers knew full well what risks they were \nrunning.\n  The first anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of \nIndependence took place in a nation at war, with our battle fortunes at \nlow ebb. But Americans still celebrated in Philadelphia, U.S. ships of \nwar were decked in red, white, and blue. At 1 o'clock, each ship fired \na salvo of 13 cannons to honor the 13 States. Members of Congress dined \nin state with other civil and military dignitaries and made toasts to \nliberty and to fallen patriots. After dinner, the Members and officers \nof the Army reviewed the troops, followed by a ringing of bells and a \nshow of fireworks.\n  In 1788, Philadelphia was serving as the U.S. Capital. On that year, \nnot only was the Declaration of Independence celebrated, but also the \nU.S. Constitution, which had recently been ratified by 10 States. This \nJuly Fourth celebration included another new feature--a parade with \nhorse-drawn floats. One float, that of an enormous eagle, carried the \nJustices of the Supreme Court in lieu of today's beauty pageant queens.\n  In 1826, the Nation achieved a milestone when the 50th Independence \nDay celebration was being planned. The mayor of Washington wrote to \ninvite the surviving ex-Presidents and Signers of the Declaration to \nattend the festivities. The five men, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, \nJames Madison, James Monroe, and Charles Carroll,\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\nwere unable to attend. Why? Because of age or infirmity, or other \nreasons. Indeed, at 10 minutes before 1 o'clock on July 4, 1826, Thomas \nJefferson, principal drafter of the Declaration, passed away.\n  John Adams, too, breathed his last on the same day. In his 90s and \ngravely ill, he had determined to hold on until the 50th anniversary of \nindependence. That morning, he roused long enough to confirm to a \nservant that he knew that ``it is the glorious Fourth of July. God \nbless it. God bless you all,'' before fading into unconsciousness. \nRousing later that afternoon, he confided unknowingly as he passed on \nto that other shore that ``Thomas Jefferson still survives.'' He did \nnot know that Jefferson had died earlier that day.\n  James Monroe, who fought in the Revolutionary War and became the \nfifth President of the United States, also died on July 4, in 1831. \nJames Madison, the fourth President, died a week short of the 60th \nanniversary of Independence Day, on June 28, 1836.\n  The last living Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Charles \nCarroll, performed one of his last public acts on July 2, 1828. He \nparticipated in a ground breaking ceremony initiating construction of \nthe Baltimore and Ohio Railway, the first important railroad in the \nNation. He died in 1832, at the age of 95. Also in 1828, President John \nQuincy Adams led an unusual 4th of July parade, up the Potomac River \nand the old Washington Canal to the site where construction was to \nstart on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. These two acts underscore the \nvital link between the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution \nwhich followed it, and the vibrant economy which has made and kept the \nUnited States economy vibrant and strong for so many years.\n  Our Nation is a union of disparate States, each of which has \nconsiderable power within its boundaries. But across those boundaries, \nlinking the Union into a seamless web of bustling commerce and economic \nmight, is the national infrastructure. Just as the Constitution \nprovides for the common defense, so it promotes the common good by \nlinking markets and people across States. Over the Years, Federal \nsupport for great infrastructure projects, from the Chesapeake and Ohio \nCanal to the National Highway System, have woven the Nation into a \nunified economic structure. Federal support for rural electrification \nand rural telephone and Internet access have spread opportunity and \nprogress from border to border and coast to coast, just as John Adams \nforetold in 1776.\n  This 4th of July, as we all visit national parks, tour Federal \nmonuments, drive on interstate highways, call friends and family around \nthe country, and buy picnic goods grown all over the United States--as \nwe celebrate a national Federal holiday under the protective watch of \nthe U.S. military and Federal law enforcement agencies--we \nunconsciously enjoy the benefits of the Federal Government and of \nbelonging to a union that is the United States.\n  Each star on the flag, the flag beside the Presiding Officer's desk, \nwe salute so proudly represents a single state, but only when they are \naligned together in the constellation of 50 do we feel the strength and \nthe glory that were won for us, beginning on July 4, 1776. This \nIndependence Day, we would all do well to read and cherish the \nDeclaration of Independence. Even more, we would do well as a Nation to \nstudy and cherish our Constitution, by which our freedom, so dearly won \nand so costly held, lives on.\n  Too often in recent years and months have I seen unwise attempts to \nerode the checks and balances of the Constitution, unknowing or \nunthinking efforts to dissolve the institutions and practices \nestablished to make our Nation the free and representative government \nby our Founding Fathers. Attacks on the United States from without are \nmet with instant, unhesitating defense by all Americans, but we are not \nso knowledgeable vigilant against the insidious weakening from within, \neven within this Chamber. We are all of us, with our voices and our \nvotes, the last, best guardians of American freedom and independence. \nWe lack only the weapons of knowledge and awareness.\n  I close with a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, entitled ``O Ship \nof State.''\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel!\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     Fear not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'Tis of the wave and not the rock;\n     'Tis but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee.\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee--are all with thee!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish that I were able to express myself in \na manner that is worthy of my feelings about the Senator from West \nVirginia. I can't do that, but I can do the best I can.\n  There isn't a day that goes by that I don't recognize personally how \nfortunate I am to live in this country and to represent the sovereign \nState of Nevada and to be a Member of the Senate. It is a blessing that \nI have had, for whatever reasons. Whether I am worthy or not, that is \nfor someone else to determine. But one of the most important aspects of \nmy life has been my association, my friendship, my service with the \nSenator from West Virginia, a man who served in the Congress for more \nthan 50 years, who, like clockwork, comes to the Senate floor on \nspecial occasions like the Fourth of July or Thanksgiving, and makes us \nall feel better for having had the opportunity to listen to a speech by \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  As I look back over the time I spent here on the Senate floor, \nlistening to the Senator from West Virginia, I am drawn to a number of \nthings I will never forget. I remember the speeches--and I sat with \nevery one of them. I missed a couple of them, but I watched them in my \noffice--the speeches on the fall of the Roman Empire that were based on \nthe line-item veto. The Senator from West Virginia was indicating the \nline-item veto would be the beginning of the end of the Senate.\n  The Senator delivered those speeches without a note. I didn't realize \nat the time, but the Senator knew every word he intended to say. They \nwere not extemporaneous in the sense I would give an extemporaneous \nspeech. He knew before he gave the speech, beforehand, every word he \nwas going to deliver.\n  I was so impressed with that series of speeches that I sent them to \nthe head of the political science then at the University of Nevada at \nLas Vegas, Andrew Tuttle. Tuttle was so impressed--I sent him the \nspeeches so he could watch them--he started a course at UNLV based on \nthe lectures of Senator Byrd.\n  I am not going to go on, other than to say our country is so much \nbetter as a result of the service granted by the people of West \nVirginia to the Senator from West Virginia. People may not always agree \nwith the Senator from West Virginia, but no one can take away the fact \nhe is the epitome of the Senate. And when the history books are \nwritten--and they will be written--there will be a place where they \nwill list the great Senators of this body, and in the top two or three \nwill be the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, who is also the Democratic whip here in the \nSenate.\n  Tennyson in Ulysses says:\n\n       I am a part of all that I have met.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know how long the great God of the universe \nwill spare me. But however long it may be, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Reid, will always be a part of me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8710-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8710-S8711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING SENATOR STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute to say a few words \nin\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\nhonor of Strom Thurmond, our friend and former colleague, who passed \naway today.\n  From the moment Strom Thurmond set foot in this Chamber in 1954, he \nhas been setting records. He was the only person ever elected to the \nU.S. Senate on a write-in vote. He set the record for the longest \nspeech on the Senate floor, clocked at an astounding 24 hours and 18 \nminutes. He was the longest serving Senator in the history of the \nSenate. He was also the oldest serving Senator. Many of my colleagues \nwill recall the momentous occasion in September of 1998 when he cast \nhis 15,000th vote in the Senate. With these and so many other \naccomplishments over the years, he has appropriately been referred to \nas ``an institution within an institution.''\n  In 1902, the year Strom Thurmond was born, life expectancy was 51 \nyears--and today it is 77 years. Strom continued to prove that, by any \nmeasure, he was anything but average.\n  He saw so much in his life. To provide some context, let me point out \nthat during his lifetime, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and \nHawaii gained Statehood, and 11 amendments were added to the \nConstitution. The technological advancements he witnessed, from the \nautomobile to the airplane to the Internet, literally spanned a century \nof progress. Conveniences we have come to take for granted today were \nnot always part of Strom Thurmond's world. Perhaps this explains why, \nduring Judiciary Committee hearings, he was often heard asking \nwitnesses who were too far away from the microphone to ``please speak \ninto the machine.''\n  The story of his remarkable political career truly could fill several \nvolumes. It began with a win in 1928 for the Edgefield County \nSuperintendent of Schools. Eighteen years later, he was Governor of \nSouth Carolina. Strom was even a Presidential candidate in 1948, \nrunning on the ``Dixiecrat'' ticket against Democrat Harry Truman.\n  I must admit, he came a long way in his political career, given that \nhe originally came to the Senate as a Democrat. I was happy to say that \nwisdom came within a few short years when Strom saw the light and \njoined the Republican Party.\n  When I first arrived in the Senate in January of 1977, he was my \nmentor. As my senior on the Judiciary Committee, it was Strom Thurmond \nwho helped me find my way and learn how the committee functioned. He \nwas not only a respected colleague, but a personal friend.\n\n  During his tenure as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Strom \nThurmond left an indelible mark on the committee and the laws that came \nthrough it. He became known and respected for many fine qualities and \npositions--his devotion to the Constitution, his toughness on crime, \nhis sense of fairness.\n  He was famous for his incredible grip. Many of us in this Chamber had \nthe experience of Strom Thurmond holding our arm tightly as he explains \na viewpoint and asked for our support. I might add that this proved to \nbe a very effective approach.\n  Strom was also known to have a kind word or greeting for everyone who \ncame his way, and for being extremely good to his staff. Despite his \npower and influence, he never forgot the importance of small acts of \nkindness. For example, whenever he ate in the Senate dining room, he \ngrabed two fistfuls of candy. When he returned to the floor of the \nSenate, he handed the candy out to the Senate pages. Unfortunately, it \nwas usually melted into a keleidoscope of sugar by then. I have a \nfeeling that the pages preferred it when Strom took them out for ice \ncream.\n  Strom Thurmond was truly a legend--someone to whom the people of \nSouth Carolina owe an enormous debt of gratitude for all his years of \nservice.\n  Clearly, the people of South Carolina recognize the sacrifices he \nmade and are grateful for all he did for them. In fact, you cannot \nmention the name Strom Thurmond in South Carolina without the audience \nbursting into spontaneous applause. He truly was an American political \nicon.\n  Abraham Lincoln once said that ``The better part of one's life \nconsists of friendships.'' With a friend like Strom Thurmond, this \nsentiment could not be more true. I am a great admirer of Strom \nThurmond, and I am proud to have called him my friend.\n  One final note about Strom Thurmond. He was a great patriot. A \ndecorated veteran of World War II who fought at Normandy on D-day, \nStrom Thurmond loved this country. Let me close by saying that this \ncountry loved him, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8711-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A SALUTE TO PAUL GALIS\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, on June 12, 2003, I published a notice in \nthe Congressional Record of my intent to object to moving to H.R. 2350, \na bill to extend the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or \n``TANF,'' our Nation's welfare program. My good friend from Oregon, \nSenator Smith, joined in this effort because the legislation does not \ncontain a provision critical to Oregon's welfare program: a waiver of \ncertain provisions that gives Oregon flexibility to operate a \nsuccessful welfare program. Because of its waiver, which expires on \nJune 30, 2003, Oregon has reduced its welfare rolls nearly 60 percent \nsince 1994. It is clear that the waiver has allowed Oregon to meet \nlocal needs and craft what has been heralded as one of the best welfare \nprograms in the country.\n  Since Senator Smith and I announced our public holds, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and \nthe ranking member, Senator Baucus, have worked closely with us to find \na way so that Oregon can continue to operate under its waiver until \nTANF is fully reauthorized. They have helped obtain a letter from \nDepartment of Health & Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson to \nOregon Governor Ted Kulongoski, myself and Senator Smith assuring us \nthat Oregon can continue to operate without penalty under its waiver. I \nbelieve this letter provides Oregon the assurances necessary to \ncontinue to operate as if the waiver were still in place, and ask \nunanimous consent to insert the letter in the Record.\n  Mr. SMITH. I join Senator Wyden in expressing deep pride in Oregon's \nTANF program and in thanking the chairman and ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, on which I serve, for their cooperation. I share his \nassessment that this letter will enable Oregon to maintain its TANF \nprogram without penalty until the program is reauthorized.\n  I also express my appreciaiton to Senators Grassley and Baucus for \ntheir efforts on TANF reauthorization. We have been working together \nfor months to ensure that all TANF proposals, including those elements \nwhich have made Oregon's TANF program so successful, are carefully \nconsidered as we move toward TANF reauthorization.\n  Oregon's TANF program, often called the Oregon Option, works because \nit recognizes local barriers to work and works with individuals to \nasses their needs and get them onto a path toward independence. For \nexample, Oregon allows individuals with severe substance abuse problems \nto seek treatment. This helps people address the root of their \nproblems--not just the symptons. The\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nOregon Option has put people into real work situations--not just make \nwork--and this has helped Oregon move people off the welfare rolls and \ninto real, sustainable jobs. I believe the Senate can learn from the \nlessons of Oregon's program, and I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues to ensure that all state TANF programs have the flexibility \nthey need to operate successfully.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I understand the concerns of the \nSenators from Oregon, and look forward to working with them to \nreauthorize the TANF program in the coming months. I appreciate their \nconcern for the need for Oregon to retain flexibility in TANF. I hope \nthe Senator from Montana will agree that the Finance Committee, on both \nsides of the aisle, should discuss this issue as we move to reauthorize \nthe TANF program.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree with the chairman and look forward to moving on \nthese issues. My home State of Montana is currently operating under a \nwaiver that expires on December 31st of this year. I know that Montana, \nlike Oregon, has been able to craft a successful TANF program because \nof its waiver, and I look foward to working with my distinguished \ncolleagues to see that it is retained.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8712-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING SENATOR TED STEVENS, THE RECIPIENT OF THE ARLEIGH BURKE \n     AWARD FROM THE CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, our distinguished colleague, the Honorable \nTed Stevens, was presented with the Arleigh Burke Award on June 11, \n2003, by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The award, \nnamed after the famed Admiral, who was the longest serving Chief of \nNaval Operations, recognizes Senator Stevens's leadership in the fields \nof strategy, resources, and maritime affairs, as well as his hard work \nand selfless dedication to promote public service and the ideals of \nfreedom.\n  When Senator Stevens accepted the Burke Award, he delivered a \nthoughtful speech that underscored Admiral Burke's conviction that duty \nto country is more important than duty to the Commander-in-Chief, and \nthat we should oppose the concentration of power.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Stevens's speech be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSpeech by Senator Ted Stevens at the CSIS Arleigh Burke Memorial Dinner \n                  on June 11, 2003, in Washington, DC\n\n       Good evening. Thanks to my good friend and colleague \n     Senator Warner for that warm introduction.\n       My congratulations to General Keene, the Army's new Acting \n     Chief of Staff. I wish him success in the coming months.\n       It is a tremendous honor to receive an award named after \n     Admiral Burke. Like many of you, I am familiar with the \n     Admiral's distinguished life of dedication, service, and \n     achievement. When I served in China during World War II, he \n     was an admiral in the Navy, and the battles that made him one \n     of that war's greatest combat leaders were well-known.\n       I met Admiral Burke during the Eisenhower Administration. I \n     was working on statehood for Alaska and Hawaii in the \n     Department of Interior in those days. Admiral Burke was the \n     Chief of Naval Operations. Like everything he did, Admiral \n     Burke served as CNO with tremendous distinction. He was the \n     youngest and longest serving CNO in history, and during his \n     tenure he fought for technologies and strategies that \n     continue to form the foundation of our Armed Services.\n       To refresh my memory of Admiral Burke's accomplishments, I \n     went back to E.B. Potter's book about him.\n       Potter reported that in January of 1958, the year Alaska's \n     Statehood Bill was enacted, Burke opposed the Gaither Report, \n     which recommended streamlining and centralization of defense. \n     At the National Press Club he warned against control of all \n     U.S. forces by ``one man, a military Solomon.''\n       Notwithstanding that position of the CNO, in April 1958, \n     and I quote from Potter's book on Arleigh Burke:\n       ``. . . Eisenhower sent to Congress a special message on \n     reorganization of the Department of Defense. Its chief \n     recommendations were (1) to remove the Service Chiefs from \n     the operation chain of command; (2) to restrict Service \n     Secretaries to administration, relieving them of \n     responsibility for military operations; (3) to restrict \n     duties of Joint Chiefs of Staff mainly to advising the \n     Secretary of Defense; (4) to enlarge the Joint Staff; and (5) \n     to limit control of operating forces to the President and the \n     Secretary of Defense.''\n       Eisenhower sent word through Secretary of Defense McElroy \n     that he wanted all senior officers and officials to support \n     his plan.\n       Arleigh was called before the Senate Armed Services \n     Committee. As Potter stated, Admiral Burke ``put duty to \n     country over duty to the Commander-in-Chief,'' and opposed \n     this concentration of power in the Secretary of Defense.\n       The Defense Reorganization Act of 1958 did not rubber stamp \n     the Gaither Report. It followed many of Admiral Burke's \n     suggestions.\n       To his great credit, Ike appointed Admiral Burke to a third \n     term as CNO in August 1959.\n       It is my hope that in reviewing the current proposals from \n     D.O.D. before Congress, senior officers and officials of \n     D.O.D. and all members of Congress will follow the great \n     traditions Admiral Burke upheld.\n       Arliegh Burke lived his life by principles which guided him \n     through the perils of World War II and still pertain today.\n       He once described his philosophy as:\n       ``An old-time philosophy--a philosophy of realism. You must \n     always ask yourself the question, `What is important in life? \n     . . . I don't think it's very important to be remembered. . . \n     . The ideas I stood for should be remembered.''\n       Admiral Burke also demonstrated his loyalty to the men \n     under his command. The spirit of Admiral Burke's commitment \n     to his sailors is reflected in the steps the Congress has \n     taken to support our troops and honor our promises to our \n     veterans.\n       Admiral Burke was a hero and a visionary, and I can think \n     of no greater honor than to be your guest at this evening's \n     event. Thanks again for this award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8712-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in New \nBedford, MA. On June 22, 2003, Saurabh Bhalerao, a 24-year-old graduate \nstudent, was ambushed by four men and savagely beaten when the \nassailants mistook the student for a Muslim. Mr. Bhalerao, a Hindu \nIndian, works part-time as a pizza delivery man. One of the suspects \nplaced a phone order at the local pizzeria where Mr. Bhalerao is \nemployed. When Mr. Bhalerao arrived with the order, two men shoved him \ninto the apartment and pushed him to the floor. After Mr. Bahlerao was \nlying on the floor, the attackers kicked and beat him. At one point, \none suspect hit him with a kitchen chair. The perpetrators also burned \nMr. Bhalerao's body with lit cigarettes. According to court documents, \none of the attackers told Mr. Bhalerao to ``Go back to your own \ncountry.'' Mr. Bhalerao eventually escaped from the trunk of an \nassailant's car after he managed to loosen the fisherman's rope binding \nhis hands and feet. He is currently in the intensive care unit at a \nlocal hospital.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8712-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8712-S8713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF JOSHUA BOLTEN TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT \n                               AND BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of Joshua Bolten as \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, and to urge Mr. Bolten \nto do everything within his power to help put the Federal budget back \non sound footing.\n  The position of OMB Director is always one of the most demanding \nposts in our Government, but it is especially so right now. The tax \ncuts pushed through by the President over the last 2\\1/2\\ years, \ncombined with the continuing economic slowdown and increased spending \nto respond to the September 11 terrorist attacks and prosecute the \nmilitary efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq, have pushed the budget deep \ninto deficit. And despite the fact that we desperately need to get our \nfiscal house in order to be ready for the imminent retirement of the \nbaby-boom population, this administration and its allies in Congress \nhave not yet accepted that the policies they have advocated are leading \nus in the wrong direction.\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\n  I support the nomination of Joshua Bolten as OMB Director because I \nbelieve he is a very capable and honorable man, with a distinguished \nrecord both in public service--including service as a Senate staffer--\nand in the private sector. I sincerely hope he will take to heart the \nduty of the OMB Director to be an advocate for fiscal responsibility--\nto be willing to present the President with the facts where the budget \nis heading even if those facts are unpleasant, and to recommend \npolicies to the President that will put the budget back on a \nsustainable path even if those policies may be politically difficult.\n  In a written response to a question by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Mr. Bolten reiterated the position of the Bush \nadministration about the deficits facing us, stating that: ``Our \ncurrent deficit--as measured as a percentage of gross domestic product \n(GDP)--is not large by historical standards and is manageable within \nthe overall context of our economy.''\n  I hope when Mr. Bolten assumes his post as head of OMB, he recognizes \nthe reality of the budget situation and leads the administration to \nreassess that position. That reality is that the deficit we are \ncurrently facing is enormous by any standard. According to CBO, the \ntotal deficit will exceed $400 billion this year, more than $100 \nbillion higher than the all-time record deficit of $290 billion \nrecorded in 1992. As a percentage of GDP, the deficit will be about 4 \npercent, a level that has been reached only eight times in the 57 years \nsince the end of World War II. More troubling, when Social Security is \nexcluded from the calculation, this year's deficit is likely to total \nabout 5.5 percent--a level reached only twice in the last 57 years.\n  I hope Mr. Bolten accepts how serious the budget situation is and how \nimportant it is that we do not delay beginning to deal with the \nsituation. I hope that he will advise the President to work with the \nCongress in a truly bipartisan way to reach agreement on and enact \npolicies that will put the budget back on track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8713-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMBATING TORTURE AND ASSISTING VICTIMS OF TORTURE\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to address the barbaric practices \nthat constitute torture as we mark the United Nations Day in Support of \nthe Victims of Torture. Astonishingly, an estimated 500,000 victims of \ntorture live in the United States today, including many in my home \nState of Colorado. The United States has provided vital leadership in \nthe campaign to prevent torture around the world. The United States \nmust not equivocate on this most basic of human rights.\n  While the United States has consistently spoken out forcefully \nagainst the use of torture around the world, serious questions have \nbeen raised suggesting U.S. complicity in torture as part of the war \nagainst terrorism. This prompted me to join other members of the \nHelsinki Commission in writing to the White House recently urging an \ninvestigation of ``serious allegations that the United States is using \ntorture, both directly and indirectly, during interrogations of those \nsuspected of terrorism.'' Against this backdrop, I urge the \nadministration to issue a forthright statement on torture. In his State \nof the Union Address, President Bush described the horrific forms of \ntorture employed by the Hussein regime and concluded, ``If this is not \nevil, then evil has no meaning.'' Even as experts document the scope of \ntorture in Iraq, there must be no doubt concerning U.S. policy and \npractice.\n  As Cochairman of the Helsinki Commission, I am particularly concerned \nthat torture remains a tolerated if not promoted practice by come \ncountries, even within the membership of the 55-nation Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE.\n  In some places, like Uzbekistan, members of the political opposition \nor religious minorities are especially likely to be the victims of \ntorture. Tragically, two more people there have joined the long list of \nthose who have died in custody amid credible allegations of abuse and \ntorture, just weeks after the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment hosted a prestigious meeting in Tashkent, and days after \nthe Secretary of State determined Uzbekistan is eligible for continued \nU.S. assistance. Moreover, the shortsighted practice of making martyrs \nout of Islamic extremists may have exactly the opposite effect the \ngovernment claims to be seeking in its efforts to combat terrorism.\n  In Georgia, torture and abuse comes hand in hand with police \ncorruption. In the most recent State Department Country Report on human \nrights in Georgia, the Department stated: ``[s]ecurity forces continued \nto torture, beat, and otherwise abuse detainees. . . . NGOs also blamed \nseveral deaths in custody on physical abuse, torture, or inhumane and \nlife-threatening prison conditions.'' Even President Shevardnadze has, \nin the past, acknowledged the prevalence of abuse against detainees and \nprisoners. I welcome a new initiative of the OSCE Mission in Georgia to \ncombat torture, but I would also note that antitorture initiatives have \ncome and gone in Georgia with little to show for it. Without real \npolitical will, I am afraid this latest initiative may end up like the \nothers.\n  In Turkey--a country which has been given particular attention by the \nHelsinki Commission--even the doctors who treat the victims of torture \nhave become targets themselves. Their offices have been raided, records \nseized, and even some doctors have been arrested and tortured. \nMoreover, the patients of these doctors, all of whom have already \nsuffered at the hands of the authorities, have often been rearrested, \nretortured and recharged based on their testimonies given to the \nmedical authorities.\n  As a result of these practices, Turkey has been repeatedly sanctioned \nby the European Court of Human Rights. The Turkish nongovernmental \norganization, the Human Rights Foundation, appears to be making some \nheadway in defending these doctors. Last year, Turkey's Grand National \nAssembly has passed significant legislation with severe penalties for \nthose convicted of torture. A major effort still needs to be made to \nconform the application of the law in the regional courts of Turkey \nwith the intent of the parliamentarians. The Helsinki Commission will \ncontinue to monitor developments in Turkey and the implementation of \nthis law.\n  In the 1999 OSCE Istanbul Charter, the participating States committed \nthemselves to ``eradicating torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading \ntreatment or punishment throughout the OSCE area. To this end, we will \npromote legislation to provide procedural and substantive safeguards \nand remedies to combat these practices. We will assist victims and \ncooperate with relevant international organizations and nongovernmental \norganizations, as appropriate.''\n  Clearly a strategy to confront and combat torture must emphasize \nprevention of torture, prosecution of those who commit torture, and \nassistance for the victims of torture. As we mark the United Nations \nDay in Support of the Victims of Torture, I note the good work being \ndone by the Rocky Mountain Survivors Center, located in Denver. The \ncenter is part of a nationwide network committed to assisting the \nvictims of torture living in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8713-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8713-S8714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HONORING PRIVATE FIRST CLASS MICHAEL DEUEL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the passing of \nPrivate First Class Michael Deuel of Nemo, SD. Pfc. Deuel was killed on \nJune 18, 2003, while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Michael moved from his home in Cheyenne, WY to attend school at \nBoxelder Job Corps in South Dakota in May 2000. His friends and \nteachers described him as an unassuming, yet confident student. Focused \nand hard working, Michael was determined to perform well in school. He \nreceived his general education diploma and certification from the \nculinary arts program shortly before enlisting in the Army. Following \nservice in the military, he dreamed of becoming a chef and owning his \nown restaurant.\n  After enlisting in the Army, Michael entered airborne school to \nbecome an Airborne Ranger. He went on to Army Ranger School and became \na member of the Army's 325th infantry regiment of the 82nd Airborne \nDivision, which is based in Fort Bragg, NC.\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\n  On February 13, 2003, he was deployed to Iraq. While protecting a \npropane-distribution center in Baghdad, he was killed by enemy fire.\n  The lives of countless people were enormously enhanced by Michael's \ngoodwill and service. Although he did not live to see his dreams \nrealized, he continued to inspire all those who knew him. Our Nation \nand South Dakota are far better places because of his life, and the \nbest way to honor his life is to emulate his commitment to our country.\n  I join with all South Dakotans in expressing my sympathies to the \nfamily of Private First Class Deuel.

Mr. President, I rise today with great concern. As you are \naware, President Bush named June National Homeownership Month 2003. I \nam proud that our President has seen fit to promote an aggressive \nhomeownership campaign, and I support this administration's efforts to \nsee more Americans reach the American Dream of homeownership. As a \nmember of the Finance Committee, I have had the opportunity to learn of \nimportant ways that we can make that a reality. In January I introduced \nthe New Homestead Economic Opportunity Act, better known as the \nHomeownership Tax Credit. This legislation will create a single-family \nhousing tax credit for developers who build in low income areas, and \nallow more Americans to reach their dreams of homeownership. It will \nalso encourage developers of single family units to invest in low \nincome areas and improve our communities.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development has stated that one \nof its goals is to allow every citizen--regardless of race, creed, \ncolor, or place of birth--the opportunity to own their own home. To \nreach this goal, there must be affordable homes to purchase.\n  In his testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Arrairs earlier this month, James Rayburn, the Vice President of \nthe National Association of Home Builders stated that the Homeownership \nTax Credit proposal seeks to close the gap in homeownership rates among \nAmericans. While 82 percent of households earning 100 percent or more \nof the national median income now own homes, only 53 percent of \nhouseholds earning less than the national median are homeowners. The \nhomeownership rate for families earning 80 percent or less of the \nnational median is only 40 percent to 45 percent. Homeownership for \nwhites is 75 percent, while the ownership rate for African Americans is \njust below 48 percent and 48 percent for Hispanics.\n  We can all agree that the quality of life in distressed neighborhoods \ncan be improved dramatically by increasing home ownership. Existing \nbuildings in these neighborhoods often need extensive renovation before \nthey can provide decent owner-occupied housing. It is also difficult \nfor renovations to occur because the costs involved exceed the prices \nat which the housing units could be sold.

Mr. President, recently, I visited with Reverend Jacob \nBazzel Mull and his wife, Elizabeth, in Knoxville, TN. They host the \nMull Singing Convention, a popular gospel radio program.\n  Reverend Mull is a legend with an interesting story to tell. He was \nborn in 1914 in Burke County, NC, into a musical family. When he was 11 \nmonths old, he lost his eyesight after falling into an open-pit \nfireplace. As a child, he played in a gospel group made up of his \nmother, father, brothers and sisters.\n  He began preaching in 1939 and hasn't stopped since. In 1942, he \nmoved to Knoxville to start his first radio program, and the rest is \nhistory. He became well-known nationwide during the 25 years he sold \nChuck Wagon Gang Records on several 50,000-watt radio stations.\n  This year, all of his many accomplishments were recognized when he \nwas honored by the Gospel Music Association for his ``outstanding \ncontributions to gospel music.''\n  During our visit in April, Reverend Mull gave me 2,000 letters and a \nnumber of petitions with thousands of names on them from Americans \nangry over the Ninth Circuit's decision declaring the Pledge of \nAllegiance unconstitutional. Reverend Mull solicited these letters from \nhis listeners across the country, and I was delighted to see the \npassion people across America have for the Pledge. It made me proud to \nanswer all of those letters.\n  It is inspiring to me that every day Reverend Mull brings out the \nbest in America. He challenges us to think, and he encourages us to be \ninvolved in issues. He also reminds us to turn to our religious faith \nfor guidance. I ran for the U.S. Senate because I wanted to find out \nhow to bring out the best in people in Tennessee and across this \ncountry, all day, every day.\n  I believe the answer to how we do that lies with the people. In \nAugust of 2002, I spent the night with Jim Coley, a Tennessee \nGovernment high school teacher, and his family. One idea that came out \nof that visit was the importance of putting the teaching of American \nhistory and civics back into our classrooms. From that discussion, we \ncame up with the framework for the American History and Civics Act of \n2003 that just passed the Senate.\n  The bill establishes summer residential academies for teachers and \nstudents to encourage the teaching and learning of American history and \ncivics in a more inspired way than is happening today. We can't expect \nour students to learn what it means to be an American if we don't teach \nthem.\n  I would also like to see students in every classroom across this \nNation beginning each schoolday with the Pledge of Allegiance. That \ncould be followed with a student or teacher explaining in his or her \nown words what it means to them to be an American.\n  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, we saw how quickly \nwe Americans could come together as one people, united in purpose, \ndespite our\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\ndiverse backgrounds. Although we are almost 2 years removed from that \ntime, there is no reason this sense of unity and purpose cannot \ncontinue as part of our lives every day. Americans have a reputation \nfor being resourceful, resilient, and having common sense. These are \ngood qualities for helping to bring out the best in the entire Nation.\n  I thank Reverend Mull for his commitment to this country, for \ninviting me to visit with him, and for sharing American's outpouring of \nsupport in favor of the basic values and principles on which this \nNation was founded. I also appreciate the opportunity to bring Reverend \nMull's good work to the attention of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8715-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WELCOME BACK TO ALASKA, MR. CONSUL GENERAL\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, next week the people of Alaska will \nwelcome Mr. Yossi Amrani, the Consul General of the State of Israel for \nthe Pacific Northwest, back to our State. He will begin his trip in \nFairbanks, meeting with students and members of the community at the \nUniversity of Alaska, visiting with members of Congregation Or \nHatzafon, which has the northernmost synagogue building in the world, \nand speaking to the Greater Fairbanks Chamber of Commerce. He will also \nvisit Anchorage on this trip and I look forward to meeting with him \nthen.\n  This is not Mr. Amrani's first visit to my State, but it is his first \nvisit to Fairbanks, the ``Golden Heart City.'' Although the Fairbanks \nJewish community is small in numbers, the fundamental Jewish values of \ntikkun olam, making the world a better place; tzedakah, charity; and \nchesed, kindness, are deeply ingrained in the Fairbanks culture, as \nthey are in the culture of Alaska as a whole.\n  Like the Fairbanks Jewish community, the Alaska Jewish community is \nsmall in numbers, but large in spirit. In the late 1990s, Professor \nBernard Reisman from Brandeis University visited Alaska on several \noccasions to learn more about our Jewish community. He concluded that \nin virtually all areas, the Alaska Jewish community has a higher level \nof identity than do American Jews generally. He found this to be true \nnot only in places like Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau, which have \nfunctioning congregations, but also in the smaller communities, where \n``conveners'' organize regular get togethers, especially on Jewish \nholidays.\n  Members of the Jewish community occupy a prominent role in the \nsocial, economic, cultural and political life of Alaska. A few weeks \nago, I welcomed the internationally known holocaust scholar, Dr. \nMichael Schuldiner of the University of Alaska Fairbanks, to my office \nin Washington. Dr. Schuldiner discussed his work with the United States \nHolocaust Memorial. Another UAF scholar, Dr. Michael Krauss, has worked \nclosely with the Alaska congressional delegation for many years in \nefforts to preserve Alaska Native languages. And let us not forget the \nmany contributions of the Gottstein family to virtually every aspect of \nAlaska's fabric.\n  This is not a new phenomenon. The beautiful municipal library in \nAnchorage is named for Zachary J. Loussac, a Russian Jewish immigrant, \nwho served as Mayor of Anchorage. The Girl Scout camp in Fairbanks is \nnamed for Jessie Bloom, who along with her husband Robert, are regarded \nas the founding leaders of the Fairbanks Jewish community. In 1926, \nJessie started the first Girl Scout troop in Alaska, while Robert was a \nfounder of what was later to become the University of Alaska. Our \nstriking new courthouse in Fairbanks is named for Jay Rabinowitz who \nserved for many years on the Alaska Supreme Court.\n  The survival of the State of Israel is important to the people of \nAlaska as it is to the American Jewish community and the American \npeople. In Washington, I stand shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues \nin praying for peace in the Middle East while standing firm on the \nprinciple that terrorism is morally and politically unacceptable. \nTerrorism will not undo Israel's future. When the Senate returns in \nJuly, it will consider comprehensive energy legislation and I am \nhopeful that my amendment to guarantee that Israel will have a secure \nsource of petroleum in the event it cannot independently acquire it due \nto an embargo will be in the bill when it passes the Senate.\n  During this visit to Alaska, as on previous visits, the Consul \nGeneral will encounter the vast natural beauty of our state. But he \nwill also discover, as in previous visits, that it is the people of \nAlaska that make this place truly special. Shalom, Mr. Consul General. \nI hope that you will visit with Alaskans often.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the message of Consul \nGeneral Yossi Amrani be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Message of Consul General Yossi Amrani to the People of Alaska\n\n       The friendship and alliance between the United States and \n     Israel have many varied faces, moral, political, economic and \n     strategic. The partnership is on the federal and state level \n     alike. Israeli consulates in the country, local Jewish \n     communities together with state level administrations aim at \n     fostering and nurturing the relationship for the benefit of \n     both countries. In the state of Alaska, thousands of miles \n     apart, the Consulate General of Israel to the Pacific \n     Northwest Region works with state leaders and the Jewish \n     community to bring the two nations together in sharing the \n     values, ideals and concerns of both people. The Consulate \n     provides seminars and speaking engagements in different \n     campuses, churches and temples to educate public opinion on \n     the complexity of the situation in the Middle East and the \n     importance of the U.S. role in that region. The Consulate \n     also promotes Israeli culture and business opportunities. \n     Mutual values are the corner stones of the relationship and \n     affinity between the people of Alaska and Israel. As we \n     maintain U.S. support for Israel's existence and well being, \n     we aspire to continue building stronger relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8715-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8715-S8716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE LATE DAVID BRINKLEY\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I am honored today to talk about a pioneer \nfor North Carolina in the field of journalism . . . the late David \nBrinkley. David died on June 12, at the age of 82, from complications \nresulting from a fall. He was laid to rest in his beloved home, \nWilmington, North Carolina . . . beside his father--William Graham \nBrinkley and mother--Mary MacDonald West Brinkley.\n  David was born in Wilmington . . . He attended high school at New \nHanover High School. While there . . . and after several long hours \npouring over books in the Wilmington Library . . . David got an itch \nfor journalism.\n  He didn't wait. He took a part-time job while still in high school, \nworking for the Wilmington Morning Star and its afternoon edition, the \nWilmington News. He said he made about $11 a week.\n  But the young boy, who once made extra money by changing light bulbs \nand running a soft-drink stand at Wrightsville Beach's Lumina \nPavillion, went on to become an icon for millions of viewers who \nwatched him each night. He and co-anchor Chet Huntley had the highest \nrated news program on American television during the 1960's with ``The \nHuntley-Brinkley Report.'' Many of us still remember their familiar \nsign-off of ``Good night, Chet,'' ``Good night, David.''\n  David went on to host ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' until he \nretired in 1996.\n  Mr. President, at a time when we often get news that is too short, \ntoo sensationalized and sometimes too slanted, David Brinkley was the \nconsummate newsman. He knew the issues, and his intelligence, quick wit \nand thirst for answers kept us all glued to the television.\n  I had the pleasure of personally knowing David Brinkley, and in \naddition to sharing a distinctive Southern twang, we shared a fondness \nfor our home state. David wrote about Wilmington in his 1995 memoirs \nand even with all this success, all his fame, David and his wife, \nSusan, returned to his home in North Carolina often and supported his \nhometown. He was an ardent supporter of downtown Wilmington \npreservation. The University of North Carolina at Wilmington presented \nhim with an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1974. He was added to \nWilmington's Walk of Fame in 2001.\n  As much as David loved North Carolina--North Carolina loved him, too.\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nHis life has been a model for so many North Carolinians--the local boy \ndoing good . . . remembering his roots.\n  We will forever be indebted to David Brinkley for solid Washington \nreporting and his wry sense of humor. The Senate passed a resolution, \nwhich I co-sponsored, honoring the life and accomplishments of David \nBrinkley. May his legacy live on and inspire those who follow in his \nfootsteps.\n  In an interview 11 years ago, David said this of his profession, \n``People go and find out what is happening, and then tell what they \nhave seen. That's all a reporter ever did. I think it's a very \nhonorable thing to do.''\n  Indeed, it is, David, indeed, it is.\n  Mr. President, I send out my heartfelt condolences--and those of all \nNorth Carolinians--to Susan and to David Brinkley's family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8716-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           WIND RIVER INDIAN RESERVATION'S 140TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 140th \nAnniversary of the Wind River Reservation.\n  On July 2, 1863, the U.S. Government and the Shoshone people signed \nthe Fort Bridger Treaty, creating the Shoshone Reservation, which \nincluded over 44 million acres in what is now Colorado, Utah, Idaho, \nand Wyoming. This area was reduced to roughly 3 million acres by the \nsecond Fort Bridger Treaty of July 3, 1868, and was later renamed the \nWind River Reservation during the 1930s. Today, the reservation is \nroughly more than 2 million acres, one of the largest in the country, \nand is located in central Wyoming's beautiful Wind River Basin. It \nremains the contemporary home of the Eastern Shoshone and Northern \nArapaho tribes.\n  Chief Washakie, a distinguished statesman of the Shoshone people, was \none of the few Indian leaders to successfully negotiate with the U.S. \nGovernment in determining the reservation's location. For centuries, \nAmerican Indians who traveled through this area referred to it the Warm \nValley of the Wind River because of surrounding hot springs. Renowned \nfor his courage on the battlefield, and talent in diplomacy, the people \nof Wyoming selected Chief Washakie to represent our State, in the U.S. \nCapitol Building, as one of our two contributions to Statuary Hall.\n  The northern band of Arapahos began to make the Wind River \nReservation a more permanent home during the last 1870s, though they \nwere not signatories to either of the Fort Bridger Treaties. Under the \nleadership of men such as Black Coal, Sharp Nose, Little Wolf and White \nHorse, the Northern Arapahos settled in Wyoming, while the southern \nband of Arapahos was moved to a reservation in western Oklahoma. Wind \nRiver country encompasses mountains, streams, lakes and forests, and \nwas favored by the Northern Arapaho over the hot and arid Oklahoma \nlandscape.\n  The Wind River Indian Reservation is one of Wyoming's great \nhistorical, cultural, and natural treasures. A grave site for \nSacajawea, the young Shoshone woman who helped guide the Lewis and \nClark expedition through Shoshone lands in the early 1800s, can be \nvisited on the reservation. Both tribes continue to host several \npowwows during the spring and summer months that draw visitors and \nmembers of tribes from across the country. Later this week, the Eastern \nShoshone will be celebrating the Treaty Days Powwow.\n  As we look back on the past 140 years, I would like to pay tribute to \nthe important contribution American Indians have made to our history \nand our culture. Throughout my time in Congress, I have had the \npleasure to work with tribal leaders from both tribes on the Wind River \nReservation. I would like to thank Vernon Hill, chairman of the Eastern \nShoshone Business Council and Burton Hutchinson, Sr., chairman of the \nNorthern Arapaho Business Council, for their leadership as we work to \nensure the prosperity of the Wind River Reservation for future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8716-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A GREAT MONTANAN--ANTHONY J. PREITE\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in celebration of a \ngreat Montanan and American, Anthony J. Preite.\n  Today, Mr. Preite, the director of the Denver Regional Office of the \nU.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration is \nretiring. I have known Tony Preite for about 30 years. He was raised on \nMontana's ``High Line'' in Havre, MT. After a short time as a high \nschool teacher and coach, he was lured by the Bear Paw Development \nCorporation, an EDA designated economic development district, to come \nto work for them in 1968. A year later, he became the executive \ndirector of that fledgling organization and thus began a career in \neconomic development that is virtually unparalleled today. Under Tony's \nleadership, Bear Paw Development Corporation quickly developed a \nreputation as one of this Nation's premiere economic development \norganizations. Tony spearheaded literally hundreds of economic and \ncommunity development projects and programs in that part of northern \nMontana. These projects resulted in hundreds of jobs, scores of \ninfrastructure improvements, and other activities that have improved \nthe lives of people in that area. Among his other accomplishments at \nBear Paw, he was a founding member of the Montana Economic Developer's \nAssociation, served on the Montana Private Industry Council, and was \nchairman of the Governor's Economic Development Council.\n  Tony's work at Bear Paw Development Corporation was so successful \nthat I felt the need to bring the benefit of his expertise and \nenthusiasm to more Montanans. That is why, in 1993, I recommended his \nappointment by President Clinton as State Director of the Montana \nFarmers Home administration. Through a reorganization at the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, Tony led a successful transformation of the \nFarmers Home Administration Agency to the current Rural Development \nagency. While at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Tony served on \nmany national committees within the rural Development Agency, helping \nto guide the agency during its formative years. The success of the \nRural Development Agency and the value of its programs today are \nlargely due to the efforts that Tony made during his tenure there.\n  In December 1999, Tony accepted the position as Regional Director for \nthe economic Development Administration. In this position, Tony has \ncontinued to impart his expertise and enthusiasm to a 10 State region. \nIn his professional life, Tony has received accolades and awards too \nnumerous to mention here. Instead, let me say that I have not met \nanyone as dedicated to public service as Tony Preite. Tony does not \nleave his work at the office. He lives and breathes ``public service'' \nevery day, all day. It's immediately apparent to anyone who meets him \nthat he always cares about the people he serves. His works has made an \nenormous difference for Montana and for all of us who work and play \nthere.\n  While Tony's retirement is a sad occasion to all of us who work with \nhim, it is well deserved. I can take comfort that he will be returning \nto Montana and that he will find some other way to continue to serve \nhis State. I wish Tony and his wife Betty all the best and I thank him \nfor more than 35 years of public service. Good luck, Tony, and welcome \nback to Montana!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8716-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8716-S8717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AL BRAIMAN: DEPAUL UNIVERSITY CLASS OF 2003\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Al Braiman, \ngraduate of DePaul University's Class of 2003. Al was the oldest \ngraduate of DePaul's Class of 2003 when he graduated on June 14. Al \ncompleted a degree in liberal arts at DePaul's College of New Learning \nwith a grade point average of 3.92 out of a possible 4.0.\n  Born in Kiev, Russia, in 1920, Al immigrated to the United States at \nthe age of one. His family took up residency in Chicago, where he lived \nmost of his life. After high school, Al turned down an academic \nscholarship for college to support his family. Al joined the Army and \nserved with distinction in World War II, spending most of his time on \nGuadalcanal.\n  After leaving the Army, Al owned and operated Lakeview Grocerland \nuntil the mid 1960s when he became an insurance salesman with Equitable \nLife\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\nInsurance Company. He became a certified life underwriter and chartered \nfinancial consultant. Al won many awards in the industry, including \ninduction into the Equitable Hall of Fame.\n  After retiring in 1985, Al decided to earn a college degree, \nsomething he promised his mother earlier in his life. Al's interest in \npolitics led him to take many political science and history courses at \nDePaul University. Some of his favorites included a class on American \npresidents and a course on race relations. He also enjoyed learning \nmany new things such as use of the Internet, photography, and art. Al \nhas proven that it is never too late to learn and we could all learn a \ngreat deal from his perseverance.\n  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating Al Braiman, \nDePaul Class of 2003.

Mr. President, every session in Congress we \nspend a large amount of time discussing education in this country. \nDebates range from accountability to school construction to teacher \nrecruitment. While our discussions are of the utmost importance, it is \nthe implementation of our decisions by the individuals within the \neducation system that changes how our children learn. Today I rise to \nhonor a man who had dedicated his life to improving education for \nchildren in Louisiana, Dr. Gerald Wayne Cobb.\n  In 1960, Dr. Cobb received his bachelor's degree in health and \nphysical education from Louisiana Tech University. Since that time he \nhas been a crucial part of school improvements within the Lincoln \nParish School System. Dr. Cobb has served as principal of Hillcrest \nElementary School, Simsboro High School, and Ruston High School. He has \nworked as visiting associate professor at Louisiana State University \nand Louisiana Tech University.\n  Dr. Cobb has also served in the Louisiana Department of Education, \nworking as the director of secondary education, the executive director \nof academic programs, and the executive assistant to the \nsuperintendent. While with the Louisiana Department of Education, Dr. \nCobb was instrumental in developing the Compensatory Education Program \nin Louisiana which provided remediation for students not meeting the \npassing scores on the State's Basic Skills Testing Program. Dr. Cobb \nalso revised Bulletin 741, which is the Louisiana Handbook for School \nAdministration and served as the basis for the State's accreditation \nprogram. Dr. Cobb worked to increase in-service training for principals \nby coauthoring the Louisiana Academy for School Administrators Program \nand representing Louisiana at the Leadership Training for Principals.\n  After working with the Department of Education and serving as \nprincipal for schools throughout Lincoln Parish, Dr. Cobb continued his \npublic service in the area of education by serving as superintendent \nfor the Lincoln Parish School System. For the past 15 years, Dr. Cobb \nhas immensely helped the 14 schools and 6,865 students in the Lincoln \nParish School System. During his tenure, Dr. Cobb helped to construct \nthe Lincoln Parish Secondary Alternative School at no cost to local \ntaxpayers. He saw the students in Lincoln Parish receive the highest \nACT scores throughout the State in 1996. In 2000, Ruston High School \ngraduated seven National Merit Finalists, the most of any public, \nnonmagnet high school in the State. Dr. Cobb helped to expand the \npreschool program, implement the Even Start Program, construct a \nParental Involvement Center, initiate the Career Options Program, wire \nall schools with the Internet, and implement 4x4 block scheduling in \nhigh schools.\n  The gifts that Dr. Cobb has given the Lincoln Parish School System \nand all of Louisiana go far beyond those that I have named above.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my good \nfriend, Louis Carney and his wife LuJuanna. Just last week, the \nCarneys, who live near my family's home in Idaho Falls, celebrated \ntheir 50th wedding anniversary. I am honored to know them and pleased \nthat I was asked to join the celebration.\n  I can think of no better way to commemorate their 50 years together \nthan to mention that they are the proud parents of eight children, six \nwho are still with us--Don, Nancy, Bob, Terry, Kevin, and Kenneth; and \ntwo who have rejoined their Heavenly Father--Laurie Ann and Jean Marie; \nthe even prouder grandparents of fifteen; and the great grandparents of \none. It speaks very highly of their commitment to each other and their \nfamily that so many of their family members were on hand to mark the \noccasion. Louis has been a very good friend to me over the years, and I \nappreciate his wisdom and guidance on many matters. He has been a \nstrong supporter of the Boy Scouts of America program, and I share his \nenthusiasm for this program which can be so important in helping young \nmen to learn new skills and achieve goals.\n  Louis and LuJuanna have been important members of our community. They \nare always available for those who are in need. They radiate happiness \nand contentment, and can be counted on by not only their friends, but \nso many others. I am proud to mark their anniversary, and even more \npleased to call them friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8717-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8717-S8718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GARY R.

Mr. President, earlier this week, more than 35 \ndedicated cyclists with People Pedaling Peace made the 200-mile trip \nfrom Hampton, VA, to Washington, DC, to honor and remember victims of \ngun violence. In partnership with the Alliance for Justice, the People \nPedaling Peace cyclists rode not only in honor of the victims of gun \nviolence, but for stronger, more sensible gun safety laws in America \nand to raise awareness of violence against children in this country.\n  Pedaling for Peace was started in 2001 by Sandra and Mike McSweeney \nwhose daughter, Stephanie, was killed while walking out of a roller \nrink in Hampton, VA. Mr. and Mrs. McSweeny, as well as several other \nindividuals affected by gun violence and violence against children made \nthe journey this year. Others who made the trip include Craig Scott, \nwhose sister Rachel is a Columbine survivor; Amber Hensley, a student \nat Thurston High School in Eugene, OR, who witnessed the shootings; and \nLorraine Reed, mother of two daughters, one of whom was murdered and \none of whom was seriously assaulted. Unfortunately, the total number of \npeople like them who have lost family and friends to gun violence \ncontinues to grow.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \ntotal number of gun deaths in the United States has been dropping since \n1993, when it peaked at nearly 40,000, to around 28,000 annually 1999 \nthrough 2001. However, guns still kill more young people in America \nthan the most common diseases of our time. Thousands more children are \ninjured, lose a loved one, or live in fear of gun violence.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in commending all of the cyclists \nwho pedaled for peace, and join me in supporting sensible gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8718-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DELBERT L. LATTA POST OFFICE BUILDING\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of a bill \nconsidered by the Senate, H.R. 985, to designate a post office in \nBowling Green, OH, as the Delbert L. Latta Post Office Building. I \nstrongly support this bill honoring a long-time member of the Ohio \ncongressional delegation. Naming this post office after Del Latta is a \nfitting way to honor him. The building that houses this post office \nalso served as a district office for Mr. Latta during his 30 years of \nservice in Congress.\n  Delbert Latta is a native and lifelong resident of Ohio. Born in the \nsmall northwestern town of Weston, OH, Mr. Latta attended Findlay \nCollege and Ohio Northern University Law School.\n  Mr. Latta began his service to our Nation as a member of the Ohio \nNational Guard. During World War II, Mr. Latta served with the U.S. \nMarine Corps Reserves.\n  After his military service, Mr. Latta practiced law in Bowling Green, \nbut in 1953, he again answered the call to public service by running \nfor the State legislature. Mr. Latta was elected to the Ohio State \nSenate. After serving three terms, Mr. Latta was elected by the people \nof Ohio's fifth congressional district to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. During his long and distinguished career in Congress, \nMr. Latta fought hard against wasteful government spending and to \nbalance the Federal budget, a passion that I share.\n  During his 30 years in Congress, Mr. Latta earned prominent committee \nassignments in the House, including serving as the ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, and as a member of the powerful Rules Committee, \nand the Agriculture Committee.\n  Naming this post office the Delbert L. Latta Post Office Building is \na wonderful tribute to a man who served Ohio and our Nation with \ndistinction throughout his life.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration of this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8718-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR G. STEPHENSON\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding accomplishments and distinguished career of Mr. Arthur G. \nStephenson upon his retirement as the Director of the NASA Marshall \nSpace Flight Center. It has been a privilege for me to get to know Art. \nWhile retirement announcements are things that we do not like to hear \nwhen it involves someone who has been as vital to the success of an \norganization as Art has been to Marshall's, I would like to say how \nmuch I have enjoyed working with Art and his staff during his tenure as \nthe Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center.\n  As the Director of one of NASA's largest field installations, with \nmore than 6,500 civil service and contract employees and an annual \nbudget in excess of $2 billion, Art successfully managed a very broad \nrange of activities for the U.S. space program. Some of these critical \nNASA initiatives included development of new reusable launch vehicles, \nspace shuttle propulsion, advanced space transportation systems, second \nand third generation propulsion technology development programs, \nresearch in microgravity, and science payload operations aboard the \nInternational Space Station. He also oversaw the establishment of the \nNational Space Science Technology Center, a partnership with \nuniversities and Federal agencies to conduct cutting-edge research. Art \nalso oversaw the planning and establishment of the Propulsion Research \nLaboratory, a world-class laboratory for research into future space \ntransportation and propulsion technology. Art has led the Marshall \nCenter in numerous successful space shuttle launches in which Marshall \nwas responsible for all propulsion elements. Under Art's direction, the \nMarshall Center has completed testing of the truss and pressurized \nmodules for the International Space Station, and provided support for \nthe construction and operation of the International Space Station, \nincluding Marshall's Payload Operations Center which controls all the \nscience experiments aboard the space station.\n  Art brought more than 35 years of experience in the space industry to \nNASA and used it to the great benefit of the Marshall Center and the \nU.S. space program. I could list many additional achievements and \nprofessional accomplishments, and I believe that success is directly \nattributable to Art's record as an extraordinary leader throughout his \ncareer.\n  Art has been an important and respected member of the Huntsville \ncommunity. I know that I speak for many people in Huntsville and \neveryone in the NASA family when I say that we all thank Art for his \ntireless commitment to NASA and to Marshall. We sincerely hope that he \nand his family will remain part of the Huntsville community for many \nyears to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8718-5", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8718-S8719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARTHUR LEVITT, JR.\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, earlier this month the Franklin \nD. Roosevelt Distinguished Public Service Award was presented to Arthur \nLevitt, Jr., the widely respected former chairman of the Securities and \nExchange Commission. The award is made annually by the Franklin D. and \nEleanor Roosevelt Institute, on whose board I am privileged to serve.\n  The speaker at the presentation was Conrad Black, now Lord Black, \nchairman of the Telegraph Group, Limited. Lord Black is active in \nnumerous nonprofit boards, foundations and councils.\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\n  In his remarks Lord Black spoke vividly and in detail about \nDepression-era America, and the ``bold experimentation,'' as he put it, \nof the New Deal years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Lord Black's remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nAddress of Lord Black at Franklin Delano Roosevelt Distinguished Public \n                          Service Award Dinner\n\n       On election night, 1932, unemployment stood at \n     approximately 30%. There was minimal direct government relief \n     for the 14 million or so unemployed. Their condition was \n     alleviated by private sector charity, and by theft and \n     begging.\n       The Soviet Union advertised in the United States for 6,000 \n     skilled workers to go to Russia in 1932 for a period of \n     several years; it's New York office was swamped with 100,000 \n     applications. The natives of West Africa sent New York City \n     $3.77 to help with relief for the poor. When the city of \n     Birmingham, Alabama, advertised for 750 ditch-diggers to work \n     ten-hour days for $2 per day, 12,000 applications arrived in \n     two days.\n       In the coal-mining regions of Kentucky and West Virginia, \n     over 90% of children were suffering from malnutrition. The \n     country had suffered a general deflation of more than 20%. \n     Millions of Americans faced the distinct possibility of death \n     by starvation or exposure to the elements. Large numbers of \n     people lived from the scraps and leftovers thrown out in the \n     garbage by restaurants and hotels.\n       The volume of cheque transactions and of stock market \n     transactions in the United States had declined by 60% since \n     1929. The amount of new capital financing had declined by \n     over 95% since 1929. The volume of new building contracts had \n     declined by 75%. By inauguration day in March 1933, the Dow-\n     Jones Industrial Average was down by 90% from its high in \n     September, 1929.\n\n\n                             bank failures\n\n       There had been 5,000 bank failures in three years, wiping \n     out nine million individual bank accounts. Steel production \n     was under 20% of capacity, and United States Steel \n     Corporation, which had had 225,000 full-time employees in \n     1929, now had no full-time employees, apart from those in the \n     executive offices.\n       Total non-agricultural production was less than half of its \n     1929 level. Manufacturing income has shrunk by 65%. \n     Agricultural production, while approximately equal in \n     physical volume to that of 1929, had shrunk in farm income \n     from $12 billion to slightly over $5 billion.\n       About 45% of the residential homes in America had been or \n     were in danger of being foreclosed by mortgage-holders. \n     Through the first six months of 1933, 250,000 homes were \n     foreclosed, well over a thousand per day, the families \n     pitched out into the streets. The money supply, deflation-\n     adjusted, had declined by 25% in four years.\n       Many local and state governments, including Chicago and \n     Georgia, could not pay their schoolteachers. Georgia closed \n     over a thousand schools attended by 170,000 students. Most \n     rural Alabama white schools were closed through the early \n     months of 1933.\n       On the day before inauguration day, 32 states had closed \n     all their banks indefinitely. Six other states had closed \n     almost all their banks. In the other ten states and in the \n     District of Columbia, withdrawals were limited to 5% of \n     deposits and in Texas to $10 per day. The U.S. financial \n     system had reached the last extremity before it would \n     collapse completely, taking the life's savings of tens of \n     millions of people and what was left of the international \n     economic system with it.\n       American literature achieved a virtual golden age with \n     writers such as John Steinbeck, Erskine Caldwell, Edmund \n     Wilson, and John Dos Passos describing depression conditions.\n\n\n            Franklin D. Roosevelt's First Inaugural Address\n\n       Over 400,000 people came out to hear Franklin D. \n     Roosevelt's famous first inaugural address; they covered 40 \n     acres of lawns adjacent to the Capitol. For the first time \n     since the Civil War, soldiers in full combat gear and machine \n     gun emplacements surrounded by sand-bags were visibly \n     guarding the main public buildings of Washington.\n       Roosevelt promised bold experimentation. In the Hundred \n     Days of the spring of 1933, the Roosevelt administration \n     reorganized and reopened the banks and guaranteed their \n     deposits, a great monetary step as bank deposits now joined \n     most definitions of the money supply.\n       The legislation of the Hundred Days incentivized price and \n     wage increases, reduced the working week, cut government \n     salaries, increased some marginal taxes, tolerated a degree \n     of cartelism to raise prices and avoid over-production, \n     encouraged collective bargaining, and engaged in massive \n     workfare schemes that employed nearly half the unemployed in \n     projects of conservation and public works. In the first year \n     of these programs, 500,000 miles of roads and 40,000 schools, \n     3,500 parks and 1,000 airfields were built or upgraded. The \n     Civilian Conservation Corps, through the 'thirties, thinned \n     four million acres of trees, stocked one billion fish, and \n     built 30,000 animal shelters.\n       Ordinary unemployment declined by four million through \n     1933, partly due to the reduction in the work week. Farmers \n     voted by category to approve production cutbacks, permitting \n     farm price increases, and some of the agricultural surplus \n     was taken for distribution to the needy. The Tennessee Valley \n     Authority was launched and great progress began on rural \n     electrification, flood control, and drought control.\n       The Hundred Days also refinanced the nation's mortgages, \n     effectively departed the gold standard, exchanged embassies \n     with the Soviet Union, and repealed Prohibition.\n\n\n                          The Second New DEAL\n\n       The second New Deal, in 1934 and 1935, was built around \n     Social Security and included the Labour Relations Act, the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, a comprehensive \n     modernization of the Federal Reserve, and what was called, \n     but was not really, a Wealth Tax. It outraged William \n     Randolph Hearst and stole the thunder of Huey Long and other \n     radicals, as it was designed to do.\n       After a pause, when unemployment again began to rise, \n     Roosevelt brought in the third New Deal in 1938 with the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act and massive public works and conservation \n     employment schemes. These were successful and reduced \n     unemployment in mid-1939 to about 8%, less than two points \n     above where it stands today, if the public sector relief \n     workers are considered to be employed people.\n       Thereafter, like other countries, the United States relied \n     on rearmament and the selective service to reduce \n     unemployment, which fell by up to 500,000 per month coming up \n     to the 1940 election, and had almost vanished before the \n     entry of the United States into the war in 1941.\n\n\n                         The GI Bill of Rights\n\n       Finally, came the GI Bill of Rights, which greatly \n     subsidized the education, and home and farm and business \n     ownership of veterans. In the late 'forties, nearly half the \n     male university students of the United States were \n     beneficiaries of that act and the barriers to advancement for \n     working class families were largely removed.\n       I yield to few people in my enthusiasm for the capitalist \n     system, but we must all remember that in 1933, capitalism in \n     America had failed, and the political system was in danger of \n     failing with it.\n       Roosevelt developed a refrain in his later elections that \n     served him well and was unanswerable. It want: ``You are, \n     most of you, old enough to remember what things were like in \n     1933.\n       ``You remember the closed banks and the breadlines and the \n     starvation wages; the foreclosures of homes and farms, and \n     the bankruptcies of business; the `Hoovervilles,' and the \n     young men and women of the Nation facing a hopeless, jobless, \n     future; the closed factories and mines and mills; the ruined \n     and abandoned farms; the stalled railroads and the empty \n     docks; the blank despair of a whole Nation, and the utter \n     impotence of the Federal Government.''\n       The voters did remember, as people remember a horrible \n     nightmare; but it had not been a dream; it was the United \n     States in 1933.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8719-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8719-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the Unite States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/26/senate-section/article/S8719-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8719-S8720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:59 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment.\n\n       S. 858.

A bill to decrease the matching funds requirement and \nauthorize additional appropriations for Keweenaw National Historical \nPark in the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe Keweenaw National Historical Park bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1338\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FUNDING FOR KEWEENAW NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK.\n\n       (a) Matching Funds.--Section 8(b) of Public Law 102-543 (16 \n     U.S.C. 410yy-7(b)) is amended by striking ``$4'' and \n     inserting ``$1''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 10(a) of \n     Public Law 102-543 (16 U.S.C. 410yy-9(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``$25,000,000'' and inserting \n     ``$50,000,000''; and\n       (2) by striking ``$3,000,000'' and inserting \n     ``$25,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will authorize additional judgeships in the Middle and \nSouthern Federal Judicial Districts of Florida.\n  Additional judgeships are needed in these two districts in order to \ndeal with a large volume of filings, heavy pending caseloads, the \nconsiderable number of senior judges, and a rapidly growing population. \nIt is vital that we add two additional permanent and one temporary \njudgeship in the Middle District and four additional permanent \njudgeships in the Southern District of Florida.\n  Florida's Middle District is one of the busiest Federal district \ncourts in the Nation. In 2001 it was ranked fifth in the Nation for the \nnumber of criminal defendants charged with fraud and drug related \noffenses among all district courts. It handles cases filed in three of \nthe four largest cities in the State of Florida, Jacksonville, Orlando \nand Tampa, which comprise 60 percent of the State's population.\n  In 1999 four judges were added to the Middle District of Florida. The \nnumbers of weighted filings and pending caseload both decreased in \n2000. However, numbers quickly rose again in 2001. A biennial judgeship \nsurvey conducted in 2003 showed that in 2001 there were 553 weighted \nfilings in this district versus the national average of 490. In \naddition, the United States Department of Justice has identified \nCentral Florida as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Enforcement Area.\n  The Southern and Middle Districts are parallel in some of the \nchallenges that they face. Despite the additional judgeships that were \ncreated in the Southern District in 2001, the amount of weighted \nfilings continues to rise. Since 1994, civil and criminal filings per \njudgeship have stayed above the national average, with civil filings \nrising by 67 percent and criminal filings increasing by 58 percent. \nMany of these increases in criminal filings are linked to the increase \nin fraud, drugs, firearms and immigration prosecutions.\n  The administration of justice will continue to be a challenge in \nFlorida's Federal courts unless adequate resources are committed. It is \nprojected that by 2015 Florida may surpass third-ranked New York in \npopulation. As the population increases, so do the number of people \nseeking justice from the Federal courts in our State. I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1342. A bill to amend the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act to give \nthe Secretary of the Interior discretion regarding taking land into \ntrust; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto amend the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act to give the State of \nCalifornia and the local communities of Sonoma, Napa, and Marin \ncounties the opportunity for input and review of the tribe's plan for a \nmajor casino in the Bay Area.\n  I am offering this legislation because the Boards of Supervisors of \nthe local communities impacted by this planned casino have asked me to \namend the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act. The Boards of Supervisors \nof Sonoma, Marin, and Napa counties have each unanimously passed \nresolutions seeking a change in Federal law to restore the Secretary of \nInterior's discretion in approving land into trust and allowing the \nState and local government to have a voice in the process.\n  Prior to today's introduction I have met with the Presidents of the \nSonoma and Marin Boards of Supervisors, the Graton tribe, and Senators \nCampbell and Inouye the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Indian \nAffairs Committee.\n  This week I had a very spirited and frank conversation with Graton \nTribal Chairman Greg Sarris and representatives from the casino \ninvestors. During the meeting Chairman Sarris committed to work with \nthe local Boards of Supervisors and he committed to look at alternative \nsites for the casino. Chairman Sarris also said the Tribe and the \ncasino investors would conduct an environmental review based on the \ncriteria laid out in the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, \nbefore a site is selected. These are positive signs and I have told \nboth the Boards of Supervisors and the Tribe that I would like to see \nthem continue to work together.\n  This legislation guarantees that the local and State officials have a \nvoice in the process. Without this change to the Graton Rancheria \nRestoration Act they do not have that voice.\n  In 2000, Congress passed the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act to \nrestore Federal recognition to the 355 members of the Federated Indians \nof the Graton Rancheria.\n  The Graton Tribe's original Rancheria was in the northern Sonoma \nCounty town of Graton on land purchased by the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, BIA, in 1920 for the ``village home'' of otherwise homeless \nMiwok and Pomo Indians. The Rancheria was terminated in 1958 when the \nBIA approved a plan to distribute the assets to resident Indians and \nremove the Rancheria from Federal trust.\n  The original version of the Graton restoration bill, H.R. 946, \nsponsored by Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey in the 106th Congress, passed \nthe House of Representatives with a gaming restriction, to which the \nTribe agreed.\n  In testimony before the House Resources Committee in May 2000, and in \nother public comments, Graton Chairman Greg Sarris stated that the \nTribe had no intention of conducting gaming.\n  In fact, before the House Resources Committee, Chairman Sarris \nstated, ``Many may think our motives for restoration have been \ninfluenced by the opportunity gaming affords some other recognized \ntribes. Because our local political constituency, both democratic and \nrepublican has opposed any sort of development for environmental \nreasons, we agreed with these local political forces to not develop a \ngaming complex. So, as proof, we voted as a tribe to include a non-\ngaming clause in our bill, stipulating that we will not be a gaming \ntribe.''\n  Furthermore, in an article in the Marin Independent Journal on \nSeptember 21, 2000, Chairman Sarris said, ``All we want is to be \nformally recognized as Indians and have the same rights that other \nIndians do for education and health care. We are not interested in \ngambling.'' I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of this article in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Marin Independent Journal, Sept. 21, 2000]\n\n                 Gambling Dispute Threatens Miwok Bill\n\n                        (By Gannet News Service)\n\n       Washington.--Legislation to formally re-establish the \n     identity and standing of Marin's band of Coast Miwok Indians \n     appears all but dead in the face of a House-Senate dispute \n     over how tight guarantees must be that the tribe will never \n     allow casino gambling.\n       ``This is insane, this is frustrating, and I just can't see \n     why we can't find a way out of this,'' said Greg Sarris, the \n     tribe's chief who is an English professor at UCLA.\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\n       Rep. Lynn Woolsey, the Petaluma Democrat who authored the \n     original bill, said she shares the frustration but sees \n     little hope other than the fact that ``down the road there \n     will be other Congresses.''\n       The problem is that the bill to restore the all-but-\n     vanquished tribe, approved by the full House in June, \n     included specific language that waived in perpetuity any \n     right to establish gaming on the tribe's remaining one-acre \n     ancestral plot in the Sonoma County town of Graton.\n       Woolsey sought that waiver in agreement with the tiny \n     tribe. In hearings last spring and summer, she and Sarris \n     said the tribe was happy to agree to the waiver. They were \n     not interested in gaming, and their acreage was too small \n     even if they were interested. Additionally, the fine print in \n     a state-passed referendum in California to divide gaming \n     resources among tribes prevents them from operating any kind \n     of casino.\n       Adding a federal gaming ban on top of an existing state ban \n     was an easy and harmless layer of extra insurance to reassure \n     the community that the tribe would not be bringing high-\n     stakes bingo to Marin.\n       ``All we want is to be formally recognized as Indians and \n     have the same rights that other Indians do for education and \n     health care,'' said Sarris, one of some 300 descendants of \n     the tribe that the government declared extinct in the 1950s. \n     ``We are not interested in gambling.''\n       But when the bill reached the Senate as an identical \n     version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-\n     Calif., numerous Indian advocates and the government's Bureau \n     of Indian Affairs objected. The surrender of sovereignty by \n     the Miwoks, however well-intentioned, would set a precedent \n     that could be used against other tribes in other states--in \n     effect a means to pressure tribes on the sensitive issue of \n     gambling.\n       ``It's not that we don't have sympathy with what the Miwoks \n     want to do, or in this case don't want to do. It's a question \n     of eroding the hard-won sovereignty that is the legal basis \n     for the gambling that has been an important resource of many \n     tribes,'' said John Sanchez, an expert on Indian sovereignty \n     at Pennsylvania State University and a member of the \n     Apache tribe.\n       Boxer's spokesman, David Sandretti, said his bill was still \n     hopeful, but the key lawmaker on the issue is Sen. Daniel \n     Inouye of Hawaii, vice chairman of the Indian Affairs \n     Committee and long a powerful voice on behalf of American \n     Indians and native Hawaiians. Without his support, the bill \n     wouldn't survive in the Senate, Sandretti said.\n       Inouye made it clear this week that the bill is dead unless \n     Woolsey agreed to drop the gambling ban in her legislation.\n       ``If you set that precedent, that creates a lot of \n     problems,'' Inouye said. ``I would prefer to see a measure \n     without the waiver, and if I do I'd be likely to support \n     it.''\n       Inouye added that it's a meaningless, symbolic waiver to \n     begin with, because the tribe is already prevented from \n     opening a casino by state law. ``I just don't think this is \n     something that the federal government should be involved \n     in,'' he said.\n       Woolsey said she has no intention of agreeing to anything \n     that doesn't include the anti-gaming clause as written.\n       ``I got it out of the House, and now it's in the Senate, \n     and I guess that's just where it is,'' Woolsey said. ``I've \n     heard some proposals for compromise, but I haven't seen \n     anything that would offer the level of protection against \n     gaming that the community and the 6th Congressional District \n     would be prepared to accept.''\n       Gene Buvelot of Novato, vice chairman of the Federated \n     Indians of Graton Rancheria, said his group is disappointed \n     in Woolsey, because members believe she should allow the bill \n     to go forward without the clause.\n       ``We're disappointed, deeply disappointed with Woolsey \n     because she seems to be the one who's dropped the ball on \n     this, not Barbara Boxer,'' he said. ``It's a shame that it's \n     getting this far and that Woolsey is letting it bog down like \n     this.''\n       Coast Miwok tribal elder Joanne Campbell, a former Marin \n     resident now living in Daly City, said she often visited her \n     great aunt at the Miwok's Graton Rancheria in Sonoma County.\n       ``I'm really steamed, I'm just so upset that this bill \n     maybe will not pass,'' Campbell said. ``I think it's a just \n     bill and it's about time we got some recognition because we \n     have all these other issues to deal with, Health issues, \n     education issues, and we need this recognition to move \n     forward.''\n       The bill would make the tribe eligible for a wide range of \n     U.S. and California health, education and housing grants and \n     assistance from various federal agencies, give the tribe the \n     right to establish a reservation and exempt the tribe from \n     some local, state, or federal taxes and local zoning \n     ordinances on reservation land.\n       If the bill is not passed by Oct. 5, when the Senate \n     recesses, a new restoration bill would have to wait until the \n     next Congress.\n       Camobell described Woolsey's refusal to drop the redundant \n     anti-gaming clause from the Senate version as ``unrelenting'' \n     and ``unreasonable.''\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Senator Boxer sponsored legislation identical to \nCongresswoman Woolsey's in the Senate, but the gaming restriction was \nstricken when the bill was ultimately passed as part of the Omnibus \nIndian Advancement Act of 2000.\n  The day the legislation passed on December 11, 2000, Senator Boxer \nstated on the Senate Floor that dropping the gaming restriction was \nnecessary because of opposition to the no-gaming clause by the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs and the Clinton Administration and because, \naccording to Senator Boxer, ``Senator Inouye asserts that the no-gaming \nclause is unnecessary because the Graton Rancheria have no intention of \nconducting gaming.''\n  So what has changed one might ask?\n  Well, even though the Gratons voluntarily and repeatedly took a no-\ngaming pledge while their restoration bill was under consideration by \nCongress, on April 23, 2003, the Tribe and its partner, Stations \nCasinos of Las Vegas, announced plans to purchase approximately 2,000 \nacres of land in Southern Sonoma County near Sears Point for the \ndevelopment of a casino.\n  This site is located on environmentally sensative open space and San \nFrancisco--North Bay tidelands which have been the subject of a \ndecades-long conservation effort by environmentalists and local \nresidents.\n  This site is roughly 30 miles from San Francisco--along the gateway \nto Sonoma that leads thousands of travelers into the beautiful wine \ncountry each day.\n  The Tribe's casino proposal has outraged local elected officials and \nresidents who had sympathized with the Tribe's plight and supported \ntheir restoration on the condition that they not seek to develop a \ncasino. The Sonoma and Marin County Boards of Supervisors have each \npassed unanimous resolutions objecting to the Graton casino proposal. \nIn fact, even the Board of Supervisors of neighboring Napa has also \npassed a resolution against the casino proposal. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print these resolutions and letters from the counties in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Marin County, San Rafael, CA and Sonoma County, Santa \n           Rose, CA,\n                                                     May 29, 2003.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     San Francisco, CA.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We write this joint letter to \n     request your assistance with an urgent matter facing Marin \n     and Sonoma counties. As you are aware, the Graton Rancheria \n     Tribe has announced plans to acquire lands adjacent to the \n     San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge and to construct a \n     major casino in partnership with Stations Casinos of Las \n     Vegas. The proposal came as a shock to us since, at the time \n     it sought restoration in 2000, the Graton tribe represented \n     to Congress that it would not engage in gaming. It now \n     appears that the Secretary of the Interior believes she must \n     take into trust any land within our counties acquired by the \n     tribe, and that gaming will be permitted on these lands \n     without consultation with local governments or discretionary \n     review by the Secretary.\n       We ask that you sponsor legislation to require that tribal \n     trust land acquisitions be subject to consultation with local \n     governments and an appropriate administrative review. We ask \n     that restored tribal land acquired for gaming be subject to \n     the two part test that it is not detrimental to the community \n     and is supported by the Governor. Finally, we ask that the \n     Secretary be given discretion with respect to accepting land \n     into trust for the benefit of the Graton tribe. County \n     Counsel from our two counties have prepared a letter to you \n     providing background and supporting details regarding our \n     proposals.\n       We know that you share our concern about the proliferation \n     of casinos in California, especially those which are close to \n     metropolitan areas or have impacts on sensitive lands.\n       We look forward to working with you to bring about changes \n     in the law which can advance the economic interests of tribes \n     without harm to the local community.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Annette Rose,\n       President, Marin County Board of Supervisors.\n     Paul Kelley,\n       Chairman, Sonoma County Board of Supervisors.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Resolution No. 03-0512\n\n       Whereas, the agricultural lands and wetlands fronting the \n     San Francisco Bay along Highway 37 constitute one of the most \n     environmentally sensitive regions in the entire Bay Area in \n     light of their proximity to and drainage directly into the \n     Bay;\n       Whereas, the agricultural lands along Lakeville Highway \n     afford an invaluable agricultural and scenic resource, not \n     only to the people of Sonoma County but to the populace of \n     the entire Bay Area;\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\n       Whereas, such lands provide one of the Bay Area's most \n     cherished community separators, and represent an important \n     scenic gateway to Sonoma County;\n       Whereas, these bay, agriculture and wet lands have been the \n     focus of preservation and conservation efforts by \n     environmentalists and local communities for many years;\n       Whereas, based upon press reports, approximately 2,000 \n     acres of such lands are presently in imminent danger of being \n     withdrawn from County land use control and placed into trust \n     for the purposes of casino development--including the \n     potential of an extensive gaming complex, including a hotel, \n     parking and other support services as well as possible \n     residential development, by Station Casinos, a Las Vegas-\n     based developer and the Federated Indians of the Graton \n     Rancheria (``Tribe'');\n       Whereas, the Tribe was restored in 2000 based, in part, on \n     its promise not to engage in Indian casino gaming;\n       Whereas, the federal legislation restoring the Tribe \n     contains language that could be used to circumvent the \n     normally required environmental review and administrative \n     regulatory process for taking land into trust by the United \n     States government on behalf of the Tribe;\n       Whereas, the Tribe's gaming plans were announced in the \n     media without any government to government consultation with \n     affected local communities;\n       Whereas, the Board and Tribe have initiated communication \n     regarding the proposed casino but details regarding the \n     project and siting have not yet been made available;\n       Whereas, the proposed project could overwhelm the local \n     infrastructure in the area in which the casino project is \n     proposed;\n       Whereas, the environmental impacts of the prosed project \n     have the potential of being are reaching and of such a \n     magnitude that they would negatively affect a significant \n     portion of the North Bay, including grossly aggravating \n     existing traffic problems along State Highways 37 and 101 (as \n     well as County roads in the project vicinity), pose severe \n     water quality risks, and have profound negative visual \n     impacts in the scenic area;\n       Whereas, when California voters approved Proposition 1A \n     (Indian Gaming) in March of 2000 as a means of supporting the \n     laudable goal of Indian economic development and self-\n     sufficiency, they were not aware that such approval would \n     allow Nevada developers to seize prized off-reservation \n     environmental resources of intense development without \n     regarding to locally approved general plans or any meaningful \n     environmental review or protection;\n       Whereas, under the provisions of Proposition 1A and the \n     Tribal-State Compact, local communities have been granted no \n     effective input into the development of proposed tribal \n     casinos that threaten their rights and the State appears to \n     have no effective redress for significant environmental \n     impacts these gambling casinos impose on local communities: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Sonoma County Board of supervisors, \n     based on the information currently available, strongly \n     opposes the creation of a gambling casino on the site \n     proposed by the Tribe;

Let me just read one part of the Resolution from \nMarin County which will give you an idea of the opposition to the \nGraton tribe's proposed casino:\n  RESOLVED, that the Board of Supervisors of the County of Marin calls \non its elected members of the United States Senate, Dianne Feinstein \nand Barbara Boxer, and its elected member of the House of \nRepresentatives, Lynn Woolsey, to assist the residents of Marin and the \nentire North Bay to preserve their environment by introducing \nlegislation that would amend the Graton Rancheria Restoration Act and/\nor the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to stop the unregulated creation of \ntribal lands and to subject development of tribal lands in the Marin \nand Sonoma Counties at a minimum to the regulatory and approval \nprocesses applicable to newly acquired tribal lands by the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act.\n  While the counties acknowledge that the Graton have a right to be \nrecognized, they object to the site selected by the tribe and they \nespecially object to language in the Restoration Act\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nthat precludes the local community, the Governor, or the Secretary of \nthe Interior from providing input on the suitability of this location \nfor land taken into trust for gaming purposes.\n  There is a problematic section of the Restoration Act that states, \n``Upon application by the Tribe, the Secretary shall accept into trust \nfor the benefit of the Tribe any real property located in Marin or \nSonoma County . . .'' According to the Department of the Interior, this \nlanguage removes any discretion by the Secretary as well as any tribal \nobligations for consultation with the surrounding community or \nenvironmental review, as required by the normal process under the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act for newly acquired land taken into trust \nfor gaming purposes.\n  According to the Department of the Interior, the tribe must only \nconduct a hazardous materials review and show title to the land for \nland to be taken into trust. This could be completed in 9 months--and \nit is an inadequate review in my opinion.\n  Since the local communities are seeking a remedy which would restore \nthe Secretary's discretion in approving its land trust application and \nallow local government to provide input in the process, I am \nintroducing this legislation today that will change the ``shall take \nland into trust'' to ``may take land into trust.'' This legislation \nwill also require the two-part test that is standard under the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act of 1988 to apply so that the State and local \ncommunities have input in the process.\n  There is precedent for this change. In 1994, legislation was passed \nrestoring the United Auburn Tribe with the same directive to the \nSecretary of the Interior, requiring that land ``shall'' be taken into \ntrust for the Tribe. One of the restoration act's sponsors, Congressman \nJohn Doolittle sponsored an amendment to change ``shall'' to ``may'' \nafter it had been passed, thereby affording the Secretary of Interior \ndiscretion in accepting particular parcels of land into trust and local \ngovernment officials an opportunity to weigh in on the Tribe's proposed \nsite.\n  The result of that change was that the Auburn Tribe and Placer County \nofficials successfully cooperated in not only identifying a mutually \nagreeable site, but they signed a Memorandum of Understanding to \nmitigate potential impacts from the proposed Thunder Valley Casino. And \nearlier this month, the tribe opened its casino.\n  Today California is home to 109 federally recognized tribes. 61 \ntribes have gaming compacts with the State and there are 54 tribal \ncasinos. With more than 50 tribes seeking Federal recognition and \napproximately 23 recognized tribes seeking gaming compacts from the \nGovernor, revenues from California's tribal gaming industry are \nexpected to surpass Nevada's by the end of the decade.\n  The dramatic growth in tribal gaming in California has the potential \nto yield much needed benefits for tribal members in terms of \nhealthcare, education and general welfare, as Congress and California \nvoters intended. However, the question is not whether gaming should be \npermitted, but rather how and where. Those questions were asked and \nanswered in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, IGRA. But without \nthe modest change made by this legislation, the Graton tribe will be \nallowed to develop an off-reservation casino outside the requirements \nestablished in IGRA, the first time such an exception has ever been \nmade for a California tribe. Allowing this to happen would set a \ndangerous precedent not only for California, but every State where \ntribal gaming is permitted.\n  The changes we are seeking today are extremely modest. We are not \nreversing any restoration of the tribe. We are not infringing on Native \nAmerican sovereignty. We are not even blocking the casino proposal. We \nare only seeking to give the State and the local communities a voice in \nthe process. They were promised the tribe would not open a casino. That \npromise was broken, so the least we can do is ensure a normal review \nwill take place.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I look forward \nto working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee to pass this legislation quickly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to require \nadditional disclosures relating to exchange rates in transfers \ninvolving international transactions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with my distinguished \ncolleagues Senators Schumer, Akaka, and Boxer, I am introducing ``The \nMoney Wire Improvement and Remittance Enhancement Act'' (The ``Money \nWIRE Act''), legislation that will protect consumers who send cash \nremittances through international money wire transmitters by providing \nthem with increased disclosure of the exchange rate and service fees, \nas well as hidden costs, for those transactions. The legislation also \nexpands access to mainstream money wiring, check cashing, and other \nimportant services for millions of the unbanked in America, \nparticularly immigrants, through our Nation's credit unions.\n  Every year, thirty million Americans send their friends and relatives \n$40 billion in cash remittances through wire transfers. The majority of \nthese transfers are remittances sent to their native countries by \nimmigrants to the United States. For these individuals, many of whom \nare in low-to-minimum wage jobs, sending this money only increases \ntheir own personal financial burdens--but they do so to aid their \nfamilies and their loved ones.\n  Unfortunately, these immigrants increasingly find themselves being \npreyed upon by the practices of some money wire transfer providers who \nnot only charge consumers with an upfront charge for the money wire \ntransfer service, but also hit them on the back end with hidden costs. \nMany of these charges are extracted when the dollars sent by the \nconsumer are converted to the foreign currency value that is supposed \nto be paid out to the friend of the family member.\n  This exploitation is especially pervasive in Latin American and \nCaribbean countries, where much of these types of transactions occur. \nAccording to the Multilateral Investment Fund and the Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, Latin American and Caribbean immigrants sent a record \n$32 billion to their home countries in 2002--a dramatic increase \ncompared with $23 billion in 2001. Many of these dollars were used to \npay for basic needs, such as food, medicine, and schooling, and to \nalleviate the suffering of loved ones during a difficult economic year.\n  To bring this amount into even greater perspective, the remittances \nthat flowed into Latin America and the Caribbean last year equaled \nroughly the amount of direct foreign investment that flowed into the \nregion, and exceeded the amount of development aid to Latin America \nfrom all sources. For this decade alone, Latin America and the \nCaribbean could receive more than $300 billion. And experts believe \nthat number is likely to grow significantly in coming years.\n  These large cash flows have proven to be a powerful incentive for \ngreed in the case of some wire transfer companies. Customers wiring \nmoney to Latin America and elsewhere in the world lose billions of \ndollars annually to undisclosed ``currency conversion fees,'' and other \nservice costs.\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\n  In fact, many large companies aggressively target immigrant \ncommunities, often advertising ``low fee'' or ``no fee'' rates for \ninternational transfers. But these misleading ads do not always clearly \ndisclose the fees charged when the currency is exchanged.\n  While large wire service companies typically obtain foreign \ncurrencies at bulk rates, they charge a significant currency conversion \nfee to their U.S. customers. For example, customers wiring money to \nMexico are charged an exchange rate that routinely varies from the \nbenchmark by as much as 15 percent. These hidden fees create staggering \nprofits, allowing companies to reap billions of dollars on top of the \nstated fees they charge for the wire transfer services.\n  Last year alone, immigrants who sent money to Latin America and the \nCaribbean paid approximately $4 billion in transaction costs to the \nmoney wire transfer companies that dominate this business. In other \nwords, for every $100 that an immigrant sent home, to help their family \nand loved ones, $12 was siphoned off by these businesses in order to \n``service'' that transaction.\n  That adds up to a $20-$30 average cost, occasionally it can be \nconsiderably more, for poor, hard-working folks for whom the typical \nremittance--around $250 to $300 a month--represents a significant \npercentage of their monthly income.\n  Multiplied by millions, these excessive charges constitute a \nsignificant major economic force. These millions could have otherwise \nbeen used to feed children, house a family, or invest in a small \nbusiness--all of which markedly improve overall quality of life.\n  The ``Money WIRE Act'' would require money wire transmitting \nbusinesses to disclose to senders, and receivers, of international \nmoney wire transfers the exchange rate used in association with the \ntransaction; any surcharges, commissions or fees charged to the \ncustomer for the service; and the exact amount of the foreign currency \nto be received by the recipient in the foreign country.\n  It also requires that that rate and fee information be prominently \ndisplayed at the wire transmitting service location and on all receipts \nassociated with the money wire transaction--and it ensures that those \ndisclosures occur in the same language as that principally used by the \nbusiness to advertise its money transmitting services, if that language \nis other than English.\n  The bill also requires Federal banking regulators and the Department \nof Treasury to conduct a study, and submit a report to Congress, of the \nfees and fees disclosure at traditional financial institutions compared \nto those that occur at money transmitting businesses for money wire \ntransactions.\n  Finally, the Act includes a provision that expands the ``field of \nmembership'' definition for credit unions to give non-members, \nparticularly unbanked and immigrant communities, access to credit \nunions for international money transfer, money order, and check cashing \nservices, where the costs for these services are significantly less.\n  This legislation does more than merely provide better information to \nconsumers--it actually helps them and their families financially. \nConsumers will see increased competition among wire transfer service \nproviders because they are better-informed and more knowledgeable. That \ncompetition will result in lower fees for the wire transfer services \nthat will free up a greater portion of these cash remittances to go to \nthe friends and families that they were originally intended for.\n  In short, this is sound public policy that empowers those who do \ntheir part to help America's economy move forward.\n  I hope that my colleagues will support this legislation and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of the Money Wire \nImprovement and Remittance Enhancement Act introduced by my colleague, \nSenator Corzine. I thank Senator Corzine for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  Immigrants often send a portion of their hard-earned wages to their \nrelatives abroad. Remittances are often used to improve the standard of \nliving of recipients by increasing access to health care, education, \nand essentials of daily life. In addition, remittances contribute \nsignificantly to the economic development of nations. For example, \nPhilippines workers across the globe sent an estimated $6.4 billion \nback to the Philippines in 2001.\n  Despite the tremendous importance of remittances, people who send \nthem are often unaware of the fees and exchange rates assessed in these \ntransactions which reduce the amount of money received by their family \nmembers. Fees for sending remittances often can be ten to twenty \npercent of the value of the transaction. Also, the exchange rate used \nin the transaction can be significantly lower than the market rate.\n  Consumers and their families cannot afford to remain uninformed about \ntheir financial service options and the fees placed on their \ntransactions. This legislation would ensure that each customer is fully \ninformed of all of the fees and the exchange rates used in sending \nmoney.\n  I am hopeful that the enactment of this legislation will result in \nmore people utilizing banks and credit unions for remittances because \nthese institutions do not charge the exorbitant fees often associated \nwith remittances processed by certain other entities. In addition, if \nunbanked immigrants take advantage of the remittance services offered \nby banks and credit unions, they will be more likely to open up an \naccount. This would allow immigrants to take advantage of the \nopportunities for saving and borrowing found at mainstream financial \ninstitutions and offer them alternatives to fringe banking products, \nsuch as check cashing services.\n  The Money Wire Improvement and Remittance Enhancement Act has special \nsignificance to my home State of Hawaii. Hawaii is home to significant \nnumbers of recent immigrants from many nations, including the \nPhilippines, who send remittances to their relatives abroad. We must do \nwhat we can to ensure that their hard-earned dollars are not eroded by \nunnecessary fees or a lack of transparency regarding exchange rates.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1345. A bill to extend the authorization for the ferry boat \ndiscretionary program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will greatly enhance Federal participation in financing and \nimproving our Nation's ferry transportation system.\n  Today I am introducing the Ferry Transportation Enhancement Act. I am \nproud to have Senators Boxer, Cantwell, Corzine, Clinton, Edwards, \nFeinstein, Hollings, Kennedy, Lautenberg, and Schumer as original \ncosponsors. This bill will provide significantly more resources to \nstate governments, public ferry systems, and public entities \nresponsible for developing facilities for ferries.\n  Specifically, the bill would: provide $150 million a year for the \nFederal Highway Administration's Ferry Boat Discretionary Program for \nfiscal years 2004 through 2009. This is approximately four times the \n$38 million a year that is currently being provided under this program; \nadd ``ferry maintenance facilities'' to the list of allowable use of \nfunds under this program; add ``ferries'' to the Clean Fuels Program; \nestablish a Ferry Joint Program Office to coordinate Federal programs \naffecting ferry boat and ferry facility construction, maintenance, and \noperations and to promote ferry service as a component of the Nation's \ntransportation system; establish an information database on ferry \nsystems, routes, vessels, passengers and vehicles carried; and \nestablish an institute for ferries to conduct R, conduct training \nprograms, encourage collaborative efforts to promote ferry service, and \npreserve historical information. This will parallel institutes that now \nexist for highways, transit, and rail.\n  Currently, the Federal investment in ferries is only one-tenth of one \npercent of the total Surface Transportation Program. There is virtually \nno coordination at the Federal level to encourage and promote ferries \nas there are for other modes of transportation.\n  We need better coordinated ferry services because it's the sole means \nof surface transportation in many areas of the country, including \nHawaii, Alaska and my home State of Washington.\n  Ferries are also the preferred, and the only feasible, method of \ncommuting from home to work in places like Washington State, New York/\nNew Jersey, North Carolina, Hawaii and Alaska.\n  Finally, in many States--like my home State of Washington--they are \nan important part of the tourism industry and represent a part of our \ncultural identity.\n  The symbol of ferries moving people and vehicles on the waterways of \nthe Puget Sound is as much a part of our cultural identity as \ncomputers, coffee, commercial aircraft and the Washington Apple.\n  Ferry use is growing.\n  In Washington State our ferry system--the Nation's largest--currently \ntransports 26 million passengers each year and carries 11 million \nvehicles.\n  Other systems that serve New York/New Jersey, North Carolina, San \nFrancisco, and Alaska also have significant numbers of passengers using \nthe ferries.\n  The Nation's six largest ferry systems carried 73 million people and \n13 million vehicles last year.\n  The growth projection for ferry use is very high. For these larger \nsystems, it is projected that by 2009 there will be a 14-percent \nincrease in passengers and a 17-percent increase in vehicles being \ncarried by ferries compared to 2002.\n  In San Francisco, that projection is a 46-percent increase.\n  It is clear that many people are using ferries and more will be using \nthem in the future.\n  This is all with very little help from the Federal Government.\n  Our investment in ferries pails in comparison to the Federal \ninvestments in highways and other forms of mass transit.\n  Our bill would provide the needed funding for these growing systems \nfor new ferry boat construction, for ferry facilities and terminals, \nand for maintenance facilities.\n  The bill also would make ferries eligible under the Clean Fuels \nProgram.\n  Like busses, ferries are a form of mass transit that is \nenvironmentally cleaner than mass use of cars and trucks. Making them \neligible for the Clean Fuels Program will encourage boat makers to \ndesign cleaner and more efficient vessels in the future. This will make \nferry travel an even more environmentally friendly means of \ntransportation than it already is today.\n  Finally, setting up a Ferry Joint Program Office, keeping track of \nferry statistics, and establishing a National Ferry Institute will \nincrease the profile of ferries as part of our Nation's infrastructure \nand provide a method to analyze and research ways to improve their use.\n  In the end, I hope this proposal can be included in the TEA-21 \nReauthorization.\n  Ferries are an important part of our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\nThis bill recognizes their importance by providing the resources and \nsupport they need to grow and serve passengers.\n  I urge the Senate support this bill, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to see it passed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1346.

A bill to amend the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 to \nprovide for training service and delivery innovation projects; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL:\n  S. 1348. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify \nthe computation of eligibility for certain Federal Pell Grants, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a \ntopic that I believe is critical to our Nation's economic growth and \nfuture competitiveness--the training of our workforce.\n  We are living in tough economic times. The economy of the State of \nWashington and the Nation at large are suffering through a recession \nwhere jobs are scarce and workers are scrambling to pay the bills. The \nmost recent employment data available from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics have offered little comfort in Washington where the \nunemployment rate is 7.3 percent. Washington, along with the other \nPacific Northwest States of Oregon and Alaska, continues to have among \nthe highest unemployment rates in the nation.\n  Just a month ago, the Senate moved quickly to extend the temporary \nextension of unemployment compensation program, so that approximately \nfour million workers across this country will not lose their Federal \nextended unemployment benefits. I am proud that the Senate acted \nquickly to extend this important program. This means that over 100,000 \nunemployed workers in Washington State will receive 26 weeks of Federal \nextended benefits. I am disappointed, however, that we were not able to \npass coverage for the estimated 1.1 million unemployed workers who have \nentirely exhausted their State and Federal benefits. Therefore, I am \nfighting to pass a bill that would extend coverage to the long-term \nunemployed, so that help is available to the hardest hit workers in \nthis weak economy.\n  Nonetheless, our efforts should not stop with an unemployment \ninsurance extension. We must continue to pursue long-term strategies \nfor a sustained economic recovery. The fundamental strength of our \neconomy lies in the working men and women of this Nation whose \ninnovation and hard work propelled the massive economic expansion of \nthe past decade.\n  The competitive edge that will keep our workers ahead in this \nchanging global economy is their skills. Our economy is global, linked \nby international markets and communications networks. The sustained \nsuccess of U.S. companies depends on adaptability and innovation, which \nmeans that workers themselves need to remain flexible and continually \nupdate job skills.\n  Even in this time of high unemployment, businesses throughout the \ncountry cannot find workers with the skills they need. According to a \nstudy completed by Heldrich Work Trends Survey, American employers are \nfinding it difficult to hire qualified workers. Nearly half, 46 \npercent, of American businesses say they have had trouble finding \nworkers with the necessary skills. At the same time, over three million \nworkers are laid off each year, but well under 500,000 receive any sort \nof training to learn the skills demanded by those businesses that face \nworker shortages. Job training is an answer to meeting those skill \ndemands and bridging the skills gaps that persist. However, it will not \noccur widely without a strong financial commitment from the Federal \nGovernment to ensure access to job training programs, and ongoing \nefforts to maximize the effectiveness of those funds that we already \ninvest.\n  Investment in job training must be our first priority not our last--\nthe decisions we make today to invest in our workers will pay off many \ntimes over in the form of stronger local economies, healthier \ncommunities, and improved quality of life.\n  But the reality is that we are delivering a trickle of funding while \nfaced with a tidal wave of need. I have traveled across my state, from \nOlympia to Kelso, Vancouver to Bellingham, the Tri-cities to Spokane \nand received a great deal of feedback from Washingtonians who are \nseeking training, are providing it, or are serving as employers who \nneed to hire skilled workers. And I heard similar concerns repeated in \neach of these areas: first, as our economy continues to evolve, the \ndemand for new skills has grown; second, the enormous increase in \ndemand for skills training by individual workers who are upgrading \nskills or changing jobs is a trend that appears to be widespread \nthroughout the Nation; but third, far too many of those workers seeking \naccess to training cannot get the training they need due to limited \nspace at training institutions and the limited tuition assistance.\n  Last year, my office released a study of this apparent shortfall in \ncapacity of training systems in my State, and the results of that study \nwere staggering to me. There are over 110,000 dislocated workers in my \nstate, the majority of whom want to upgrade their skills but cannot do \nso because of budgetary limitations that prevent institutions from \noffering enough courses, and the limited numbers of available training \nvouchers.\n  To make things worse, this year, the State of Washington received \napproximately 40 percent less in Workforce Investment Act, WIA, formula \nfunding compared to last year. This drastic cut in WIA funding means \nthat services will be cut back at a time when the demand is at an all \ntime high. It is imperative that during this time of State deficits, \nStates receive additional help from the Federal Government for \nimportant services such as education and job training.\n  As my colleagues know, the Workforce Investment Act is up for \nreauthorization this year. The WIA system is clearly the centerpiece of \nthe Federal job training programs. It provides a one-stop delivery \nsystem designed to meet a broad range of worker needs, and it emerged \nfrom years of bipartisan work by Congress to consolidate over 33 \nFederal programs into one system for delivering employment and training \nservices.\n  Today, I am introducing three bills that are designed to build upon \nthe existing workforce structure to expand opportunities for training \nand improve its effectiveness.\n  The first piece of legislation would change the Pell Grant program to \nmake certain that student financial aid is available to recently laid \noff workers. Under current law, the standard practice in the \ndetermination of Pell Grant eligibility for student aid is to base \ngrant awards upon the applicant's income during the previous year. The \nuse of tax forms for this purpose, in many cases, is the most \nappropriate and easiest administrative method of obtaining a clear and \nofficial statement of financial need. But, as a result, many recently \nlaid-off workers are not eligible for critical financial assistance at \na time when the workers' families are experiencing a dramatic decrease \nin income. My legislation would explicitly provide the authority for \neducational institutions, after taking sufficient precautions to \nprevent fraud, to consider current-year income levels for applicants \nseeking training through Pell Grant-eligible programs. It does this in \na very narrow way, by only allowing institutions in States with high \nunemployment rates to consider current year financial circumstances \nrather than previous year income.\n  The second bill addresses issues of distance-learning and delivery of \ntraining to hard to reach areas in a comprehensive manner. While many \ndistance-learning technologies have been developed in recent years, \nthose technologies have not necessarily reached many of those who are \nmost in need of training. Many workers in need of\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\ntraining may not be aware of online distance learning opportunities and \nmay not be able to take advantage of them even if they do know about \nthem. I believe, it is not enough to create a distance learning \ncurriculum and passively provide it through an educational institution \nwebsite. Rather, comprehensive solutions need to be developed that \nintegrate curriculum innovations, technological access, and the \npromotion and linkage of workers in need of training with such \nopportunities, especially to help workers in rural areas. That's why my \nbill encourages the local workforce development boards to plan a \ncomprehensive approach to improve access to and delivery of employment \ntraining services by using technology and online resources to connect \nworkers with the information and tools they need to upgrade their \nskills.\n  The third bill that I am introducing today is designed to help local \nworkforce development boards better understand regional labor market \ndynamics and improve system performance by identifying emerging sectors \nand industries with chronic worker shortages. My legislation encourages \nlocal workforce development boards to target employment and training \nresources so that workers can get training in occupations where \nemployers need workers.\n  My legislation provides new resources to the state level so that \nstates can direct funding down to the local workforce development \nboards to form partnerships with employers, unions, service providers \nand other key players in order to develop a strategic plan for \naddressing regional industry and workforce needs.\n  I want to make clear that this legislation is not intended to \nreinvent the wheel for areas that are already developing sectoral \napproaches within existing workforce development systems. In fact, \nWashington State is a leader in sector approaches: in 2000, the \nWashington State Legislature enacted legislation to support industry \nskills panels known as the ``Skills Initiative.'' The Skills Initiative \nprovides grants to local workforce development councils to engage \nbusiness and industry in strategies to close the skill gaps in my \nState. My legislation emphasizes this work by providing funding to \nsupport these partnerships.\n  This is a first step on a long journey as we work to improve Federal \njob training systems, and it is critical, now more than ever, that \nCongress increase funding for the job training programs under the \nWorkforce Investment Act. By providing the necessary resources, we send \na strong message to the American public that our government must invest \nin our greatest resource--the American worker. Each of these bills is \nan important component of that broader strategy, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues as we begin to look at the reauthorization \nof WIA and the Higher Education Act this year and next.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of each bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sectoral Market Assessment \n     for Regional Training Enhancement and Revitalization Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than \\1/3\\ of the Nation's current workforce lacks \n     the basic skills necessary to succeed in today's labor \n     market.\n       (2) Globalization of the economy is leading to losses of \n     jobs in key domestic industries, as well as challenges to \n     competitiveness and productivity in other domestic \n     industries.\n       (3) To remain economically vital and competitive, the \n     Nation must invest in generating jobs and train a workforce \n     skilled enough to contribute productively to the United \n     States economy.\n       (4) Strategic planning that links workforce development and \n     economic development, and the targeting of resources to \n     industries that can build strong regional economies and \n     create jobs with living wages for workers, need to be \n     priorities for the workforce investment system.\n       (5) States and local workforce investment boards can play \n     lead roles in guiding a more strategic process for achieving \n     economic growth through workforce development.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require Federal agencies, and persons engaged in \ninterstate commerce, in possession of electronic data containing \npersonal information, to disclose any unauthorized acquisition of such \ninformation; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Notification \nof Risk to Personal Data Act of 2003. This legislation will require \nthat individuals are notified when their most sensitive personal \ninformation is stolen from a corporate or government database.\n  Specifically, the bill would require government or private entities \nto notify individuals if a data breach has compromised their Social \nSecurity number, driver's license number, credit card number, debit \ncard number, or financial account numbers.\n  In most cases, if authorities know that someone is a victim of a \ncrime, the victim is notified. But that isn't the case if an \nindividual's most sensitive personal information is stolen from an \nelectronic database.\n  Unfortunately, data breaches are becoming all too common. Consider \nthe following incidents which have compromised the records of hundreds \nof thousands of Americans.\n  On April 5, 2002, a hacker broke into the electronic records of \nSteven P. Teale Data Center, the payroll facility for California State \nemployees. The hacker compromises files containing the first initials, \nmiddle initials, and last names, Social Security numbers, and payroll \ndeduction information of approximately 265,000 people. Despite the \nbreathtaking potential harm of the crime, the breach was not publicly \nacknowledged and State employees were not made aware of their \nvulnerability to identify theft until May 24, 2002--17 days later.\n  On December 14, 2002, TriWest Health Care Alliance, a company that \nprovides health care coverage for military personnel and their \nfamilies, was burglarized at its Phoenix, AZ offices. Thieves broke \ninto a management suite and stole laptop computers and computer hard \ndrives containing the names, addressed, telephone numbers, birth dates \nand Social Security numbers of 562,000 military service members, \ndependents and retirees, as well as medical claims records for people \non active duty in the Persian Gulf.\n  In February 2003, a hacker gained access to 10 million Visa, \nMasterCard, American Express Card and Discovery Card numbers from the \ndatabases of a credit processor, DPI Merchant services of Omaha, NE. \nCompany officials maintained that the intruder did not obtain any \npersonal information for these card numbers such as the account \nholder's name, address, telephone number or Social Security number. \nHowever, at least one bank canceled and replaced 8,800 cards when it \nfound out about the security breach.\n  And in March of this year, a University of Texas student was charged \nwith hacking into the university's computer system and stealing 55,000 \nSocial Security numbers.\n  These are just some examples of the types of breaches that are \noccurring today. Except for California, which as a notification law \ngoing into effect in July, no State of Federal law requires companies \nor agencies to tell individuals of the misappropriation of their \npersonal data.\n  I strongly believe Americans should be notified if a hacker gets \naccess to their most personal data. This is both a matter of principle \nand a practical measure to curb identity theft.\n  Let me take a moment to describe the proposed legislation.\n  The Notification of Risk to Personal Data Act will set a national \nstandard for notification of consumers when a data breach occurs.\n  Specifically, the legislation requires a business or government \nentity to notify an individual when there is a reasonable basis to \nconclude that a hacker or other criminal has obtained unencrypted \npersonal data maintained by the entity.\n  Personal data is defined by the bill as an individual's Social \nSecurity number, State identification number, driver's license number, \nfinancial account number, or credit card number.\n  The legislation's notification scheme minimizes the burdens on \ncompanies or agencies that must report a data breach.\n  In general, notice would have to be provided to each person whose \ndata was compromised in writing or through e-mail. But there are \nimportant exceptions.\n  First, companies that have developed their own reasonable \nnotification policies are given a safe harbor under the\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nbill and are exempted from its notification requirements.\n  Second, encrypted data is exempted.\n  Third, where it is too expensive or impractical, e.g., contact \naddress information is incomplete, to notify every individual who is \nharmed, the bill allows entities to send out an alternative form of \nnotice called ``substitute notice.'' Substitute notice includes posting \nnotice on a website or notifying major media.\n  Substitute notice would be triggered if any of the following factors \nexist: 1. the agency or person demonstrates that the cost of providing \ndirect notice would exceed $250,000; 2. the affected class of subject \npersons to be notified exceeds 500,000; or 3. the agency or person does \nnot have sufficient contact information to notify people whose \ninformation is at risk.\n  The bill has a tough, but fair enforcement regime. Entities that fail \nto comply with the bill will be subject to fines by the Federal Trade \nCommission of $5,000 per violation or up to $25,000 per day while the \nviolation persists. State Attorneys General can also file suit to \nenforce the statute.\n  Additionally, the bill would allow California's new law to remain in \neffect, but preempt conflicting State laws. It is my understanding that \nlegislators in a number of States are developing bills modeled after \nthe California law. Reportedly, some of these bills have requirements \nthat are inconsistent with the California legislation. It is not fair \nto put companies in a situation that forces them to comply with \ndatabase notification laws of 50 different States.\n  I strongly believe individuals have a right to be notified when their \nmost sensitive information is compromised--because it is truly their \ninformation. Ask the ordinary person on the street if he or she would \nlike to know if a criminal had illegally gained access to their \npersonal information from a database--the answer will be a resounding \nyes.\n  Enabling consumers to be notified in a timely manner of security \nbreaches involving their personal data will help combat the growth \nscourge of identity theft. According to the Identity Theft Resources \nCenter, a typical identity theft victim takes six to 12 months to \ndiscover that a fraud has been perpetuated against them.\n  As Linda Foley, Executive Director of the Identity Theft Resources \ncenter puts it: ``Identity theft is a crime of opportunity and time is \nessential at every junction. Every minute that passes after the breach \nuntil detection and notification increases the damage done to the \nconsumer victim, the commercial entities, and law enforcement's ability \nto track and catch the criminals. It takes less than a minute to fill \nout a credit application and to start an action that could permanently \naffect the victim's life. Multiply that times hundreds of minutes, \nhundreds of opportunities to use or sell the information stolen and you \njust begin to understand the enormity of the problem that the lack of \nnotification can cause.''\n  If individuals are informed of the theft of their Social Security \nnumbers or other sensitive information, they can take immediate \npreventative action.\n  They can place a fraud alert on their credit report to prevent crooks \nfrom obtaining credit cards in their name; they can monitor their \ncredit reports to see if unauthorized activity has occurred; they can \ncancel any affected financial or consumer or utility accounts; they can \nchange their phone numbers if necessary.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this vitally \nneeded legislation. This bill will give ordinary Americans more control \nand confidence about the safety of their personal information. \nAmericans will have the security of knowing that should a breach occur, \nthey will be notified and be able to take protective action.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expedite procedures for hazardous fuels reduction \nactivities and restoration in wildland fire prone National Forests and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President: Today, I introduce, for myself and Mrs. \nFeinstein, the Community and Forest Protection Act. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) In 2002, approximately six and one half million acres \n     of forest lands in the U.S. burned with varying degrees of \n     severity, 21 people lost their lives, and over 3000 \n     structures were destroyed. The Forest Service and Bureau of \n     Land Management spent more than $1 billion fighting these \n     fires.\n       (2) 73 million acres of public lands are classified as \n     condition class 3 fire risks. This includes 23 million acres \n     that are in strategic areas designated by the U.S. Forest \n     Service for emergency treatment to withstand catastrophic \n     fire.\n       (3) The forest management policy of fire suppression has \n     resulted in an accumulation of fuel loads, dead and dying \n     trees, and non-native species that create fuel ladders which \n     allow fires to reach the crowns of large old trees and cause \n     catastrophic fire.\n       (4) The U.S. Forest Service and the Department of the \n     Interior should immediately undertake an emergency program to \n     reduce the risk of catastrophic fire.\n       (5) This emergency program should prioritize the protection \n     of homes and communities and the restoration of forest health \n     on lands at the highest risk of catastrophic fire. All fuel \n     reduction treatments should protect old growth stands and \n     large trees to ensure a rich and continued species diversity \n     in the nation's forests.\n\n     SECTION 1.

I rise to introduce with Senator Wyden a bill to \nreduce the risk of catastrophic fire in our country's magnificent \nnational forests.\n  No one who watched last week as Arizona's community of Summerhaven on \nMount Lemmon burned can doubt the importance of this issue. My heart \ngoes out to the residents of Summerhaven, and to the others who will be \ndisplaced by the fires yet to come this summer.\n  Americans know that there is something wrong with our national \nforests. For too long we have suppressed fires, gradually letting brush \nand small trees multiply until many of our forests are now choked by a \ndense thicket.\n  Today, there are 57 million acres of Federal lands at the highest \nrisk of catastrophic forest fires. If we do not take action now, these \nforests could go up in smoke. This bill we are introducing today is \nbalancing, and it will reduce the risk of catastrophic fire in our \ncountry's magnificent national forests.\n  This legislation would speed up the environmental review process--\nwithout sacrificing the most important environmental protections. It \nalso would protect the communities which face the highest risk and \nsafeguard old growth stands and large trees. And it would include \nsensible provisions on judicial review that will help projects go \nforward quickly without compromising our independent judiciary. These \nare provisions that makes sense, and I hope that my colleagues will \nsupport the bill.\n  We have crafted our bill around three fundamental principles:\n  We should focus limited Federal resources on protecting communities \nand on the forest lands truly most at risk;\n  We should speed up the environmental review process, but without \nsacrificing the most important environmental protections; and\n  We should protect old growth stands and large trees.\n  Let me show how the bill achieves these three goals.\n  First, the bill prioritizes our efforts. Many people believe that we \nshould protect communities first. The bill does so. Seventy percent of \nthe funding is directed to the wildland-urban interface near \ncommunities.\n  Of course, conditions vary by State. The bill allows Governors to \nadjust the percentage of work that is to be done within the wildland--\nurban interface for their State, up to a maximum of 75 percent, or down \nto a minimum of 50 percent.\n  By way of contrast, H.R. 1904, which passed the House, includes no \nfocus on protecting communities. All the money can be spent far from \ncommunities under H.R. 1904, even if the Governor of a State wishes \notherwise.\n  Senator Wyden and I believe that in addition to protecting \ncommunities, there are some forest lands that should be thinned to \nensure that catastrophic fires do not devastate the forest and \neliminate habitat for the species that have there.\n  In the last century, Americans have rigorously suppressed fires, \nstamping them out whenever they start. In certain forests like \nponderosa pine, these fires would naturally have cleared out the brush \nand small trees every 10 or 20 years or so.\n  In the absence of these fires, brush has grown into ``doghair \nthickets'' with dangerous levels of fuel loadings. When fires burn now \nin these forests, they will be so hot that they won't just clear out \nthe brush but will kill the large trees and often scorch the soil.\n  These are the forests where we need to focus our efforts. We thus \ntarget thinning projects to forests that are both Fire Regime I and \nCondition Class 3. Fire Regime I forests are those that used to have \nlow-intensity, brush-clearing fires; and Condition Class 3 forests are \nthe most altered from their natural condition. The combination of Fire \nRegime I and Condition Class 3 are the highest priority lands for \ntreatment.\n  We also direct projects to municipal watersheds and diseased or \nwindblown forests that are in Condition Class 3. If we don't protect \nthe municipal watersheds, catastrophic fires could strip off the tree \ncover that prevents soils from eroding into creeks and lakes. \nMunicipalities' water quality could suffer.\n  In contrast to our bill, H.R. 1904 fails to prioritize brush-clearing \nprojects for the areas that need it the most. Instead, H.R. 1904 \nprovides expedited processes for lands that are only moderately altered \nby fire suppression--Condition Class 2 lands in addition to Condition \nClass 3.\n  In many of the forests where H.R. 1904 would direct brush-clearing \nwork, there naturally would have been severe fires that burned all the \ntrees in the stand. After a thinning project, fires in these forests \nwill still behave the same way, scorching and killing most of the \ntrees. Thus, much of the thinning called for in H.R. 1904 would have \nlittle effect on the fire behavior or forest health.\n  Senator Wyden and I have worked very hard to develop a bill that \nspeeds up the review process so important work can get done without \nsacrificing environmental protections.\n  Almost everyone agrees that we need to work quickly to protect the \nareas immediately around communities. There is little controversy or \ndebate over these projects.\n  The Forest Service has proposed an analytical short-cut for these \nprojects, which requires very little environmental analysis and no \nformal pubic comment process or administrative appeal.\n  There is some uncertainty, however, over the Forest Service's \nproposed approach. People can claim that laws Congress has previously \npassed will require some of these projects to be held up by more \nenvironmental analysis or administrative appeals.\n  Our bill eliminates this uncertainty. When the Forest Service works \nin the immediate vicinity of a community, the bill would make \nabsolutely clear that there need to be no environmental analysis or \nadministrative appeals. The only exception is where there might be \nextraordinary circumstances, such as a major threat to endangered \nspecies. We also prohibit the Forest Service from conducting clearcuts \naround communities, requiring them to focus on clearing out the brush.\n  By way of comparison, the House-passed bill does not provide any \nassistance to thinning projects in the immediate vicinity of \ncommunities, even though everyone agrees on the need for these \nprojects.\n  Senator Wyden and I have also sped up the process for projects \noutside the immediate vicinity of communities. These projects are more \ncontroversial, so we want to make sure that the public has some \nopportunity for input.\n  In the past, the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior \nhave been able to conduct the majority of brush-clearing mechanical \ntreatment following a National Environmental Policy Act process known \nas environmental assessments. Our bill simplified these environmental \nassessments in several ways.\n\n  The bill provides one round of public comment--the administrative \nappeal process--rather than two.\n  The bill shortens the time frame for administrative appeals from 90 \nto 60 days.\n  Finally, the appeal deciding offer can make necessary changes rather \nthan having to send the project back to the original decisionmaker for \nfurther time-consuming review.\n  Together, these changes will likely speed up the process by a few \nmonths or more. We do all this without eliminating public comment or \ngutting core parts of the environmental analysis.\n  In contrast, the House-passed bill would eliminate the requirement \nthat the Forest Service consider alternatives to the proposed project \nas part of its environmental analysis. In other\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\nwords, the Forest Service doesn't have to study other, less damaging \nways of undertaking the project--it can just do the project the way it \nwants.\n  Many people think that public debate over alternatives is the core of \nthe National Environmental Policy Act. Our bill does not eliminate this \nimportant environmental protection.\n  Another important part of our bill is its protection of magnificent \nold growth stands. The remaining groves of these trees provide a \nconnection to nature untrammeled by human activity, a connection that \nmany of us cherish.\n  Our bill would require full protection of these old growth stands. In \naddition, outside old growth stands, the bill focuses on small-diameter \ntrees and protects large trees that promote fire-resistant stands and \nspecies diversity.\n  By way of contrast, H.R. 1904 provides no protection for these \nmagnificent resources.\n  Let me now talk about judicial review. No one wants court cases to go \non too long. In addition, people should not be able to tie up projects \nby gaming the system and picking and choosing the friendliest courts to \nhear their lawsuits.\n  Our bill addresses these problems. The bill encourages courts, to the \nmaximum extent practicable, to resolve lawsuits over brush-clearing \nprojects quickly. These are important projects for the safety of our \ncommunities and our forests, and it is appropriate to give them some \npriority.\n  In addition, we require that potential litigants file suit in the \nsame judicial district where a fuels reduction project takes place, No \none can game the system by looking for a friendly judge somewhere else.\n  Finally, we limit temporary injunctions that are typically issued at \nthe outset of a case to 60 days. They can be renewed if necessary--but \nthe challengers to a projects must submit updates explaining why the \ninjunctions should be extended. This provision prevents projects from \nbeing held up any longer than is strictly necessary.\n  These changes will expedite the process--but they still respect our \ncourt system's essential autonomy. As a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I spend much of my time trying to make sure our court system \nis as fair as possible.\n  Americans count on a judiciary independent of the executive branch to \npreserve their liberties and to right any wrongs that their government \ncommits. I think it is very important that we do not interfere with the \nindependence of our judiciary.\n\n  The House-passed bill would require the courts to give weight to \ncertain findings by the Forest Service and the Department of the \nInterior. Even if projects had been found to violate the environmental \nlaws, courts would be told to give weight to the agencies' findings and \nallow many of the projects to go ahead anyway.\n  This is a dangerous provision for a bill to include, and I cannot \nsupport it. I believe our bill includes more sensible provisions on \njudicial review that will help projects go forward quickly without \ncompromising the independence of our judiciary.\n  Our bill includes several provisions to address forest health \nproblems on private and State lands.\n  We authorize $50 million annually in emergency grants to States and \nlocalities where lives are at risk. The last few years have seen vast \ninsect epidemics killing millions of trees in Southern California, \nArizona, and elsewhere.\n  In places like Lake Arrowhead, Big Bear and Idyllwild in Southern \nCalifornia, communities are surrounded by dead and dying trees that are \nperfect kindling for a catastrophic fire. There is a real threat to \npeople's lives that we must address.\n  There is now no good funding source for clearing evacuation routes \nand clearing around schools and other emergency shelters that are on \nState and private lands. The emergency grants in the bill would \nauthorize funds for these essential purposes.\n  The bill also includes two measures to encourage homeowners to clear \nbrush around their houses and install non-flammable roofs. A study of \nSouthern California fires by Forest Service researcher Jack Cohen has \nshown that these measures could reduce a blaze's threat to homes by as \nmuch as 85 to 95 percent.\n  Our bill would encourage these home-saving practices in two ways:\n  The bill would prioritize grants to those communities that encourage \nbrush-clearing and use of non-flammable roofs or develop comprehensive \nfire plans.\n  The bill would record the Sense of Congress that insurers should \noffer lower premiums to homeowners who take steps to protect their \nhomes.\n  Our bill would also include grants to encourage the use of woody \nmaterial, or biomass, for energy production. Biomass-to-energy plants \nserve multiple beneficial purposes: one, they are a clean and renewable \nsource of energy; and two, they make brush-clearing projects more cost-\neffective, so we can protect more with the finite Federal dollars \navailable.\n  Finally, our bill would also include contracting provisions to \nbenefit rural communities. The Forest Service and the Department of the \nInterior would be required to use ``best value contracting'' for brush-\nclearing projects under the Act.\n  This contracting approach requires the agencies to consider other \nfactors besides the price of the bid in awarding contractors. Bidders \nwould be rewarded for such factors as their commitment to hire local \nworkers, and their past record of environmental stewardship.\n  I would like to close by saying that this is truly a bipartisan \nissue. All of us, Democrat and Republican, have an interest in clearing \nout dangerous accumulations of brush in our national forests. All of us \nhave an interest as well in protecting the magnificent old growth \nstands and species habitat that Americans cherish, and in upholding our \nenvironmental laws.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to pass a bill as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1353.

A bill to resolve certain conveyances and provide for \nalternative land selections under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct related to Cape Fox Corporation and Sealaska Corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill that \npassed the Senate with bipartisan support in the 107th Congress. This \nlegislation addresses an equity issue for one of Alaska's rural village \ncorporations.\n  Cape Fox Corporation is an Alaskan Village Corporation organized \npursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, by the Native \nVillage of Saxman, near Ketchikan, AK. As with other ANCSA village \ncorporations in Southeast Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting \n23,040 acres under Section 16. However, unlike other village \ncorporations, Cape Fox was further restricted from selecting lands \nwithin 6 miles of the boundary of the home rule city of Ketchikan. All \nother ANCSA corporations were restricted from selecting within 2 miles \nof such a home rule of city.\n  The 6-mile restriction went beyond protecting Ketchikan's watershed \nand damaged Cape Fox by preventing the corporation from selecting \nvaluable timber lands, industrial sites, and other commercial property, \nnot only in its core township, but in surrounding lands far removed \nfrom Ketchikan and its watershed. AS a result of the 6-mile \nrestriction, only the mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core \ntownship, which is nonproductive and of no economic value, was \navailable for selection by the corporation. Cape Fox's land selections \nwere further limited by the fact that the Annette Island Indian \nReservation is within its selection area, and those lands were \nunavailable for ANCSA selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village \ncorporation affected by this restriction.\n  Clearly, Cape Fox was placed on unequal economic footing relative to \nother village corporations in Southeast Alaska. Despite its best \nefforts during the years since ANCSA was signed into law, Cape Fox has \nbeen unable to overcome the disadvantage the law built into its land \nselection opportunities by this inequitable treatment.\n  To address this inequity, I have introduced the Cape Fox Land \nEntitlement Adjustment Act of 2003. This bill will address the Cape Fox \nproblem by providing three interrelated remedies:\n  (1) The obligation of Cape Fox to select and seek conveyance of the \napproximately 160 acres of unusable land in the mountainous northeast \ncorner of Cape Fox's core township will be annulled.\n  (2) Cape Fox will be allowed to select and the Secretary of the \nInterior will be directed to convey 99 acres of timber land adjacent to \nCape Fox's current holdings on Revilla Island.\n  (3) Cape Fox and the Secretary of Agriculture will be authorized to \nenter into an equal value exchange of lands in Southeast Alaska that \nwill be of mutual benefit to the Corporation and the U.S. Forest \nService. Lands conveyed to Cape Fox in this exchange will not be \ntimberlands, but will be associated with a mining property containing \nexisting Federal mining claims, some of which are patented. Lands \nanticipated to be returned to Forest Service ownership will be of \nwildlife habitat, recreation and watershed values and will consolidate \nForest Service holdings in the George Inlet area of Revilla Island.\n  The land exchange provisions of this bill will help rectify the long-\nstanding inequities associated with restrictions placed on Cape Fox in \nANCSA. It will help allow this Native village corporation to make the \ntransition from its major dependence on timber harvest to a more \ndiversified portfolio of income-producing lands.\n  The bill also provides for the resolution of a long-standing land \nownership problem with the Tongass National Forest. The predominant \nprivate landowner in the region, Sealaska Corporation, holds the \nsubsurface estate on several thousand acres of National Forest System \nlands. This split estate poses a management problem which the Forest \nService has long sought to resolve. Efforts to address this issue go \nback more than a decade. Provisions in the Cape Fox Land Entitlement \nAct of 2003 will allow the agency to consolidate its surface and \nsubsurface estate and greatly enhance its management effectiveness and \nefficiency in the Tongass National Forest. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cape Fox Land Entitlement \n     Adjustment Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) Cape Fox Corporation (Cape Fox) is an Alaska Native \n     Village Corporation organized pursuant to the Alaska Native \n     Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) for \n     the Native Village of Saxman.\n       (2) As with other ANCSA village corporations in Southeast \n     Alaska, Cape Fox was limited to selecting 23,040 acres under \n     section 16 of ANCSA.\n       (3) Except for Cape Fox, all other Southeast Alaska ANCSA \n     village corporations were restricted from selecting within \n     two miles of a home rule city.\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\n       (4) To protect the watersheds in the vicinity of Ketchikan, \n     Cape Fox was restricted from selecting lands within six miles \n     from the boundary of the home rule City of Ketchikan under \n     section 22(1) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 1621(1)).\n       (5) The six mile restriction damaged Cape Fox by precluding \n     the corporation from selecting valuable timber lands, \n     industrial sites, and other commercial property, not only in \n     its core township but in surrounding lands far removed from \n     Ketchikan and its watershed.\n       (6) As a result of the 6 mile restriction, only the remote \n     mountainous northeast corner of Cape Fox's core township, \n     which is nonproductive and of no known economic value, was \n     available for selection by the corporation. Selection of this \n     parcel was, however, mandated by section 16(b) of ANCSA (43 \n     U.S.C. 1615(b)).\n       (7) Cape Fox's land selections were further limited by the \n     fact that the Annette Island Indian Reservation is within its \n     selection area, and those lands were unavailable for ANCSA \n     selection. Cape Fox is the only ANCSA village corporation \n     affected by this restriction.\n       (8) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n     land under ANCSA requires adjustment of Sealaska \n     Corporation's (Sealaska) selections and conveyances to avoid \n     creation of additional split estate between National Forest \n     System surface lands and Sealaska subsurface lands.\n       (9) Sealaska is the Alaska native regional corporation for \n     Southeast Alaska, organized under the Alaska Native Claims \n     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).\n       (10) There is an additional need to resolve existing areas \n     of Sealaska/Tongass split estate, in which Sealaska holds \n     title or conveyance rights to several thousand acres of \n     subsurface lands that encumber management of Tongass National \n     Forest surface lands.\n       (11) The Tongass National Forest lands identified in this \n     Act for selection by and conveyance to Cape Fox and Sealaska, \n     subject to valid existing rights, provide a means to resolve \n     some of the Cape Fox and Sealaska ANCSA land entitlement \n     issues without significantly affecting Tongass National \n     Forest resources, uses or values.\n       (12) Adjustment of Cape Fox's selections and conveyances of \n     land under ANCSA through the provisions of this Act, and the \n     related adjustment of Sealaska's selections and conveyances \n     hereunder, are in accordance with the purposes of ANCSA and \n     otherwise in the public interest.\n\n     SEC. 3. WAIVER OF CORE TOWNSHIP REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN \n                   LANDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding the provisions of section 16(b) of ANCSA \n     (43 U.S.C. 1615(b)), Cape Fox shall not be required to select \n     or receive conveyance of approximately 160 acres of Federal \n     unconveyed lands within Section 1, T. 75 S., R. 91 E., C.R.M.\n\n     SEC. 4. SELECTION OUTSIDE EXTERIOR SELECTION BOUNDARY.\n\n       (a) Selection and Conveyance of Surface Estate.--In \n     addition to lands made available for selection under ANCSA, \n     within 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     Cape Fox may select, and, upon receiving written notice of \n     such selection, the Secretary of the Interior shall convey \n     approximately 99 acres of the surface estate of Tongass \n     National Forest lands outside Cape Fox's current exterior \n     selection boundary, specifically that parcel described as \n     follows:\n       (1) T. 73 S., R. 90 E., C.R.M.\n       (2) Section 33: SW portion of SE\\1/4\\: 38 acres.\n       (3) Section 33: NW portion of SE\\1/4\\: 13 acres.\n       (4) Section 33: SE\\1/4\\ of SE\\1/4\\: 40 acres.\n       (5) Section 33: SE\\1/4\\ of SW\\1/4\\: 8 acres.\n       (b) Conveyance of Subsurface Estate.--Upon conveyance to \n     Cape Fox of the surface estate to the lands identified in \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior shall convey to \n     Sealaska the subsurface estate to the lands.\n       (c) Timing.--The Secretary of the Interior shall complete \n     the interim conveyances to Cape Fox and Sealaska under this \n     section within 180 days after the Secretary of the Interior \n     receives notice of the Cape Fox selection under subsection \n     (a).\n\n     SEC. 5. EXCHANGE OF LANDS BETWEEN CAPE FOX AND THE TONGASS \n                   NATIONAL FOREST.\n\n       (a) General.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall offer, and \n     if accepted by Cape Fox, shall exchange the Federal lands \n     described in subsection (b) for lands and interests therein \n     identified by Cape Fox under subsection (c) and, to the \n     extent necessary, lands and interests therein identified \n     under subsection (d).\n       (b) Lands To Be Exchanged to Cape Fox.--The lands to be \n     offered for exchange by the Secretary of Agriculture are \n     Tongass National Forest lands comprising approximately \n     2,663.9 acres in T. 36 S., R. 62 E., C.R.M. and T. 35 S., R. \n     62 E., C.R.M., as designated upon a map entitled ``Proposed \n     Kensington Project Land Exchange'', dated March 18, 2002, and \n     available for inspection in the Forest Service Region 10 \n     regional office in Juneau, Alaska.\n       (c) Lands To Be Exchanged to the United States.--Cape Fox \n     shall be entitled, within 60 days after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, to identify in writing to the Secretaries of \n     Agriculture and the Interior the lands and interests in lands \n     that Cape Fox proposes to exchange for the Federal lands \n     described in subsection (b). The lands and interests in lands \n     shall be identified from lands previously conveyed to Cape \n     Fox comprising approximately 2,900 acres and designated as \n     parcels A-1 to A-3, B-1 to B-3, and C upon a map entitled \n     ``Cape Fox Corporation ANCSA Land Exchange Proposal'', dated \n     March 15, 2002, and available for inspection in the Forest \n     Service Region 10 regional office in Juneau, Alaska. Lands \n     identified for exchange within each parcel shall be \n     contiguous to adjacent National Forest System lands and in \n     reasonably compact tracts. The lands identified for exchange \n     shall include a public trail easement designated as D on said \n     map, unless the Secretary of Agriculture agrees otherwise. \n     The value of the easement shall be included in determining \n     the total value of lands exchanged to the United States.\n       (d) Valuation of Exchange Lands.--The Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall determine whether the lands identified by \n     Cape Fox under subsection (c) are equal in value to the lands \n     described in subsection (b). If the lands identified under \n     subsection (c) are determined to have insufficient value to \n     equal the value of the lands described in subsection (b), \n     Cape Fox and the Secretary shall mutually identify additional \n     Cape Fox lands for exchange sufficient to equalize the value \n     of lands conveyed to Cape Fox.

A bill to amend chapter 23 of title 5, United States Code, \nto clarify the disclosure of information protected from prohibited \npersonnel practices, require a statement in non-disclosure policies, \nforms, and agreements that such policies, forms, and agreements conform \nwith certain disclosure protections, provide certain authority for the \nSpecial Council, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Federal \nEmployee Protection of Disclosures Act. I offered legislation under \nthis title earlier this month. I am modifying that measure, S. 1229, by \nintroducing a new bill today which is cosponsored by Senators Grassley, \nLevin, Leahy, and Durbin. This bill, as with S. 1229, amends the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, WPA. These amendments are necessary to \nsafeguard Federal employees from retaliation and protect American \ntaxpayers from government waste, fraud, and abuse. Our bill follows S. \n995 and S. 3070, the latter of which was favorably reported by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee in the 107th Congress. The bill we \nintroduce today is the result of a bipartisan compromise to protect our \nfederal whistleblowers.\n  Our bill would codify the repeated and unequivocal statements of \ncongressional intent that Federal employees are to be protected when \nmaking ``any disclosure'' evidencing violations of law, gross \nmismanagement, or a gross waste of funds. The bill would also clarify \nthe test that must be met to prove that a Federal employee reasonably \nbelieved that his or her disclosure was evidence of wrongdoing. The \nclear language of the WPA says that an employee is protected for \ndisclosing information he or she reasonably believes evidences a \nviolation. However, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which has \nsole jurisdiction over whistleblower cases, ruled in 1999 that the \nreasonableness review must begin with the presumption that public \nofficers perform their duties in good faith and that this presumption \nstands unless there is ``irrefragable proof'' to the contrary. As \nirrefragable means impossible to refute, our bill replaces this \nexcessively high burden with the more reasonable standard of \nsubstantial evidence.\n  The measure would also provide independent litigating authority to \nthe Office of Special Counsel, OSC. Under current law, OSC has no \nauthority to request the Merit Systems Protection Board, MSPB, to \nreconsider its decision or to seek review of a MSPB decision by the \nFederal Circuit. The limitation undermines both OSC's ability to \nprotect whistleblowers and the integrity of the WPA. As such, our bill \nwould provide OSC authority to appear in any civil action brought in \nconnection with the WPA and obtain review of any MSPB order where OSC \ndetermines MSPB erred and the case will impact the enforcement of the \nWPA.\n  Our bill would codify an ``anti-gag'' provision that Congress has \npassed annually since 1988 as part of the appropriations process. The \nyearly appropriations language bars agencies from implementing or \nenforcing any nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement that does not \ncontain specified language preserving open government statutes. In \naddition, the bill would make it a prohibited personnel practice to \nenforce a non-disclosure agreement that does not comply with open \ngovernment statutes.\n  Enactment of the Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act will \nstrengthen the rights and protections afforded to federal \nwhistleblowers and encourage the disclosure of information vital to an \neffective government. Following the events of September 11, we realized \nthat whistleblowing is even more important when our national security \nis at stake. In many instances, the security of our Nation depends upon \nthose who step forward to blow the whistle on significant lapses in our \nefforts to protect the United States against potential terrorist \nattacks. Congress should act quickly to assure whistleblowers that \ndisclosing illegal activities and mismanagement within their agencies \nwill not be met with retaliation. I urge my colleagues to join with me \nin protecting our federal whistleblowers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1358\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Akaka, \nGrassley, Leahy, and Durbin today in introducing the Federal Employees \nProtection of Disclosures Act. Our bill strengthens the law protecting \nemployees who blow the whistle on fraud, waste, and abuse in federal \nprograms.\n  Whistleblowers play a crucial role in ensuring that Congress and the \npublic are aware of serious cases of waste, fraud, and mismanagement in \ngovernment. Whistleblowing is never more important than when our \nnational security is at stake. Since the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001, courageous individuals have stepped forward to blow the \nwhistle on significant lapses in our efforts to protect the United \nStates against potential future attacks. Most notably, FBI Agent Coleen \nRowley alerted Congress to serious institutional problems at the FBI \nand their impact on the agency's ability to effectively investigate and \nprevent terrorism.\n  In another example, two Border Patrol agents from my State of \nMichigan, Mark Hall and Bob Lindemann, risked their careers when they \nblew the whistle on Border Patrol and INS policies that were \ncompromising security on\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nthe Northern Border. Their disclosure led to my holding a hearing at \nthe Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in November 2001, that \nexposed serious deficiencies in the way Border Patrol and INS were \ndealing with aliens who were arrested while trying to enter the country \nillegally. Since the hearing, some of the most troublesome policies \nhave been changed, improving the security situation and validating the \ntwo agents' concerns. Despite the fact that their concerns proved to be \ndead on, shortly after they blew the whistle, disciplinary action was \nproposed against the two agents. Fortunately in this case, \nwhistleblower protections worked. The Office of Special Counsel \nconducted an investigation and the decision to discipline the agents \nwas reversed. However, that disciplinary an action was proposed in the \nfirst place is a troubling reminder of how important it is for us to \nboth strengthen protections for whistleblowers and empower the Office \nof Special Counsel to discipline managers who seek to muzzle employees.\n  Agent Rowley, Mark Hall and Bob Lindermann are simply the latest in a \nlong line of Federal employees who have taken great personal risks in \nblowing the whistle on government waste, fraud, and mismanagement. \nCongress has long recognized the obligation we have to protect a \nFederal employee when he or she discloses evidence of wrongdoing in a \nFederal program. If an employee reasonably believes that a fraud or \nmismanagement is occurring, and that employee has the courage and the \nsense of responsibility to make that fraud or mismanagement known, it \nis our duty to protect the employee from any reprisal. We want Federal \nemployees to identify problems so we can fix them, and if they fear \nreprisal for doing so, then we are not only failing to protect the \nwhistleblower, but we are also failing to protect the taxpayer.\n  I sponsored the Whistleblower Protection Act in 1989 which \nstrengthened and clarified whistleblower rights, as well as the bill \npassed by Congress to strengthen the law further in 1994. \nUnfortunately, however, repeated holdings by the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Federal Circuit have corrupted the intent of Congress, \nwith the result that additional clarifying language is sorely needed. \nThe case of LaChance versus White represents perhaps the most notable \nexample of the Federal Circuit's misinterpretation of the whistleblower \nlaw.\n  In LaChance, decided on May 14, 1999, the court imposed an unfounded \nand virtually unattainable standard on Federal employee whistleblowers \nin proving their cases. In that case, John E. White was an education \nspecialist for the Air Force who spoke out against a new educational \nsystem that purported to mandate quality standards for schools \ncontracting with the Air Force bases. White criticized the new system \nas counterproductive because it was too burdensome and seriously \nreduced the education opportunities available on base. After making \nthese criticisms, local agency officials reassigned White, relieving \nhim of his duties and allegedly isolating him. However, after an \nindependent management review supported White's concerns, the Air Force \ncanceled the program White had criticized. White appealed the \nreassignment in 1992 and the case has been in litigation ever since.\n  The administrative judge initially dismissed White's case, finding \nthat his disclosures were not protected by the Whistleblower Protection \nAct. The MSPB, however, reversed the administrative judge's decision \nand remanded the case back to the administrative judge, holding that \nsince White disclosed information he reasonably believed evidenced \ngross mismanagement, this disclosure was protected under the Act. On \nremand, the administrative judge found that the Air Force had violated \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act and ordered the Air Force to return \nWhite to his prior status; the MSPB affirmed the decision of the \nadministrative judge. OPM petitioned the Federal Circuit for a review \nof the board's decision. The Federal Circuit subsequently reversed the \nMSPB's decision, holding that there was not adequate evidence to \nsupport a violation under the Whistleblower Protection Act. The Federal \nCircuit held that the evidence that White was a specialist on the \nsubject at issue and aware of the alleged improper activities and that \nhis belief was shared by other employees was not sufficient to meet the \n``reasonable belief'' test in the law. The court held that ``the board \nmust look for evidence that it was reasonable to believe that the \ndisclosures revealed misbehavior'' by the Air Force. The court went on \nto say: ``In this case, review of the Air Force's policy and \nimplementation via the QES standards might well show them to be \nentirely appropriate, even if not the best option. Indeed, this review \nwould start out with a presumption that public officers perform their \nduties correctly, fairly, in good faith, and in accordance with the law \nand governing regulations. * * * And this presumption stands unless \nthere is `irrefragable proof to the contrary'.''\n  It was appropriate for the Federal Circuit to remand the case to the \nMSPB to have it reconsider whether it was reasonable for White to \nbelieve that what the Air Force did in this case involved gross \nmismanagement. However, the Federal Circuit went on to impose a clearly \nerroneous and excessive standard for him to demonstrate his \n``reasonable belief''--requiring him to provide ``irrefragable'' proof \nthat the Air Force had engaged in gross mismanagement.\n  Irrefragable means ``undeniable, incontestable, incontrovertible, \nincapable of being overthrown.'' How can a Federal employee meet a \nstandard of ``irrefragable'' in proving gross mismanagement? It is \nvirtually impossible standard of proof to meet. Moreover, there is \nnothing in the law or legislative history that even suggests such a \nstandard applies to the Whistleblower Protection Act. The intent of the \nlaw is not for a federal employee to act as an investigator and compile \n``irrefragable'' proof that the Federal Government, in fact, committed \nfraud, waste or abuse. Rather, under the clear language of the statute, \nthe employee needs only to have ``a reasonable belief'' that there is \nfraud, waste or abuse occurring in order to make a protected \ndisclosure.\n  LaChance is only one example of the Federal Circuit misinterpreting \nthe law. Our bill corrects LaChance and as well as several other \nFederal Circuit holdings. In addition, the bill strengthens the Office \nof Special Counsel and creates additional protections for federal \nemployees who are retaliated against for blowing the whistle.\n  One of the most important issues addressed in the bill is to clarify \nagain that the law is intended to protect a broad range of \nwhistleblower disclosures. The legislative history supporting the 1994 \nWhistleblower Protection Act amendments emphasized: ``[I]t also is not \npossible to further clarify the clear language in section 2302(b)(8) \nthat protection for `any' whistleblowing disclosure truly means `any'. \nA protected disclosure may be made as part of an employee's job duties, \nmay concern policy or individual misconduct, and may be oral or written \nand to any audience inside or outside the agency, without restriction \nto time, place, motive or content.''\n  Despite this clear Congressional intent that was clearly articulated \nin 1994, the Federal Circuit has acted to push a number of \nwhistleblower disclosures outside the protections of the whistleblower \nlaw. For example, in Horton versus the Department of the Navy, the \nFederal Circuit ruled that a whistleblower's disclosures to co-workers, \nor to the wrong-doer, or to a court ruled that a whistleblower's \ndisclosures to official in the agency chain of command or those made in \nthe course of normal job duties were not protected. In Huffman versus \nOffice of Personnel Management, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed Horton \nand Willis. And in Meuwissen versus Department of Interior, the Federal \nCircuit held that a whistleblower's disclosures of previously known \ninformation do not qualify as ``disclosures'' under the WPA. All of \nthese rulings violate clear Congressional intent to afford broad \nprotection to whistleblower disclosures.\n  In order to make it clear that any lawful disclosure that an employee \nor job applicant reasonably believes is evidence of waste, fraud, \nabuse, or gross mismanagement is covered by the WPA, the bill codifies \nprevious statements of Congressional intent. Using the 1994 legislative \nhistory, it amends the whistleblower statute to\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\ncover any disclosure of information without restriction to time, place, \nform, motive or context, or prior disclosure made to any person by an \nemployee or applicant, including a disclosure made in the ordinary \ncourse of an employee's duties that the employee or applicant \nreasonably believes is credible evidence of any violation of any law, \nrule, or regulation, or other misconduct specified in the whistleblower \nlaw. I want to emphasize here that, other than the explicitly listed \nexceptions identified in the statute, we intend for there to be no \nexceptions, inferred or otherwise, as to what is a protected \ndisclosure. And the prohibition on inferred exceptions is intended to \napply to all protected speech categories in section 2302(b)(8) of the \nlaw. The intent here, again, is to make it clear that when the WPA \nspeaks of protecting disclosures by Federal employees ``any'' means \n``any.''\n  The bill also addresses the clearly erroneous standard established by \nthe Federal Circuit's LaChance decision I mentioned earlier. Rather \nthan needing ``irrefragable proof'' to overcome the presumption that a \npublic officer performed his or her duties correctly, fairly, in good \nfaith, and in accordance with the law and regulations, the bill makes \nit clear that the whistleblower can rebut this presumption with \n``substantial evidence.'' This burden of proof is a far more reasonable \nand appropriate standard for whistleblowing cases.\n  The Federal Circuit's repeated misinterpretations of the \nwhistleblower law are unacceptable and demand Congressional action. In \nresponse to the court's inexplicable and inappropriate rulings, our \nbill would suspend for five years the Federal Circuit's exclusive \njurisdiction over whistleblower appeals. It would instead allow a \nwhistleblower to file a petition to review a final order or final \ndecision of the MSPB in the Federal Circuit or in any other United \nStates appellate court of competent jurisdiction and defined under 5 \nU.S.C. 7703(b)(2). In most cases, using another court would mean going \nto the federal circuit where the contested personnel action took place. \nThis five year period would allow Congress to evaluate whether other \nappellate courts would issue whistleblower decisions which are \nconsistent with the Federal Circuit's interpretation of WPA protections \nand guide Congressional efforts to clarify the law if necessary.\n  In addition to addressing jurisdictional issues and troublesome \nFederal Circuit precedents, our bill would also make important \nadditions to the list of protected disclosures. First, it would subject \ncertain disclosures of classified information to whistleblower \nprotections. However, in order for a disclosure of classified \ninformation to be protected, the employee would have to possess a \nreasonable belief that the disclosure was direct and specific evidence \nof a violation of law, rule or regulation, gross mismanagement, a gross \nwaste of funds, an abuse of authority, a substantial and specified \ndanger to public health or safety, or a false statement to Congress on \nan issue of material fact. A whistleblower must also limit the \ndisclosure to a member of Congress or staff of the executive or \nlegislative branch holding the appropriate security clearance and \nauthorized to receive the information disclosed. Federal agencies \ncovered by the WPA would be required to establish a process to provide \nconfidential advice to employees on how to lawfully make a protected \ndisclosure of classified information to Congress.\n\n  Current law permits Federal employees to file a case at the MSPB when \nthey feel that a manager has taken a personnel action against them in \nretaliation for blowing the whistle. The legislation would add three \nnew personnel actions to the list of adverse actions that cannot be \ntaken against whistleblowers for engaging in protected activity. These \nactions would include enforcement of any nondisclosure policy, form or \nagreement against a whistleblower for making a protected disclosure; \nthe suspension, revocation, or other determination relating to a \nwhistleblower's security clearance; and an investigation of an employee \nor applicant for employment if taken due to their participation in \nwhistleblowing activity.\n  It is important to note that, if it is demonstrated that a security \nclearance was suspended or revoked in retaliation for whistleblowing, \nthe legislation limits the relief that the MSPB and reviewing court can \norder. The bill specifies that the MSPB or reviewing court may issue \ndeclaratory and other appropriate relief but may not direct a security \nclearance to be restored. Appropriate relief may include back pay, an \norder to reassign the employee, attorney fees, or any other relief the \nBoard or court is authorized to provide for other prohibited personnel \npractices. In addition, if the Board finds an action on a security \nclearance to have been illegal, it may bar the agency from directly or \nindirectly taking any other personnel action based on that illegal \nsecurity clearance action. Our legislation would also require the \nagency to review and provide a report to Congress detailing the \ncircumstances of the agency's security clearance decision, and \nauthorizes expedited MSPB review of whistleblower cases where a \nsecurity clearance was revoked or suspended. The latter is important \nbecause a person whose clearance has been suspended or revoked and \nwhose job responsibilities require clearance may be unable to work \nwhile their case is being considered.\n  Our bill would also add two prohibited personnel practices of the \nwhistleblower law. First, it would codify the ``anti-gag'' provision \nthat has been in force since 1988, by virture of its inclusion in \nappropriations bills. Second, it would prohibit a manager from \ninitiating an investigation of an employee or applicant for employment \nbecause they engage in a protected activity, including whistleblowing.\n  Another issue addressed in the bill involves certain employees who \nare excluded from the WPA. Among these are employees who hold \n``confidential policy-making positions.'' In 1994, Congress amended the \nWPA to keep agencies from designating employees confidential \npolicymakers after the employees filed whistleblower complaints. The \nWPA also allows the President to exclude from WPA jurisdiction any \nagency whose principal function is the conduct of foreign intelligence \nor counterintelligence activities. Our legislation maintains this \nauthority but makes it clear that a decision to exclude an agency from \nWPA protections must also be made prior to a personnel action being \ntaken against a whistleblower from that agency. This provision is \nnecessary to ensure that agencies cannot argue that employees are \nexempt from whistleblower protections after an employee files a claim \nthat they were retaliated against.\n  Another key section of the bill would strengthen the Office of \nSpecial Counsel. OSC is the independent federal agency responsible for \ninvestigating and prosecuting federal employee complaints of \nwhistleblower retaliation. Current law, however, limits OSC's ability \nto effectively enforce and defend whistleblower laws. For example, the \nlaw provides the OSC with no authority to request the Merit Systems \nProtection Board to reconsider one of its decisions or to seek \nappellate review of an MSPB decision. Even when another party petitions \nfor a review of a MSPB decision, OSC is typically denied the right to \nparticipate in the proceedings.\n  Our bill would provide explicit authority for the Office of Special \nCounsel to appear in any civil action brought in connection with the \nwhistleblower law. In addition, it would authorize OSC to obtain \ncircuit court review of any MSPB order in a whistleblowing case if the \nOSC determines the Board erred and the case would have a substantial \nimpact on the enforcement of the whisltleblower statute. In a letter to \nme addressing these provisions, special Counsel Elaine Kaplan said, ``I \nbelieve that these changes are necessary, not only to ensure OSC's \neffectiveness, but to address continuing concerns about the whittling \naway of the WPA's protections by narrow judicial interpretations of the \nlaw.'' I ask unanimous consent that the OSC letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               U.S. Office of Special Counsel,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for giving me the opportunity \n     to comment on the proposed Title VI of H.R. 5005, concerning\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\n     the protection of federal employee whistleblowers.\n       As the head of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), \n     the independent federal agency that is responsible for \n     investigating and prosecuting federal employees' complaints \n     of whistleblower retaliation, I share your recognition that \n     is crucial to ensure that the laws protecting whistleblowers \n     are strong and effective. Federal employees are often in the \n     best position to observe and identify official misconduct or \n     malfeasance as well as dangers to the public health and \n     safety, and the national security.\n       Now, perhaps more than ever before, our national interest \n     demands that federal workers feel safe to come forward to \n     bring appropriate attention to these conditions so that they \n     may be corrected. Further, and again more than ever, the \n     public now needs assurance that the workforce which is \n     carrying out crucial operations is alert, and that its \n     leaders welcome and encourage their constructive \n     participation in making the government a highly efficient and \n     effective steward of the public interest.\n       To these ends, Title VI contains a number of provisions \n     that will strengthen the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) \n     and close loopholes in the Act's coverage. The amendment \n     would reverse the effects of several judicial decisions that \n     have imposed unduly narrow and restrictive tests for \n     determining whether employees qualify for the protection of \n     the WPA. These decisions, among other things, have held that \n     employees are not protected against retaliation when they \n     make their disclosures in the line of duty or when they \n     confront subject officials with their suspicions of \n     wrongdoing. They have also made it more difficult for \n     whistleblowers to secure the Act's protection by interposing \n     what the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has called \n     an ``irrefragable'' presumption that government officials \n     perform their duties lawfully and in good faith.\n       In addition to reversing these rulings, Title VI would \n     grant the Special Counsel independent litigating authority \n     and the right to request judicial review of decisions of the \n     Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) in cases that will have \n     a substantial impact upon the enforcement of the WPA. I \n     firmly believe that these changes are necessary, not only to \n     ensure OSC's effectiveness, but to address continuing \n     concerns about the whittling away of the WPA's protections \n     by narrow judicial interpretations of the law. The changes \n     would ensure that OSC, the government agency charged with \n     protecting whistleblowers, will have a meaningful \n     opportunity to participate in the shaping of the law.\n       Further, Title VI would strengthen OSC's capacity to use \n     its disciplinary action authority to deter agency \n     supervisors, managers, and other officials from engaging in \n     retaliation, and to punish those who do so. The amendment \n     does this in two ways. First, it clarifies the burden of \n     proof in disciplinary action cases that OSC brings by \n     employing the test first set forth by the Supreme Court in \n     Mt. Healthy School District v. Board of Education. Under this \n     test, in order to secure discipline of an agency official \n     accused of engaging in whistleblower retaliation, OSC would \n     have to show that protected whistleblowing was a \n     ``significant, motivating factor'' in the decision to take or \n     threaten to take a personnel action. If OSC made such a \n     showing, the MSPB would order appropriate discipline unless \n     the official showed, by preponderant evidence, that he or she \n     would have taken or threatened to take the same action even \n     had there been no protected activity.\n       This change is necessary in order to ensure that the burden \n     of proof in these cases is not so onerous as to make it \n     virtually impossible to secure discipline against \n     retaliators. Under current law, OSC bears the unprecedented \n     burden of demonstrating that protected activity was the but-\n     for cause of an adverse personnel action against a \n     whistleblower. The amendment would correct the imbalance by \n     imposing the well-established Mt. Healthy test in these \n     cases.\n       In addition, the bill would relieve OSC of attorney fee \n     liability in disciplinary action cases in which it ultimately \n     does not prevail. The amendment would shift liability for \n     fees to the manager's employing agency, where an award of \n     fees would be in the interest of justice. The employing \n     agency would indemnify the manager for these costs which \n     would have been incurred by him in the course of performing \n     his official duties.\n       Under current law, if OSC ultimately does not prevail in a \n     case it brings against a manager whom our investigation shows \n     has engaged in retaliation, then we must pay attorney fees, \n     even if our prosecution decision was an entirely reasonable \n     one. For a small agency like OSC, with a limited budget, the \n     specter of having to pay large attorney fee awards simply \n     because we do not ultimately prevail in a case, is a \n     significant obstacle to our ability to use this important \n     authority to hold managers accountable. It is, moreover, an \n     unprecedented burden; virtually all fee shifting provisions \n     which could result in an award of fees against a government \n     agency, depend upon a showing that the government agency has \n     acted unreasonably or in bad faith.\n       In addition to these provisions, the bill would also \n     provide that for a period of five years, beginning on \n     February 1, 2003, there would be multi-circuit review of \n     decisions of the MSPB, just as there is now multi-circuit \n     review of decisions of the MSPB's sister agency, the \n     Federal Labor Relations Authority. This experiment will \n     give Congress the opportunity to judge whether providing \n     broader perspectives of all of the nation's courts of \n     appeals will enhance the development of the law under the \n     WPA.\n       There are several other provisions of the amendments that \n     would strengthen the Act's coverage and remedies. The \n     amendments, for example, would extend coverage of the WPA to \n     circumstances in which an agency initiated an investigation \n     of an employee or applicant in reprisal for whistleblowing or \n     where an agency implemented an illegal non-disclosure form or \n     policy. The amendments also would authorize an award of \n     compensatory damages in federal employee whistleblower cases. \n     Such awards are authorized for federal employees under the \n     civil rights acts, and for environmental and nuclear \n     whistleblowers, among others, under other federal statutes. \n     Given the important public policies underlying the WPA, it \n     seems appropriate that the same sort of make whole relief \n     should be available to federal employee whistleblowers.\n       Finally, Title VI contains a provision that would provide \n     relief to employees who allege that their security clearances \n     were denied or revoked because of protected whistleblowing, \n     without interfering with the longstanding authority of the \n     President to make security clearance determinations. The \n     amendment would allow employees to file OSC complaints \n     alleging they suffered a retaliatory adverse security \n     clearance determination. OSC would be given the authority to \n     investigate such complaints and the MSPB would have the \n     authority to issue declaratory and appropriate relief other \n     than ordering the restoration of the clearance. Further, \n     where the Board found retaliation, the employing agency would \n     be required to conduct its own investigation of the \n     revocation and report back to Congress.\n       This amendment provides a balance resolution of the tension \n     between protecting national security whistleblowers against \n     retaliation and maintaining the President's traditional \n     prerogative to decide who will have access to classified \n     information. Especially in light of the current heightened \n     concerns about issues of national security, this change in \n     the law is clearly warranted.\n       Thank you again for providing me with an opportunity to \n     comment on these amendments, and for your continuing interest \n     in the work of the Office of Special Counsel.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Elaine Kaplan.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. OSC currently has the authority to pursue disciplinary \naction against managers who retaliate against whistleblowers. However, \nFederal Circuit decisions, like LaChance, have undermined the agency's \nability to successfully pursue such cases. The Special Counsel has said \nthat ``change is necessary in order to ensure that the burden of proof \nin these cases is not so onerous as to make it virtually impossible to \nsecure disciplinary action against retaliators.'' In addition to it \nbeing difficult to win, if the OSC loses a disciplinary case, it has to \npay the legal fees of those against whom OSC initiates disciplinary \naction. In its letter, OSC said that ``the specter of having to pay \nlarge attorney fee awards . . . is a significant obstacle to our \nability to use this important authority to hold managers accountable.'' \nOur bill addresses these problems by establishing a reasonable burden \nof proof for disciplinary actions and requiring the employing agency, \nnot the OSC, to reimburse the prevailing party for attorney fees in a \ndisciplinary proceeding.\n  Finally, the bill addresses a new issue that has arisen in connection \nwith the recent enactment of the Homeland Security Act or HSA. To \nevaluate the vulnerability to terrorist attack of certain critical \ninfrastructure such as chemical plants, computer networks and other key \nfacilities, the HSA asks private companies that own these facilities to \nsubmit unclassified information about them to the government. In doing \nso, the law also created some ambiguity on the question of whether \nFederal employee whistleblowers would be protected by the WPA if they \nshould disclose information that has been independently obtained by the \nwhistleblower about such facilities but which may also have been \ndisclosed to the government under the critical infrastructure \ninformation program.\n  While I believe it was Congress's intent to extend whistleblower \nprotections to Federal employees who disclose such independently \nobtained information, the law's ambiguities are troublesome in the \ncontext of the tendency of the Federal Circuit to narrowly construe the \nscope of protections afforded by the WPA. Our bill would thus clarify \nthat whistleblower protections do extend to Federal employees who \ndisclose independently obtained information that may also have been \ndisclosed to the government as part of the\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\ncritical infrastructure information program\n  We need to encourage Federal employees to blow the whistle on waste, \nfraud and abuse in Federal Government agencies and programs. These \npeople take great risks and often face enormous obstacles in doing what \nthey believe is right. The Congress and the country owe a particular \ndebt of gratitude to those whistleblowers who put their careers on the \nline to protect national security. Since September 11, 2001, we have \nseen a number of examples of how crucial people like Coleen Rowley, \nMark Hall and Bob Lindermann are to keeping our country safe. I request \nunanimous consent that a letter from Agent Rowley be printed in the \nRecord. In the letter she says that when she blew the whistle, she was \nlucky enough to garner the support of many of her colleagues and \nmembers of Congress. However, her letter warns that for every Coleen \nRowley, ``there are many more who do not benefit from the relative \nsafety of public notoriety.'' It is to protect those responsible, \ncourageous many that we offer this legislation. We need more like them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a section-by-section \nexplanation of the bill.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                September 2, 2002.\n       Dear Senators: I have proudly served in federal law \n     enforcement for over 21 years. Prior to my personal \n     involvement in a specific matter, I did not fully appreciate \n     the strong disincentives that sometimes keep government \n     employees from exposing waste, fraud, abuse, or other \n     failures they witness on the job. Nor did I appreciate the \n     strong incentives that do exist for agencies to avoid \n     institutional embarrassment.\n       The decision to step forward with information that exposed \n     my agency to scrutiny was one of the most difficult of my \n     career. I did not come to it quickly or lightly. I first \n     attempted to warn my superiors through regular channels. Only \n     after those warnings failed to bring about the necessary \n     response and congressional inquiry was initiated, did I go \n     outside the agency with my concerns. I had no intention or \n     desire to be in the public spotlight, so I did not go to the \n     news media. I provided the information to Members of Congress \n     with oversight responsibility. I felt compelled to do so \n     because my responsibility is to the American people, not to a \n     government agency.\n       Unfortunately, the cloak of secrecy which is necessary for \n     the effective operation of government agencies involved in \n     national security and criminal investigations fosters an \n     environment where the incentives to avoid embarrassment and \n     the disincentives to step forward combine. When that happens, \n     the public loses. We need laws that strike a better balance, \n     that are able to protect effective government operation \n     without sacrificing accountability to the public. I was lucky \n     enough to garner a good deal of support from my colleagues in \n     the Minneapolis office and Members of Congress. But for every \n     one like me, there are many more who do not benefit from the \n     relative safety of public notoriety. They need credible, \n     functioning rights and remedies to retain the freedom to \n     warn.\n       I also need to state that I write this letter in my \n     personal capacity, and that it reflects my personal views \n     only, not those of the government agency for which I work.\n       Thank you for your consideration,\n                                                    Coleen Rowley.\n\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Section-by-Section Analysis of the Federal Employee Protection of \n                            Disclosures Act\n\n       The Federal Employee Protection of Disclosures Act would \n     strengthen protections for Federal employees who blow the \n     whistle on waste, fraud and abuse in the Federal Government.\n       Protected Whistleblower Disclosures--To correct court \n     decisions improperly limiting the disclosures protected by \n     the Whistleblower Protection Act, WPA, section (b) of the \n     bill would clarify Congressional intent that the law covers \n     ``any'' whistleblowing disclosure, whether that disclosure is \n     made as part of an employee's job duties, concerns policy or \n     individual misconduct, is oral or written, or is made to any \n     audience inside or outside an agency, and without restriction \n     to time, place, motive or context. This section would also \n     protect certain disclosures of classified information to \n     Congress when the disclosure is to a Member or legislative \n     staff holding an appropriate security clearance and \n     authorized to receive the type of information disclosed.\n       Informal Disclosures.--Section (c) would clarify the \n     definition of ``disclosure'' to include a formal or informal \n     communication or transmission.\n       Irrefragable Proof.--In LaChance v. White, the U.S. Court \n     of Appeals for the Federal Circuit imposed an erroneous \n     standard for determining when an employee makes a protected \n     disclosure under the WPA. Under the clear language of the \n     statute, an employee need only have a reasonable belief that \n     he or she is providing evidence of fraud, waste or abuse to \n     make a protected disclosure. But the court ruled that an \n     employee had to have ``irrefragable proof''--meaning \n     undeniable and incontestable proof--to overcome the \n     presumption that a public officer is performing their duties \n     in accordance with law. Section (d) would replace this \n     unreasonable standard of proof by providing that a \n     whistleblower can rebut the presumption with ``substantial \n     evidence.''\n       Prohibited Personnel Actions.--Section (e)(1) would add \n     three actions to the list of prohibited personnel actions \n     that may not be taken against whistleblowers for protected \n     disclosures: enforcement of a nondisclosure policy, form or \n     agreement; suspension, revocation, or other determination \n     relating to an employee's security clearance; and \n     investigation of an employee or applicant for employment due \n     to protected whistleblowing activities.\n       Nondisclosure Actions Against Whistleblowers.--Section \n     (e)(2) would bar agencies from implementing or enforcing \n     against whistleblowers any nondisclosure policy, form or \n     agreement that fails to contain specified language preserving \n     the right of federal employees to disclose certain protected \n     information. It would also prohibit a manager from initiating \n     an investigation of an employee or applicant for employment \n     because they engaged in protected activity.\n       Retaliations Involving Security Clearances.--Section (e)(3) \n     would make it a prohibited personnel practice for a manager \n     to suspend, revoke or take other action with respect to an \n     employee's security clearance in retaliation for \n     whistleblowing. This section would also authorize the Merit \n     Systems Protection Board, MSPB, to conduct an expedited \n     review of such matters and issue declaratory and other \n     appropriate relief, but would not empower MSPB to restore a \n     security clearance. If MSPB or a reviewing court were to find \n     that a security clearance decision was retaliatory, the \n     agency involved would be required to review its security \n     clearance decision and issue a report to Congress explaining \n     it.\n       Exclusions From WPA.--Current law allows the President to \n     exclude certain employees and agencies from the WPA if they \n     perform certain intelligence related or policy making \n     functions. In 1994, Congress amended the WPA to stop agencies \n     from removing employees from WPA coverage after the employees \n     filed whistleblower complaints. Section (f) would also \n     require that removal of an agency from the WPA be made prior \n     to a personnel action being taken against a whistleblower at \n     that agency.\n       Attorney Fees.--The Office of Special Counsel, OSC, has \n     authority to pursue disciplinary action against managers who \n     retaliate against whistleblowers. Currently, if OSC loses a \n     disciplinary case, it must pay the legal fees of those \n     against whom it initiated the action. Because the amounts \n     involved could significantly deplete OSC's limited resources, \n     section (g) would require the employing agency, rather than \n     OSC, to reimburse the manager's attorney fees.\n       Burden of Proof in Disciplinary Actions.--Currently, when \n     OSC pursues disciplinary action against managers who \n     retaliate against whistleblowers, OSC must demonstrate that \n     an adverse personnel action would not have occurred ``but \n     for'' the whistleblower's protected activity. Section (i) \n     would establish a more reasonable burden of proof by \n     requiring OSC to demonstrate that the whistleblower's \n     protected disclosure was a ``significant motivating factor'' \n     in the decision by the manager to take the adverse action, \n     even if other factors also motivated the decision. This \n     standard would be equivalent of the Mt. Healthy standard.\n       Disclosures to Congress.--Section (j) would require \n     agencies to establish a process to provide confidential \n     advice to employees on how to lawfully make a protected \n     disclosure of classified information to Congress.\n       Authority of Special Counsel.--Under current law, OSC has \n     no authority to request MSPB to reconsider a decision or seek \n     appellate review of a MSPB decision. This limitation \n     undermines OSC's ability to protect whistleblowers and \n     integrity of the WPA. Section k would authorize OSC to appear \n     in any civil action brought in connection with the WPA and \n     request appellate review of any MSPB order where OSC \n     determines MSPB erred and the case would have a substantial \n     impact on WPA enforcement.\n       Judicial Review.--In 1982, Congress replaced normal \n     Administrative Procedures Act appellate review of MSPB \n     decisions with exclusive jurisdiction in the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit. While the 1989 WPA and its \n     1994 amendments strengthened and clarified whistleblower \n     protections, Federal Circuit holdings have repeatedly \n     misinterpreted key provisions of the law. Subject to a five \n     year sunset , section (l) would suspend the Federal Circuit's \n     exclusive jurisdiction over whistleblower appeals and allow \n     petitions for review to be filed either in the Federal \n     Circuit or any other federal circuit court of competent \n     jurisdiction.\n       Nondisclosure Restrictions on Whistleblowers.--Section (m) \n     would require all federal nondisclosure policies, forms and \n     agreements to contain specified language preserving the right \n     of federal employees to disclose certain protected \n     information. This section would codify the so-called anti-gag \n     provision that has been included in federal appropriations \n     bills since 1988.\n       Critical Infrastructure Information.--Section (n) would \n     clarify that section 214(c) of\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\n     the Homeland Security Act, HSA, maintains existing WPA rights \n     for independently obtained information that may also qualify \n     as critical infrastructure information under the HSA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1359. A bill to allow credit unions to provide international money \ntransfer services and to require disclosures in connection with \ninternational money transfers from all money transmitting service \nproviders; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the International \nRemittances Services Enhancement and Protection Act of 2003.\n  Remittances are the funds that immigrants send to their families \nabroad to help those relatives meet their basic needs. In the Latino \ncommunity, 47 percent of all Latinos born outside the United States \nregularly send money to their country of origin. But since 43 percent \nto 58 percent of those who send remittances abroad regularly do not \nhave a bank account, much of their hard earned money is lost in fees \npaid to check cashing agencies and wire transfer companies. They rely \non check cashing services to cash their paychecks at hefty fees and \nthen pay another fee to send some portion of that money through a wire \nservice to their relatives in Latin America and elsewhere at varying \nexchange rates.\n  This legislation will increase competition and transparency in the \nremittances market. It will provide immigrants with access to more \nchoices for sending remittances by allowing credit unions to provide \nwire transfer and check cashing services to nonmembers. It will also \nprovide immigrants with access to information in more than one language \nfrom all money transmitters about the fees and exchange rates that they \npay. That information will make it easier for consumers to compare the \nvalue of the services they can receive from different service \nproviders.\n  The larger goal is to provide immigrants with more control over their \nfinances. I believe this bill with encourage financial institutions to \ndevelop better services for immigrants and build stronger relationships \nwith immigrant communities.\n  According to the Multilateral Investment Fund, immigrants living in \nthe United States sent $23 billion to Latin America in 2001. More than \n$3 billion of that total was consumed in fees paid to money transfer \nagencies. If current growth rates in remittance transfers are \nmaintained, cumulative remittances to Latin America could reach $300 \nbillion for the 10-year period ending in 2010. We need to work to \nensure that competition in the market and modern technology come \ntogether to lower the portion of those monies lost in fees and instead \nare used for productive purposes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM of Florida:\n  S. 1360. A bill to amend section 7105 of title 38, United States \nCode, to clarify the requirements for notices of disagreement for \nappellate review of Department of Veterans Affairs activities; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will remove a significant and arbitrary barrier to \nappellate review of veterans' benefits claims. In 1988, when Congress \ncreated judicial review for veterans' claims it intended to provide \n``an opportunity for those aggrieved by VA decisions to have such \ndecisions reviewed by a court'' and found such review ``necessary in \norder to provide such claimants with fundamental justice.''\n  A veteran or survivor of a veteran seeking VA benefits must file a \nclaim for such benefits, generally at a VA Regional Office. If the VA \ndenies the claim for benefits, the claimant must file a ``Notice of \nDisagreement,'' or NOD, as defined in section 7105 of title 38 of the \nUnited States Code. This NOD initiates appellate review by the agency \nand begins a series of events where VA communicates the basis of the \ndenial to the claimant and allows various levels of review of this \ndenial at the regional office. If the claimant still disagrees with the \nVA decision, the claimant may file a ``Substantive Appeal'' that vests \njurisdiction of the claim with the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the \nappellate arm of VA.\n  Section 7105 defines what is required of a valid NOD. It must be \nfiled within 1 year from the notice of the initial denial, in writing, \nand filed with the regional office that issued the decision over which \nthere is disagreement. The NOD may be filed by the claimant or the \nclaimant's guardian or representative.\n  VA has promulgated regulations to implement section 7105. In Section \n20.201 or title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations, the Secretary \ndefined a NOD to not require special wording. The regulation does \nrequire that the NOD ``must be in terms which can be reasonably \nconstrued as disagreement with the determination and a desire for \nappellate review.'' The second component of that sentence--``a desire \nfor appellate review''--is not required under the statute.\n  In 1997, Raymond Gallegos, a veteran, again filed an application for \nservice connection for post-traumatic stress disorder that had been \npreviously denied. The VA regional office granted his claim. However, \nMr. Gallegos believed the effective date assigned to his claim was \nwrong and filed what was then thought to be a NOD. He appealed this \nissue to the Board, which reasoned that the letter expressing his \ndisagreement was not a valid NOD because it did not express his desire \nfor appellate review. Mr. Gallegos appealed the Board's determination \nto the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, or the CAVC.\n  In 2000, the CAVC determined in Gallegos v. Gober that the VA \nregulation was invalid because it required more of the claimant than \nCongress required in statute. Last year, in Gallegos v. Principi, the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the \nCAVC and upheld the VA regulation, finding that the agency \ninterpretation was entitled to deference because Congressional intent \nwas not clear in limiting the requirements of a NOD to those in section \n7105.\n  Congress never intended to require that level of formality from \nveterans, in this uniquely pro-claimant system. Therefore, I offer \nlegislation that would specify that if a claimant's filing meets the \ncriteria defined in section 7105 of title 38 of the United States Code, \nthe document will be deemed a Notice of Disagreements with all the \nrights and procedures that accompany that determination. It will also \nensure that claimants whose NODs were found to be defective since the \ncourt decision will have the opportunity to have their NOD reevaluated \nunder this new provision.\n  This is very significant because there are two key consequences of \nnot having a valid, timely NOD. First, if a claimant fails to file a \ntimely, valid NOD, the VA denial becomes final. The claimant will need \nto submit ``new and material evidence'' that VA erred in order to \nreopen the case. If successful, the claimant will only be able to \nreceive benefits dating to the beginning of the newly reopened claim, \npotentially losing years of retroactive benefits. This may affect a \nveteran's ability to receive VA health care, a dependent's ability to \nuse educational benefits, and all the other benefits that flow from a \nfinding of service-connection.\n  Second, if a claimant has not been deemed to file a NOD, there can be \nno appeal of the VA decision. A NOD is required to initiate an appeal. \nIt is a prerequisite to review by the Board of Veterans' Appeals and \nultimately judicial review at the CAVC. This contravenes Congress's \nintent to remove arbitrary barriers to judicial review as it did in \nPublic Law 107-103.\n  We face the tragic fact that in 2002, America lost 646,264 veterans. \nThe many aging veterans who still await justice cannot afford this \ndebate. I ask my colleagues to support this critical measure and \nrestore this fundamental justice to our veterans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1360\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat foreign base company shipping income shall include only income \nfrom aircraft and income from certain vessels transporting petroleum \nand related products; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation which would deal with a real problem facing our Nation, the \ndecline of our U.S.-owned shipping fleet. A U.S. owned shipping fleet \nis essential as a matter of national and economic security. My bill \nwould help make U.S. based shipping companies more competitive in the \nglobal market.\n  This is important to our country and to my state. Oregon plays a key \nrole as a facilitator of international commerce. The Port of Portland \nis one of the most active ports in the world. It is a key link for \ntrade between the United States and the Pacific Rim. In addition to its \nkey role enabling global commerce, Portland is home to U.S. owned \nshipping companies, shipyards, and numerous support businesses.\n  As a result of tax-law changes enacted in 1975 and 1986, U.S. \nshipping companies must pay tax on income earned by subsidiaries \noverseas immediately rather than when such income is later brought back \nto the United States. This treatment represents a sharp departure from \nthe generally applicable income tax principle of ``deferral'' and \nplaces U.S.-based owners of international fleets at a distinct tax \ndisadvantage compared to their foreign-based competitors.\n  Controlled foreign corporations engaged in ocean transport are one of \nthe only active businesses that are not eligible for general rule of \ndeferral. My bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to allow U.S. \ncompanies that own foreign-flagged ships to treat income earned by \ntheir controlled foreign corporations in the same manner as all other \nU.S. companies. In short, it would allow American shipping companies to \ndefer the payment of tax on income that they derive from shipping \nactivities outside the United States until that income is repatriated \nto the United States.\n  Most foreign-based carriers pay no home-country taxes on income they \nearn abroad from international shipping. As a result of this \ncompetitive imbalance, U.S. companies now hold precious little share of \nthe world shipping marketplace. Indeed, U.S. ownership of international \nshipping trades dropped precipitously in the aftermath of the 1975 and \n1986 tax-law changes. Before 1975, the U.S.-owned share of the world's \nopen-registry shipping fleet stood at 26 percent. By 1986, the U.S. \nshare had dropped to 14 percent. By 1996, the U.S. share had dropped to \n5 percent.\n  Other security concerns also are raised by the decline in U.S. \nownership of the international shipping trade. The U.S. military, in \ntimes of emergency, relies on the ability to requisition U.S.-owned \nforeign-flagged tankers, bulk carriers, and other vessels to carry oil, \ngasoline, and other materials in defense of U.S. interests overseas. \nThese vessels comprise the Effective United States Control, EUSC, \nfleet. The sharp decline in the EUSC fleet since the 1975 and 1986 tax-\nlaw changes, and the resulting adverse strategic consequences, have \nbeen confirmed in a recent MIT study conducted for the Navy Department. \nThe study recommended that in the short term, the most practical and \ncost-effective means of reversing this trend would be to ``revise \nlegislation to reflect tax deferment of income for some or all EUSC \nvessels.''\n  U.S. security also depends in no small part on our ability to \nmaintain adequate domestic oil supplies in times of emergency. The \nUnited States consumes approximately 19.6 million barrels of oil per \nday, of which roughly 55 percent, mostly crude, is imported into the \nUnited States. It is estimated that 95 percent of all oil imported into \nthe United States by sea is now imported on foreign-owned tankers. This \nmeans that one half of every gallon of oil consumed in the United \nStates is carried on foreign-owned vessels. This growing dependence on \nforeign parties--who may not be sympathetic to U.S. interests--to \ndeliver our oil in times of global crisis is cause for potential alarm. \nIn recent years, two of the largest American shipping companies have \nbeen purchased by foreign companies, thereby making their shipping \noperations more competitive than the remaining American companies.\n  The time has come for us to make changes in the tax law that will \nallow our domestic companies to compete fairly in the global \nmarketplace. I urge my colleagues to join me to enact this needed \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Port Passenger Accelerated Service \nSystem (Port PASS) as a permanent program for land border inspection \nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation that \nwill strengthen national security, promote commerce, and provide \nassistance to our dedicated agents at the border.\n  Thousands of San Diego and Tijuana residents cross the border every \nday as commuters, shoppers, or visitors. Unfortunately, our border \ninfrastructure has not kept pace with the increasing\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\ntraffic volume, and travelers frequently encounter delays and \ncongestion at the border.\n  The tragic events of September 11 further intensified these \nchallenges along the border. Increased security measures severely over-\nextended inspection resources and resulted in longer waiting times for \ncrossing the border.\n  The Secure Electronic Network for Travelers' Rapid Inspection, \nSENTRI, program was created to help alleviate the congestion at the \nborder.\n  SENTRI is a dedicated commuter lane program. It allows pre-screened \ntravelers to move quickly through the inspection process at the United \nStates-Mexican border. After participants pass a background check, they \ncan move more quickly through a dedicated lane.\n  SENTRI accepts only travelers who pass both an extensive background \ncheck to verify their eligibility and a thorough inspection of their \nvehicle.\n  Delays at crossing the border were often an hour or more prior to \nSENTRI But, with the program, the delays for participants are 5 to 15 \nminutes. Travelers in other lanes also benefit because the prescreened \nSENTRI crossers move swiftly through the border, reducing the number of \nmotorists using general commuter lanes.\n  Expediting inspections through SENTRI is actually helping to improve \nborder security, as Customs and Border Patrol agents can focus more \nattention on nonscreened drivers and passengers.\n  Unfortunately, SENTRI has become a victim of its own success. SENTRI \nneeds a greater investment of resources to keep up with the current and \nfuture demand. Enrollment increased by more than 100 percent after \nSeptember 11. Currently, prospective applicants must wait approximately \n8 months to participate in the program.\n  For innovative programs, such as SENTRI, to work, we must provide \nthem with the tools and resources they need to succeed. This is why I \nam introducing the Secure and Fast Entry at the Border Act or SAFE \nBorder Act.\n  The SAFE Border Act recognizes the contribution of SENTRI to border \nsecurity and the agents who administer the program. My bill would \nextend the length of a SENTRI pass from 1 to 2 years--enabling border \nagents to process more new applicants and reduce the current enrollment \nwait. The SAFE Border Act also recommends the appointment of dedicated \nSENTRI staff to expedite application processing, and encourages the \ncreation of a dedicated commuter lane for prescreened, low-risk \npedestrian crossers.\n  In addition, to ensure security at our borders, my legislation bans a \nperson convicted of a felony or under active criminal investigation \nfrom participating in the program.\n  Our agents at the border shoulder an enormous responsibility every \nday. I believe we owe them the appropriate resources and support they \nneed to carry out their duties.\n  Our Nation's economic and overall security is heavily linked to \nsmooth and secure border crossings. The SAFE Border Act provides a way \nfor trusted travelers to cross the border securely and quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 1363. A bill to prohibit the study or implementation of any plan \nto privatize, divest, or transfer any part of the mission, function, or \nresponsibility of the National Park Service; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as thousands of families look forward to \nsummer vacations at our beautiful national parks, we must address an \nissue that could one day ruin their experience: privatization of the \nNational Park Service.\n  The Park Service has worked hard to preserve Nevada's unique \nlandscapes at the Great Basin National Park, Death Valley, and Lake \nMead National Recreation Area. Instead of applauding the Park Service \nfor a job well done, the Administration wants to study 1,800 jobs in \nthe Park Service for privatization.\n  Many of these Park Service jobs have direct contact with visitors to \nour parks. They not only collect fees and maintain parks but also give \ndirections, fight wildfires when necessary, and provide emergency \nmedical assistance to injured park visitors. They are not required to \ndo these things; they are driven by a love for the parks and a \ncommitment to public service that contractors lack.\n  Privatizing the Park Service would jeopardize our national parks. \nMembers of the Park Service have a career-long interest in maintaining \nthe parks and perform their jobs because they are dedicated to serving \nthe public. They often go beyond the call of duty to fix a problem in \nthe middle of the night or change a tire for an unlucky park visitor. \nCan we be sure that a contractor would do the same? No.\n  In addition, the Park Service receives tens of thousands of hours of \nvolunteer work every year. At the Lake Mead National Recreation Area \nalone, volunteers provided 92,000 hours of work, the equivalent of 44 \nfull-time employees. Will a contractor find volunteers to provide it \nwith 92,000 hours of assistance. Not likely.\n  Privatization will waste taxpayer money. Privatization studies cost \nabout $3,000 per position studied, and privatization does not save \nmoney.\n  Nevadans visiting the national parks this summer want members of the \nPark Service, not profit-minded corporations, enriching their \nexperience by directing them to the famous sites and best kept secrets \nof our parks.\n  I oppose privatizing the Park Service because it would hurt Nevadans, \nendanger our national parks, and waste taxpayer money.\n  This bill will keep our dedicated Park Service members running our \nnational parks. It stops costly privatization studies and redirects the \nfunds to address the maintenance backlog that President Bush promised \nto eliminate.\n  I am committed to protecting our parks, and I am proud to introduce \nthis bill that will ensure that the Park Service can preserve them for \ngenerations to come.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PARK PROFESSIONALS PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Park \n     Professionals Protection Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Park System is recognized throughout the \n     world as a model for the conservation and enjoyment of \n     natural, scenic, recreational, cultural, and historic \n     resources.\n       (2) The National Park System would never have achieved such \n     status, nor could the system maintain such status, without \n     the professionalism, dedication, and passion of the men and \n     women of the National Park Service.\n       (3) Current plans to privatize thousands of jobs within the \n     National Park Service ignore the unique contributions made by \n     the men and women of the National Park Service and threaten \n     to undermine the entire National Park System.\n       (4) Scarce park operations and maintenance resources are \n     being diverted to pay private consultants to study the \n     current privatization scheme. According to the National Park \n     Service, these studies cost approximately $3000 for each \n     position proposed to be privatized.\n       (5) Despite the millions of taxpayer dollars diverted to \n     these studies, not a single report has been published \n     documenting any cost savings to be generated by the \n     privatization of park operations.\n       (6) The current privatization scheme raises serious \n     questions regarding the ability of temporary workers, \n     provided by the lowest bidder, to adequately fulfill the \n     responsibilities of professional National Park Service \n     employees in the areas of conservation, interpretation, \n     emergency fire and rescue, and homeland security.\n       (7) The current privatization scheme appears to affect \n     minority employees disproportionately, threatening to \n     significantly reduce the number of minority employees within \n     the National Park Service.\n       (8) Pendency of the current privatization scheme is having \n     detrimental impacts on the morale of current employees and is \n     discouraging high quality candidates from applying for \n     positions within the National Park Service.\n       (c) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary is prohibited from studying or \n     implementing any plan to privatize, divest, or transfer any \n     part of what is, as of the date of the enactment of this \n     section, the mission, function, or responsibility of the \n     National Park Service.\n       (d) Reallocation of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, the Secretary shall withhold any funds \n     currently dedicated to the activities prohibited under \n     subsection (c) and shall reallocate those funds to the \n     operations and maintenance accounts within the National Park \n     Service.\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\n       (e) No Effect on Certain Plans.--Nothing in this section \n     shall affect the authority, as of the date of the enactment \n     of this section, of a National Park Service Superintendent to \n     develop and implement concessions management plans and \n     commercial services plans covering, in whole or in part, the \n     area managed by that Superintendent.\n       (f) Secretary Defined.--The term ``Secretary'' means the \n     Secretary of the Interior and any person employed by the \n     Secretary of the Interior in any capacity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1364. A bill to amend the Alaska National Lands Conservation Act \nto authorize the payment of expenses after the death of certain Federal \nemployees in the State of Alaska; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on the morning following the annual \ncandlelight vigil to honor fallen law enforcement officers, I came to \nthe floor to speak about three brave Alaskans whose names were \ninscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers' Memorial at \nJudiciary Square this year. One of these brave Alaskans was a National \nPark Service ranger who lost his life when the aircraft he was piloting \ncrashed in a remote part of Alaska. Today, I am introducing legislation \nwhich I hope will help the surviving family members of this ranger in \ntheir recovery from this tragic loss and provide authority for the \nFederal Government to help the surviving family members of other \nsimilarly situated Federal employees should a similar tragedy occur in \nthe future.\n  This ranger I am speaking about was assigned to the Katmai National \nPark and Preserve in the Bristol Bay region of Alaska and lived in the \ncommunity of Naknek. Naknek is not connected to the rest of North \nAmerica by road. It is what we in Alaska call a ``bush'' community. But \nit was home to the ranger and became the adopted home of his widow who \ndid not grow up in the area. The ranger about whom I am speaking was \nhired under a special hiring authority in the Alaska National Interest \nLands Conservation Act, ANILCA, which authorizes the Federal land \nmanagers to extend a hiring preference to those with special knowledge \nabout a Conservation System Unit. He was regarded as a ``local hire.''\n  Under the Federal Travel Regulation, when a federal employee dies \noutside of the Continental United States, the Federal Government will \nreimburse the members of his or her household for the cost of \nrelocating to their permanent residence. Alaska is regarded as \n``outside of the Continental United States'' under this regulation.\n  Thus, if the National Park Service ranger who died in the line of \nduty came from the Lower 48 before being assigned to the Katmai \nNational Park and Preserve then the Federal Government, as I read the \nregulation, could reimburse the surviving family members for the cost \nof relocating to Anchorage. This cost can be fairly substantial since \none cannot hire a moving van to ship the personal effects from South \nNaknek to Anchorage. There are no roads which connect the bush village \nof South Naknek to Anchorage. The personal effects need to be \ntransported by air.\n  However, if the deceased employee is a local hire employee, the \nFederal Travel Regulation does not authorize the Federal Government to \nreimburse the surviving family members for their relocation cost \nbecause the deceased employee's hometown is deemed to be the local hire \nlocation. This works an inequity where, as in the present case, the \ndeceased employee's surviving spouse does not have ties to the duty \nstation community, but rather to another community in Alaska. In this \ninstance, the surviving spouse desires to relocate to Anchorage, which \nis Alaska's largest city, and continue to raise her three children \nthere.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today is intended to cure this \ninequity. It would amend ANILCA, the same legislation which contains \nthe local hire authority, to provide that if a local hire employee dies \nin the line of duty, the Federal Government will reimburse the \nsurviving immediate family for the cost of transporting the remains to \na location in Alaska of their choosing and will also relocate the \nimmediate family members to a community in the State of Alaska which is \nselected by the surviving head of household. I think that this is the \nleast we can do for the survivors of local hire employees who go to \nwork everyday in the harsh climate and conditions of bush Alaska but \nsadly sometimes do not return home.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This Act is particularly timely, given \nthat national elections are scheduled in that country on July 27th.\n  Cambodia is on its third round of parliamentary elections since the \n1991 Paris Peace Accords, with previous elections having been funded by \nthe United Nations in 1993 and by the Cambodian governments in 1998. \nDespite the billions of dollars spent on elections in that country--\nover $2 billion by the U.N. alone--there has yet to be a credible poll \nthat accurately reflects the will of the Cambodian people.\n  My colleagues will remember that the U.N.-sponsored elections \nresulted in a large voter turnout--but also an unworkable power sharing \ndeal brokered between the winning royalist FUNCINPEC party and the hard \nline Cambodian People's Party, CPP, that quickly dissolved into open \nhostilities, including a bloody grenade attack against a peaceful, pro-\ndemocracy rally and a CPP sponsored coup d'etat in 1997.\n  The debilitating hangover from this coup--destroyed party offices, \ndead activists, and a palpable climate of fear and repression--\nundermined prospects for free and fair elections in 1998 even before \nthe first ballots were cast.\n  Fatigued and frustrated, the international community found it \nexpedient to endorse the flawed elections, even as students and \nBuddhist monks erected a ``democracy square'' in Phnom Penh to protest \nthe polls. A CPP crackdown left many of these peaceful protestors \nkilled, beaten or harassed.\n  It is time that Prime Minister Hun Sen--as the self-proclaimed \nstrongman of Cambodia--is held accountable for the murder of political \nactivists, Buddhist monks, civilians, and students. There is no rule of \nlaw, if the leaders of the government are not subject to it.\n  A second ``coalition'' government between royalists and hard liners \nwas cobbled together in the aftermath of the 1998 elections. This time, \nthere was no pretext of power sharing, and for the past 5 years CPP has \nbeen firmly and completely in control of the country.\n  Nevertheless, in the months and weeks before the upcoming July \nelections, the political marriage between FUNCINPEC and CPP is fraying. \nIn an\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\neffort to harass and intimidate his opponents, in late January Prime \nMinister Hun Sen whipped up nationalistic sentiment against Thailand, \nlet loose the so-called Pagoda Boys, government-paid thugs, and \ndestroyed $50 million worth of Thai public and private interests in \nPhnom Penh.\n  Despite frantic pleas for assistance, the Thai ambassador and other \ndiplomatic personnel escaped injury by scaling the embassy's walls and \nscurrying to safety. In the aftermath of the riots, Hun Sen arrested \nand intimidated students, independent broadcasters, and political \nactivists. A senior opposition figure sought--and was granted-- refuge \nin the U.S. Embassy.\n  In February, former royalist parliamentarian Om Radsady was gunned \ndown in a mafia-style murder in Phnom Penh. Well liked and respected by \nhis colleagues from all Cambodian political parties, Radsady's \nassassination sent a not so subtle message that no one is immune from \nthe black hand of CPP.\n  It is time Hun Sen is held accountable for his complicity in actions \nthat grossly violate international and domestic laws, and the human \nrights and dignity of the people of Cambodia.\n  The fundamental question facing the Cambodian people today is whether \nthe July 27th elections will be a meaningful exercise in democracy, or \nanother lost opportunity to chart a new course for that beleaguered \ncountry.\n  Last week, Prime Minister Hun Sen assured Secretary of State Colin \nPowell that Cambodia would hold free and fair elections. Secretary \nPowell should not be duped by these hollow promises. A preponderance of \nevidence suggests that CPP is actively trying to steal the elections \nbefore July 27th: political activists continue to be murdered and \nintimidated, creating a chilling tone of fear and repression; the CPP \ncontinues to directly influence and manipulate the election machinery, \nwith members of the National Election Commission, NEC, nominated in a \nclosed manner by the co-Ministers of Interior and the NEC already \nfailing to investigate allegations of election improprieties; and, \nopposition political parties continue to lack access to media, with \nseveral broadcast outlets in Cambodia unwilling to sell air time to \nCPP's challengers.\n  Let me take a moment to describe what the Cambodian Democracy and \nAccountability Act does--and does not--do.\n  The Act provides additional foreign assistance to Cambodia--an \nincrease by half (or $21.5 million) over the fiscal year 2004 budget \nrequest of $43 million--if new leadership has been elected in free and \nfair elections, and if Hun Sen is no longer Prime Minister. It has been \napparent to me that Hun Sen has long been part of Cambodia's problems--\nand not part of the solution.\n  The Act does not preclude the Cambodian people from voting for the \npolitical party of their choice. Ballot secrecy must be ensured--as \nwell as transparency in the process of vote counting and tabulation--in \norder that the will of the Cambodian people is accurately expressed. It \nis my fear that CPP pre-election chicanery may already have violated \nthe integrity of the election process.\n  If I wanted to interfere with the elections I would have offered \nlegislation that restricts all assistance to Cambodia unless a specific \npolitical party or parties was elected. This Act does not do this. It \ndoes not cut any assistance--not a single penny--to Cambodia included \nin the fiscal year 2004 budget request. It simply provides that if the \nmajor obstacle to democracy and development in the country--namely \nPrime Minister Hun Sen--is out of power, additional foreign aid will be \nforthcoming.\n\n  It is important to recall that Hun Sen's coup resulted in severe \nrestrictions on assistance to Cambodia--that continue to this day. If \ngiven an opportunity through free and fair elections, the Cambodian \npeople will make the right choices that will ensure a dawn for \ndevelopment in that country.\n  Why will they make the right choice? Over the many decades he has \nbeen in power, Hun Sen has ruled Cambodia through violence, fear and \nrepression. Under his watch, the country has become a haven for sexual \npredators and pedophiles, the criminal underworld, and international \nterrorists. Hun Sen has repeatedly abused the most basic of freedoms \nprotected by the Cambodian Constitution, attacked his political \nopposition, and perpetuated a climate of impunity that stifles the \nadvancement of freedom and free markets.\n  And he has never--not once--been held accountable for his actions.\n  In addition to increasing foreign assistance under certain \nconditions, the Act restricts assistance to a Khmer Rouge tribunal \nunless the President determines that, among other things, the tribunal \nis supported by democratic Cambodian political parties and is not under \nthe control or influence of the CPP. It also requires the Federal \nBureau of Investigations to resume its investigation of the March 30, \n1997 grenade attack against opposition leader Sam Rainsy that killed \nand injured scores of Cambodians.\n  I should remind my colleagues that American democracy worker Ron \nAbney was injured in this act of terrorism, reportedly carried out by \nthe CPP. Ron--and all the victims of this attack--are still waiting for \njustice.\n  Secretary Powell wrote in a June 24 op-ed that Zimbabwean dictator \nRobert Mugabe's ``time has come and gone.'' As democracy is similarly \nunder siege in both Zimbabwe and Cambodia, dictator Hun Sen's time has \nalso come and gone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1366. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to make \ngrants to State and tribal governments to assist State and tribal \nefforts to manage and control the spread of chronic wasting disease in \ndeer and elk herds, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1366\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease \n     Financial Assistance Act of 2003''.\n\n      SEC. 2. DEFINITION AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Chronic Wasting Disease Defined.--In this Act, the term \n     ``chronic wasting disease'' means the animal disease \n     afflicting deer and elk that--\n       (1) is a transmissible disease of the nervous system \n     resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; and\n       (2) belongs to the group of diseases known as transmissible \n     spongiform encephalopathies, which group includes scrapie, \n     bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob \n     disease.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The States retain undisputed primacy and policy-making \n     authority with regard to wildlife management, and nothing in \n     this Act interferes with or otherwise affects the primacy of \n     the States in managing wildlife generally, or managing, \n     surveying, and monitoring the incidence of chronic wasting \n     disease in animal populations.\n       (2) Chronic wasting disease is a fundamental threat to the \n     health and vibrancy of deer and elk populations, and the \n     increased occurrence of chronic wasting disease in the United \n     States necessitates government action to manage and eradicate \n     this lethal disease.\n       (3) As the States and tribal government move to manage \n     existing incidence of chronic wasting disease and insulate \n     non-infected wild cervid populations from the disease, it is \n     appropriate for the Federal Government to support their \n     efforts with financial assistance.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Not more than three \n     percent of such funds may be expended for administrative \n     expenses of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     carry out this Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Colorado, Mr. Allard, as a cosponsor of the Chronic Wasting \nDisease Financial Assistance Act of 2003. This legislation is similar \nto legislation, S. 1036, the Chronic Wasting Disease Support Act of \n2003, that we introduced earlier this year.\n  The House Resources Committee held a hearing on June 19, 2003 on the \nissue of chronic wasting disease, or CWD. At that hearing, state agency \nrepresentatives argued strongly that Congress should create a new grant \nprogram to provide assistance to states for the management of CWD. They \nalso expressed an interest in having those funds distributed using an \nexisting distribution mechanism. This legislation responds directly to \nthese comments. In total, the bill directs the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService to provide $20.5 million in Federal grants to State and tribal \ngovernments for CWD management in wild deer and elk, $10.5 million more \nin resources than were included in the bill Senator Allard and I \nintroduced earlier this year.\n  The bill creates three new Federal CWD grant programs. The first \nprogram is a new nationwide CWD capacity grant, authorized at a total \nof $7.5 million. This program would provide grants to States so that \nthey can fund CWD management programs. Preference would be given to \nStates with comprehensive and integrated chronic wasting disease \nmanagement programs involving all relevant state agencies.\n  The second grant program would provide additional $10 million in \ngrant assistance to states like Colorado and Wisconsin that already \nhave detected chronic wasting disease in their wild deer and elk. These \nStates need additional help. Wisconsin has undertaken significant \nmeasures to combat CWD at significant expense, and this program \nacknowledges that outbreaks are expensive to manage and require Federal \nfinancial assistance.\n  Finally, the bill would create a third $3 million grant program to \nprovide CWD management grants directly to tribal governments. To be \neligible for these programs, States and tribes are given the ability \nunder the bill to use an existing mechanism, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService Federal Assistance Act procedures to expedite the receipt of \ngrant funds.\n  This bill is needed because State wildlife departments and tribal \ngovernments do not have the financial resources to adequately confront \nthe problem. Their resources are spread too thin as they attempt to \nprevent the disease from spreading. Federal help in the form of \nmanagement funding is urgently needed. Federal funding will help States \nand tribes to protect and safeguard our valued wild deer and elk from \nthis disease.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate to secure passage of this \nmeasure. This is a good bill, and it deserves the Senate's support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Fitzgerald):\n  S. 1367. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Act \nto establish programs to promote increased consumption of milk in \nschools and to improve the nutrition and health of children; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very \nimportant piece of legislation that could provide great benefits for \nthe health of our young people while simultaneously strengthening the \nfuture viability of dairy producers throughout the United States.\n  My bill, the Child Nutrition Improvement Act of 2003, would provide \nincentives for schools to encourage the consumption of milk as part of \nthe school lunch program and supply needed flexibility for schools to \noffer a wide variety of milk products and flavors.\n  There is no doubt that the eating habits we develop when we are young \naffect our habits and nutritional choices for the rest of our lives. \nThe school lunch program has provided a key tool in promoting healthy \neating habits among young people, which have both health and \neducational benefits.\n  Milk has been a critical component of the school lunch program \nbecause it is the principal source of calcium and a leading source of \nseveral other important nutrients in our diet. That was true when the \nfederal program began in 1946 and it is still true today.\n  With 9 out of 10 teenage girls and 7 out of 10 teenage boys currently \nnot getting enough calcium, milk's important is perhaps greater today \nthan ever before. Serving milk with the school lunch is a critical step \nin addressing the calcium crisis. Federal child health experts who are \non the frontlines fighting the calcium crisis recognize milk's central \nrole in addressing the problem. Study after study, emphasize the need \nfor growing children and teens to consume more milk for healthy bones, \nand the American Academy of Pediatrics has urged its members to \nrecommend their patients get enough milk, cheese, yogurt and other \ncalcium rich foods to help build bone mass.\n  As a result of these recommendations, we have seen a push for more \nmilk in more places in school, like vending machines and school stores. \nThere's a real concern about nutritious choices for school children, \nand many\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\nlocal school districts and state legislatures are pushing to add more \nhealthful beverage choices like milk.\n  A large school vending test in 2001 demonstrated that kids will \neagerly buy milk from vending machines in schools when it is offered. \nThe test was heralded by school nutritionists and helped stimulate \nnationwide interest in getting milk vending machines into more schools.\n  A pilot test conducted in 146 schools with 100,000 students showed \ndramatic increases in milk consumption--15 percent in elementary \nschools and 22 percent in secondary schools--when simple improvements \nwere made in the way milk was packaged and presented to students. The \nmilk was served colder and kids loved the addition of a third flavor, \nit was usually strawberry. No only did kids drink more milk, more kids \nate in the cafeteria. That meant they not only got milk, they also got \nimproved nutrition through greater intake of vegetables, fruits and \nother nutritionally important foods.\n  Milk has an unsurpassed nutrient package for young children and \nteens. Milk has nine essential vitamins and minerals, including \ncalcium, vitamins A, D and B12, protein, potassium, riboflavin, niacin \nand phosphorus. These nutrients are critical to good health and the \nprevention of chronic disease. In addition, it is the primary way that \ngrowing children get the calcium they need. In fact, according to the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture about 75 percent of the calcium in our \nfood supply comes from milk and foods made with milk. By about age 20, \nthe average young person has acquired about 98 percent of his or her \nskeletal mass. Building strong bones during childhood and adolescence \nis one of the best defenses against developing osteoporosis later in \nlife.\n  In addition to the bone-building benefits of milk, research indicates \nthat a diet rich in low-fat milk may help reduce the risk of high blood \npressure and heart disease and help prevent breast cancer, colon cancer \nand even help in the fight against obesity.\n  Milk's role in a nutritious diet has long been noted by the nutrition \nand science community, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, \nthe American Dietetic Association, the National Institute of Child \nHealth and Human Development, the National Osteoporosis Foundation, the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, and many other reputable health \norganizations.\n  As I have already mentioned, government statistics indicate that we \nhave a calcium crisis among our children and youth. Nearly 90 percent \nof teenage girls and almost 70 percent of teenage boys fail to get \nenough calcium in their diets. During the teen years nearly half of all \nbone is formed and about 15 percent of your adult height is added. As a \nnational health priority, for proper growth and development, we need to \nbe doing all we can to encourage our children and youth to drink milk, \nand that is the goal of the legislation I am introducing today.\n  I ask my colleagues for your support of this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Nutrition Improvement \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 190\n\n       Whereas General Eric Shinseki, the Army's 34th Chief of \n     Staff, retired in June 2003, from active military duty after \n     37 distinguished years of service;\n       Whereas General Shinseki, a native of Hawaii, graduated \n     from the United States Military Academy, West Point, in 1965 \n     and served in a variety of assignments, including 2 combat \n     tours in Vietnam, and was wounded twice in combat while \n     serving his country;\n       Whereas General Shinseki has been awarded the Defense \n     Distinguished Service Medal, Distinguished Service Medal, \n     Legion of Merit (with oak leaf clusters), Bronze Star Medal \n     with ``V'' Device (with 2 oak leaf clusters), Purple Heart \n     (with oak leaf cluster), Meritorious Service Medal (with 2 \n     oak leaf clusters), Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal (with \n     oak leaf cluster), Army Achievement Medal, Parachutist Badge, \n     Ranger Tab, Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification \n     Badge, Joint Chiefs of Staff Identification Badge, and the \n     Army Staff Identification Badge;\n       Whereas General Shinseki has spent the last 4 years of his \n     career in the highest position attainable in the Army and has \n     proven himself a tremendous leader who has demonstrated \n     unselfish devotion to this Nation and the soldiers he leads;\n       Whereas General Shinseki focused the Army on improved \n     readiness in preparation for war and transformed the Army \n     into the lean, agile, lethal fighting force that achieved \n     victories during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       Whereas General Shinseki provided the vision to set the \n     Army on a path of transformation that will provide the Nation \n     with an Army that is more lethal, agile, deployable, and \n     flexible; capable of fighting and winning this Nation's wars \n     in all future threat environments.\n       Whereas General Shinseki exemplifies the trademark \n     characteristics exhibited by all\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\n     great leaders and is a remarkable man of integrity, courage, \n     and honor;\n       Whereas General Shinseki is an American hero who has been \n     selfless in his service to his country through war, peace, \n     and personal trial, and epitomizes the spirit of aloha; and\n       Whereas John F. Kennedy, the 35th President of the United \n     States once said, ``When at some future date the high court \n     of history sits in judgment of each one of us--recording \n     whether in our brief span of service we fulfilled our \n     responsibilities, we will be measured by the answers to 4 \n     questions--were we truly men of courage . . . were we truly \n     men of judgment . . . were we truly men of integrity . . . \n     were we truly men of dedication?'' and whereas when history \n     looks back at the Army's 34th Chief of Staff, it will be \n     clear that this was truly a man of courage, judgment, \n     integrity, and dedication: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. COMMENDATION.\n\n       The Senate--\n       (1) thanks General Eric Shinseki of the United States Army \n     on behalf of a grateful Nation; and\n       (2) commends General Eric Shinseki for his extraordinary \n     dedication to service to this great country and for his \n     lifetime of commitment to excellence.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSMITTAL OF RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Senate directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit \n     an enrolled copy of this resolution to General Eric Shinseki.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great American \nhero, General Eric Shinseki, the Army's 34th Chief of Staff. General \nShinseki, a native of Hawaii, attained the Army's highest position as \nthe Army's Chief of Staff in June 1999 and retired in June 2003.\n  Ric Shinseki graduated from the United States Military Academy, West \nPoint, in 1965. He served two combat tours in Vietnam and was wounded \ntwice in combat. Throughout his 37 years of service to this country, he \nhas given his personal best, serving with great pride and dignity. His \nlegacy to this Nation will live on for years to come.\n  Over the span of his career, I've watched his progress as a soldier \nand was privileged to participate in his promotion ceremony to Colonel. \nAt that time, I thought he had a stellar career as a ``soldier's \nsoldier.'' I was very proud to witness his four years of service as the \nArmy's Chief of Staff. He was the perfect soldier to lead our Army into \nthe 21st century.\n  This remarkable man and distinguished decorated soldier set a new \nstandard for the Army. With extraordinary vision, he transformed the \nArmy into an agile, lean, flexible, and lethal fighting force. This man \nof honor, integrity, and courage set a higher standard for all to \nfollow, all while embodying the spirit of aloha. With his deep sense of \npride and dedication to service, he made our Army stronger, one able to \nachieve swift victories during Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom.\n  As I quoted in the Senate Resolution, President John F. Kennedy once \nsaid, ``When at some future date the high court of history sits in \njudgment of each one of us--recording whether in our brief span of \nservice we fulfilled our responsibilities, we will be measured by the \nanswers to four questions--were we truly men of courage . . . were we \ntruly men of judgment . . . were we truly men of integrity . . . were \nwe truly men of dedication?'' When history looks back at the Army's \n34th Chief of Staff, it will be clear that this was truly a man of \ncourage, judgment, integrity, and dedication.\n  General Shinseki is to be commended for his patriotism, unwavering \ncommitment to this Nation, and his meritorious service to this country.\n                                  ____\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 56--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n THAT A COMMEMORATIVE POSTAGE STAMP SHOULD BE ISSUED HONORING GUNNERY \n             SERGEANT JOHN BASILONE, A GREAT AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mrs. \nClinton) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 56\n\n       Whereas Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone was born in 1916 in \n     Buffalo, New York, son of Salvatore and Dora Basilone, one of \n     10 children;\n       Whereas John Basilone was raised and educated in Raritan, \n     New Jersey;\n       Whereas, at the age of 18, John Basilone enlisted in the \n     United States Army, principally seeing garrison service in \n     the Philippines;\n       Whereas, after his honorable discharge in 1937, Sergeant \n     Basilone, known by his comrades as ``Manila John'', returned \n     to Raritan;\n       Whereas, seeing the storm clouds of war hovering over the \n     Nation, and believing that his place was with this country's \n     fighting forces, Sergeant Basilone enlisted in the United \n     States Marine Corps in July 1940;\n       Whereas, on October 24 and 25, 1942, on Guadalcanal, \n     Solomon Islands, Sergeant Basilone was a member of ``C'' \n     Company, 1st Battalion, 7th Regiment, 1st Marine Division, \n     and was in charge of 2 sections of heavy machine guns \n     defending a narrow pass that led to Henderson Airfield;\n       Whereas, although Sergeant Basilone and his machine gunners \n     were vastly outnumbered and without available reinforcements, \n     Sergeant Basilone and his fellow Marines fought valiantly to \n     check the savage and determined assault by the Japanese \n     Imperial Army;\n       Whereas, for this action, Sergeant Basilone was awarded the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor and sent home a hero;\n       Whereas, in December 1944, Sergeant Basilone's restlessness \n     to rejoin his fellow Marines, who were fighting the bloody \n     island-to-island battles en route to the Philippines and \n     Japan, prompted him to volunteer again for combat;\n       Whereas, on Iwo Jima, on February 19, 1945, Sergeant \n     Basilone again distinguished himself by single-handedly \n     destroying an enemy blockhouse while braving heavy-caliber \n     fire;\n       Whereas, minutes later, an artillery shell killed Sergeant \n     Basilone and 4 of his platoon members;\n       Whereas Sergeant Basilone was posthumously awarded the Navy \n     Cross and Purple Heart, and a life-sized bronze statue stands \n     in Raritan, New Jersey, where ``Manila John'' is clad in \n     battle dress and cradles a machine gun in his arms;\n       Whereas, in 1949, the United States Government commissioned \n     a destroyer the U.S.S. Basilone, and in November 1951, \n     Governor Alfred E. Driscoll posthumously awarded Sergeant \n     Basilone the State of New Jersey's highest decoration;\n       Whereas, following World War II, Sergeant Basilone's \n     remains were reinterred in the Arlington National Cemetery;\n       Whereas Sergeant Basilone was the first recipient of the \n     Congressional Medal of Honor awarded in World War II;\n       Whereas Sergeant Basilone was also awarded the Navy Cross \n     and the Purple Heart, giving him the distinction of being the \n     only enlisted Marine in World War II to receive all 3 medals; \n     and\n       Whereas commemorative postage stamps have been commissioned \n     to honor other great heroes in American history: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a commemorative postage stamp should be issued by the \n     United States Postal Service honoring Gunnery Sergeant John \n     Basilone; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a stamp be issued.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution calling on the United States Postal Service to issue a \ncommemorative postage stamp honoring an extraordinary American hero: \nGunnery Sergeant John Basilone. Basilone is the only person in American \nhistory to be awarded both the Congressional Medal of Honor and the \nNavy Cross. Only one USPS stamp has ever commemorated an individual \nMarine, a stamp featuring John Phillip Sousa; it bears noting that \nalthough Sousa was a Marine, he was not selected for his service on the \nbattlefield. It is time to remember the tremendous sacrifice of at \nleast one individual Marine, John Basilone, an American Patriot.\n  John Basilone was raised in Raritan, NJ, one of ten children in a \nlarge Italian-American family. Soon after he turned 18, Basilone heeded \nthe patriotic call and enlisted in the U.S. Army. Basilone was \nimmediately sent to the Philippines where he earned a nickname that \nwould stick with him for the rest of his career: ``Manila John.''\n  Following his tour of duty in 1937, Basilone returned to Raritan. But \nhe wouldn't stay there long. In July 1940--with much of Europe at war \nand the United States on the brink--``Manila John'' left New Jersey, \nenlisting in the military once again, this time joining the United \nStates Marine Corps.\n  On October 24, 1942, Basilone earned his Congressional Medal of \nHonor. He was sent to a position on the Tenaru River at Guadalcanal and \nplaced in command of two sections of heavy machine guns. Sergeant \nBasilone and his men were charged with defending Henderson Airfield, an \nimportant American foothold on the island. Although the Marine \ncontingent was vastly outnumbered and without needed support,\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\nBasilone and his men successfully repelled a Japanese assault. Other \nsurvivors reported that their success can be attributed to one man: \n``Manila John.'' He crossed enemy lines to replenish a dangerously low \nstockpile of ammunition, repaired artillery pieces, and steadied his \ntroops in the midst of torrential rain. He went several days and nights \nwithout food or sleep, and the U.S. military was able to carry the day. \nHis exploits became Marine lore, and served as a patriotic inspiration \nto others facing daunting challenges in the midst of war.\n  For his courage under fire and profound patriotism, Basilone was the \nfirst enlisted Marine to be awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nWhen he returned to the United States, he was heralded as a hero and \nquickly sent on tour around the country to help finance the war through \nthe sale of war bonds. The Marine Corps offered to commission Basilone \nas an officer and station him far away from the frontlines.\n  But Basilone was not interested in riding out the war in Washington, \nDC. He was quoted as saying, ``I ain't no officer, and I ain't no \nmuseum piece. I belong back with my outfit.'' In December 1944, he got \nhis wish and returned to the frontlines.\n  General Douglas MacArthur called him ``a one-man army,'' and on \nFebruary 19, 1945 at Iwo Jima, Basilone once again lived up to that \nreputation. Basilone destroyed an enemy stronghold, a blockhouse on \nthat small Japanese island and commanded his young troops to move the \nheavy guns off the beach. Unfortunately, less than two hours into the \nassault on that fateful day in February, Basilone and four of his \nfellow Marines were killed when an enemy mortar shell exploded nearby.\n  When Gunnery Sergeant John Basilone died he was only 27, but he had \nalready earned the Congressional Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, the \nPurple Heart, and the appreciation of his Nation. Basilone is a true \nAmerican patriot whose legacy should be preserved.\n  Now more than ever, the United States needs to honor and praise the \ncourageous efforts put forth by the men and women of our military. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this resolution as an important \nmessage to our soldiers that we appreciate and admire all of their \nefforts in the war on terrorism.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 57--HONORING DR.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nan individual who has longstanding dedication and service specific to \nXavier University and to education as a whole.

HEALTH CARE THAT WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS-CITIZENS \n                   HEALTH CARE WORKING GROUP.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In order to improve the health care system, the \n     American public must engage in an informed national public \n     debate to make choices about the services they want covered, \n     what health care coverage they want, and how they are willing \n     to pay for coverage.\n       (2) More than a trillion dollars annually is spent on the \n     health care system, yet--\n       (A) 41,000,000 Americans are uninsured;\n       (B) insured individuals do not always have access to \n     essential, effective services to improve and maintain their \n     health; and\n       (C) employers, who cover over 170,000,000 Americans, find \n     providing coverage increasingly difficult because of rising \n     costs and double digit premium increases.\n       (3) Despite increases in medical care spending that are \n     greater than the rate of inflation, population growth, and \n     Gross Domestic Product growth, there has not been a \n     commensurate improvement in our health status as a nation.\n       (4) Health care costs for even just 1 member of a family \n     can be catastrophic, resulting in medical bills potentially \n     harming the economic stability of the entire family.\n       (5) Common life occurrences can jeopardize the ability of a \n     family to retain private coverage or jeopardize access to \n     public coverage.\n       (6) Innovations in health care access, coverage, and \n     quality of care, including the use of technology, have often \n     come from States, local communities, and private sector \n     organizations, but more creative policies could tap this \n     potential.\n       (7) Despite our Nation's wealth, the health care system \n     does not provide coverage to all Americans who want it.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide for a nationwide public debate about \n     improving the health care system to provide every American \n     with the ability to obtain quality, affordable health care \n     coverage; and\n       (2) to provide for a vote by Congress on the \n     recommendations that result from the debate.\n       (c) Establishment.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, shall establish \n     an entity to be known as the Citizens' Health Care Working \n     Group (referred to in this Act as the ``Working Group'').\n       (d) Appointment.--Not later than 45 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Speaker and Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives and the Majority Leader and Minority \n     Leader of the Senate (in this section referred to as the \n     ``leadership'') shall each appoint individuals to serve as \n     members of the Working Group in accordance with subsections \n     (e), (f), and (g).\n       (e) Membership Criteria.--\n       (1) Appointed members.--\n       (A) Separate appointments.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives jointly with the Minority Leader of the House \n     of Representatives, and the Majority Leader of the Senate \n     jointly with the Minority Leader of the Senate, shall each \n     appoint 1 member of the Working Group described in \n     subparagraphs (A), (G), (J), (K), and (M) of paragraph (2).\n       (B) Joint appointments.--Members of the Working Group \n     described in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), (F), (I), and \n     (N) of paragraph (2) shall be appointed jointly by the \n     leadership.\n       (C) Combined appointments.--Members of the Working Group \n     described in subparagraphs (H) and (L) shall be appointed in \n     the following manner:\n       (i) One member of the Working Group in each of such \n     subparagraphs shall be appointed jointly by the leadership.\n       (ii) The remaining appointments of the members in each of \n     such subparagraphs shall be divided equally such that the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives jointly with the \n     Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, and the \n     Majority Leader of the Senate jointly with the Minority \n     Leader of the Senate each appoint an equal number of members.\n       (2) Categories of appointed members.--Members of the \n     Working Group shall be appointed as follows:\n       (A) 2 members shall be patients or family members of \n     patients who, at least 1 year prior to the date of enactment \n     of this Act, have had no health insurance.\n       (B) 1 member shall be a representative of children.\n       (C) 1 member shall be a representative of the mentally ill.\n       (D) 1 member shall be a representative of the disabled.\n       (E) 1 member shall be over the age of 65 and a beneficiary \n     under the medicare program established under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n       (F) 1 member shall be a recipient of benefits under the \n     medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).\n       (G) 2 members shall be State health officials.\n       (H) 3 members shall be employers, including--\n       (i) 1 large employer (an employer who employed 50 or more \n     employees on business days during the preceding calendar year \n     and who employed at least 50 employees on the first of the \n     year);\n       (ii) 1 small employer (an employer who employed an average \n     of at least 2 employees but less than 50 employees on \n     business days in the preceding calendar year and who employs \n     at least 2 employees on the first of the year);

Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Thomas, \nand Mr. Lott) proposed an amendment to the bill S. 1, to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to provide for a voluntary \nprescription drug benefit under the Medicare program and to strengthen \nand improve the Medicare program, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE STRUCTURE OF \n                   MEDICARE REFORM AND THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG \n                   BENEFIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's seniors deserve a fiscally-strong Medicare \n     system that fulfills its promise to them and future retirees.\n       (2) The impending retirement of the ``baby boom'' \n     generation will dramatically increase the costs of providing \n     Medicare benefits. Medicare costs will double relative to the \n     size of the economy from 2% of GDP today to 4% in 2025 and \n     double again to 8% of GDP in 2075. This growth will \n     accelerate substantially when Congress adds a necessary \n     prescription drug benefit.\n       (3) Medicare's current structure does not have the \n     flexibility to quickly adapt to rapid advances in modern \n     health care. Medicare lags far behind other insurers in \n     providing prescription drug coverage, disease management \n     programs, and a host of other advances. Reforming Medicare to \n     create a more self-adjusting, innovative structure is \n     essential to improve Medicare's efficiency and the quality of \n     the medical care it provides.\n       (4) Private-sector choice for Medicare beneficiaries would \n     provide two key benefits: it would be tailored to the needs \n     of America's seniors, not the government, and would create a \n     powerful incentive for private-sector Medicare plans to \n     provide the best quality health care to seniors at the most \n     affordable price.\n       (5) The method by which the national preferred provider \n     organizations in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n     Program have been reimbursed has proven to be a reliable and \n     successful mechanism for providing Members of Congress and \n     federal employees with excellent health care choices.\n       (6) Unlike the Medicare payment system, which has had to be \n     changed by Congress every few years, the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program has existed for 43 years with minimal \n     changes from Congress.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that Medicare reform legislation should:\n       (1) Ensure that prescription drug coverage is directed to \n     those who need it most.\n       (2) Provide that government contributions used to support \n     Medicare Advantage plans are based on market principles \n     beginning in 2006 to ensure the long and short term viability \n     of such options for America's seniors.\n       (3) Develop a payment system for the Medicare Advantage \n     preferred provider organizations similar to the payment \n     system used for the national preferred provider organizations \n     in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n       (4) Limit the addition of new unfunded obligations in the \n     Medicare program so that the long-term solvency of this \n     important program is not further jeopardized.\n       (5) Incorporate private sector, market-based elements, that \n     do not rely on the inefficient Medicare price control \n     structure.\n       (6) Keep the cost of structural changes and new benefits \n     within the $400 billion provided for under the current \n     Congressional Budget Resolution for implementing Medicare \n     reform and providing a prescription drug benefit.\n       (7) Preserve the current employer-sponsored retiree health \n     plans and not design a benefit which has the unintended \n     consequences of supplanting private coverage.\n       (8) Incorporate regulatory reform proposals to eliminate \n     red tape and reduce costs.\n       (9  Restore the right of Medicare beneficiaries and their \n     doctors to work together to provide services, allow private \n     fee for service plans to set their own premiums, and permit \n     seniors to add their own dollars beyond the government \n     contribution.\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1122.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING MEDICARE PAYMENT \n                   UPDATE FOR PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH \n                   PROFESSIONALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The formula by which medicare payments are updated each \n     year for services furnished by physicians and other health \n     professionals is fundamentally flawed.\n       (2) The flawed physician payment update formula is causing \n     a continuing physician payment crisis, and, without \n     congressional action, medicare payment rates for physicians \n     and other practitioners are predicted to fall by 4.2 percent \n     in 2004.\n       (3) A physician payment cut in 2004 would the fifth cut \n     since 1991, and would be on top of a 5.4 percent cut in 2002, \n     with additional cuts estimated for 2005, 2006, and 2007. From \n     1991 through 2003, payment rates for physicians and health \n     professionals fell 14 percent behind practice cost inflation \n     as measured by medicare's own conservative estimates.\n       (4) The sustainable growth rate (SGR) expenditure target, \n     which is the basis for the physician payment update, is \n     linked to the gross domestic product and penalizes physicians \n     and other practitioners for volume increases that they cannot \n     control and that the government actively promotes through new \n     coverage decisions, quality improvement activities, and other \n     initiatives that, while beneficial to patients, are not \n     reflected in the SGR.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that medicare beneficiary access to quality care may be \n     compromised if Congress does not take action to prevent cuts \n     in 2004 and the following years that result from the SGR \n     formula.\n       On page 542, strike lines 18 through 23, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(D) Review entity defined.--For purposes of this \n     subsection, the term `review entity' means an entity of up to \n     3 qualified reviewers drawn from existing appeals levels \n     other than the redetermination level.''.\n       On page 569, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 518.

and\n\n       (ii) demonstrated to the consumer that the substitute check \n     was properly charged to the consumer account.\n       (2) Timing of recredit.--\n       (A) In general.--The bank shall recredit the subject \n     consumer account for the amount described in paragraph (1) \n     not later than the end of the business day following the \n     business day on which the bank determines the claim of the \n     consumer is valid.\n       (B) Recredit pending investigation.--If the bank has not \n     determined that the claim of the consumer is valid before the \n     end of the 10th business day after the business day on which \n     the consumer submitted the claim, the bank shall recredit the \n     subject consumer account for--\n       (i) the lesser of the amount of the substitute check that \n     was charged against the consumer account, or $2,500, together \n     with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, \n     not later than the end of such 10th business day; and\n       (ii) the remaining amount of the substitute check that was \n     charged against the consumer account, if any, together with \n     interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, not \n     later than the 45th calendar day following the business day \n     on which the consumer submits the claim.\n       (d) Availability of Recredit.--\n       (1) Next business day availability.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a bank that provides a recredit to a consumer \n     account under subsection (c) shall make the recredited funds \n     available for withdrawal by the consumer by the start of the \n     next business day after the business day on which the bank \n     recredits the consumer account under subsection (c).\n       (2) Safeguard exceptions.--A bank may delay availability to \n     a consumer of a recredit provided under subsection \n     (c)(2)(B)(i) until the start of either the business day \n     following the business day on which the bank determines that \n     the claim of the consumer is valid, or the 45th calendar day \n     following the business day on which the consumer submits a \n     claim for such recredit in accordance with subsection (b), \n     whichever is earlier, in any of the following circumstances:\n       (A) New accounts.--The claim is made during the 30-day \n     period beginning on the business day on which the consumer \n     account was established.\n       (B) Repeated overdrafts.--Without regard to the charge that \n     is the subject of the claim for which the recredit was made--\n       (i) on 6 or more business days during the 6-month period \n     ending on the date on which the consumer submits the claim, \n     the balance in the consumer account was negative or would \n     have become negative if checks or other charges to the \n     account had been paid; or\n       (ii) on 2 or more business days during such 6-month period, \n     the balance in the consumer account was negative or would \n     have become negative in the amount of $5,000 or more if \n     checks or other charges to the account had been paid.\n       (C) Prevention of fraud losses.--The bank has reasonable \n     cause to believe that the claim is fraudulent, based on facts \n     (other than the fact that the check in question or the \n     consumer is of a particular class) that would cause a well-\n     grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person that the \n     claim is fraudulent.\n       (3) Overdraft fees.--No bank that, in accordance with \n     paragraph (2), delays the availability of a recredit under \n     subsection (c) to any consumer account may impose any \n     overdraft fees with respect to drafts drawn by the consumer \n     on such recredited amount before the end of the 5-day period \n     beginning on the date on which notice of the delay in the \n     availability of such amount is sent by the bank to the \n     consumer.\n       (e) Reversal of Recredit.--A bank may reverse a recredit to \n     a consumer account if the bank--\n       (1) determines that a substitute check for which the bank \n     recredited a consumer account under subsection (c) was in \n     fact properly charged to the consumer account; and\n       (2) notifies the consumer in accordance with subsection \n     (f)(3).\n       (f) Notice to Consumer.--\n       (1) Notice if consumer claim not valid.--If a bank \n     determines that a substitute check subject to the claim of a \n     consumer under this section was in fact properly charged to \n     the consumer account, the bank shall send to the consumer, \n     not later than the business day following the business day on \n     which the bank makes the determination--\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\n       (A) the original check or a copy of the original check \n     (including an image or a substitute check) that--\n       (i) accurately represents all of the information on the \n     front and back of the original check (as of the time at which \n     the original check was truncated); or\n       (ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not \n     the claim of the consumer is valid; and\n       (B) an explanation of the basis for the determination by \n     the bank that the substitute check was properly charged, \n     including a statement that the consumer may request copies of \n     any information or documents on which the bank relied in \n     making the determination.\n       (2) Notice of recredit.--If a bank recredits a consumer \n     account under subsection (c), the bank shall send to the \n     consumer, not later than the business day following the \n     business day on which the bank makes the recredit, a notice \n     of--\n       (A) the amount of the recredit; and\n       (B) the date on which the recredited funds will be \n     available for withdrawal.\n       (3) Notice of reversal of recredit.--In addition to the \n     notice required under paragraph (1), if a bank reverses a \n     recredited amount under subsection (e), the bank shall send \n     to the consumer, not later than the business day following \n     the business day on which the bank reverses the recredit, a \n     notice of--\n       (A) the amount of the reversal; and\n       (B) the date on which the recredit was reversed.\n       (4) Mode of delivery.--A notice described in this \n     subsection shall be delivered by United States mail or by any \n     other means through which the consumer has agreed to receive \n     account information.\n       (g) Other Claims Not Affected.--Providing a recredit in \n     accordance with this section shall not absolve the bank from \n     liability for a claim made under any other provision of law, \n     such as a claim for wrongful dishonor under the Uniform \n     Commercial Code, or from liability for additional damages \n     under section 6 or 10.\n       (h) Scope of Application.--This section shall only apply to \n     customers who are consumers.\n\n     SEC. 8. EXPEDITED RECREDIT PROCEDURES FOR BANKS.\n\n       (a) Recredit Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--A bank may make a claim against an \n     indemnifying bank for expedited recredit for which that bank \n     is indemnified, if--\n       (A) the claimant bank (or a bank that the claimant bank has \n     indemnified) has received a claim for expedited recredit from \n     a consumer under section 7 with respect to a substitute \n     check, or would have been subject to such a claim had the \n     subject consumer account been charged;\n       (B) the claimant bank has suffered a resulting loss or is \n     obligated to recredit the consumer account under section 7 \n     with respect to such substitute check; and\n       (C) production of the original check or a better copy of \n     the original check is necessary to determine the validity of \n     the charge to the consumer account or any warranty claim \n     connected with such substitute check.\n       (2) 120-day period.--Any claim under paragraph (1) may be \n     submitted by the claimant bank to an indemnifying bank before \n     the end of the 120-day period beginning on the date of the \n     transaction that gave rise to the claim.\n       (b) Procedures for Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--To make a claim under subsection (a) for \n     an expedited recredit relating to a substitute check, the \n     claimant bank shall send to the indemnifying bank--\n       (A) a description of--\n       (i) the claim, including an explanation of why the \n     substitute check cannot be properly charged to the consumer \n     account; or\n       (ii) the warranty claim;\n       (B) a statement that the claimant bank has suffered a loss \n     or is obligated to recredit the subject consumer account \n     under section 7, together with an estimate of the amount of \n     the loss or recredit;\n       (C) the reason why production of the original check or a \n     better copy of the original check is necessary to determine \n     the validity of the charge to the consumer account or the \n     warranty claim; and\n       (D) information sufficient for the indemnifying bank to \n     identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.\n       (2) Requirements relating to copies of substitute checks.--\n     If the information submitted by a claimant bank pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) in connection with a claim for an expedited \n     recredit includes a copy of any substitute check for which \n     any such claim is made, the claimant bank shall take \n     reasonable steps to ensure that any such copy cannot be--\n       (A) mistaken for the legal equivalent of the check under \n     section 4(b); or\n       (B) sent or handled by any bank, including the indemnifying \n     bank, as a forward collection or returned check.\n       (3) Claim in writing.--\n       (A) In general.--An indemnifying bank may, in the \n     discretion of the bank, require the claimant bank to submit \n     the information required by paragraph (1) in writing, \n     including a copy of the written or electronically submitted \n     claim, if any, that the consumer provided in accordance with \n     section 7(b).\n       (B) Means of submission.--An indemnifying bank that \n     requires a submission of information under subparagraph (A) \n     may permit the claimant bank to make the submission \n     electronically, if the claimant bank has agreed to \n     communicate with the indemnifying bank in that manner.\n       (c) Recredit by Indemnifying Bank.--\n       (1) Prompt action required.--Not later than 10 business \n     days after the business day on which an indemnifying bank \n     receives a claim under subsection (a) from a claimant bank \n     with respect to a substitute check, the indemnifying bank \n     shall--\n       (A) provide, to the claimant bank, the original check (with \n     respect to such substitute check) or a copy of the original \n     check (including an image or a substitute check) that--\n       (i) accurately represents all of the information on the \n     front and back of the original check (as of the time at which \n     the original check was truncated); or\n       (ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine that the claim of \n     the bank is not valid;\n       (B) recredit the claimant bank for the amount of the claim \n     up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if \n     applicable; or\n       (C) provide information to the claimant bank as to why the \n     indemnifying bank is not obligated to comply with \n     subparagraph (A) or (B).\n       (2) Recredit does not abrogate other liabilities.--\n     Providing a recredit under this subsection to a claimant bank \n     with respect to a substitute check shall not absolve the \n     indemnifying bank from liability for claims brought under any \n     other law or from additional damages under section 6 or 10 \n     with respect to such check.\n       (3) Refund to indemnifying bank.--If a claimant bank \n     reverses, in accordance with section 7(e), a recredit \n     previously made to a consumer account under section 7(c), or \n     otherwise receives a credit or recredit with regard to such \n     substitute check, the claimant bank shall promptly refund to \n     any indemnifying bank any amount previously advanced by the \n     indemnifying bank in connection with such substitute check.\n       (d) Production of Original Check or a Sufficient Copy \n     Governed by Section 6(d).--If the indemnifying bank provides \n     the claimant bank with the original check or a copy of the \n     original check (including an image or a substitute check) \n     under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section, section 6(d) \n     shall govern any right of the indemnifying bank to any \n     repayment of any funds that the indemnifying bank has \n     recredited to the claimant bank pursuant to subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 9. DELAYS IN AN EMERGENCY.\n\n       Delay by a bank beyond the time limits prescribed or \n     permitted by this Act is excused if the delay is caused by \n     interruption of communication or computer facilities, \n     suspension of payments by another bank, war, emergency \n     conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances \n     beyond the control of a bank, and if the bank uses such \n     diligence as the circumstances require.\n\n     SEC. 10.
