Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes to lay out \nthe schedule for today. This morning, the Senate will have a period of \nmorning business for up to 60 minutes. Last night's orders provided \nthat the first 30 minutes will be controlled by the majority and the \nfinal 30 minutes will be controlled by the minority.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will begin consideration of \nIDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education reauthorization bill, \nS. 1248. We will consider that bill under a previously agreed to order, \nwhich provides for a limited number of amendments per side. Chairman \nGregg will be here to manage the bill on this side.\n  I expect there will be votes throughout the course of the day in \nrelation to those amendments. We should be able to complete our work on \nthis bill either late today or early tomorrow.\n  This morning, I wanted to again comment on the Executive Calendar and \nthe mounting number of nominations. It is an important issue and \nimportant to our Nation and to the way we are viewed around the world. \nSo I want to review the process again. I mentioned yesterday morning \nsome of the specific pending ambassadorial nominations awaiting our \naction, in addition to the 32 judicial nominations. I know the \ndistinguished assistant Democratic leader mentioned these ambassador \nnominations later in the day yesterday. Again, I want to restate what I \nmentioned yesterday morning. There are eight nominations for \nambassadorships that are pending on the calendar. These nominations \nhave been presented, have gone through committee, and are simply \nawaiting action on the floor of the Senate. It is not one, two, three, \nfour, or five--it is eight. That includes ambassadorships to Sweden, \nBrazil, Finland, Romania, South Africa, Nepal, Poland, and Northern \nIreland.\n\n  I know of a concern at this time by a Member on our side of the aisle \nwith respect to one of these eight nominees; however, I don't believe \nthere are concerns on either side of the aisle with respect to the \nremaining seven nominations. So we are prepared to confirm these other \nnominations and allow them to begin their important work for the United \nStates of America, the work that awaits them at their posts in the \ncountries I mentioned. Each one of these is important and significant. \nWe are ready to move with them.\n  I do want to restate the intention of bringing it to the Senate floor \nyesterday, and that was that we need to work together on the \nnominations. It is really as simple as that. Eight nominations have \ngone through the entire vetting process up to this point, and they are \nsimply awaiting action here on the floor of the Senate. We are prepared \nto confirm seven of those eight today.\n  I will also mention that this is true with respect to a number of \njudges. We\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\nhave 32 pending judicial nominations as well. Ultimately, once we \nfigure out some way to allow these nominations to be considered, I am \nconfident that most, or many, are going to receive unanimous votes if \nthis body is just given the opportunity to vote.\n  I guess my point is, as I look at the 8 nominations and the 32 \nnominations, I urge my colleagues not to take this sort of blanket or \nscorched earth policy of not letting anybody through at all. We need to \nbe reasonable and we need to work together on these nominations. If \nthere is a concern, and if there are certain nominations that are not \nbeing considered, there are a lot of different ways we can get \nattention to those individuals. But this sort of blanket holding things \nback is something we need to address.\n  I hope the nominations, many of which are probably cleared on both \nsides, are not held hostage by a few. On this side of the aisle, we are \nprepared to consider the ambassadors, we are prepared to consider the \njudges, and we are prepared to vote on the chairmen of a whole range of \ncommittees, such as the Consumer Products Safety Commission, HUD \nnominations, and the list goes on. It is time for good faith and it is \ntime to do our constitutional duty. These nominations are sent to us to \nbe voted upon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5242-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ABUSE OF IRAQI PRISONERS\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I want to also mention that yesterday the \nSenate Armed Services Committee held a day-long hearing to learn more \nabout the abuse of the Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison. Many \nof us did not see all of the testimony, but we were able to review it \nover the course of the day. The committee received detailed testimony \nfrom Major General Antonio Taguba, the senior officer who investigated \nand reported on the Abu Ghraib prison abuses, and from a range of other \nDefense Department officials.\n  Today, the Intelligence Committee will be holding a closed hearing to \nexplore matters under their jurisdiction related to these incidents. As \nwe know, both committees met last week in a similar fashion. This \nafternoon, from 2 to approximately 5 o'clock, in S. 407, there will be \nan opportunity for all Senators to review photographs and evidence \nrelated to the prisoner abuse scandal. We will have the opportunity to \nview them. They will be there from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. in S-407, after \nwhich they will be returned.\n\n  As I stated yesterday, it is our expectation that the Senate will be \napprised of the ongoing investigations being conducted by the \nDepartment of Defense and of all the actions being taken to ensure \nthese incidents never occur again.\n  To that end, I simply wish to reflect my perspective that the Defense \nDepartment has been very responsive to our requests. Secretary \nRumsfeld, General Myers, and their senior aides have updated us as \nevents have unfolded, and they have been attentive to the Senate's \nrequests and to their needs.\n  As the President said the other day, Secretary Rumsfeld--I agree with \nthe President--has done a superb job as Secretary of Defense in very \ntrying and challenging times. I am confident he is taking action to \naddress these deplorable acts in a deliberate manner, in a transparent \nmanner, and is taking all measures to ensure that these acts will never \noccur again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5242-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EXTENDING CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY OF NICHOLAS BERG\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to extend my condolences to the \nfamily of Nicholas Berg who, as we all know, was murdered yesterday in \nIraq by kidnappers. We grieve for him, and we grieve for his family.\n  At the same time, the actions of his murderers are a reminder to us \nof what all our soldiers on a daily basis are undergoing.

Mr. President, I wish to comment, because I did not have \nthe opportunity last night, on the FSC/ETI JOBS bill that was passed \nlast night after a long time on the floor and after a number of \namendments, an approximately equal number considered from the \nRepublican and Democratic side. It is a real achievement for this body. \nIt was passed, and it is critical to accelerating jobs and production \nof jobs in this country.\n  The bill we passed will bring our trade and tax laws into compliance \nwith our trade agreements finally. As many of my colleagues know, the \nEuropeans are already imposing tariffs on our exports. That Euro tax \nstarted in March at 5 percent, and until we act--we have acted in the \nSenate, and now the House must act, but we must act as a Congress--\nthese will increase 1 percent each month if we do not act.\n  I do want to mention the energy provisions that are part of this bill \nthat were added on the Senate floor--too many for me to refer to now \nbut provisions such as tax credits for the production of electricity \nfrom renewable sources, such as wind and solar. It contains tax \nincentives to promote the production and use of alternative fuels motor \nvehicles using natural gas. It includes added incentives to promote the \nuse of clean coal and advanced clean coal technology. There are \nimportant incentives to increase the supply of natural gas, and the \nlist goes on.\n  The Senate has acted, and I look forward to the House passing its \nversion of this legislation so that the House and Senate can go to \nconference and we can produce a conference bill without much delay and \nbring it back to the Senate.\n  There is a lot going on in the Senate both on and off the floor. I \nappreciate the cooperation of my colleagues as we move America forward.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning the distinguished majority \nleader made some comments regarding ambassadorial nominations. This is \nan important issue, and I thought I would take a minute to talk about \nit and respond to some of the concerns we heard expressed on the floor \nover the last several days.\n  Last Thursday, I was pleased the Senate confirmed 20 ambassadors, \nincluding Ambassador Negroponte for the tough assignment in Iraq after \nJune 30. I note Ambassador Negroponte's nomination was completed with \nnear record speed, given that he was confirmed 1 week after he was \nnominated by the President. The other 19 ambassadors were confirmed \nless than a week after they were reported out of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  By confirming those 19, the Senate filled three vacant U.S. \nEmbassies. We had hoped to confirm other career Foreign Service \nofficers for the vacancies that exist, including the Embassy in Nepal, \nwhich has been the site of some considerable violence over the last \nseveral months. Unfortunately, I am told there is still an objection to \nhis confirmation from the Republican side, meaning the Embassy will \ncontinue to be vacant for the foreseeable future.\n  At the moment, I am told the State Department has nearly 170 \nEmbassies around the world. Eight are currently vacant, meaning they \nhave no confirmed ambassador. Of those eight, the President has chosen \nnot to fill two of them, and two are currently too dangerous to fill. \nOne is awaiting action in the Foreign Relations Committee, and the \nRepublicans are objecting to another. The last two, in Sweden and \nFinland, are vacant because the political appointees who previously \nserved in those posts did not serve out the terms they were committed \nto serve.\n  Last week, several of our Republican friends noted that the vacancies \nsend a negative signal to these countries. I hope the President will \nmove with dispatch to fill these vacancies as soon as possible. I also \nhope the President will work with us to address another problem: \nAmbassadors pulled out of the duties for which they were confirmed so \nthat they can assume assignments in or related to Iraq.\n  Here are three examples. Our Ambassador to the Philippines has not \nbeen in Manila for the last several months, even though that country, \nwhich is hosting American forces that are training Filipino forces, \njust went through a\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\ntight national election. Our Ambassador to Kuwait is resident in \nBaghdad. And our Ambassador to the Bahrain has been in Iraq since \nFebruary.\n  That is not to say these jobs they are performing in Iraq are not \nimportant; they are. But if we are going to come to the floor and call \nattention to problems filling vacancies in the diplomatic corps, we \nought to be sure we are considering the whole picture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5243-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5243-S5244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISCOUNT CARD\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this morning in the New York Times, there \nwas yet another reminder of the great difficulty seniors are having in \ndealing with the Medicare prescription drug discount card, so-called. I \nnoticed with some amusement a number of our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle came to the floor highly critical of those of us who \nhave expressed skepticism and concern about the drug card. Some have \neven expressed the belief that our motivation in coming to the floor to \ntalk about these shortcomings in the drug card and the prescription \ndrug benefit were politically motivated.\n  The New York Times has an article this morning quoting people who \nhave nothing to do with politics. The title of the article is ``73 \nOptions for Medicare Plan Fuel Chaos, Not Prescriptions.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 12, 2004]\n\n       73 Options for Medicare Plan Fuel Chaos, Not Prescription\n\n                            (By John Leland)\n\n       When Mildred Fruhling and her husband lost their \n     prescription drug coverage in 2001, they suddenly faced drug \n     bills of $7,000 a year. Mrs. Fruhling, now 76, began \n     scrambling to find discounts on the Internet, by mail order, \n     from Canada and through free samples from her doctors.\n       ``It's the only way I can continue to have some ease in my \n     retirement,'' she said.\n       Last week, when the federal government rolled out a new \n     discount drug program, Mrs. Fruhling studied her options with \n     the same thoroughness. What she found, she said, was \n     confusion: 73 competing drug discount cards, each providing \n     different savings on different medications, and all subject \n     to change.\n       ``I personally feel I can do better on my own,'' she said. \n     But she added, ``At this point, I don't think anyone can make \n     an evaluation.''\n       Even before they go into effect on June 1, the cards--which \n     are approved by Medicare but offered by various companies and \n     organizations--have been the subject of heated political \n     debate, an AARP advertising campaign about how confusing they \n     are and anxious speculation from those they are supposed to \n     help. Among retirees of different income groups interviewed \n     last week, the initial reaction was incomprehension.\n       ``Even the person who came to explain it to us didn't \n     understand it,'' said Mary Shen, 77, at the Whittaker Senior \n     Center on Manhattan's Lower East side. ``It's not fair to \n     expect seniors, who have enough difficulties already, to have \n     to figure this out.''\n       Shirley Brauner, 75, pushed a metal walker through the \n     center's lunchroom. ``All I've got to say is they confuse the \n     elderly, including me,'' she said. ``I'm furious. They're \n     taking advantage of the seniors. How can the seniors \n     understand it?''\n       The prescription drug discount cards are a prelude to the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization \n     Act, which will provide broad drug coverage starting in 2006. \n     The federal government projects that 7.3 million of \n     Medicare's 41 million participants will sign up for the \n     cards.\n       Those who wish to do so, however, face the daunting task of \n     choosing the right card.\n       ``What it's like is a bunch of confusion,'' said Katharine \n     Roberts, 77, who said she had not been to a movie in six \n     years, in part because of her drug expenses. ``You might find \n     you really need three cards, and you can only choose one.''\n       The cards are a 19-month stopgap measure to provide \n     discounts of 10 percent to 25 percent for Medicare \n     participants who have no other prescription drug coverage. \n     In addition, low-income participants are eligible for \n     subsidies of $600 a year.\n       The Department of Health and Human Services approved 28 \n     companies or organization to issue cards; among them are \n     AARP, insurance companies and health maintenance \n     organizations. Cards cost up to $30 a year. Each card \n     provides different discounts on different drugs, and is \n     accepted by different pharmacies. Participants can choose \n     only one.\n       To help people sort through the options, Medicare and a \n     company called DestinationRx set up a database on its Web \n     site, medicare.gov, that lists the prices charged under \n     various plans for whatever medications a user types in. \n     People can get similar help by telephone at 1-800-MEDICAR. \n     But some providers complained that the prices on the site \n     were inaccurate, and some cards are not listed at all.\n       For many retirees, it is too much.\n       ``I'm 85, do I have to go through this nonsense?'' asked \n     Florence Daniels, a retired engineer who said she received \n     less than $1,000 a month from Social Security, of which she \n     paid $179 a month for supplemental medical insurance. She \n     gets drugs through a New York State program, which provides \n     any prescription for $20 or less. To make ends meet and \n     afford her drugs, she said she bought used clothing and put \n     off buying new glasses. Some of her friends travel by bus to \n     Canada to buy drugs; others do without, she said.\n       Ms. Daniels did not use the government Web site to compare \n     drug cards, in part because she cannot afford a computer. \n     ``I'm trying to absorb all the information, but it's \n     ridiculous,'' she said. ``Not just ridiculous, it's scary. If \n     there was a single card and it was administered by Medicare, \n     and it got the cost of drugs down--wonderful, marvelous. But \n     with these cards, the only thing we know is that we'll have \n     to pay money to other people to administer what we can get \n     and can't get.''\n       The discount program, which is financed largely by the \n     cards' sponsors, reflects the Bush administration's desire to \n     open Medicare to market principles without allowing \n     participants to import drugs from other countries, which many \n     Democrats favored.\n       Mark B. McClellan, an administrator at the Center for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the complexity of the \n     plan encouraged competition. ``We're seeing more plans \n     offering better benefits,'' he said, estimating that people \n     will be able to save 15 percent or more using the cards.\n       But the complexity of choices will keep many people away \n     from the program, said Marilyn Moon, director of health at \n     the American Institutes for Research, a nonprofit research \n     organization in Washington.\n       Often, the discount provided by the cards is not as good as \n     what people can get from exiting state programs, union plans \n     or consumer groups, said Robert M. Hayes, president of the \n     Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit organization that helps \n     individuals with Medicare problems.\n       Sydney Bild, 81, a retired doctor in Chicago, compared the \n     discount cards with the prices he paid ordering his drugs by \n     mail from Canada. Dr. Bild pays $4,000 to $5,000 for year for \n     five medications. When he checked the government Web site, he \n     said the best plans were about 50 percent to 60 percent \n     higher than what he was paying.\n       But Dr. Bild said his main objection to the new plans was \n     that companies could change prices on drugs, or change the \n     drugs covered. Medicare requires plans to cover only one drug \n     in each of 209 common categories. Consumers can change cards \n     only once a year. Committing to a card is ``like love--it's a \n     sometime thing,'' Dr. Bild said ``What if I chose one? They \n     could drop my drugs two weeks later.''\n       Companies began soliciting customers for their discount \n     drug cards last week. When the first pamphlets arrived at \n     Beverly Lowy's home in New York City, Ms. Lowy said, she \n     looked at them carefully. She does not have drug coverage and \n     last year spent about $3,000 on prescription drugs. but the \n     more brochures she read, Ms. Lowy said, the less clear things \n     became.\n       ``You really have to be a rocket scientist,'' Ms. Lowy, 71, \n     said. ``It takes time, energy, and you don't even save money. \n     I thought, `This one is offering this, this one is offering \n     that.' Finally I decided this isn't for me.''\n       At the Leonard Covello Senior Center in East Harlem, the \n     new cards seemed opaque. Ramon Velez, 72, a retired taxi \n     driver, said he had watched AARP advertisements in which \n     people read the dense language of the federal Medicare bill.\n       ``I was laughing at the people in the ads, but it's true,'' \n     Mr. Velez said ``Everyone's confused.''\n       Mr. Velez receives $763 a month from Social Security, and \n     often skips his psoriasis medication because he cannot afford \n     the $45 co-payment under his Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan. He \n     wondered if the new drug cards could save him money.\n       ``But it's very confusing,'' he said ``I'd go to the Social \n     Security office to ask about the cards, but I don't think \n     they'd know.''\n       Alejandro Sierra, 67 a retired barber, paced around the \n     center's pool table. Mr Sierra takes six medications for \n     diabetes and complications from cataracts and colon cancer, \n     and sometimes skips a medication because he cannot afford it.\n       ``I'm interested in the cards,'' he said. ``But I can't \n     figure it out on the computer, because I can't see.''\n       Carlos Lopez, the director of the center, said the cards \n     had so far produced little but anxiety. Mr. Lopez asked \n     participants to bring any applications to him before signing \n     them, and warned them about people selling phony cards.\n       ``They're not nervous, but concerned,'' he said. ``They \n     feel, why now? Why do I suddenly need a card for \n     medications?''\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, to excerpt from this article, it talks \nabout:\n\n       Last week, when the federal government rolled out a new \n     discount drug program, Mrs. Fruhling--\n\n  Mildred Fruhling studied her options with the same thoroughness with \nwhich she has been reviewing all of this now for some time. ``What she \nfound,'' according to the article, ``was confusion: 73 competing drug \ndiscount cards,\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\neach providing different savings on different medications, and all \nsubject to change.''\n  Quoting Mrs. Fruhling:\n\n       ``I personally feel I can do better on my own,'' she said. \n     But she added, ``At this point, I don't think anyone can make \n     an evaluation.''\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Even before they go into effect on June 1, the cards--which \n     are approved by Medicare but offered by various companies and \n     organizations--have been the subject of heated political \n     debate, an AARP advertising campaign about how confusing they \n     are and anxious speculation from those they are supposed to \n     help.\n       Among retirees of different income groups interviewed last \n     week, the initial reaction was incomprehensible.\n\n  It goes on to quote Mrs. Florence Daniels, a retired engineer who \ngets less than $1,000 a month from Social Security. She did not use the \nGovernment Web site that is currently available to compare drug cards, \nin part because she cannot afford a computer. She states:\n\n       I'm trying to absorb all the information, but it's \n     ridiculous. Not just ridiculous, it's scary. If there was a \n     single card and it was administered by Medicare, and it got \n     the cost of drugs down, wonderful, marvelous. But with these \n     cards, the only thing we know is that we'll have to pay money \n     to other people to administer what we can get and what we \n     can't get.\n\n  Sidney Bild is another retiree quoted in the article, a retired \ndoctor in Chicago. He compared the drug discount cards with prices he \npaid ordering his drugs by mail from Canada. Dr. Bild pays $4,000 to \n$5,000 a year for five medications. When he checked the Government Web \nsite, he said the best plans were about 50 to 60 percent higher than he \nwas paying.\n  At the Leonard Covello Senior Center in East Harlem, the article \nquotes another senior, Ramon Velez, a 72-year-old taxi driver who is \nretired. He said:\n\n       I was laughing at the people in the ads [that I have seen \n     on television] but it's true. Everyone's confused.\n\n  That summarizes what many of us have expressed now for some time. \nPeople are confused. They are terribly frustrated. They are anxious. \nThey do not want to have to deal with 73 different options and there is \nchaos as a result. Unfortunately, the Congress had an opportunity to \nside with seniors or side with the drug companies, and clearly this is \na drug company benefit, this is a drug company program. It has nothing \nto do with helping seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5244-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5244-S5245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COVER THE UNINSURED\n\n   Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this week is ``Cover the Uninsured \nWeek.'' Today, and for the rest of this week, in all 50 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, Americans will take part in nearly 1,500 public \nevents to call attention to the growing number of Americans without \nhealth insurance and the growing price they, and all of us, pay for the \ngaping holes in America's health care safety net.\n   The nonpartisan campaign is co-chaired by former Presidents Gerald \nFord and Jimmy Carter and supported by a diverse coalition of \norganizations representing business owners, union members, educators, \nhealth consumers, hospitals, health insurers, physicians, nurses, \nreligious leaders and others. It is also endorsed by several former \nSurgeons General and Health and Human Services Secretaries from both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations.\n   This is the second ``Cover the Uninsured Week.'' Unfortunately, the \nproblem has only gotten worse in the last year. Last year, nearly 44 \nmillion Americans, including 8.5 million children, had no health \ninsurance. That is more than 15 percent of all Americans. Tens of \nmillions more Americans were uninsured for at least part of the year. \nIn my State, South Dakota, 12 percent of the people have no health \ninsurance.\n   Most uninsured Americans go to work every day. In fact, many work \ntwo or three jobs. But their employers do not offer health coverage, or \nthey cannot afford the premiums and other costs. And they cannot afford \nto buy private coverage on their own. So they, and their families, live \nwith the daily dread that one serious illness or accident would wipe \nthem out financially.\n   Last summer, I received an e-mail from a father who lives every day \nwith that fear. He lives in South Dakota. He and his wife asked me not \nto use their names or the name of her employer because they do not want \nto risk losing her job and the very meager health benefits it provides.\n\n  This couple has two children, both in high school. When the father e-\nmailed me last summer, he had just spent hours in a hospital emergency \nroom. He went to the hospital because he thought he might be having a \nheart attack. He ended up leaving without seeing a doctor because he \nwas afraid he might end up with a medical bill he could not pay.\n  He said that his chest pains started around midnight on a Saturday \nnight. He asked his son, the only other person at home at the time, to \ntake him to the hospital. Before he left home, the father grabbed a \nfile folder containing his last 5 years' worth of tax returns. Why did \nhe do this?\n  Two years earlier, his son had been hit by a car, and the family \nended up with $34,000 in medical bills. The father did not want anyone \nat the hospital to think he was trying to take advantage of them when \nhe warned them that he would not be able to pay another huge medical \nbill. After they arrived at the hospital, the father sat in the waiting \nroom for 3 hours waiting to talk to someone in the hospital's business \ndepartment. Before he accepted any treatment, he wanted to be sure it \nwas not going to bankrupt his family.\n  But there was no one in the business office in the middle of the \nnight on a weekend. So he sat there for 3 hours, clutching his tax \nreturns, and praying that he was not having a heart attack. Finally, a \nnurse came out, spoke to him for a few minutes, and told him he was \nprobably just having a panic attack. So he went home. To this day, he \ndoes not know if what he suffered was a panic attack or a mild heart \nattack. He still has not seen a doctor.\n  This man and his family are not even counted among the nearly 44 \nmillion Americans without health insurance. They used to have family \nhealth coverage through his employer, but 3 years ago, that company \nmoved out of State. He has been self-employed ever since. Now, they get \ntheir health insurance through his wife's job.\n  I hear, as I heard on the floor yesterday, from some of our \ncolleagues that in this country, thank goodness, we never have to \nration health insurance. If this is not rationing health care, health \ninsurance, I do not know what is. What does one call it when a person \nsits at midnight on a Saturday night with 5 years of tax records to \nprove they do not have the ability to pay and then walk out not knowing \nif they had a heart attack. Tell someone today that is not rationing \nhealth care. A family income for this particular family is about \n$13,000.\n  Two years ago, this family paid $2,800 in premiums for family \ncoverage and another $5,800 out of pocket for medical costs that \nweren't covered--$8,600 in all. Their family income that year was about \n$13,000.\n  This is what that father wrote to me in his e-mail last summer:\n\n       Our family hasn't seen a dentist for over 3 years. I \n     haven't seen a dentist in nearly 10 years. Simply cannot pay \n     the cost. My son needs glasses. My wife has a broken tooth. I \n     haven't seen a doctor in 15 years.\n       We all work hard and play by the rules and cannot make ends \n     meet. The last three years have been devastating to us. We \n     will probably lose our house because we cannot afford to keep \n     it up. We are a sad case and getting more depressed every \n     day. I am embarrassed and ashamed to even talk about it. I \n     just wanted you to know about the suffering many of us are \n     enduring.\n\n  Recently, a woman wrote a long letter to a paper in my State, the \nEagle Butte News, about her sister. As a Native American, her sister \nwas theoretically guaranteed free health care from the United States \nGovernment, through the Indian Health Service.\n  Last June, the sister went to see an IHS doctor because of severe \nstomach pains. The doctor told her she had a bacterial infection and \nsent her home with an antibiotic. A month later, the pain was so \nintense she could no longer eat. When she went to IHS clinics, she was \ngiven a shot for pain and some antacids and told there was no money to \nsend her to a specialist. By October, she had lost 70 pounds. Last \nNovember, she finally saw a different doctor and got an accurate \ndiagnosis. By then, her stomach cancer was inoperable. She died on \nApril 7.\n  In her letter to the editor, her sister wrote:\n\n       She was prepared to accept her fate, which she did bravely \n     and with courage. But I am\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\n     not going to accept her death quietly because her life was \n     cut short and I don't want to see others suffer the same fate \n     that she did.\n\n  As terrible as these stories are, these people are technically among \nthe lucky ones. The father who sent me that e-mail has what amounts to \ncatastrophic health coverage through his wife's job. American Indians \nare promised health care by the Federal Government, even though that \npromise is routinely broken.\n  The nearly 44 million uninsured Americans have even less than that. \nNone of us should accept this quietly.\n  The lack of health insurance has devastating consequences for \nuninsured individuals, for families, and for our Nation as a whole. \nAccording to the National Institute of Medicine:\n  Children and adults without health insurance are less likely to \nreceive preventive care and early diagnosis of illness. They live \nsicker and die younger than those with insurance.\n  Eighteen thousand Americans a year die prematurely because of lack of \nhealth insurance.\n   Families suffer emotionally and financially when even one member is \nuninsured.\n  Communities suffer as the cost of uncompensated care is shifted onto \ndoctors, hospitals and taxpayers.\n  The Nation suffers economically. The Institute of Medicine estimates \nthat lack of health insurance costs America between $65 billion and \n$130 billion a year in lost productivity and other costs.\n  The National Institute of Medicine has called for universal health \ncoverage for all Americans by 2010. Democrats have been leading the \nfight for universal health coverage in America for decades. We created \nMedicare.\n   We welcome Republicans' concern about the rising number of Americans \nwithout health insurance, and we want to work with them to find \nsolutions. But the proposals offered by the President and congressional \nRepublicans will not work.\n  A recent study concluded that the President's proposals would only \nreduce the number of uninsured Americans by between 2.1 and 2.4 million \npeople out of the 44 million who have no health insurance. That is not \neven as many people as have lost their health coverage during his \nadministration. We have to think bigger, for if we ``cover the \nuninsured'' at that rate, we will continue to lose ground.\n  Moreover, some of the President's ideas would actually make matters \nworse. According to CBO, the President's plan to create ``association \nhealth plans'' would decrease the number of uninsured Americans by only \nabout 600,000 people--600,000 out of nearly 44 million. But it would \nincrease premiums for 80 percent of employees of small businesses. It \nwould also exempt ``association health plans'' from important State \nregulations, including solvency requirements and other protections.\n  The administration's proposed health care tax credit is far too low \nto help most people who need help. It also ignores two fundamental \nproblems: Premiums for individual health care coverage are far too high \nfor most Americans, and, if you are not young and in good health, you \nmay not be able to purchase an individual health insurance policy at \nany price.\n  Health savings accounts are no solution, either. They are a tax \nshelter that primarily benefit the healthy and the wealthy--those who \nare least likely to be uninsured. A new study by an M.I.T. expert \nreleased just this week concludes that the President's health savings \naccount proposal would actually increase the number of uninsured \nAmericans by 350,000--and cost taxpayers $25 billion. There are better \nideas.\n  After that father sent me that e-mail, we told him about the CHIP \nprogram. Today, his two children have health insurance through that \nprogram.\n  In the words of that South Dakota father;\n\n       The CHIP program is a tremendous safety net for families. \n     At least now, when my children are sick, I can take them to \n     the doctor. It takes some of the fear away. And, when you \n     walk in to the doctor's office or the hospital and show them \n     that card, they treat you like a human being.\n\n  The CHIP program is working. We should continue it--and our other \nsuccessful Federal health care programs--and ensure they are adequately \nfunded.\n  We recently introduced a bill that could significantly reduce the \nnumber of uninsured Americans and help small business owners create new \njobs at the same time. The Small Business Health Tax Credit--S. 2245--\nwould provide small businesses with tax credits to cover up to 50 \npercent of the cost of their employees' health insurance. Businesses \nwith 36 to 50 workers would get a tax credit worth 30 percent of their \nemployee health care costs. Companies with 26 to 35 workers would get a \n40-percent tax credit. And companies with 25 or fewer employees would \nget the full 50-percent tax credit. This is a far more generous tax \ncredit than what small businesses can claim now.\n  Business owners and entrepreneurs are working hard to make a profit--\nbut their profits are being eaten up by out-of-control health care \ncosts.\n  Finally, later this morning, my colleagues and I are going to \nannounce a bold new commitment that will enable the Federal Government \nto offer every American access to quality health care at an affordable \nprice within 2 years. We look forward to working with our Republican \ncolleagues to make that commitment a reality.\n  I recently received another letter from a woman in South Dakota. She \nwrote:\n\n       I have noticed that gas stations continue to place spare-\n     change jars on counters for fundraisers, and small towns \n     often hold pancake breakfasts for the same reason. However, \n     rather than raising money for band trips and sports, they are \n     increasingly for a local uninsured person's health care.\n\n  There are better ways. Working together, we can tap the spirit of \ncommunity and compassion those spare-change jars represent, and we can \nfind ways to ensure that every American is able to see a doctor when he \nor she is sick.\n  We do not have to be the only major industrialized nation in the \nworld that fails to guarantee health care for all its citizens. We can \ndo better, and none of us should rest until we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5245-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5245]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina.)

Mr. President, I would like to take the first 10 minutes \nof our 30 minutes and talk a little bit about the uninsured and talk a \nlittle bit about insurance, of course. I am pleased this is uninsured \nweek, that we are focusing on that problem of uninsured folks. I think \nit is a great thing that we ought to be doing. There are some \nalternatives that we can pursue.\n  I have been particularly involved in the rural health care aspect, \nbeing from Wyoming where, of course, almost all of our health care is \nrural health care. We have had good results in our Medicare bill that \nwas passed last year. We have equity pay for the providers in that \nbill. We have assistance for those serving underserved areas. We have a \nnumber of things that are very necessary. I am pleased they are there.\n  We have been focusing on Medicare, of course, because that is the \nGovernment's responsibility directly. We have made some good progress \non that. Among other things, we seek to help seniors with \npharmaceutical costs. We have a program out there. I am a little \ndisappointed the minority leader is nothing but critical of it. It is \nout there and we ought to be trying to make it work now rather than \ntrying to oppose it for political reasons. I think that is a mistake.\n  There are opportunities out there for the elderly to enjoy a \nconsiderable amount of assistance, particularly low-income people, with \nthe $600 assistance in addition to a 20-percent reduction. The fact \nthat there are 70 cards out there--all you have to do is call 1-800-\nMedicare and get the advice that is necessary to do it. I wish we \ncould support something instead of totally always being critical.\n\n  In any event, we have worked on those, and I think it is time that we\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nlook, now, at the broader aspects of health care. That includes many \nother things. We have a great system. We have probably the best health \ncare system in the world. However, if that system gets in the position \nwhere access is limited by the costs, then of course we are not making \nit possible for everyone to participate. That is really where we are.\n  The costs of health care have increased substantially. There are lots \nof reasons for that. One of them is the new equipment that is being \nused, which everybody wants to take advantage of, of course, because it \nis the high-tech stuff.\n  Another reason, obviously, is the liability problem we have tried to \naddress on the floor a number of times, and we have not been able to \nmove past the obstructionism on the other side. The liability problem \nnot only results in the cost of the liability insurance going up, but \nit also results in having more testing, more specialists, more costly \nhealth care simply to avoid the opportunities that people might have to \nsue. So there are a lot of things.\n  I had the opportunity not long ago to talk to the management of one \nof the largest hospitals we have in Wyoming. It was interesting when \nthe financial officer broke down the situation with regard to the \nfunding. First, he talked about the billing level, which, of course, is \nquite above the cost level because they need to bill some more than it \ncosts to make up for those who do not pay. But the point was, they \nbroke down the number of people who were there, the number there in \nMedicare, the number there on Medicaid, the number that had their own \ninsurance, the number that were uninsured, and the emergency ones. Part \nof the problem is Medicare is not paying the full cost, Medicaid does \nnot pay much of the cost at all, so then you get to the uninsured and, \nof course, many of them do not pay, are not able to pay at all, and you \nhave the emergencies, so what happens? It goes to those of us who have \ninsurance.\n  As I go about my State talking to people, I hear more about the cost \nof health insurance than anything else that you talk about in a town \nmeeting. It is largely because of some of those shifts there.\n  As has been pointed out, we have over 40 million Americans who do not \nhave health insurance, and that is unacceptable. We need to do \nsomething about that. The cost of health care--of course we ought not \nto forget that continues to grow almost unchecked. It has grown to $1.6 \ntrillion in 2002, a 9.3-percent increase over the previous year. You \ncannot keep having a 10-percent increase in these costs and yet be able \nto deal with them. The health care cost portion of the gross national \nproduct in 2002 was nearly 15 percent, up from 14 percent the year \nbefore.\n  This is part of it that we ought not forget--the cost of health care. \nWe ought to look at the costs as well as who is going to pay. \nUnfortunately, that is about all we ever talk about--who is going to \npay. There is more to it than that. These rates cannot continue to grow \nat that rate.\n  We have had a considerable amount of planning in our State with \nrespect to the uninsured. We had a group--I am glad there has been a \ntask force here, and we have about 14 percent of our people in Wyoming \nwho are uninsured.\n  It is largely because of the cost. We have a number of things, \nhowever, that have been suggested which I think we ought to take a look \nat. There are some important special recommendations.\n  We could expand public programs such as Medicaid and CHIP. The \nminority leader was just talking about the CHIP program and why it \nshould be such a surprise since it has been there for a good long time. \nIt is one that the States participate in funding. We need to do that. \nIt needs to be funded at the full level by the States.\n  We need to provide a buy-in option for public programs so people have \nan opportunity to buy into these programs that now exist. We need to \nincrease the reimbursement for public programs. They are not paying \ntheir share. Therefore, private insurance goes up, and those people who \ncan't afford it or even come close to affording it are even less likely \nbecause it has gone up more.\n  We need to target tax credits and Federal subsidies. I think tax \ncredits are valuable. That would allow people to take a higher crisis \nsort of a policy.\n  Community health centers that deal with people who aren't able to \nhave insurance and need help is an excellent way to deal with this.\n  Of course, we need to do something to help participation of employer-\nsponsored programs. That is not the only answer because a lot of people \nare self-employed.\n  Of course, we also need to push for personal responsibility for \nhealth. An interesting program has been talked about in Wyoming. It is \na group called the ``Be Well Program.'' They would deal with employer \ngroups that cover their employees. The employees would sign an \nagreement to keep up their own health, to exercise, and do some of the \nthings that we all talk about and which not everyone does. That would \nbe a condition of being insured. It is already in a couple of \ncontracts.\n  There are a lot of things to do, and the task force has a number of \nideas. I think we need to move forward to try to do some things. Most \nof us I don't believe favor a socialist program where the Government \nruns all of the health care programs. That is evidently not the kind of \nthing we want to have because all of the Canadians would come here.\n  But, nevertheless, there needs to be a program that gives an \nopportunity for people to fully participate. I am delighted that we are \nmoving forward with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, thank you for recognizing me. I came out \non the floor to talk for a few minutes about the health care task \nforce, and particularly about association health plans or small \nbusiness health plans.\n  I am very pleased that we are talking about the health care task \nforce report. I want to talk a little bit about the drug discount card \nin part because I think it is important that we talk about it. I want \nmy senior citizens to be aware of this benefit and to use it. I think \nit is something everyone ought to consider. For many of them, it is \ngoing to be the relief they have been looking for many years.\n  I want to say that it is hard for me to understand these attacks \nwhich are occurring on a fundamental level against the discount card. \nWithout question, this card is going to provide relief to tens and tens \nof thousands of people who have been choosing between the other \nnecessities of life and their prescription drugs.\n  There are 200,000 senior citizens in the State of Missouri today who \nare buying prescription drugs entirely out of pocket. It is not very \ngood for them for two reasons: In the first place, they are buying \nentirely out of pocket. They are paying for it entirely on their own. \nIn the second place, they are paying the highest price entirely on \ntheir own. When they walk into the pharmacy to get prescription drugs, \nthey are facing the prescription drug companies alone. They are not \npart of a broader pool that has purchasing power and is able to \nnegotiate a discount over the sticker price of the drugs. So they are \npaying the highest price, and they are paying it entirely out of \npocket. Many of them are the poorest senior citizens. As a result, they \ndo not get the prescription drugs. They get sick, or they take every \nother pill.\n  I have talked personally to scores of people like that over the \nyears. I had a hearing of the Aging Committee that Senator Gregg was \nkind enough to let me hold in Missouri. I had senior citizens come and \ntestify.\n  Everybody in the Senate is familiar with this. This discount card is \ngoing to provide relief. Seniors are going to have access to a variety \nof cards that will give them discounts off the prescription drugs. For \nlower income senior citizens, those receiving retirement of less than \n$1,000 a month, they will get $600 from the Government toward the price \nof the discounted drugs. The average price, which it is for \nprescription drugs, for senior citizens is about $1,400 a year for \nprescription drugs. That person in Missouri right now is paying the \nentire $1,400 out of pocket, and probably more than that since they are \npaying the highest price. With a card, they will go into the pharmacy, \nthe pharmacist will swipe the card through the machine and say: For \nyour Lipitor, which was costing you $80 a\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nmonth, under this card it costs you $65 a month. The first $600 of that \nthis year the Government is paying for it. Instead of paying $1,400, \nwhich you couldn't pay--they get nothing, is what it comes down to--\nthey end up getting a $200 or a $300 discount, and the Government pays \n$600 off of that, and they can afford not to get sick anymore.\n  I think that is pretty important.\n  I understand the concerns on the other side of the aisle that this \nbill isn't Government-dominated enough. I recognize that. They are \nsaying basically this is federally subsidized, but they are buying the \nprescription drugs from private organizations. That is not a good \nthing. It is true. This is federally subsidized, but we are buying the \nprescription drugs from private companies.\n\n  There is a word for a Federal health care plan that pays for health \ncare costs of senior citizens so that they can go to private companies \nand get health care services or goods. Do you know what the word for \nthat is? Medicare. That is what Medicare is. When Medicare was set up \nin 1965, the Government could have gone on and done what it has done \nwith the VA health care system--buy or build new hospitals, hire \nphysicians, and run the whole thing as a Government organization. We \ndidn't do that. What we did instead was set up a system where we would \npay for the cost of Federal health care, but seniors would have a \nchoice of private providers if they wanted. That is what this \nprescription drug plan is about, what it is modeled after.\n  It is going to help tens of thousands of people in my State of \nMissouri at a minimum.\n  I hope we can get behind it and make it work as well as we can \npossibly make it work.\n  Let me switch now to talk a little bit about the health care task \nforce which addresses another huge problem; that is, the rising cost of \nhealth insurance premiums.\n  There are a number of things in this health care task force report. I \nrecommend it to every Member of the Senate.\n  One of the key things about it is that it is designed to attack the \ntrends in the system which are driving those costs up. I really like \nthis. It is time for us to stop concentrating on how we can keep \nfeeding this beast and start getting the beast on a leash, if you will.\n  It is fine to subsidize the cost of health care for people who can't \nafford it. I certainly support it. I just talked about prescription \ndrug costs. But we also need to bring down the costs of health care. \nThere are a lot of things in this report that are designed to do that.\n  Liability reform is one of them. Another is the emphasis in the \nreport on the use of information technology, which is very important. \nHealth care is behind in information technology. If we can get the same \nkind of architecture of technology in health care that we have in other \nparts of the economy, we have the potential to save tens of billions of \ndollars.\n  There is important regulatory reform in the bill that will lower \ncost.\n  I met with a bunch of nurses and nursing students at Southeastern \nMissouri University and asked them what their big concerns were about \nhealth care. I was really surprised. The thing that bothers them the \nmost is the amount of time they have to spend in filling out forms to \ncomply with the oversight of one group or another. It is very \ndemoralizing, and it raises costs.\n  The task force also includes associated health plans, which I want to \ntalk about briefly.\n  Of the people who are uninsured--there are about 43 million--two-\nthirds either own a small business, work for a small business, or are a \ndependent of someone who owns or works for a small business. We can ask \nourselves, why is that? Is it because small businesspeople are more \nchintzy than big businesspeople? Small businesspeople and farmers do \nnot care about their employees as much as the larger businesses? They \ndo not want to buy health care? That is one possibility. But I don't \nthink it is true.\n  The reason many of these people, working people who work for small \nbusinesses, are not getting health insurance is that costs for buying \nhealth insurance are higher for small businesses than they are for \nbigger businesses because the administrative costs cannot be spread \nacross as big a pool. The costs of getting health insurance for someone \nwho runs a small business are about three times per employee what they \nare for someone who runs a big business.\n  Small business health plans allow small businesspeople to pool \ntogether through a national trade association and get health insurance \nas part of a big national pool.\n  My brother owns a Little Tavern restaurant. It is a great place. I \nhave talked about it before in the Senate. If anyone is ever in the St. \nLouis area and wants a good hamburger, give me a call and I will give a \nrecommendation. My brother has a little restaurant. He could join the \nNational Restaurant Association and become like a little division of a \nbig company. He would get health insurance then as part of a 10,000, \n20,000 or 30,000-person pool, the same as the employees of Anheuser-\nBusch, which is located in St. Louis, or the employees of Hallmark, \nwhich is located in Kansas City. It will lower his costs 10 to 20 \npercent by reducing the administrative costs. It would not cost the \ntaxpayers anything because we are not feeding that beast with tax \ndollars. We are empowering people to put the beast on a leash to reduce \ncosts that are driving up health insurance premiums without adding \nanything to quality or accessibility.\n  There is no reason we should not do this. I am pleased it was \nincluded in the task force report. We worked on it. I hope we can get \nit, along with the other things in this report.\n  We have to remember that as the Democratic leader was saying, if \nAmericans are working and do not have health insurance, or they have \nhealth insurance and these costs continue to go up, this is the No. 1 \nthing employees worry about as far as their job is concerned. I have \nhad a lot of folks in the last recession--and I am pleased we are \ncoming out of this now--who lost jobs and said to me, We have families; \nwe have to get our health insurance back. It is very difficult to \nprovide it when premiums go up and up and up all the time.\n  We can do something about it. There are a number of different ideas \nout there. Many of them are in this task force report. I commend it to \nthe Senate. It is time to get these things done. We can all come down \nhere and talk about stories back home of people who are suffering \nbecause of this situation. We need to get something done. It would be a \nhuge step forward if we all said we are going to sit down as a group, \nwe will work something out, we will agree beforehand we will not \nfilibuster everything because we do not like this particular aspect of \nthe package or that particular aspect of the package. We are not going \nto take small things we disagree with in a bill and treat them as if \nthere is some enormous attempt by people--whom we disagree with \nhonestly--to do something that is venal or wrong. These problems are \nbig enough to solve if we try to stick together and agree where we can \nagree and disagree reasonably where we do disagree. They will be \nimpossible to solve if everything becomes a subject of some kind of a \npolitical attack.\n\n  I appreciate the time of the Senate and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Missouri for \nhis advocacy on the part of his constituents and, indeed, all the \nAmerican people, to make sure more have access to good quality health \ncare.\n  I will talk about the work of the task force created by Majority \nLeader Frist, which was chaired by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. \nThis work, over the last number of months, promised a lot in terms of \nnew ideas and new approaches. It will help make sure health care is \naccessible to more Americans.\n  It is amazing, but we spend in this country somewhere between $1.4 \ntrillion and $1.7 trillion on health care. That is a lot of money, even \nin Washington. Most people cannot even get their minds around what $1 \ntrillion is. I promise you, I cannot. But I do know that is an enormous \namount of money.\n  If we ask people who should know about it, they will say there is \nenough money in the health care delivery system in the United States of \nAmerica to make sure everyone has access to\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\nhealth care. The problem is what we call sometimes a ``health care \nsystem'' is not a system but a patchwork of different delivery methods. \nIt is a local taxing jurisdiction, hospital districts, using property \ntaxes in some States, of course supplemented by other taxes, and of \ncourse there is Federal Government-provided health care available, \npartially, at least, through the CHIPS Program, through Medicaid and \nthrough Medicare.\n  We do know there is a tremendous challenge to make sure everyone in \nthis country has access to good quality health care. Those who do not \nhave health insurance represent one of the biggest challenges. One of \nthe things we have learned is this is not so much a challenge of \ngetting everyone insurance. The real question is, How do we make sure \neveryone has access? Even for those who do not have health care \ninsurance, we need to make sure they have access to health care.\n\n  Right now the irony is the Federal Government has already gotten into \nthis area and mandated if you have nowhere else to turn for health \ncare, you know you can always show up at the local emergency room at \nyour hospital and get that health care provided. If you cannot pay for \nit, it is provided without charge to the patient. The problem is, in \nmany major metropolitan areas on any given Friday or Saturday night, \nwhen the demands on the emergency room are great, many emergency rooms \nare on divert status, which means they cannot take anymore patients \nbecause they are full.\n  However, 80 percent of those people being treated in emergency rooms \ncould be and should be more humanely, more efficiently, and less \nexpensively provided health care in some other setting--in a clinic, \nfor example.\n  One of the most amazing things about our health care delivery system \nin our country, while we do compensate--although some argue it is not \nas generous as it should be--we do compensate health care providers for \nproviding health care to people after they are sick, we do a pretty \nlousy job of trying to give people access to what they need in order to \nprevent their getting sick.\n  We have made good strides forward with the Medicare bill we passed \nlast year to provide prescription drugs to many seniors who did not \nhave that. Of course, this Medicare discount drug card Senator Talent \ntalked about is an interim step that leads to the full implementation \nof that program in a couple of years when the vast infrastructure can \nbe created to deliver that system.\n  For example, for someone who has not previously had access to a drug \nlike Lipitor, one of the statin drugs--and there are a number of them; \nthat is just one trade name--that perhaps can prevent someone from \nhaving to have more expensive, invasive, and dangerous surgery, either \nbypass surgery or angioplasty or perhaps placement of a stent, or \nsomething that costs a lot of money to treat if the basic cause that \ncould be prevented is left untreated through the use of prescription \ndrugs.\n  We have made a great step forward to broaden the number of people, to \nincrease the number of people preventive measures are available to. \nThat is smart. We ought to continue along that trend.\n  Mr. President, I ask to be reminded when I have 1 minute remaining of \nmy time.\n  One of the things I believe is a great safety net in this country, \nthat I have come to learn about and see used so well in my State, is \nfederally qualified community health centers. The great thing about \ncommunity health centers is they provide clinical--that is, \nnonemergency room--access to health care in your neighborhood, where \nyou pay based on a sliding scale, based upon your ability to pay. These \nare actually designated health centers by the Federal Government. They \nhave access to a number of important programs, for example, the Federal \n340B Discount Pricing Program. This task force recommends that program \nbe expanded to more people, so we can bring down the price of \nprescription drugs.\n  But these community health centers provide, on a sliding scale, \naccess to care in one's local community, which I think is very \nimportant. I was told by the head of Parkland Hospital, one of the \nlargest public hospitals in Dallas, TX, for example, that people show \nup in the emergency room to have a baby, where they have no health \ninsurance. Because they have no health insurance, and may never have \nseen a doctor before they show up in the emergency room, the risk of \ninjury to that baby--either it being born prematurely or some other \nhealth risk--goes up exponentially.\n  Even though they do not receive any income for it, Parkland Hospital \nroutinely provides prenatal care for mothers, on a free basis, even \nthough they do not get a penny paid by that pregnant mom. One reason is \nbecause they know the cost of 1 day in the neonatal intensive care unit \nat the Parkland Hospital costs about $10,000. Now, of course, I would \nlike to say we would do that from our sheer desire to see healthy \nbabies, but, unfortunately, money drives access.\n  My point is, in this instance what Parkland Hospital, in Dallas \nCounty, has decided to do in a way to help control costs is to ensure \nmore healthy babies are born who do not need access to the neonatal \nintensive care unit, as they provide free prenatal care to these \npregnant moms. But community health centers can make sure this pregnant \nmom has access to somewhere other than the emergency room of the \nhospital in which to get that important prenatal care.\n  We also would increase, as part of this task force report, the number \nof medical volunteers by extending critical Federal tort claims act \nliability coverage. This is an area that I think is very important.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is very important because the medical liability \ncrisis in this country does not only hurt doctors and hospitals, but it \nhurts patients who are denied access to health care. One of the issues \nwe have to deal with--I know the leader has brought it up several \ntimes, and we have been unable to get 60 votes to get an up-or-down \nvote on the merits of the legislation--is medical liability reform.\n  Whether it is increasing access to specialty care, increasing the \nnumber of federally qualified community health clinics, increasing \naccess to prescription drugs by extending the Federal 340B Program, or \ncreating an exemption so religiously sponsored health systems can \ncreate community health systems, integrated health systems, we have to \ndo something about this crisis in this country. It is a crisis of \naccess, not only of insurance. But I think we are well on our way to a \ngood start.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have always believed health care policy \nneeds to be bipartisan, and needs to be ideas driven. So as we talk \nabout health care, I come to the floor to mention an idea our colleague \nSenator Kerry has talked about which I think is especially promising \nfor small business.\n  The reality is, a very high percentage of the uninsured work in small \nbusinesses. These small businesses are dying to cover their people. The \nowners of those small businesses do not get up in the morning and say: \nWe want to be rotten to our workers in not giving coverage. They are \ndying to figure out ways to help their small businesses.\n  Senator Kerry has come up with an idea that I think is really \ninnovative. He has said, given the fact resources are scarce, that \ndollars for trying to address the uninsured, the needs of our small \nbusinesses, are restricted, we ought to target those dollars where they \nare needed the most. He has proposed the Federal Government, with\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\nrespect to small business, concentrate on instances where there are \nvery large bills, bills above $50,000. He would have the Federal \nGovernment step in and pick up about 75 percent of those costs. The \npremiums that would be charged employers and their workers could be \ntrimmed about 10 percent in this fashion.\n  We know it has been documented that those who are particularly in \nneed of assistance when they face these very high bills are a very \nlarge proportion of the health care costs in America. These health care \ncosts are particularly punitive for the small businesses. Small \nbusinesses are always walking on economic tightropes. If one employee \nat a small business gets sick, this can devastate the entire budget of \nthe company for not just health care coverage but the entire coverage \nof the business.\n  I am very pleased Senator Kerry has brought forward this idea. I \nthink it is one that can be supported in a bipartisan way. The \nCongress, over the years, has tried to look at ways to strengthen the \nemployer-based system of coverage. I think we all understand if you are \ntalking about starting scores of new programs, that would be very \ndifficult at this time. I also do not think it is warranted at a time \nwhen we are spending $1.7 trillion on health care. If you divide that \nup by 270 million Americans, it comes to more than $17,000 for a family \nof 4. So we are spending a lot of money.\n  The challenge now is to really zero in on areas where the Government \ncan be best utilized. I think Senator Kerry's proposal with respect to \ntrying to deal with the costs of individuals who work at small \nbusinesses with very high bills is particularly appropriate at this \ntime. It is something I think could be built in a bipartisan way.\n  I will have more to say about this and other proposals in the days \nahead. But as we come to the floor and talk--Democrats and \nRepublicans--about health care, I think we ought to make our policies \nbipartisan. We ought to make them ideas driven. The kind of idea that \nhas been outlined by Senator Kerry with respect to the needs of \nindividuals who work at small businesses with very large bills is the \nkind of thinking that would make a difference now. It is cost \neffective. I think it warrants support on a bipartisan basis.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to lament the fact that we have \nmade no progress in reducing the uninsured since 2001. This is an issue \nwe all need to be working together on because it affects everyone we \nrepresent, every family, every business. In fact, nearly 4 million more \npeople are uninsured today than the day this administration took \noffice.\n  We need to light a fire. We need to have a sense of urgency about \ngetting this done for people. We can do much better than we are doing. \nWe live in the United States of America. We are the greatest, the \nrichest country on the face of the Earth. When we have the will, we can \nmake great things happen. That is what we need to do here.\n  We enacted Social Security in 1935. This program now serves as our \nuniversal retirement, life insurance, and disability insurance system \nfor millions of people. A generation later we passed Medicare, our \nNation's universal health plan for seniors and the disabled. Even \nthough I am very concerned about the recent law that we passed and \nwhether it is a step backward--and I believe it is--the fact is, we put \nin place in 1965 a policy based on a set of values that said, if you \nare 65 or older, if you are disabled, you are going to receive health \ncare.\n  Interestingly, at that time, if we go back and read the record, this \nwas viewed as a compromise, a first step. Originally in 1960, what was \nbeing debated was health care for everyone. Then when there was not the \nsupport to pass that, the compromise was to start with older Americans \nand with the disabled, to provide health care first to them and then to \nopen it up to all of our citizens. Yet today we are not seeing that \nhappening. It is now time to go the last mile. We need to make sure all \nAmericans have the same access to health insurance that we do in the \nSenate.\n  As most colleagues know, approximately 80 percent of the people who \ndon't have health insurance are working--one job, two jobs, three jobs, \nworking very hard to care for their families. They have jobs. They go \nto work. They play by the rules. Unfortunately, health insurance is so \nexpensive, they can't afford it or the business they work for can't \nafford it. We need to value the hard work these people are doing. We \nneed to recognize and ensure that if they work for a living, they have \nthe health insurance they need for themselves and their families.\n  Regrettably, this administration has been basically silent on the \nuninsured. When members of the administration do speak, they are \nnegative and pessimistic about providing access to affordable health \ncare for all Americans. For example, in January of this year, the \nNational Academy of Sciences said that the President and Congress \nshould work to achieve health insurance coverage for all Americans by \n2010. That is a worthy goal, although I would argue too far into the \nfuture.\n  What was the response? The administration's top health official, \nHealth and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said universal \nhealth coverage is ``not realistic . . . I don't think, \nadministratively or legislatively, it's feasible.''\n  Then 2 months later Secretary Thompson went on to minimize the \nNation's uninsured problem by saying:\n\n       Even if you don't have health insurance in America, you get \n     taken care of. That could be defined as universal health \n     care.\n\n  In other words, just go to the emergency room to get your health care \ncoverage.\n  In fact, too many people are doing that now. Sometimes you can just \nget taken care of, but by the time an uninsured patient reaches the \nemergency room, it is often too late to provide lifesaving health care. \nMany of the uninsured forgo less costly preventative care and early \ntreatments, getting sicker as what money they have goes for the rent, \nthe car, the kids, and food.\n  Hospitals in Michigan indicate they have provided over $1 billion in \nhealth care for the uninsured, uncompensated care this last year. Think \nwhat we could do if we could capture that $1 billion and put it into a \nsystem that worked on the front end, that kept people healthy, that \nprovided preventive care, that made sure they could see the doctor in \nhis office or her office rather than having to wait for the emergency \nroom.\n  We can do better than this in the greatest country in the world. I do \nnot think we should throw in the towel. We should not say we can't do \nit, it is not feasible. It is time to create the will. The fact is, we \ncan do it, if we pick the right priorities. We can do the same thing we \ndid when we passed Social Security and Medicare--two great American \nsuccess stories that have provided economic security for people as they \ngrow older and retire and health care for older Americans and the \ndisabled. In my book, that was all about values, about what is \nimportant. This certainly is equally important. We should be \noptimistic. We should join all other modern countries and make sure all \nAmericans have access to affordable health insurance.\n  One of the reasons more and more families can't get health care is \nbecause the costs are spiraling out of control. In fact, from 2000 to \n2003, the average annual cost of premiums doubled, making health \ninsurance out of reach for more and more middle-income families and \nsmall businesses. In 3 years, the costs have doubled. Medical problems, \nin fact, were a factor in nearly half of all nonbusiness bankruptcy \nfilings. Overall, health care costs have gone up nearly 14 percent last \nyear. Meanwhile, workers' earnings increased by only 3 percent. You can \nsee the hole people find themselves in.\n  This is the fifth year in a row premiums outpaced earnings. We all \nknow that one of the reasons health care costs have escalated so fast \nis the spiraling price of prescription drugs. I\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\nhave talked frequently about this. I speak about it and focus on it \nbecause it is such a driver for the costs of health care and health \ninsurance.\n  What has Congress done to fix this problem? Unfortunately, absolutely \nnothing. In fact, the new Medicare law failed to do anything to lower \nprescription drug prices. At the same time approximately 3 million \nretirees will actually lose their prescription drug coverage under this \nnew law. This bill actually takes us backward instead of forward.\n  The only major health care coverage initiative this administration \nhas proposed is actually for the Iraqi people. Our country has made a \ncommitment to moving forward with universal health coverage for all \nIraqi citizens. We have provided $950 million to build hospitals and \nclinics in Iraq.\n  Please do not misunderstand what I am saying. I certainly want to be \nsupportive of efforts to provide health care in Iraq.\n  What about us? What about Americans? I also want to help American \nfamilies who are working hard every day, playing by the rules in this \ngreat country, and struggling to pay their bills and care for their \nfamilies. I think we can help both the people of Iraq and Americans at \nthe same time. It is our moral obligation, I believe, to make sure we \nare helping American families as well as others.\n  Mr. President, working families deserve access to affordable care for \nthemselves and for their families. It is going to take leadership to \naccomplish this. The administration has had almost 4 years to take \naction, and it has not.\n  I believe it is time for bold change. I believe that when we are \nlooking at the price of prescription drugs, we need to take out that \nprovision in the new Medicare law that says Medicare cannot negotiate \nfor group discounts. That is pretty basic. We know that one of the main \nways you are able to lower prescription drug prices, or the price of \nany product, is to be able to get a group discount. Everybody knows \nthat. Yet, in this new Medicare law, Medicare is specifically \nprohibited from doing that. Who benefits from that? Certainly not the \ntaxpayers, certainly not American seniors or the disabled, and American \nfamilies certainly don't benefit from that. The prescription drug \nindustry benefits from that. What we have seen under the new Medicare \nlaw, rather than providing lower prices for people, we have 40 million \nseniors who are being locked into paying top dollar, and that makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  We can do something about that. We can make changes in the Medicare \nlaw so it works for people. We can also lower prices immediately by \nsimply allowing the local pharmacists at the local drugstores in \nAmerica to be able to do business with pharmacists in Canada or other \ncountries, where they can provide FDA-approved drugs and processes and \nbring the prescription drugs--actually made in America--back to America \nso we can get the same deal everybody else gets around the world.\n  We have a wonderful, bipartisan bill that has been put together. I am \nhopeful that we will bring it to the Senate floor as soon as possible \nand that we are able to pass what is called reimportation of \nprescription drugs and lower prices. I am very hopeful and I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of Senator Daschle's effort and vision to say that, \nby 2006, we are going to make a commitment that every American has \naccess at least to the same level of health care that we receive. This \nis one of the few instances where employees--elected officials--have \nbetter health care and benefits than the employers. It is time to turn \nthat around. It is time to make a commitment.\n  Medicare, after it was passed, was put together in 1 year. We have \ngreat American ingenuity.

Improving \n     educational results for children with disabilities is an \n     essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality \n     of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \n     economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\n       [``(2) Before the date of the enactment of the Education \n     for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142), \n     the educational needs of millions of children with \n     disabilities were not being fully met because--\n       [``(A) the children did not receive appropriate educational \n     services;\n       [``(B) the children were excluded entirely from the public \n     school system and from being educated with their peers;\n       [``(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the children from \n     having a successful educational experience; or\n       [``(D) a lack of adequate resources within the public \n     school system forced families to find services outside the \n     public school system.\n       [``(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this Act \n     has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities \n     and the families of such children access to a free \n     appropriate public education and in improving educational \n     results for children with disabilities.\n       [``(4) However, the implementation of this Act has been \n     impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on \n     applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching \n     and learning for children with disabilities.\n       [``(5) Over 25 years of research and experience has \n     demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities \n     can be made more effective by--\n       [``(A) having high expectations for such children and \n     ensuring their access to the general education curriculum in \n     the regular classroom to the maximum extent possible in order \n     to--\n       [``(i) meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent \n     possible, the challenging expectations that have been \n     established for all children;

Authorization of appropriations.\n       ``(c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience \n     and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to \n     participate in or contribute to society. Improving \n     educational results for children with disabilities is an \n     essential element of our national policy of ensuring equality \n     of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \n     economic self-sufficiency for individuals with disabilities.\n       ``(2) Before the date of the enactment of the Education for \n     All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public Law 94-142), the \n     educational needs of millions of children with disabilities \n     were not being fully met because--\n       ``(A) the children did not receive appropriate educational \n     services;\n       ``(B) the children were excluded entirely from the public \n     school system and from being educated with their peers;\n       ``(C) undiagnosed disabilities prevented the children from \n     having a successful educational experience; or\n       ``(D) a lack of adequate resources within the public school \n     system forced families to find services outside the public \n     school system.\n       ``(3) Since the enactment and implementation of the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, this Act \n     has been successful in ensuring children with disabilities \n     and the families of such children access to a free \n     appropriate public education and in improving educational \n     results for children with disabilities.\n       ``(4) However, the implementation of this Act has been \n     impeded by low expectations, and an insufficient focus on \n     applying replicable research on proven methods of teaching \n     and learning for children with disabilities.\n       ``(5) Over 25 years of research and experience has \n     demonstrated that the education of children with disabilities \n     can be made more effective by--\n       ``(A) having high expectations for such children and \n     ensuring their access to the general education curriculum in \n     the regular classroom to the maximum extent possible in order \n     to--\n       ``(i) meet developmental goals and, to the maximum extent \n     possible, the challenging expectations that have been \n     established for all children; and\n       ``(ii) be prepared to lead productive and independent adult \n     lives, to the maximum extent possible;\n       ``(B) strengthening the role and responsibility of parents \n     and ensuring that families of such children have meaningful \n     opportunities to participate in the education of their \n     children at school and at home;\n       ``(C) coordinating this Act with other local, educational \n     service agency, State, and Federal school improvement \n     efforts, including improvement efforts under the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965, in order to ensure that \n     such children benefit from such efforts and that special \n     education can become a service for such children rather than \n     a place where they are sent;\n       ``(D) providing appropriate special education and related \n     services, and aids and supports in the regular classroom, to \n     such children, whenever appropriate;\n       ``(E) supporting high-quality, intensive preservice \n     preparation and professional development for all personnel \n     who work with children with disabilities in order to ensure \n     that such personnel have the skills and knowledge necessary \n     to improve the academic achievement and functional \n     performance of children with disabilities, including the use \n     of scientifically based instructional practices, to the \n     maximum extent possible;\n       ``(F) providing incentives for whole-school approaches, \n     scientifically based early reading programs, positive \n     behavioral interventions and supports, and prereferral \n     interventions to reduce the need to label children as \n     disabled in order to address their learning and behavioral \n     needs;\n       ``(G) focusing resources on teaching and learning while \n     reducing paperwork and requirements that do not assist in \n     improving educational results; and\n       ``(H) supporting the development and use of technology, \n     including assistive technology devices and assistive \n     technology services, to maximize accessibility for children \n     with disabilities.\n       ``(6) While States, local educational agencies, and \n     educational service agencies are primarily responsible for \n     providing an education for all children with disabilities, it \n     is in the national interest that the Federal Government have \n     a supporting role in assisting State and local efforts to \n     educate children with disabilities in order to improve \n     results for such children and to ensure equal protection of \n     the law.\n       ``(7) A more equitable allocation of resources is essential \n     for the Federal Government to meet its responsibility to \n     provide an equal educational opportunity for all individuals.\n       ``(8) Parents and schools should be given expanded \n     opportunities to resolve their disagreements in positive and \n     constructive ways.\n       ``(9) Teachers, schools, local educational agencies, and \n     States should be relieved of irrelevant and unnecessary \n     paperwork burdens that do not lead to improved educational \n     outcomes.\n       ``(10)(A) The Federal Government must be responsive to the \n     growing needs of an increasingly more diverse society.\n       ``(B) America's ethnic profile is rapidly changing. In the \n     year 2000, 1 of every 3 persons in the United States was a \n     member of a minority group or was limited English proficient.\n       ``(C) Minority children comprise an increasing percentage \n     of public school students.\n       ``(D) With such changing demographics, recruitment efforts \n     for special education personnel should focus on increasing \n     the participation of minorities in the teaching profession.\n       ``(11)(A) The limited English proficient population is the \n     fastest growing in our Nation, and the growth is occurring in \n     many parts of our Nation.\n       ``(B) Studies have documented apparent discrepancies in the \n     levels of referral and placement of limited English \n     proficient children in special education.\n       ``(C) This poses a special challenge for special education \n     in the referral of, assessment of, and services for, our \n     Nation's students from non-English language backgrounds.\n       ``(12)(A) Greater efforts are needed to prevent the \n     intensification of problems connected with mislabeling and \n     high dropout rates among minority children with disabilities.\n       ``(B) More minority children continue to be served in \n     special education than would be expected from the percentage \n     of minority students in the general school population.\n       ``(C) African-American children are identified as having \n     mental retardation and emotional disturbance at rates greater \n     than their white counterparts.\n       ``(D) In the 1998-1999 school year, African-American \n     children represented just 14.8 percent of the population aged \n     6 through 21, but comprised 20.2 percent of all children with \n     disabilities.\n       ``(E) Studies have found that schools with predominately \n     Caucasian students and teachers have placed \n     disproportionately high numbers of their minority students \n     into special education.\n       ``(13)(A) As the number of minority students in special \n     education increases, the number of minority teachers and \n     related services personnel produced in colleges and \n     universities continues to decrease.\n       ``(B) The opportunity for minority individuals, \n     organizations, and Historically Black Colleges and \n     Universities to participate fully in awards for grants and \n     contracts, boards of organizations receiving funds under this \n     Act, and peer review panels, and in the training of \n     professionals in the area of special education is essential \n     if we are to obtain greater success in the education of \n     minority children with disabilities.\n       ``(14) As the graduation rates for children with \n     disabilities continue to climb, providing effective \n     transition services to promote successful post-school \n     employment or education is an important measure of \n     accountability for children with disabilities.\n       ``(d) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       ``(1)(A) to ensure that all children with disabilities have \n     available to them a free appropriate public education that \n     emphasizes special education and related services designed to \n     meet their unique needs and prepare them for employment, \n     further education, and independent living;\n       ``(B) to ensure that the rights of children with \n     disabilities and parents of such children are protected; and\n       ``(C) to assist States, localities, educational service \n     agencies, and Federal agencies to provide for the education \n     of all children with disabilities;\n       ``(2) to assist States in the implementation of a \n     Statewide, coordinated, multidisciplinary, interagency system \n     of early intervention services for infants and toddlers with \n     disabilities and their families;\n       ``(3) to ensure that educators and parents have the \n     necessary tools to improve educational results for children \n     with disabilities by supporting systemic-change activities; \n     coordinated research and personnel preparation; coordinated \n     technical assistance, dissemination, and support; and \n     technology development and media services; and\n       ``(4) to assess, and ensure the effectiveness of, efforts \n     to educate children with disabilities.\n\n     ``SEC. 602.

educational agency, or for whom that State agency is \n     responsible, if the State educational agency determines that \n     the local educational agency or State agency, as the case may \n     be--\n       ``(A) has not provided the information needed to establish \n     the eligibility of such agency under this section;\n       ``(B) is unable to establish and maintain programs of free \n

I ask also that following that \ndebate, the Senate proceed to a vote in relationship to my amendment, \nto be followed by a vote in relationship to\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\nthe Harkin amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order to \neither amendment.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that no further amendments relating \nto funding be in order to the bill, and that there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between the votes, and that the votes begin at \n1:45 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to modify the consent \nagreement to say that the time from now until 1:45 be equally divided \nbetween the two sides. It is more than 2 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from Iowa, \nwho will be offering an extremely important amendment dealing with the \nfunding issue for the special needs education program. As he is \ngathering his papers, I want to say to our colleagues in the Senate \nthat this legislation represents the best effort of our committee, \nwhich is truly bipartisan.\n  I pay tribute to Senator Gregg, our chairman, for his leadership in \nhelping bring all of the members together on this legislation. We \nvirtually have a unanimous committee recommendation. We have a few \npublic policy issues, which appropriately the Senate will address, and \nthen we will move ahead.\n  Many times around this institution we wonder how it functions and \nworks. I think recognizing the extraordinary challenges that so many of \nthese children are facing has sort of brought out the best of our \nMembers.\n  I thank our chairman, and I thank all of my colleagues on my side who \ntook great interest and great involvement in this issue. I will go into \ngreater detail as we go through the process.\n  I always pay tribute to my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator \nHarkin, who has had a special leadership role in issues involving the \ndisabled and handicapped since the time he has been in the Senate. I \nalways thank him, as well as the rest of our colleagues.\n  As we move through the course of the morning, we will have a more \ndetailed description of what is in the legislation and the importance \nof the support of this institution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts. I specifically thank the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts for his cooperation and the cooperation of the entire \ncommittee.\n  This is a bill that is 90 percent agreed to. There are some public \npolicy issues we are going to debate on the floor, specifically on the \nprocess of funding this bill. It is a very strong step forward in the \narea of addressing the needs of children who have special needs, \nbasically focused on making sure there is less bureaucracy and more \ncare, that teachers have more flexibility and parents have more \ninvolvement, and that there is less litigation and more results.\n  Kids who have special needs, rather than just being put through a \nprocess of checking off boxes, are actually given the opportunity to \nlearn, and we have accountability standards for that learning.\n  It is a very good bill. We will get into more depth on its substance \nas we move forward. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Iowa \nfor moving expeditiously his amendment, along with one of the \namendments I will be offering, one of the primary issues that needs to \nbe addressed on the floor. I look forward to him offering his \namendment. I will offer mine, and we will get into the substance of \nthat debate.\n   Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act is a landmark civil rights law that has had a powerfully \npositive impact on millions of Americans.\n   Before moving to the substance of my remarks, I would like to thank \nthe chairman of our committee, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. \nGregg, and the ranking member, my friend from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, for their dedicated work on this bill. The reauthorization of \na bill of this size is a considerable undertaking, and I want to \nrecognize the excellent work of Annie White of Senator Gregg's staff, \nand Connie Garner of Senator Kennedy's staff, along with many other \ncommittee staff who have worked so hard on this reauthorization.\n   Let me take a moment to put the Individuals with Disabilities Act in \nhistorical context. IDEA was passed almost three decades ago, in 1975, \nthe year after I was first elected to the House of Representatives. So \nI have watched the progress of this law since its inception. I am proud \nof what IDEA has achieved. No question, we have further to go to \nachieve equal educational opportunity for children with disabilities. \nBut we have made tremendous progress since 1975.\n   We must not forget that, prior to the early 1970s, children with \ndisabilities were routinely kept out of school. More than 1 million \nchildren were excluded entirely from their local public schools, and \nmore than half of all children with disabilities in the United States \ndid not receive appropriate educational services. If they did get an \neducation, it was often in segregated schools or institutional \nsettings.\n   But in the early 1970s, that began to change. Two landmark cases, \nPARC v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1971, and Mills v. Board of \nEducation in 1972 established that children with disabilities had the \nright to an equal opportunity for education under the fourteenth \namendment to the Constitution.\n   In 1975, Congress wrote IDEA for two reasons. First, we fleshed out \nthe substance and details of what was required to achieve equality for \nchildren with disabilities. Congress specified critical protections for \nparents and children to transform the constitutional requirement into a \npractical reality throughout the country. While we still have further \nto go, I believe that we have made major progress since the days when 1 \nmillion children were entirely excluded from school. The latest figures \navailable indicate that some 6.6 million children are receiving \nservices under IDEA.\n   A second important purpose of IDEA was to help States meet their \nconstitutional obligations. And here we have fallen far short of our \ngoals. When IDEA was passed, the Federal Government pledged to help \nwith 40 percent of the excess costs of special education. At the \npresent time, we are funding less than 20 percent of these costs. I \nwill have more to say about this later when I offer an amendment along \nwith my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Nebraska.\n   I think it is important to keep fixed in our minds these two \nhistoric purposes of IDEA, because these purposes must inform our \ndiscussion over the next few days here in the Senate. The protections \nthat we wrote into the law to ensure opportunity for all continue to be \ncritical today. And the need for Federal help to meet states' \nobligation also continues to be critical to realizing the full promise \nof this law.\n   These matters are vitally important because the education that a \nchild receives has a profound impact on his or her future. This is true \nfor all children, whether or not they have disabilities.\n   IDEA is a critical cornerstone of the Federal Government's \ncommitment to ensuring equality for individuals with disabilities. When \nwe passed the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, we said \nthat this Nation's four great goals for individuals with disabilities \nare equal opportunity, full participation, independent living and \neconomic self-sufficiency. These same goals are referenced in IDEA. \nObviously, a quality education is essential to achieving all four of \nthese goals.\n   These may be broad goals, but they are not abstractions. To the \ncontrary, they have enormous practical, nitty-gritty consequences for \nindividuals with disabilities. They have the power to transform \nindividual lives.\n   On that score, I want to tell you about my good friend, Danny Piper \nfrom Ankeny, IA. Tragically, Danny died in a car accident more than a \nyear ago, but he left behind a legacy of friends, family, and personal \nachievement.\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\n   From an early age, Danny's parents insisted that he be educated with \nhis peers. He was an integral part of his school community, performing \nin the school play and active in a variety of school activities. Once, \nafter he testified before my subcommittee on the ADA, I asked him how \ntestifying before Congress compared to being in the school play. He \nanswered, ``Not so bad.''\n  Danny went on to finish high school and get a job. I spent one day \nwith him on the job at Osco drugstore, where he worked everyday. He \nshowed me the ropes--how to correctly stock the shelves, how to load \nthe cardboard box machine to avoid getting hurt, and so on. We had \nlunch together, too. It was a day I will always cherish.\n  Danny had what we want for all of our children--a fulfilling life of \nindependence and dignity. He lived with a friend in an apartment. He \nworked every day. This is what IDEA is all about. It is why I strongly \nsupport the protections this law provides--and why it is time for the \nFederal Government to fully fund the act.\n  We have a long way to go to ensure that all children have access to a \nquality education, and the opportunities that come with it. This \nreauthorization correctly emphasizes enforcement of the act. I thank my \nfriend from Massachusetts for his leadership on this issue. This bill \ncontains provisions that require states to meet compliance benchmarks. \nIt specifies that the Secretary and the States must take action if \nthere is a consistent failure to provide an appropriate education to \nchildren with disabilities.\n  The bill also ensures that a child's individualized education \nprogram, known as an IEP, provides services up front to ensure that a \nchild succeeds. So each child will have access to the behavioral health \nservices that will ensure a good experience for the child and his or \nher classmates. Getting that plan in place in the first place, rather \nthan after any problems occur, is critical to making this law work for \neveryone.\n  The bill has several important provisions to assist deaf children get \nthe education that they need to succeed. It specifies that interpreters \nare a related service required under the act, and it preserves critical \naccess to captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing students. These \nprovisions are very important to me because, as many of you know, my \nbrother Frank was deaf. These are the kinds of services that would have \nmade a huge difference for Frank. So I am especially proud to support \nthese provisions in the reauthorization.\n  This bill also maintains all of the early intervention and preschool \neducation programs that get children off on the right foot so they can \nachieve in school.\n  As we debate this reauthorization, let's be guided by the vision that \nIDEA is an investment in children's lives and futures. We are investing \nmoney at the front end--with early intervention, with interpreters, \nwith behavioral health and other related services. And the return on \nthat investment is productive, independent, taxpaying citizens. We get \nindividuals who are prepared to go on to higher education, to gainful \nemployment, and to independent living in our communities.\n  But we have to make investments in order to get the results we want. \nWe have to ensure that schools provide the appropriate education \nrequired by the law. And we have to meet our commitment to help local \npublic schools by, at long last, providing them with full Federal \nfunding IDEA. As I said, IDEA was passed in 1975. It has been almost \nthree decades, and we are not even half way toward meeting our original \ncommitment to pay 40 percent of the excess costs of special education.\n  I will be offering an amendment later with my friend, the senior \nSenator from Nebraska, to remedy this longstanding failure of the \nFederal Government. Over the years, we have talked again and again \nabout full funding. I say to my colleagues that its time for us not \njust to talk the talk, but to walk the walk. It is time to make good on \nthe critical investment of federal funds that we pledged over 30 years \nago.\n  I will have more to say on this later. For now, I conclude by noting \nthat IDEA is about the kind of country we want America to be. We must \nfully fund the act, and we must renew our commitment to its cornerstone \nprotections. Only then will every child in America have the opportunity \nnot only to dream, but to make his or her dreams a reality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleague from Nebraska, \nSenator Hagel, and many others to offer an amendment that will ensure \nat long last the Congress meets its commitment it made almost 30 years \nago. At that time, we told children with disabilities, their families, \nschools, and States that the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of \nthe extra cost of special education. We have never lived up to that \ncommitment. In fact, we are not even halfway there.\n  This is really about the credibility of the Congress. It is about the \ncredibility of each and every one of us. We tell our children all the \ntime to keep your promises, do what you say you are going to do. We \nteach them if they do not follow through, other people will be hurt. \nYet the Congress has not kept its word. We have not done what we have \ntold children, parents, schools, and States we would do, and people \nhave been hurt as a result.\n  People are harmed every time parents of children with disabilities \nare pitted against parents with children without disabilities for a \nlimited pot of funds. They are harmed every time a family opts not to \nask for what their child truly needs because they have been told it \ncosts too much and other children will suffer. They are harmed every \ntime a school district struggles to provide educational opportunities \nfor all its students.\n  Congress had two purposes when it passed the predecessor to IDEA in \n1975. First, we wanted to codify the constitutional obligation to \nprovide education to all children, including those with disabilities. \nThere had been several Federal court cases, including the PARC case in \nPennsylvania and the Mills case in DC, that challenged the exclusion of \nkids with disabilities from public schools. These cases held that if \nschools do provide for public education of their kids, then they must \neducate all children. So Congress passed a law, and we spelled out what \nschools have to do to meet these constitutional obligations.\n  The other purpose of the law was to provide financial support for the \neducation of children with disabilities. Congress recognized that \nserving additional students would cost substantially more money, and it \ncommitted to paying 40 percent of the excess costs of special \neducation, which is known as the full funding amount.\n  Almost 30 years later, we are reauthorizing this bill, and I say to \nmy friends and colleagues that we need to think about what we \noriginally wanted to do and promised to do. We wanted to show Federal \nsupport for the principle that all children deserve a quality \neducation, and we wanted to help State and local governments meet the \ncosts involved. The amendment of Senator Hagel and I will help us at \nlong last to achieve these goals.\n  Recent history leaves no doubt that discretionary increases will not \nget us to full funding. The charade is over. Educators, parents, \nchildren, and State and local government officials all know that we \nneed mandatory increases. Promised increases on the discretionary side \nwill not get us to full funding. They have not worked for 29 years; \nthey will not work now.\n  If Members of this body are still not convinced that we need \nmandatory full funding, they only have to look at the past 2 years. \nThis chart shows that, in 2003, President Bush proposed a $1 billion \nincrease for IDEA. The Senate increased it to $2.3 billion. And the \nfinal tally was $1.3 billion.\n\n  Last year, it was the same story. President Bush wanted a $650 \nmillion increase. The Senate went up to $2.2 billion, and we came down \nto $1.2 billion, actually less of an increase than we had the year \nbefore.\n  Again this year President Bush asked for $1 billion, and we do not \nknow how it will come out next year. We can look at the last 2 years \nand say probably the same thing will happen again.\n  The reason is simple, there are a lot of other important education \nprograms that also need money. The President has consistently \nshortchanged the No Child Left Behind Act, especially title I. There \nsimply has not been enough discretionary money to meet our obligations \non IDEA while also funding programs to help schools meet the mandate of \nthe No Child Left Behind Act. So special education funding gets \nsqueezed.\n  Again, we are on track for a similar situation this year. The \nPresident, as I said, has proposed $1 billion for IDEA. The Senate \nbudget resolution includes the same amount. So, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, we will never reach full funding if we \nincrease IDEA at the rate of $1 billion a year under current law.\n  Under the revised funding formula in S. 1248, we will not reach full \nfunding until fiscal year 2028, nearly a quarter century from now, 53 \nyears after Congress first committed to that goal and made that \npromise. A child born today would not see full funding of IDEA during \nhis or her entire education. That is unacceptable.\n  Fully funding IDEA within 6 years, as we do in our amendment, takes \n$2.2 billion a year, not $1 billion as the President has proposed.\n  Where is the additional money from IDEA going to come from this year \nif we do not use mandatory funding? Do my colleagues want to cut title \n1? Do we want to cut afterschool centers? Do we want to cut teacher \ntraining? The money simply is not there in the President's budget to \nfind $2.2 billion a year for special education unless we use mandatory \nfunding.\n  My colleague from Nebraska, Senator Hagel, and I have been trying to \nmeet this goal for a long time now. We came close once before.\n  When the No Child Left Behind Act passed the Senate, this body agreed \nunanimously to mandate increases for IDEA until we reached full funding \nin 6 years. But strong opposition from the President and the House \nleadership thwarted the will of the Senate. At that time, we were told \nin conference to wait until reauthorization of IDEA took place. Well, \nhere we are. We are reauthorizing IDEA.\n  So again I want to make this point very clear. Two years ago, this \nSenate unanimously approved mandatory funding for IDEA. It was only \ntaken out in conference. It was taken out saying we have to wait until \nthe reauthorization of IDEA. Well, as I said, we are on the \nreauthorization of IDEA right now and that is why Senator Hagel and I \nand others are proposing this amendment.\n  We have waited long enough; children with disabilities and their \nparents have waited long enough; schools have waited long enough and, \nquite frankly, our property taxpayers have waited long enough.\n  Back home, I have heard from parents, school administrators, \nteachers, State legislators, chambers of commerce, taxpayers' \nassociations, and others about the need to fully fund IDEA. I am sure \nevery Senator in this body has heard the same thing from his or her own \nconstituents. These voices are unanimous in support of mandatory full \nfunding because they know that is the only way we are ever going to \nreach that.\n  Mandatory funding is also widely supported by all of the national \ndisability and education groups. During this reauthorization, the \neducation and disability communities disagreed on a\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\nlot of issues, but they are unanimous and united on mandatory funding.\n  This chart shows a list of all of those who are in support. There are \n36 organizations that are members of the Consortium of Citizens with \nDisabilities Education Task Force, plus 38 organizations that are part \nof the IDEA Funding Coalition.\n  The National Governors Association also has a clear position \nsupporting mandatory full funding. To quote the joint policy of the NGA \nand the Council of Chief State School Officers:\n\n       Mandatory full funding of the Federal share of IDEA is \n     essential.\n\n  They further state:\n\n       Congress should do the following: Provide mandatory full \n     funding at the federally committed level of 40 percent of the \n     average per pupil expenditure.\n\n  The Governors support mandatory full funding because they know how \nmuch it will mean to each of their States. I have a chart that shows \nhow much more each State will get under the amendment Senator Hagel and \nI are proposing as compared to what they would get if it is not \nsupported. Again, I am not going to run through every State, but it is \nhere for Senators to look at it if they would like. I urge each of my \ncolleagues to look up their own State.\n  My own State of Iowa stands to gain $2 billion over 10 years under \nthis amendment, an increase of $460 million over what they would get \nwith the annual $1 billion increases.\n  I will talk for a minute about the investments IDEA funding pays for. \nIt pays for the teachers who help children learn. It pays for \noccupational and physical therapy to help children grow stronger. It \npays for interpreters and captioning for deaf and hard-of-\nhearing students, and Braille materials that allow blind children to \nread their textbooks. It pays for the behavioral health services that \nallow children with mental health needs to succeed. It pays for \nassistive technology, for example, software that helps a blind child \nuse the classroom materials, or augmentative communication devices that \nhelp kids with cerebral palsy communicate with their teachers and their \npeers.\n\n  IDEA is an investment in children's lives and in their future. We are \ninvesting money at the front end with early intervention, with \ninterpreters, with behavioral health and other related services. The \nreturn on that investment is productive, independent, taxpaying \ncitizens. We get individuals who are prepared to go on to higher \neducation, to gainful employment, and to independent living in their \ncommunities.\n  The unemployment rate for people with disabilities right now is about \n70 percent. That is right, 70 percent. IDEA is critical to ensuring \nthat we bring that rate down and increase the number of individuals \nwith disabilities who are working.\n  Our House colleague, former Congressman Tony Coelho, always liked to \nsay people with disabilities are the one group that really wants to pay \ntaxes. They want to work. They want to have the opportunity to \ncontribute to our society and economy.\n  IDEA has also cut down on the number of children who have to live in \ninstitutions. Dr. Charlie Lakin of the University of Minnesota \nestimates $6.5 billion a year is saved on institutional costs by making \nit possible for children with disabilities to live in their own homes \nand communities. The true value of this is impossible to measure in \ndollars. How does one measure the value of keeping a family together?\n  In closing, when Congress first passed this law in 1975, we created a \nbeacon of hope for children who previously had none. We said to \nchildren with disabilities and their parents that all children deserve \neducational opportunity, all children deserve to take part in the \nAmerican dream, all children deserve to look forward to having a home \nand a job when they grow up. To that end, we made a pledge to these \nchildren and their parents. We promised the Federal Government would \npay its fair share of the costs, up to 40 percent on average per-pupil \nexpense, to ensure this dream becomes a reality.\n  Today, nearly three decades later, it is time for Congress to make \ngood on that commitment. So I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the \namendment offered by Senator Hagel, this Senator from Iowa, and so many \nothers.\n  I see my colleague and cosponsor of the amendment, Senator Hagel. He \nis a great leader on this issue. I yield to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa, for his years of effort and leadership and focus on \nthis issue.\n  I rise this morning to join with Senator Harkin in introducing this \namendment to S. 1248, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA, reauthorization. Our amendment will provide mandatory increases \nin funding of $2.2 billion per year to fully fund part B of the IDEA \nProgram over the next 6 years.\n  This amendment will allow us to reach our Federal funding commitment \nto IDEA by fiscal year 2010 and fulfill our nearly 30-year-old Federal \ncommitment to the States, our schools, our children with disabilities.\n  In 1975, Congress guaranteed children with disabilities the right to \na free and appropriate public education. This means whatever the cost, \nStates and local school districts are mandated by Federal law to \nprovide necessary services to educate a child with a disability. \nCongress understood this Federal mandate would be costly. As a result, \nCongress agreed over 30 years ago to provide States with 40 percent of \nthe cost of educating these children. Unfortunately, States have been \nbearing the bulk of the costs associated with IDEA for this time. \nStates have upheld their part of the deal. Congress has not. This is \nwhy Senator Harkin and I and others believe mandatory funding is \nwarranted for the IDEA Program.\n  IDEA is one of the largest unfunded mandates imposed on the States. \nAs a matter of fact, I recall in a speech on the Senate floor earlier \nthis year the junior Senator from Tennessee, the former Governor of \nTennessee, Mr. Alexander, talking about unfunded mandates that he dealt \nwith in his 8 years as Governor of Tennessee. He pointed out \nspecifically that IDEA was one of those unfunded mandates.\n  Everyone in this body has heard from their Governors, school boards, \nadministrators, teachers and parents about the importance of this \nissue. Unfortunately, instead of making IDEA funding a priority, \nCongress continues to pass new education programs that require more \nmoney, more resources, and more responsibility from the States. So we \ncontinue to force down upon the States, more unfunded mandates. Even \nthough the purpose is noble, the cause is right, and we say on the \nfloor of the Congress that we will help, we will provide those \nresources and those funds--in the case of IDEA, for 30 years we have \nnot done that. We have not fulfilled the statutory commitments that we \nmade to the States and the school districts--and ultimately to our \nchildren.\n\n  For the past 7 years, I have worked on a bipartisan basis with \nSenators Harkin, Dodd, Kennedy, Jeffords, Warner, Collins, Chafee, \nSnowe, Coleman, Roberts, and others to accomplish this task. Three \nyears ago, as was noted by my distinguished colleague from Iowa, the \nSenate agreed to an amendment that Senator Harkin and I offered to the \nNo Child Left Behind Act. The amendment provided mandatory funding for \nthe IDEA program. Unfortunately, this amendment was removed during a \nHouse-Senate conference in 2001.\n  Today we have another opportunity to show the Senate's support for \nmandatory IDEA funding by passing the Harkin-Hagel amendment. Although \nwe have had great success in increasing IDEA appropriations from $2.3 \nbillion in fiscal year 1996 to $10.1 billion in fiscal year 2004, we \nstill have a long way to go before meeting our total Federal IDEA \nfunding responsibilities. The cost of special education is high. We \nunderstand that. But it is the thing that is most important for the \nparents, the teachers, and the children. By underfunding the Federal \nGovernment's portion of IDEA, States and local school districts are \nforced to pick up the additional costs, adding to their already heavy \ntax burdens.\n  Our amendment has nothing to do with expanding the Federal role. It \nhas nothing to do with expanding the Federal role in education. It is \nabout meeting the existing commitments of the Federal Government under \nthe current law.\n  While I share the same budgetary concerns as others in this body--we \nall\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\nmust share those concerns and act as prudent, wise stewards of the \npeople's money--I remind my colleagues that despite our recent progress \non IDEA, we are still only about halfway to meeting our Federal \nobligation that we made to the people of this country 30 years ago. We \nare not now meeting those statutory commitments. Although we made \nbudget promises year after year, we continue to fail in meeting our \nannual discretionary funding goals for IDEA.\n  Last year the Senate adopted a budget amendment that would have \nincreased IDEA funds by $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2004. \nUnfortunately, we came up $1 billion short, even though we had passed \nit in the Senate, by the time we finished the appropriations process. \nThis is just another example of why mandatory funding is absolutely \nnecessary to fulfill the commitment of Congress to IDEA. Meeting our \nFederal commitment to IDEA would help school districts fund additional \neducation priorities such as facility improvements, teacher salaries, \nand purchasing upgraded hardware and software for the classroom.\n  On another point that needs some clarification, the Harkin-Hagel \namendment, this amendment that we debate this morning, would not take \naway the authority of Congress to reauthorize this program. There seems \nto be some misunderstanding about that issue. In fact, our amendment \nincludes language that states that nothing shall prevent future \nreauthorizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote today to fulfill America's commitment to \nIDEA funding. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield at least 7 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Vermont, my friend and colleague who has spent a great part of his \nlife and career in the Senate on educational issues, and especially on \nthis particular issue. It is important that we hear his voice. I yield \n7 minutes--more time if he so desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it was many years ago the Senator from \nMassachusetts and I sat on the committee that designed this bill and \npassed it with all the expectations of it being fulfilled. But we still \nare a long ways from that.\n  I support the bipartisan Harkin-Hagel amendment to S. 1248, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2003.\n  This amendment would fully fund the Federal share of special \neducation within 6 years, and finally meet the commitment that Congress \nmade in 1975 when the original IDEA law was enacted.\n  And although I am supporting this amendment, I must admit that my \nemotions are mixed.\n  That is because we have been trying to accomplish this task for 29 \nyears, and for 29 years we have failed. Quite simply, this should have \nbeen done a long time ago, and it pains me that we are still debating \nthis issue.\n  In 1975 I was a member of the House-Senate conference committee that \nauthored the Education for All Handicapped Children Act.\n  This came after courts across this country ruled that State and \nFederal constitutions obliged schools to provide all children with a \nfree and appropriate education.\n  At that time, we in the Congress enacted a funding schedule for the \nFederal Government's share IDEA dollars.\n  We calculated the cost of educating a disabled child to be about \ntwice that of a non-disabled child. Based on that calculation, we \ncommitted the Federal Government to pay 40 percent of the national per-\npupil expenditure for each disabled child's education.\n  The schedule was for the Federal Government to pay 5 percent by 1978; \n10 percent by 1979; 20 percent by 1980, 30 percent by 1981; and 40 \npercent by 1982.\n  Currently, we are not even meeting the 1980 allocation of 20 percent. \nIn fact, we are only providing states with 18.6 percent of the costs. \nThis is a disgrace.\n  And according to the Congressional Research Service, if we continue \nincreasing funding at a rate of one billion dollars each year, we will \nnever reach our goal of 40 percent set in 1975.\n  Every dollar that the Federal Government fails to provide must be \nsupplied by the State and local governments, which usually translates \nto higher property taxes.\n  For communities that often struggle to pass school budgets, our \nfailure to meet our promise may fuel resentment against families that \nalready have enough to deal with in raising a child with special needs.\n  In many small towns, such as those in Vermont, Iowa, and Nebraska, a \nsingle child with severe disabilities can have a significant impact on \na school's budget.\n  Yet even though the Federal Government has broken its promise year \nafter year, great progress has been made and the States and local \nschool districts deserve a lot of the credit for providing quality \neducation to so many children.\n  It is long overdue that we here in the Congress stand up to our \nresponsibility to support all of our children, schools and communities.\n  If 29 years has shown us anything, it is that our children do not \nbenefit from hollow promises.\n  The underlying bill is a solid piece of bipartisan legislation. There \nare some compromises on difficult issues such as how children are \ndisciplined. But none of these issues addressed in the bill is as \nimportant as the subject of the amendment--fully funding IDEA and \ntreating the annual funding increases as mandatory spending.\n  Although I am supporting this amendment, I am deeply troubled that \nsome may consider the funding mechanism being proposed here is a \ngimmick since the current $10 billion Federal allocation will remain as \ndiscretionary spending in the language before us. If we are successful \nin passing this amendment--and I hope we will be--the integrity of the \namendment will only be upheld if the current $10 billion continues to \nbe used only for IDEA.\n  Further, that $10 billion must remain $10 billion and not be reduced \nand used for non-IDEA programming. As important as it is to vote for \nthis amendment before us, it is equally important to commit to \nprotecting the level of funding.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. The time is long \noverdue for fulfilling our promise.\n  I have a question for the Senator from Iowa, the sponsor of the \namendment.\n  As we have discussed, the amendment before this body makes IDEA \nfunding increases mandatory. The Senator from Iowa is a member of the \nAppropriations Committee and a ranking member of the subcommittee that \noverseas IDEA spending. Is it the understanding of the Senator from \nIowa that the current discretionary allocation for IDEA, which is $10 \nbillion, will continue to be dedicated only to IDEA programming and not \nreduced if this amendment is agreed to?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I respond by \nsaying to my friend from Vermont that I appreciate his question. I want \nto assure him that, as he knows, I am committed to fully funding IDEA. \nThis amendment--I know I can speak for my colleague from Nebraska \nalso--presumes that the discretionary rates will remain dedicated to \nspecial education, and I am fully confident that will be the case.\n  I have been on the Appropriations Committee now for 20 years and on \nthe subcommittee that funds IDEA. My experience in 20 years is that it \nhas never been cut. Maybe it has not been added to much, but I have \nnever known anyone to try to cut it. Right now, Senator Specter is the \nchair of that subcommittee. I want to assure the Senator that no one \nhas any intention of cutting IDEA. Those of us on committee would \nresist that. Again, Senator Gregg is also on the subcommittee, and I \nassume he doesn't want to cut IDEA either. There has not been a cut in \nIDEA funding in 25 years. There will not be any now on the \ndiscretionary account.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for that commitment and \nunderstanding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to \nfully\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\nfund IDEA offered by Senator Harkin and Senator Hagel.\n  Nearly 30 years ago the Federal Government made a commitment of equal \nopportunity to our Nation's children with disabilities. With that \ncommitment, we promised that the Federal Government would uphold its \nend of the bargain and pay 40 percent of the average per-student cost \nfor every special education student. Today, however, the Federal \nGovernment is paying less than 19 percent of that cost.\n  Over the past couple of years, IDEA has received significant \nincreases but, according to the Congressional Research Service, at \nincreases of $1 billion each year, the Federal Government will never \nfulfill its promise of funding at 40 percent. Further, if annual \nincreases were $1 billion plus inflation, we would not reach the \npromised level of 40 percent until 2035, more than 30 years from now.\n  The Harkin-Hagel amendment increases IDEA funding over 8 years by $2 \nbillion per year through mandatory funding. Mandatory funding is what \nit is going to take because local schools today are already struggling \nwith the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act, the lack of \npromised Federal funding, and the dismal financial picture still facing \nmany of our States and local governments. It is going to take real \nfunding through mandatory spending to make up for all of those gaps.\n  This gap in special education funding, by the way, doesn't just hurt \ndisabled students; it hurts their classmates as well because we are \nforcing schools to make difficult decisions with regard to which kids \nget funding. In order to make up for the Federal funding shortfall, \nmany school districts have been forced to take money from their general \neducation budget, which affects every single student. I know we can do \nbetter for America's disabled students. Let us not make them wait \nanother 30 years to fully fund this law.\n  I urge my colleagues to fulfill the promise of IDEA and support the \nHagel-Harkin amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have a number of other speakers. I \nyield myself 6 minutes.\n  First of all, I congratulate the Senator from Iowa for his \nperseverance in ensuring that this issue would be brought to the floor \nof the Senate so the Senate can have an opportunity to vote on this \nvery important question that makes an enormous difference to hundreds \nof thousands--millions--of our fellow citizens, primarily the parents \nbut certainly the children who will also be affected. I commend him for \nhis doggedness and perseverance in pursuing what is basically a \nfundamental civil right.\n  The holdings by the courts of this country have said under the equal \nprotection laws that these children need to have the kind of necessary \nand reasonable accommodation they are entitled to under our Federal \nConstitution; therefore, we have the responsibility to make sure they \nare going to be protected and they are going to receive these kinds of \neducational opportunities.\n  As my good friend from Vermont pointed out, he has made special \neducation one of his real priorities in this institution. Over the \ncourse of his very distinguished career, he has added immeasurably to \nthe scope and understanding of the realization of the education for \nneedy children with special needs in this country. But he remembers, as \nI do, when we were trying to provide--going back to 1965 when we passed \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act--some funding for special \nneeds children. Over a period of years, we enhanced that funding to try \nto provide some help for special needs children. But all of that \nchanged dramatically after we had the court decisions that interpreted \nthe Equal Protection Clause to ensure that we were going to have to \nmake sure children with special needs were going to be able to have \neducational opportunities.\n  We passed the IDEA bill. What was the rational here in the U.S. \nCongress? What was the rational with the President at that particular \ntime? It was a general recognition that to educate a special needs \nchild, it was going to cost effectively double what it costs to \nnormally educate a child in this country. It is going to cost double \nthat--double of that in my State of Massachusetts. It varies slightly \nfrom different States, but, nonetheless, we recognized that it was \ngoing to be effectively doubled. That was the best estimate. That was \nthe testimony cited. It was the judgment and the decision that the \nCongress was going to help and assist the States and local communities. \nWe ensure over 80 percent of the funds provided in this program go to \nthe local community. There is some money that can be retained at the \nState level in terms of training programs and coordination of various \nservices, but this program was driven to the local level to help offset \nthe additional burdens that taxpayers would have in local communities.\n\n  As we all know, one of the extraordinary demands we have seen in \nsmall and large communities is when a family has a special needs child \nwho takes the extra services. They go to those town meetings and we \nfind out who is going to end up paying for those needs. In my own \nState, even with the IDEA, it only offsets 8 percent of the education \nprogram. We will come back to that later. However, it is only 8 \npercent. The greatest percent, 50 percent, is raised at the local level \nin local taxes. So we have services that will be necessary for special \nneeds children, causing particular hardships on small communities \nbecause of these additional expenditures.\n  When we fail in the Senate to provide that 40 percent, so often, \nparticularly now when we have scarce resources, we see the kind of \ntension that is taking place between parents who have children who do \nnot have disabilities and want to see the educational opportunities \nenhanced and those who have special needs and want to make sure their \nchildren are going to be covered. It brings enormous tension in local \ncommunities, neighbors struggling against neighbors.\n  We made the judgment and decision in 1979 when we passed the first \nIDEA act. At that time, we were only covering 2 million of the disabled \nchildren. Generally, it was considered to be 4.5 million children. The \nStates were covering 2 million children. There were 37 States that had \nIDEA-type legislation, but by and large, we were not providing help and \nassistance to these children, even though too often we saw the \nsituation where these children were effectively being warehoused, \npushed off into basements, pushed off into attics, pushed off into \nremote areas.\n  The idea they were getting a benefit of any education defied the \nimagination.\n  We decided we were going to encourage the States, and the way to \nencourage the States was to indicate that we at the national level were \ngoing to be in partnership with the States, and most importantly, in \npartnership with local communities. That is where this commitment lies, \nwith the local communities, the local towns. They pay the greatest \npercent of this burden. We were going to work with those local \ncommunities to help offset the expenditures.\n  We made a commitment that it was going to be 40 percent of that \nadditional cost. That is the basis of the argument for the 40 percent--\nwhy it is 40 percent and not 50 percent, why it was not 100 percent. We \nwanted to be a partner. This is what the decision was. That was a \ndecision and a judgment relied on by States and by local communities \nall across this country. That is a commitment and pledge that has not \nbeen kept.\n  As result of the fact we have not kept that commitment, local \ncommunities have been making up the difference and seeing their taxes \nrise to try to offset the challenges that local communities will face \nwhen they have special needs children. That is the issue we are trying \nto address today.\n  Today, we know we are fulfilling 19 percent of the challenge. The \nCongressional Research Service says, under the President's program, the \nway the administration is going, it would never be reached with \nincreases of $1 billion a year. It will never be reached.\n  Senator Harkin and Senator Hagel have said we have committed \nourselves to doing this. We ought to meet our responsibilities and \nprovide these resources which are so necessary and can make such an \nimportant difference.\n\n  With the legislation before the Senate, with all of the changes--and \nI will wait to go over those various changes\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nmade in the legislation, that we now will support and the contrast from \n1997--we have brought this legislation up to where it can make an \nextraordinary difference, will make an extraordinary difference for \nthose special needs children.\n  Now, people can ask, Where are you going to get the resources and \nwhere are you going to get the money given the kinds of challenges we \nare facing?\n  I just saw on the business page of the Washington Post, on Tuesday, \nMay 4, ``The Federal Deficit Likely to Narrow by $100 Billion.'' That \nis this year alone. The Harkin amendment would take $2.2 billion out of \nthat $100 billion that they expect this year over the other \npredictions. That is the responsible way.\n  I will not take the time now to go through the favorable comments \nthat those in the Treasury and the Budget Committee have made in terms \nof what they are expecting regarding the windfall. It is a matter of \npriority. It seems to me, if we will have a $100 billion windfall that \nwill come over the course of the summer, we ought to be able to afford \n$2.2 billion to meet our responsibilities to local communities all \nacross this country that are trying to meet their responsibilities to \neducate children who have special needs. That is the issue.\n  I have great respect for my colleague and friend, the chairman of our \ncommittee. I am going to vote in favor of his amendment that will \nincrease the authorization. If we increase the authorization, we are \nable to get the funding for that program, we would get to that 40 \npercent over a 7-year period, but, unfortunately, in terms of the \nauthorization with the No Child Left Behind Act, we have seen what is \nactually appropriated and what is authorized are going in different \ndirections.\n  It seems to me, if we are serious in trying to meet the needs of \nspecial needs children, we have the ability with this legislation, \nwhich will make the greatest difference in the world to special needs \nchildren in this country, that understands the importance of early \nintervention, understands the importance of transition, has brought \ninto place changes in terms of the discipline, brings in other kinds of \nagencies so they will involve themselves. It involves the local school \ncommunity to a greater extent, with greater flexibility, but still has \nstrong accountability.\n  We have a very important piece of legislation. This can make an \nextraordinary difference. I hope our colleagues and friends will pay \nheed to the opportunities we have with the Harkin-Hagel amendment. It \ncan make a very important difference. This is an obligation we have. We \nought to meet the obligations we have made to families across this \ncountry. They are being hard pressed and particularly hard pressed now \nwhen many of the States are cutting back their support in terms of \neducation funds. The burden is falling increasingly on these families.\n  We have an opportunity. With this positive news that is coming, we \nought to make sure we support the Harkin-Hagel amendment and meet our \nresponsibilities to special needs children.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  Mr. President, first of all, I, once again, thank the members of the \ncommittee for assisting in pulling together a bill which is a very \npositive piece of legislation in the area of special education. We all \nunderstand the historical development of special education. It has been \noutlined quite adequately and well by the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthe fact that for many years these children were put in special rooms \nor put in the basement and left there to basically be warehoused, for \nall intents and purposes.\n  Then, with the passage of the special education law back in 1976, \nthat all changed, and these kids ended up having an opportunity, a shot \nat decent education, and, where mainstreaming came into play, we tried \nto get them into the classroom, and to the extent they could not be in \nthe classroom, they would get high-quality care.\n  I have had a personal involvement in this issue for a long time. I \nchaired, was the president of, and a member of the board of directors, \nof a very excellent center for special needs children, which is an \neducational facility, not a hospital, called the Crotched Mountain \nRehabilitation Center, in New Hampshire. I was basically very active in \nthat center for many years, until the mid to late 1980s. So it is an \nissue that concerns me a lot.\n  I want to make sure these kids get adequate care and adequate \neducation. This bill makes giant strides toward addressing some of the \nproblems that have evolved over the years relative to special needs \nstudents, especially as we attempt to reduce the amount of bureaucracy \nand paperwork that teachers for special needs children specifically \nhave to handle.\n  It is estimated that some teachers for special needs children--\nprobably even a majority--spend almost a day and a half of every week \nessentially doing paperwork to maintain the lesson plans and the \nplanning process and making sure all the different regulatory activity \nis addressed relative to their jobs, instead of actually being with the \nchild and doing the classroom work that is so important. So this bill \ntries to address that.\n  It also tries to address the excessive litigiousness that has \noccurred over the years relative to special needs children, trying to \nreduce that, and getting us out of the courtroom and back into the \nclassroom with these kids. It is a very important factor.\n  It also addresses the question of discipline. This has been a \nproblem. It tries to give teachers and school officials a little more \ncontrol, significantly more control, in how they manage their \nclassrooms and dealing with children who are, unfortunately, \ndisruptive, but does it without uniquely penalizing a child whose \ndisruption is a function of their problem which they may have which \ngives them special needs. So I think we reach a balance that is very \nconstructive.\n  The bill is a positive step forward in trying to make the special \neducation laws more responsive to the outpouring of concerns we heard \nfrom school teachers, administrators, and parents across the country, \nbut especially, in my case, from New Hampshire. So we are trying to \naddress and improve the law to make it more efficient and effective.\n  We focus it now more on accountability. We want to make sure these \nchildren learn to the extent they are capable of learning. Rather than \njust going through a series of checking off boxes because this has been \ndone and that has been done, what we want to know is, are there \nresults? We try to adjust the process to focus on results versus \nbureaucracy and input. So that is the goal of this bill.\n\n  It is a good piece of legislation. It is bipartisan, as has been \nmentioned. The issues which remain are significant, but they are not \nthe core of the bill. The core of the bill is how it addresses the \nneeds of that child.\n  One of the major issues, obviously, that remains is how we fund this \nlegislation. This has been a primary concern of mine since I was \nelected. When I had the good fortune to serve as Governor of New \nHampshire, I believed that the single largest unfunded requirement the \nFederal Government was putting on us, outside of some of the \nenvironmental requirements, was this issue of how we paid for special \neducation. I did come here with the intention, and have, I believe, had \nreasonable impact on getting those dollars up, getting the Federal \ndollars up, the commitment up. It has been a long and very difficult \nroad, but it has been a road where significant success has been \naccomplished also.\n  I do not think we should ignore the fact that we have dramatically \nincreased funding in the special education accounts. In fact, if you \nlook at the special education funding accounts, I believe you will find \nthey are, as a percentage--obviously, not in gross dollars, but as a \npercentage--the fastest growing funding area in the Federal Government, \nand have been in that arena for the last 4 years during this \nPresident's time, and even prior to that since the Republicans took \nover the Senate.\n  I think it is important we refer to some of the history of what was \nhappening, and how we have increased funding in these accounts. First \noff, in 1996, when we Republicans retook control of the Senate, myself \nand other Members of the Senate, including Senator Lott and Senator \nSpecter, decided to make it an absolute priority.\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nIn fact, it became S. 1 at that time, the first bill we introduced, \nthat we would increase the funding for special education programs.\n  We started a process of increasing the commitment to funding to those \nprograms, which was significant. This chart reflects that increase. We \nhave gone from $2.3 billion--and each one of these increases represents \nvery substantive and dramatic increases. By the way, almost $1 billion \na year, since 1996, on a compounded basis, has been going into the \nspecial education accounts. So we went from $2.3 billion, when we \nstarted this aggressiveness--and I would like to think I was one of the \ninitiators of this, as was Senator Jeffords at the time--and have now \nmoved it up to $11.3 billion.\n  As a percentage, in 1996, when we started, the Federal Government was \npaying maybe 6 percent of the cost of special needs children. Now we \nare paying about 20 percent of the cost of special needs children.\n  I think it is very important in the context of the debate to put this \nin perspective relative to what the commitments made by the Clinton \nadministration were during this time because what happened during this \nperiod was that, actually, President Clinton did not send up any \nbudgets which increased special education funding until the last 2 \nyears of his administration. In fact, he was flat-funding special \neducation throughout his administration, for all intents and purposes. \nIt was not until the Republican Senate insisted that dollars be put \ninto special education, and we increased the funding by $1 billion a \nyear, as I mentioned, starting in 1996, that President Clinton actually \nresponded to that, and in the last 2 years of his administration \nstarted to put funds into this account.\n\n  If you look at it by year, you will notice essentially the Clinton \nadministration's funding levels were basically flat. If you look at our \nfunding, you will see that it increased dramatically during this \nperiod. In fact, in gross terms, over the 8 years of the Clinton \nadministration, his commitment to special education was $29 billion. In \nthe first 4 years of the Bush administration, the increase is $38 \nbillion. So just in a period of 4 years, President Bush has \ndramatically increased--almost by 50 percent--the total increases which \nwere made to special education funding during the 8 years of President \nClinton's administration.\n  This reflects the fact that once the Presidency changed, and \nPresident Bush came into office, there was actually even an \nacceleration of funding into the special education accounts beyond what \nwas occurring when we had a Republican Senate and a Democratic \nPresident and the Republican Senate was pushing the issue. Now we had \nan actual President who was in agreement with accelerating special \neducation funding, and we accelerated that funding rather dramatically.\n  President Bush, in every budget he has brought forward since becoming \nPresident, has proposed an increase of at least $1 billion--and that is \na compounded number--so that we have seen this rather dramatic increase \nin funding from the administration over this period of time which has \nled to this huge increase--significant increase--which, as I said, is \none of the fastest growing percentages in the Federal budget, if not \nthe fastest growing percentage in the Federal budget of funding for any \naccount. And that has occurred in the special education accounts.\n  In fact, when I looked at Senator Harkin's chart, I found it \ninteresting that at least he gave credit to the fact that the President \nwas increasing funding $1 billion a year--$1 billion a year; $1 billion \non top of $1 billion. That was not enough to reach the goals that we \nhad hoped to reach. But it was those big increases that he was \nreflecting there. And it is ironic that that would be attacked, that \nthe President would be attacked for only increasing funding $1 billion \na year--``only,'' using the term from the other side--only increasing \nfunding $1 billion a year and $1 billion the next year which is $2 \nbillion, and a billion dollars the next year which is $3 billion, that \nhe would be attacked for that. When the Democrats controlled the Senate \nand the Democrats controlled the Presidency, they flat-funded this \naccount. When President Clinton was President and we controlled the \nSenate, we had to really pull teeth to get the funding up. Now we have \na President who has been actively promoting the expansion of funding in \nthese accounts, aggressively and rather dramatically expanding it, and \nwhat do we hear from the other side: You are only doing $3 billion, $1 \nbillion 1 year, $1 billion on top of that, $1 billion the next year. It \nis a little inconsistent, to say the least, if not a touch hypocritical \nto make that statement in the context of the last time the budget was \nactually under their control.\n\n  In fact, if you go back to the last time Senator Harkin was the \nappropriating chairman--there was a period here where the Democratic \nParty did control the Senate, while President Bush was President, has \nbeen President. During that period Senator Harkin brought forward an \nappropriation, when he had control over the appropriations accounts \nthat deal with special education, which did not come anywhere near the \nnumber which he now claims should have been funded. He is claiming the \nfunding increase should have been $2.2 billion a year under his own \nchart. That is what he is saying.\n  Under his budget, as he brought it out--actually he never brought it \nat the floor of the Senate. It was passed through committee. They never \nactually brought a budget to the floor and they never brought an \nappropriations bill to the floor. Under his appropriations bill as it \npassed out of his committee, I believe his number was $875 million that \nhe had for an increase in the account. It might have been $1 billion. \nWhatever it was, it was less than the full funding he now says has to \nbe given or should have been given, even during that time under his own \ncharge, to special education.\n  So there is a disconnect. When they are in charge, when they control \nthe Presidency, when they control the Senate, they flat-fund special \neducation. When they control the Presidency and we control the Senate, \nwe have to pull teeth to get their President to send up a budget that \nincreases special education. When they control the Senate and we \ncontrol the Presidency, they send out an appropriations bill which is \nat least $1 billion less than what they claim we should be doing. There \nis, to say the least, a disconnect.\n  The fact is under this President we have seen the fastest growth in \nspecial education funding that has occurred in the history of the \naccounts. We have seen growth in special education funding in 4 years \nof $38 billion by President Bush as compared with $29 billion over 8 \nyears of the Clinton administration.\n  I believe when we make the case on this side of the aisle that we are \ncommitted to special education funding, that we are doing what we think \nis reasonable and capable within the context of this budget process--\nremember, we are running a deficit--to fund special education, where \nwe are giving it the single biggest increases of any account in the \nFederal Government year after year after year on a percentage basis, \nthat we come to this argument with significant credibility on our \ncommitment to fund special education and fund it aggressively.\n\n  That brings us to the substance of the debate on the amendment today. \nWhat Senator Harkin has proposed is we take prospective payments to \nspecial education accounts and make them mandatory. Remember, this \ncreates a whole new concept of how we fund things around here. This is \na brand new idea--and not a very good one--which suggests we create a \nnew highway where you are going to have discretionary accounts funding \nthe vast majority of the spending, and then you are going to put on top \nof the discretionary accounts, like a layer cake, a mandatory account. \nThis creates some pretty significant problems.\n  The first problem it creates is it creates a new mandatory account. \nMandatory accounts are not a good idea when you are running a deficit \nbecause they basically mean you do not set priorities. We as a \ngovernment, when you are running a $300 billion deficit, maybe more, \n$400 billion--according to Senator Kennedy, we are going to save $100 \nbillion this year, so maybe we are down to $300 billion or we may be at \n$400 billion--but when you are running this type of deficit, we as a \ngovernment have some responsibility to our constituents to be \nresponsible and to make choices, to prioritize needs.\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\n  We, as the Senate, have historically prioritized special education \nvery highly, at least whenever the Republicans have controlled the \nSenate. And we have asked for what would amount to a pathway to full \nfunding by 2010. We have put in Senate proposals that have represented \nthat approximately $2.2 billion in annual increases. We have done it \nthe right way. We have, when we have done that, cut other accounts. \nWhen we have passed these increases in our budget proposals that have \nbeen at $2.2 billion, we have reduced other accounts to offset those \nincreases. That is the priority we should set as a government.\n  But when you set up a mandatory account, you basically ignore \npriorities and you essentially say, let's add the money to the deficit, \nwhich is exactly what the Senator from Massachusetts is suggesting. \nThat is a different approach. It doesn't happen to be our approach on \nthis side of the aisle.\n  We think fiscal responsibility requires, especially in a time when we \nare running a deficit, that you set priorities. We believe we have \nshown, beyond any question on the facts, with these dramatic increases \nin special education funding, which we have done under Republican \nPresidents, under a Republican Senate, that in a competition for funds, \nspecial education wins and has won and will continue to win.\n  So to set up a mandatory account is a mistake, especially when you \nare running a deficit. It also creates a couple of other problems. One \nis that under the rules of the Senate, when you set up a mandatory \naccount, you must reduce discretionary accounts dollar for dollar for \nthat mandatory account. That is our budget rule. So as a practical \nmatter, it is very possible that unless we decide to waive that budget \nitem, we will actually end up reducing the discretionary spending that \nis committed toward special education, the $11 billion, in order to \nfund the mandatory spending. And we will probably end up or we \npotentially could end up, because this bill calls for $2 billion of \nmandatory spending, with a $2 billion reduction in discretionary \nspending so you would level-fund the mandatory. You would level-fund \nspecial education if the budget rules kick in the way they are written.\n\n  The practical effect would be there would be no net gain for special \neducation funding, or it would be very limited. So this becomes a bit \nof an illusory term, when you are using mandatory and you merge it with \ndiscretionary accounts. If it were pure mandatory, I guess you could \nargue the funding would occur. But under our rules, it is not going to \nbe pure mandatory. It is going to be this new hybrid, this layer cake, \nhalf mandatory, half discretionary.\n  The practical implication under our rules is you have to reduce \ndollar for dollar the discretionary accounts by the mandatory increase. \nWhat does that mean? Zero increase for special education, if these \nrules are applied in their present form.\n  There is another problem this creates, this new hybrid animal. For \nexample, if we accept the fact the mandatory money is coming through \nand that the discretionary accounts are not reduced--in other words, \nsay we waive this budget rule--we will create a scenario where the \nappropriators--of which I happen to be one and am very proud, and we do \na wonderful job, but as an appropriator, I will tell you what I am \nthinking. I am thinking I just got $2 billion I don't have to spend on \nthis discretionary account. I can put it somewhere else. Basically you \nare not guaranteeing this money at all. What you are doing is you are \ncreating more dollar availability for the appropriator who has that \ndiscretionary account to use in some other area.\n  That is the distinct potential here because there is no--let us call \nit ``maintenance of effort'' language in this amendment for the \nAppropriations Committee. So as a practical matter, you don't resolve \nthe problem this way. The only way you resolve the problem is to do it \nstraight up, which is to say we should fund this account on a glidepath \ntoward full funding, which is what the Senate has said.\n  We should use our appropriations authority and keep that discretion \nwithin the appropriations authority to accomplish that. We should set \nthe priorities so that special education gets fully funded. That is \nwhat my amendment does. It sets up the authorization levels to allow \nthe Appropriations Committee to proceed down that path.\n  Why do I think it will occur? Well, primarily because of the history \nhere, which is that when we as Republicans control the Senate--and now \nwe have a Republican President--we are making these huge increases in \nthe special education accounts. So the alternative that we presented \nhere is the more fiscally responsible way to do this. I think it is the \nmore practical way to get to the ends at which we are aimed.\n  You can throw out this term ``mandatory.'' When you go home to your \ntown meetings, it resonates well. I don't deny that for a second. But \nit is illusory when it is used in conjunction with the discretionary \nfunding accounts and when used in conjunction with the budget rules as \npresently structured in the Senate. It literally means nothing. The \nonly thing that is going to accomplish full funding for special \neducation is the willingness of the Senate and the House, hopefully, \nwhich has not joined us in the past, to assert the $2.2 billion \nincrease and move down that road and protect ourselves in conference \nwith the House.\n  To pass the Harkin amendment may make us feel good politically, but \nit creates bad policy and doesn't accomplish our goals, which is to get \nfull funding of special education. That is why I have put forward this \nalternative, which I think is a much more constructive approach.\n  I reserve our time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. MURKOWSKI). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I ask to be recognized for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, as a former Governor for Delaware and \nchairman of the National Governors Association, for a long time I have \nsupported full funding for IDEA. In fact, when Senator Gregg was \nCongressman Gregg, we served together in the House, and we talked about \nfull funding for IDEA. We talked about the Government's commitment to \n40 percent of the funding for special education and that we weren't \ncoming close to it. Today, we are actually making progress in getting \ncloser to that number. We are about halfway there. We have a good way \nto go. Senator Harkin's and Senator Hagel's amendment will take us \nwhere we need to go.\n  I rise to say I would like to be able to offer an amendment to the \nHarkin-Hagel amendment, but I cannot do it. Under the unanimous consent \nagreement, this pay-go amendment is precluded. Since I cannot offer it, \nI ask unanimous consent that this amendment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To pay for mandatory full funding of part B of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act by restoring the top income \n                    tax rate to its pre-2001 level)\n\n       At the end add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESTORATION OF HIGHEST INCOME TAX RATE TO PRE-2001 \n                   LEVEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The last column in the table contained in \n     section 1(i)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to reductions in rates after June 30, 2001) is \n     amended by striking ``35.0%'' and inserting ``39.6%''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2004.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I printed this amendment for Senator \nChafee, myself, and Senator Feingold, who have been among the champions \nfor the pay-go principle. I think if things are worth doing, we ought \nto pay for them. If it is worth investing more money in our efforts in \nIraq, we ought to pay for it. If it is worth funding special education, \nwe ought to pay for that. I think that argument goes for both \nmeritorious causes.\n  The thing about pay-go is that it calls for a 60-vote margin in order \nto bust the budget and the caps. We used to operate under these \nguidelines throughout the 1990s, when we went from huge deficits to \nbalancing the budget.\n  Pay-go lapsed in 2001. We need to restore it. One of the issues being \ndiscussed and debated now in the conference on the budget resolution is \nwhether to reestablish the pay-go principle. It ought to be restored \nand reestablished.\n  Today, rather than being denied the opportunity to offer this \namendment\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\nbecause of the procedures we are operating under, we would be able to \ncite the Budget Act pay-go principles and automatically have a 60-vote \nprocedure before us. Having said that, we are operating under a rule \nthat will--in this instance at least--require 60 votes, so that \nthreshold of a 60-vote supermajority will apply even without pay-go.\n  I will vote for this amendment. I just wish we had the pay-as-you-go \nprinciple in place so we would not be denied the opportunity to offer \nthis amendment and we could offer it routinely. That is what I wanted \nto say today. I especially thank Senator Baucus who was in line ahead \nof me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask to speak for 5 minutes in favor of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I thank my friend from Delaware. I agree \nwith him. I believe we should have pay-go principles in the Senate. I \nhope the Budget Committee adopts pay-go. I think it would be a \ndereliction of duty not to. I also support his view on this amendment.\n  For the last 10, 15 minutes I have heard a lot of complaints against \nthe Clinton administration, against Democrats, how they have not really \nhelped special education. One can use that argument and point the \nfinger, playing one party against the other. I have all kinds of data \nthat resoundingly refute the allegations made by the chairman of the \ncommittee. It is just not accurate. But I will not get into that. That \nis not why we are here.\n  We are not here to blame and say who is doing a better job, \nRepublicans or Democrats. People back home don't care two hoots about \nthat. They care about whether we are doing our job as a body. I submit \nthat we are not doing our job with respect to providing the dollars for \nspecial education. I don't know about you, Madam President, but when I \nam in my State, I hear constantly from school districts, school \nadministrators, about how pressed they are and their inability to meet \ncosts and the cost increases.\n  As you well know, we have in America a system where elementary and \nsecondary education is paid for basically by taxpayer dollars, property \ntaxes. That is what it comes down to. People are stressed, with the \neconomy not doing too well in our States. School levies are not going \nthrough. People cannot pay more property taxes to support anything. \nThey would love to support their schools, but they cannot afford it.\n  Costs for school districts in Montana have gone up over 1,000 percent \nin the last 20 years; that is for special education and elementary \neducation in general. That is the cost increase. School districts in \nMontana--and I daresay most school districts across the country--are \nfacing this. What do we do about it?\n  As you know, Madam President, back in 1975, Congress passed a law--\nIDEA--regarding special education. What did that law provide? It \nprovided for ramping up 40 percent payment of IDEA, of special \neducation costs. That was the law in 1975. Beginning in 1978, there \nwould be a 5-percent increase; in 1979, 10 percent of the funding; in \n1980, 20 percent would be paid; up to 1982 when 40 percent--the full \namount--of special education costs would be provided for by Uncle Sam. \nThat was back in 1975 when that statute was passed.\n  Here we are in 2004, and I think we are only at 18 percent. We have \nnot made good on our promise. We are way off base. So a lot of the data \nwe have heard about a 365-percent increase is misleading. You can do \nanything with statistics. Those statistics start from a very low base, \nand I am just telling you what the law is. The law was that back in \n1975 we would ramp it up to 40 percent by 1982. That is why it is our \nfailure to do so. We are only at 18 percent; that is all we come up \nwith. With costs going up so much at home, that is why I believe the \nHarkin approach makes sense. We need mandatory increases up to 2014--\nnot discretionary, because it has been discretionary. And when the \nPresident is given discretion what has happened? Virtually nothing.\n  Sure, we are getting some increases, just a little bit, but it is \nvirtually nothing. Congress always finds a way, Presidents always find \na way, not to spend money on education. Other things seemingly are more \nimportant.\n  If we do not pass the Harkin amendment, mark my words, there is no \nway we are ever going to get up even close to 40 percent. We are not \ngoing to get up to 25 percent by the year 2014. It is not going to \nhappen. It is only going to happen if we keep our feet to the fire and \nforce the President and the Congress to come up with the promise that \nwe should fulfill. We should fulfill it because we made that promise.\n  I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is a promise we made. We should live up to our \npromise. No. 2, we are coming nowhere near living up to our promise. \nNo. 3, costs are going up dramatically in all our States for special \neducation, and we are not helping address that. And No. 4 is the \ntremendous importance of education in this country. We are competing \nworldwide with elementary and high school students in Pusan, Korea, in \nCzechoslovakia, high schools and elementary schools all around the \nworld. Education is going to be the key to America's economic success \nin the future. It is going to have to be education. It cannot be \nanything else.\n  We need to educate our kids. We ought to set priorities for educating \nour kids rather than spending money elsewhere.\n  We have a lot of programs on which I do not think money should be \nspent. I think most Americans think our priorities are a little askew \nand that we should spend more on education, helping our kids, than we \nare thus far.\n  I heard the argument, well, gee, if it is mandatory, first, that is \nnot necessary. That is the main argument to be made. I have shown how \nnecessary it is.\n  The second argument I hear is, well, it is illusory, that perhaps the \ndiscretionary portion will not be provided. That is a false statement. \nFirst, we are talking about the very worst case scenario. The mandatory \nportion will be provided for. It is possible that the discretionary \nportion may not be provided for by Congress. That is possible. The very \nworst possible situation is that we only get the mandatory increase \nunder this amendment, but sure as I am standing here, my colleagues \nknow doggoned well that Congress is not going to provide the \ndiscretionary money, too.\n  We are talking about education, and with the mandatory increase \nprovided for we are certainly going to provide for the discretionary \nportion, too. This amendment is a no-brainer. It is clear to this \nSenator this amendment must and should pass, for the sake of our kids. \nWe have a duty on the face of this Earth, I believe a moral obligation, \nto leave this place in as good a shape or better shape than we found \nit. Clearly, that includes making sure our kids, special education \nstudents, are in as good a shape or better shape than we had when we \nwere being educated, particularly given the competitive forces in the \nworld.\n  I strongly urge the passage of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Judd Gregg for his \nleadership on this issue. When I came to the Senate some years ago, \nthere was no greater champion for IDEA funding by the Federal \nGovernment or improving IDEA than Senator Gregg. He has maintained that \nand he continues to be an expert, as my colleagues can tell when they \nhear him speak about it.\n  We have made tremendous progress since I came to the Senate in \nfunding special education. We have seen the numbers, how much they have \nincreased since 1996, and we will continue to make progress. We have \ngone from 7 percent of the funding for this education program for our \nschools around the country to almost 20 percent. We are going to keep \non increasing that.\n  The legislation we have before us today, however, unanimously came \nout of our HELP Committee, of which I am a member. It was a product of \na lot of hard work and hours and hours of discussion. There are a \nnumber of provisions in the bill that I would like to see improved and \nstrengthened. Maybe some on the other side think it could\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nbe improved more, but we hammered out this agreement because we need to \nmove this bill forward. We need to increase funding, once again \nsignificantly, for IDEA. We need to give more control and make a better \ncommitment to the practical application of the law.\n  The special education bill was enacted in 1975 with the goal of \nencouraging schools to mainstream students with disabilities, keep them \nin the normal classroom where possible and give special treatment where \nnecessary.\n  States that follow Federal rules receive federal financial \nassistance, and in 2002, 6.5 million students were served through IDEA. \nSchools have responded to this challenge positively, and they are \nexpending very large sums of money to meet the goals of this law. In \nfact, I remember distinctly several years ago the school board \nsuperintendent of a county in Vermont testifying that 40 percent of his \ncounty's budget for that school system went to the IDEA program.\n  In recent years, the President and Congress have increased the \nfederal investment in this program. If the President's proposed budget \nis enacted, IDEA funding will have increased 376 percent since 1996, 8 \nyears ago.\n  I have been repeatedly told, however, when I travel in my State, and \nI made this a special project of mine, that this funding is not the \nonly problem. Repeatedly I have been told there are things bigger and \nmore important than funding. One teacher who had been working in \nspecial education for many years, who is very bright and has a master's \ndegree, told me: Jeff, we are not looking out for our children. We have \nlost sight of what is good for the students. What we are doing is \nfilling out paperwork and keeping our sight on the lawyers. It is \nthreatening the integrity of the system, and we are not focusing on how \nto help each individual child achieve their highest and best skills.\n  The paperwork procedures are burdensome to a significant degree. I \nhave asked them about it. Too often teachers and principals are faced \nwith a literal maze of regulations and laws that must be met before a \ndisruptive child can be removed from a classroom. Too often school \ndistricts are forced to spend thousands of dollars on attorneys and \nlitigation costs that could be avoided if the parties simply sat down \nand discussed the issues rather than forcing the disputes to court. \nThese problems not only distract our dedicated educators from the core \nmission of teaching our children, they cause stress and confrontation \nthat can be avoided if common sense were applied.\n  I have received letters from hundreds of teachers in my State, from \nparents and educators, who are concerned about the current management \nof this system. The frustration, the anger, and the compassion in these \nletters are powerful.\n  I have also visited schools across the State of Alabama and heard \nfirsthand from educators about the problems the current law creates for \nstudents, parents, and teachers. I go into schools and I ask them to \ntell me what the problems are, what frustrates them the most. Almost \nuniversally special education, IDEA, comes up as one of the top \nexamples of a program they believe is micromanaged from Washington, \ndoes not allow teachers who love children to be able to have the \nfreedom to help those children in the best way possible. They have told \nme that problems with the current law are going to drive them out of \nthe profession. They are going to leave the profession over these \nfrustrations. They have dedicated their lives to improving the welfare \nof disabled children.\n  A veteran special education teacher wrote me this:\n\n       I consider myself on the front lines of the ongoing battles \n     that take place on a daily basis in our Nation's schools. I \n     strongly believe that the current IDEA law fuels these \n     struggles. The law, though well intended, has become one of \n     the single greatest obstacles that educators face in our \n     fight to provide all of our children with a quality education \n     delivered in a safe environment. I have dedicated my life to \n     helping children with special needs. However, at times my \n     frustration has been so high that I have literally gotten in \n     my car to leave--\n\n  Leave the profession, she means--\n\n     but my moral responsibilities to the children I have in my \n     class have kept me there. The law must be reformed now. As my \n     grandmother said, ``right is right and wrong is wrong'' and \n     to enable the current system to continue is just wrong.\n\n  Another 32-year special education veteran wrote:\n\n       If IDEA is not revised to be less restrictive and \n     burdensome, we might as well as kiss public education good-\n     bye. If changes are not made, we will have one of the largest \n     teaching shortages on record. In the past I have had 5 to 10 \n     college students coming to me in the spring to apply for \n     positions. This year I have none. Most are fearful of \n     entering the special education field because of the threat \n     of litigation brought about by IDEA.\n\n  They are afraid of being sued. The regulations are complex and there \nare a group of lawyers and specialists in this who descend on the \nsystem on a regular basis. So it is time for a change and Congress \nshould be leading the charge for positive change, to make it better.\n  I have a number of other letters from teachers and students who fear \nfor their safety every day. They feel handcuffed by the current rules \nand feel overwhelmed with the requirements of the current law. I \nbelieve it will be a tragedy if we lose proven, dedicated teachers \nbecause of the shortcomings of a Federal law that is not adequately \nfulfilling its purposes.\n  I saw a poll recently, I think in the State of Washington, of special \neducation teachers. An astounding number said they did not expect to be \nin the profession in 5 years. This is the reason that is occurring.\n  President Bush has recognized the importance of the IDEA law, and the \nneed to bring real reform to the system. In order to get an accurate \npicture, the President appointed a commission to review the law and \nprovide recommendations. The commission held 13 hearings and meetings \nthroughout the Nation and listened to the concerns and comments of \nparents and teachers, principals, and so forth. Over 100 expert \nwitnesses and more than 175 parents, teachers, students with \ndisabilities, and others addressed the commission. Hundreds have \nprovided letters and written statements.\n  The commission distilled this information into a set of principles \nthat were used during the reauthorization process. First, decrease the \nemphasis on compliance with procedure and increase the emphasis on \nresults. That means decrease paperwork and that kind of thing, and ask \nwhether children are benefitting to the maximum extent by the special \nefforts we are expending.\n  Second, simplify the law's burdensome due process requirements, which \ncreate inordinate amounts of paperwork, limit the ability of schools to \nproperly discipline children with disabilities for inappropriate \nbehavior, and intensify adversity between parents and schools. This is \na big problem. Put two children in a classroom, one a disabled child, \nthat child has substantially greater expectation of not receiving the \nsame discipline as another child for the same offense. Sometimes the \ndisability is totally unconnected to the discipline problem that shows \nup in a classroom.\n  A child who sells drugs, for instance. That behavior is very unlikely \nto be a part or product of the disability and that child should be \ndisciplined as other children where that makes sense, and under the \nappropriate rules of the school.\n  Third, reduce misidentification of students, which has fueled growing \nIDEA costs. Too many students are being placed in IDEA programs who do \nnot need to be there, and that is not good for the children and it is \nnot good for the school system.\n  Finally, increase the role of parents in determining the most \nappropriate setting for their child's education.\n  This legislation does much to achieve those principles. It reflects a \nbalanced approach that, as I said, was voted out of our committee \nunanimously.\n  On the question of discipline, that is something I have talked a lot \nabout and our committee has worked on it. We didn't make big changes in \nthe bill that came out of committee. We made some changes. We made some \nimprovements in the law that I think certainly will put us on a more \nrational basis and will help reduce excessive litigation.\n  One of the things, for example, is this: Before a lawsuit is filed \nand a school board has to go to court, they have to be notified \nspecifically of what it is the school is alleged to have done \nimproperly with regard to their child, and the school board has a \nchance to\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\ncorrect it. What we are finding is lawsuits have been filed all over \nthe country, schools have been taken to court at great expense, and by \nthe time they finish the litigation not only do they have to pay their \nown attorneys, not only are their own principals and teachers called \nout of classrooms to testify and prepare for trial, but they have to \npay the costs of the plaintiffs' attorney if one thing they did was \nwrong. They may make eight allegations, but if they are wrong in any \nway and are found liable, then they have to pay the child's attorney.\n  We need to figure out how we can avoid some of this litigation. It is \nmoney out of the pocket of the school system. It is money not being \nspent to educate children but to litigate in court, and sometimes these \ncases cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenses for school \nsystems. Nearly 8 in 10 teachers say there are persistent troublemakers \nin the school who need to be removed and we have created a system that \nis so complex and so litigious it is not working and it is driving up \ncosts in an unwise way.\n  I will offer some more comments for the Record, but I will conclude \nby saying this: Special education is a big program in America today. \nThis Congress, this Senate is increasing funding steadily for this \nprogram. We need to continue to do that and need to continue to reach \ntoward that commitment Congress made before I came here to pay 40 \npercent of that cost. I think we should do that and we should be on the \nroad to that.\n  However, as Senator Gregg knows--who is the senior member of the \nBudget Committee also and knows how things work here in reality--this \nis a weird deal, to mix and match discretionary and mandatory spending. \nIn fact, we are criticized substantially in this body for going toward \nmandatory spending for too many programs. In fact, most objective \nobservers in Congress believe that has diminished the ability of \nCongress to set priorities and accomplish good things for our children. \nWe do not need to put this in mandatory spending. We need to continue \nthe steady goals and progress we have made to reach the highest level \nof funding, reach the full funding we are committed to do.\n  I believe we can do that. I believe this bill is a tremendous step in \nthe right direction toward that goal. I will continue to work for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On behalf of Senator Kennedy, I yield 4 minutes to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, like many of my colleagues I rise in \nstrong support of the Harkin-Hagel amendment to require full funding of \nIDEA, providing these increases over 6 years on a mandatory basis. It \nis straightforward. I think it is absolutely necessary. As a number of \nmy colleagues have said, there is nothing that strikes more at the \nheart of my dialog with my constituents and those who are involved in \nthe educational system than getting to full funding on IDEA. It is \nabsolutely essential.\n  Before I go into some of the reasons, I also want to say how pleased \nI am with the work of the committee, for taking up this legislation, \nstructuring it, and moving it forward, and with reform, but also for \nincluding some things I think were essential. There are provisions that \nwere added at our request with regard to making funds available to \nimprove programs for autism spectrum disorder, which is a very \nsignificantly growing, recognized disability many children are facing. \nWe need to have funding in addressing it, particularly the early \nchildhood elements.\n  I am also pleased the committee was willing to work with us to \nclarify parents' rights to represent their children in due process \nhearings.\n  I think it makes a huge difference as we go forward in making sure \nall of our children are represented. But my main point is it is not \nenough to say we all embrace dealing with special education. This \nprogram is drastically underfunded, and it is posing a significant \nburden on the citizens of my State and across our Nation.\n  It gets at the heart of the tax question. We put down what I think is \na terrific legislative initiative in 1975 to deal with disabilities \namong children and to improve their educational opportunity. But we \nalso put down an objective that we were going to move to 40 percent of \nthe average funding for each child with disabilities. We are nowhere \nclose. I think it is 18.5 percent or so. We are way behind. That is why \nit is mandatory to step it up over the next 6 years. It is so \nimportant. It is real common sense.\n  I have to tell you in my home State of New Jersey, school budgets are \ncapped at only 3 percent annual growth per year. When the spending on \nspecial education goes up more, we end by accommodating mandates which \nare required by cutting other costs in our educational system. We set \nup a horrific dynamic in our local communities. The only other out on \nthat is local property taxes, which at least in my State are the \nhighest in the Nation, and we are already extraordinarily burdened by \nthem. That is true across the country.\n  It is absolutely essential that we get to full funding. The \ndifference in 2004 versus where we are today and where we would be if \nwe had fully funded 40 percent is almost $300 million--$320 million, \n$319 million is what we are going to receive, and $641 million is what \nwe would have received if we had full funding. It is a huge difference \non the tax base in our community.\n  I cannot tell you that there is any other issue which generates more \nheat because it sets neighbor against neighbor in the school districts \nabout how they have to make tough choices, or it forces us to go to the \ntaxpayer and raise local property tax burdens which are already \nextraordinarily high in my State. But it is also true in other places.\n  I have an example of a situation in New Jersey where an individual \ntalks about her son whose needs are being addressed in special \neducation but also reflecting what it has translated into not only for \nher son but to the special education programs and the rising burden on \nindividual property taxes. It is setting up a system of failure and \nconflict in our communities. That is unacceptable.\n  We need to accept our responsibility here in Washington to fulfill \nour pledge and our promise to move to that 40 percent so we don't have \nthese dynamics. It is time it happened.\n  I fully support and compliment the distinguished Senator from Iowa. I \nhope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, we are going to hear a lot of rhetoric \ntoday. I want people to know exactly what it is about.\n  I will be opposing Senator Harkin's amendment. I will be supporting \nSenator Gregg's amendment. Senator Gregg's amendment will actually work \nus toward achieving the goal of full funding for IDEA. It is not a \npolitical statement. We have been having this debate for some time. \nThere hasn't been the kind of progress any of us would like to have on \nit, but there has been steady progress. There has been more steady \nprogress since this President and Senator Gregg have been working on \nthis issue.\n  During the 8 years President Clinton was in office, the increase in \npart B funds was $1.4 billion. Under this President--a much shorter \ntime--it has been $3.7 billion. That is reality versus rhetoric.\n  I want to make a few comments about the bill as a whole because we \nhaven't had a chance to actually debate that. I want to point out how \nbipartisan the reauthorization was that came out of committee, how well \npeople worked on it, worked on it together, resolved differences and \nmade it possible for it to come to the floor and now to pass the floor \nin a relatively short time, I hope, so we hopefully can have a \nconference committee and work out any differences with the House and \nget this legislation into place.\n  This reauthorization is past due. I am pleased the Senate has begun \nconsideration of S. 1248, the Individuals With Disabilities Education \nImprovement Act of 2003. There are few issues as important as the \neducation of our Nation's youth. Making sure all children receive a \ngood education has been a longstanding goal of this body. I am pleased \nthe committee was able to reach unanimous support of the underlying \nbill, and I hope this body will act\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\nquickly to agree to this important legislation and send it to \nconference.\n  Since Congress first began providing State grant funding for the \neducation of disabled students in 1966, the process for ensuring every \ndisabled student receives a free, appropriate public education has been \nrefined and improved from one reauthorization to the next. I believe \nthis legislation is another important step in that process.\n  While there are many improvements to the law in this legislation, I \nwant to highlight four changes which I feel are most important to my \nhome State of Wyoming.\n  First, there is an increased emphasis on early identification and \nintervention. Wyoming currently uses the model that identifies students \nas disabled once they fall more than two grade levels behind. Many \nStates use the same method, or a method called the IQ discrepancy test. \nBoth of these models tend to limit the positive effects that timely \nservices will have on a student's growth. Unfortunately, States are \ncompelled to use these models because of the requirements that exist in \nFederal law.\n  This bill provides for a set-aside of part B funds that can be used \nfor services such as tutoring or other special assistance to students \nwho are at risk of being identified as needing special education. That \nwill help these students meet their potential.\n  Research by the President's Commission on Special Education and the \nNational Research Council has identified important benefits to \nproviding early educational intervention. They suggest early \neducational intervention can reduce the number of children referred to \nspecial education.\n  That research also shows students receiving early educational \nintervention and who are referred to special education frequently \nrequire less intensive services.\n  I believe this is an important step toward ensuring that other \ndisabled students receive the services they need without placing \nchildren in the special education programs unnecessarily. By using \nfunds for early intervention services, schools will be able to provide \nservices in a very seamless fashion to students with disabilities or \nstudents who may be unnecessarily referred to special education \nprograms.\n\n  Second, this legislation addresses the needs of rural States by \nclearly defining what is a highly qualified teacher. Under the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, which received large bipartisan support in Congress, \nall teachers in public elementary and secondary schools must meet the \nhighly qualified teacher standard.\n  In rural States such as Wyoming, many teachers, including special \neducation teachers, are responsible for multiple subjects. In my home \nState, they are sometimes responsible for multiple grades as well. The \nlegislation we are considering would work hand in hand with the No \nChild Left Behind Act to help address the concerns of teachers in this \nchallenging position.\n  This bill requires every disabled child to be taught by a highly \nqualified teacher, but it also maintains State flexibility to determine \nwhat constitutes highly qualified. The only requirement is that special \neducation teachers have an undergraduate degree and be fully certified \nas special education instructors, and that the students have a chance \nto be taught by an instructor who is highly qualified in the subject \narea. The bill does not even require that be the same person.\n  In many schools, disabled students are placed in classrooms with \ntheir non-disabled peers, and they receive instructions from more than \none teacher. Students with disabilities would be instructed in the \nappropriate subject area by a highly qualified teacher who has \ndemonstrated mastery of the subject, but they would also receive \nsupport from a teacher who meets the highly qualified standard for \nspecial education. It is a very important distinction.\n\n  For teachers who are responsible for both the special education and \nthe content area, this legislation preserves the flexibility of the \nState that was created under No Child Left Behind to define what \nconstitutes a highly qualified teacher.\n  I continue to be impressed that more than 95 percent of Wyoming \nteachers meet the highly qualified teacher standard, including its \nspecial educators.\n  This legislation will support the commitment of States such as \nWyoming with a 95-percent rate to place a highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom, whether it is a special education classroom or not.\n  The third point of the bill, that I want to address is that this \nlegislation makes improvements to the disciplinary system that operates \nunder current law. A concern I have heard from parents and educators is \nthat the discipline of students with disabilities has led to the \ncreation of a two-tier disciplinary system. Students with disabilities \nare treated differently from their peers because it is required by law.\n  I don't believe that is in the best interest of these students when \nwe are asking, for academic purposes, that we place them in the least \nrestrictive environment. It is inconsistent to say we would treat \ndisabled students as we treat their peers until they are in need of \ndiscipline. Disabled students are able to learn responsibility just \nlike their peers. We should give them a chance to learn the same kind \nof responsibility we expect of other students.\n  Many parents I talk with about discipline are concerned that we not \nallow teachers to discipline disabled students too harshly. I agree. I \nthink everyone agrees. I support the bill we are considering because it \npreserves protections for disabled students, like the protection that \nschools must abide by the manifest determination standard, which \nrequires schools to determine if the student's disability led to the \nbehavior--that is a key--if the student's disability led to the \nbehavior.\n  This bill also preserves the rights of parents to question the \nschool's decision. I also believe this legislation makes significant \nimprovements in permitting teachers and school administrators to \nproperly discipline students with disabilities when a need is \nidentified.\n  Schools are given a margin of flexibility to remove disabled students \nfrom their classroom when a dangerous situation presents itself. The \nschool is still accountable to the parent, however, and must make every \neffort to return the student to the classroom as soon as possible.\n  Finally, I wish to highlight the issue of State flexibility. For \nyears, local educational agencies have been permitted to use \nflexibility with their funding. As the Federal Government increases its \ncommitment to funding special education programs, local districts in \nmost States are able to shift funding into other priorities. \nTraditionally, their funding has not even been limited in its use to \neducational purposes.\n  This flexibility has never benefitted Wyoming. That is because \nWyoming has decided to use an alternative financing method for its \nspecial education programs.\n  Instead of the State passing Federal funding on to the local \ndistricts, Wyoming retains the bulk of the funding at the State level \nand reimburses districts for their special education expenses. Part of \nthe reason for this approach is we do not pay for our education with \nproperty taxes as most States do. We use mineral taxes, which come from \na few spots in the State. This system has worked in Wyoming for several \nreasons, including the help it provides to shield local districts from \nthe cost of services for severely disabled students.\n  Some of the districts in Wyoming are so small that a single student \nwith a severe disability would require all of the funding available to \nthat district to be spent on a single student. That would threaten the \nservices to other children with disabilities and subject the district \nto due process hearings under the law.\n\n  Instead, Wyoming has elected to use its allocations under part B of \nthe special education program as reimbursements. Even very small \ndistricts can confidently provide services to students with \ndisabilities with the understanding that the State will reimburse them \nfor those services.\n  Even though the system is much more effective at providing services \nto students with disabilities, the lack of flexibility in the use of \nFederal funding has tied the hands of the State's administrators who \nwould like to use the funding for early identification and other \neducational programs. The irony\n\n[[Page S5339]]\n\nis, if Wyoming were to operate their special education programs \ndifferently, and less effectively, they would enjoy much more \nflexibility with their funding. Right now in Wyoming, families of \nstudents with disabilities are moving from other States to enroll their \nchildren in Wyoming schools because we have done so well at meeting \ntheir needs. Even though our programs are among the best in the \nregion--and, I argue, among the best in the country--Wyoming is \npenalized for doing a good job just because we do it differently than \nFederal law suggests we do it.\n  The phrase ``one size fits all'' has been used a lot in the Senate \nlately on the subject of education. But at the risk of abusing the \nterm, this is a perfect example of a one-size-fits-all program that \ndoes not fit Wyoming. If Wyoming were to pursue a less effective model \nof providing services to students with disabilities, the State could \nuse more flexibility. Instead, because the State decided to use a \nsystem that places the needs of the students first, we are denied the \nsame flexibility provided every other State.\n  The legislation we are considering now would address this concern. It \nwould allow States that are responsible for the largest share of non-\nFederal special education funding to enjoy more flexibility at the \nState level. It is important to note that this flexibility is only \napplied to educational programs so no State can drain funding away from \nits educational programs for other purposes. The funding has to be used \nin conjunction with State educational efforts.\n  This is a critical piece of legislation, and one I feel strongly \nabout retaining both in this legislation and the bill that is produced \nby the conference process.\n  Those are the four main points of the actual legislation. That is \nlegislation, again, that we unanimously supported out of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee--that is no small achievement. \nIt is important we move forward in the process. That is what we are \ndoing now.\n  Of course, we are debating two amendments, the Harkin amendment and \nthe Gregg amendment, which will each be voted on this afternoon. I will \nmake a few comments in support of the Gregg amendment to fully fund the \nIDEA program.\n  According to assumptions in the Senate budget resolution this body \npassed earlier this year, we will have increased spending by 75 percent \nfrom 2001 levels. The Gregg amendment builds on those increases and \nsets us on a path to reach full funding by 2011. That is a very \nrealistic path, one that we can do, one that we can slightly \naccelerate. It is not just a statement but something that can happen.\n  I have heard colleagues comment that we can do anything with \nstatistics. That is a common perception. But if my colleagues would \nrather look at the real dollars, we spend more now on education than we \never have in this country at the Federal level. Right now, under the \nassumptions of the fiscal year 2005 budget, we will be at 20 percent of \nthe share of Federal special education. The Gregg amendment would take \nus to the 40-percent mark in 7 years. That is the mark we have in the \noriginal legislation.\n  I have mentioned, again, that happened in 1966. We are at a higher \nlevel now than we have ever been. It is pretty remarkable since it took \nover 30 years to get to 20 percent, but most of the progress that has \noccurred has occurred under this President in the past 4 years.\n  I want to make it clear, we are closer to full funding now than we \never have been in the history of this IDEA program. To get there within \n7 years is within reach, but we should not be confused that mandatory \nspending is the right solution. I can hear the Members who made \nprevious speeches saying: No, no, this is not mandatory. The way I read \nit, it is mandatory. But even if it were not mandatory, I am not aware \nof a program, particularly not this program, where we reduced spending. \nWhatever level we take it to at this moment is where it will stay. Then \nwe will fight to show we are more concerned than anyone else in raising \nthe revenues in the future.\n  So we need to have a rational, realistic, and regular approach to \nraising the level of IDEA funding until we can come in compliance with \nthe 40 percent that we promised.\n  We have made significant progress in the past 4 years toward full \nfunding under the current administration and congressional leadership. \nThere is no reason to assume we will not continue to make significant \nprogress in the near future.\n  I want to mention again that under the previous President, during his \n8 years, we increased part B funding $1.4 billion. Under this \nPresident, in 3 years we have increased it $3.7 billion.\n  I have to point out, under the previous administration we were \nfunding during a surplus. We were funding in period of growth, not a \nrecession. We were not funding during a time of terrorism. We were not \nfunding during a time of war in Afghanistan. We were not funding during \na time of war in Iraq. We were funding during a surplus, and we did not \nmeet that 40-percent goal.\n  Now, when we have severe budget constraints, there is a political \nstatement that says: Give it all to them. And then there is a balanced \napproach that Senator Gregg has that says: Let's grow it and really get \nit done and quit making the political statements on it.\n  We have an opportunity to advance IDEA and to advance the funding on \nit. I know we will take advantage of both.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 17 minutes \n40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time is on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 25 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I did not hear that. The Senator from \nMassachusetts yielded me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is yielded 7 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer. I did not hear that.\n  Mr. President, first, I would like to respond to my friend from New \nHampshire who was in the Chamber earlier, and maybe some others, who \ntalked about the GOP record. He had a chart that said Republicans have \ndone more any way you slice it, and then went on to say that President \nBush is attacked for increasing spending by $1 billion a year.\n  I want to address that with my friend from New Hampshire in the \nChamber. I never attacked President Bush for this. I have not heard \nanyone on this side attack Republicans or President Bush for this. In \nthe 30 years we have been discussing, amending, and fashioning \ndisability policy in the Senate and the Congress, it has never been a \npartisan issue. It was not when we first did IDEA. It was not when we \ndid the Americans with Disabilities Act. We may disagree on funding and \nstuff and how we do it, but I have never known it to be a partisan \nissue. I have purposely not attacked the President, the Republicans, or \nanyone else for this. No one on our side has on this point, and we are \nnot attacking anyone.\n  So I refuse to look upon this as any kind of partisan issue. You can \ngo back and look at who did what when, and all that, but what I want to \nfocus on is the here and now. Where are we now? What did Congress \npromise? What kind of situation are we in? Let's look at the future.\n  I am sorry somebody is trying to put this in a partisan framework. It \nhas never been that way. It has always been a bipartisan issue. We \nought to continue on that approach. Yes, we can disagree on whether or \nnot it would be discretionary or mandatory, but not on a partisan \nbasis.\n  I want to talk also about the mix of mandatory and discretionary. \nThere has been some talk that this is some kind of--I heard it said--\n``weird mix'' of mandatory and discretionary money. We have done that \nbefore. We have the childcare block grant. We have safe and stable \nfamilies. We have some NIH funding. I have come up with this right now. \nThere are probably a lot more programs for which we have both mandatory \nand discretionary funding.\n\n[[Page S5340]]\n\n  Also, my friend from New Hampshire said there is some kind of budget \nrule--I did not get this clear--that means our amendment would result \nin a reduction in discretionary spending. That is absolutely not so. It \nis only so if you move money from discretionary to mandatory.\n  That is not what we are doing. We are adding money over and above \ndiscretionary. So there is no cut in any discretionary funding. So what \nthe Senator from New Hampshire says is just not so.\n  I responded earlier to a question from Senator Jeffords that on the \ndiscretionary side we have never cut funding for IDEA, and we are not \ngoing to do so in the future.\n  Now, the Gregg amendment before us simply authorizes more money. But \nwe have been doing that for 30 years--30 years--and we are still only \nat 19 percent of the 40 percent we had promised. The Gregg amendment \ndoes not change one thing. It does not change a thing--nothing. Kids, \nfamilies, and schools will still be sold short.\n  Now, if anyone wants to know what authorizations mean around here, I \nwould just use a statement from the Senator from New Hampshire that he \nmade last September on a Byrd amendment. The Senator from New Hampshire \nhimself said:\n\n       Now, let's go to another issue, this concept that the \n     authorized level has to be funded. This is a very unusual \n     concept for Congress because for all intents and purposes \n     Congress does not fund anything to the authorized level.\n\n  The Senator then went on to say: Authorizations simply are statements \nof intent, purpose, and good will.\n  Well, that is exactly what the Gregg amendment is. It is a statement \nof intent and good will, but it does not do anything. The Senator from \nNew Hampshire himself said we do not fund to authorized levels. And \nthat is all he has done, just raised the authorized level. It does not \ndo one thing. If we want to meet our obligations and fulfill our \npromise, we have to adopt the Hagel and Harkin amendment to provide for \nmandatory funding.\n  Mr. President, let's get off all this talking about money and stuff \nand shifting it around. Listen to what Julie Reynolds said. She runs \nthe Parent Training and Information Center in Iowa. She said to me that \nfamilies and kids with disabilities are unfairly blamed for the \nshortfalls in schools. Parents are told not to ask for what the child \nneeds because it costs too much. Parents are told their children with \ndisabilities take away resources from other kids.\n  Families with kids with disabilities are not to blame. If there is \nanyone to blame, it is us in Congress for shirking our responsibilities \nfor 30 years and not meeting that 40-percent level.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will step to the plate. I repeat, 2 years \nago, this Senate unanimously--unanimously--adopted the same amendment \nthat the Senator from Nebraska and I are offering today to provide for \nfull mandatory funding up to that 40-percent level. Unanimously we \nadopted it. It was cut out in conference, and we were told we should \ncome back when IDEA is reauthorized. Well, reauthorization is here. I \nhope the Senate will speak again with that same forceful voice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the time I may have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto yield myself time from the majority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gregg amendment \nand in opposition to the Hagel-Harkin amendment.\n  I begin by commending the leadership of my State's senior Senator, \nMr. Judd Gregg, on this issue. IDEA and special education funding is an \nissue that has been a hallmark of the leadership provided by Senator \nGregg in New Hampshire and across the country.\n  In New Hampshire we still fund education locally. That is one of the \nreasons we have had historically such a strong school system. That \nmeans people really understand the shortfalls, the problems associated \nwith education funding.\n  In New Hampshire people have recognized we have not done our job as a \nCongress and as a nation in funding the original commitment made well \nover 20 years ago to support IDEA and special education.\n  Since 1996, we have made enormous steps forward, again, under the \nleadership of Senator Gregg, Senator Jeffords, and others in this body, \nCongressman Charles Bass in the House, working on the Budget Committee, \nwhere I was privileged to serve as well. We have increased funding $8.7 \nbillion for IDEA since 1996, increased funding $4.7 billion since 2001. \nThat is the kind of leadership on meeting a funding obligation that had \nnot been seen in this Congress in 20 years under Democratic support. I \nthink that, to use a phrase, is putting our collective money where our \nmouth is, recognizing that IDEA funding needs to be a priority for \nAmerican education.\n  The President's leadership on this issue has been outstanding. Those \non the other side of the aisle might not like to admit this, but it is \nhard to argue with the budgets that President Bush has sent up where \nIDEA funding is concerned. There have been historic increases year \nafter year since President Bush took office, increases in commitments \nin funding for special education that put the prior administration's \nbudget requests to shame. That needs to be recognized as well as part \nof the debate.\n  We have a lot more work to do. Senator Gregg has outlined the need to \ncontinue these funding increases and, in the 2005 budget, that \ncommitment is there, continuing the fight to meet our funding \nobligations. But putting the spending on autopilot, creating a new area \nof mandatory funding is not the solution.\n  Even more to the point, to the Harkin amendment, this new idea where \nonly the increases are mandatory is effectively a shell game, where \ncurrent funding is left as discretionary, only the increases are \nmandatory. Under our current budget resolution and the 2005 budget \nresolution, these mandatory funding increases would require a dollar-\nfor-dollar cut in other discretionary programs, of course, that are not \nspecified in this legislation. That is simply wrong.\n  Placing funding on autopilot rarely, if ever, is the answer to the \nproblems that we wrestle with in Congress. Even more problematic, this \namendment falls short on oversight. Throwing the funding on autopilot \nremoves Congress from its oversight responsibility. Most everyone who \nhas followed the debate on this program recognizes that more needs to \nbe done to make sure the program works better for those parents and \nchildren who are truly in need of the program's benefits.\n  Second, the Harkin amendment enables Congress to avoid setting \npriorities. That is simply wrong. It enables Congress to put the \nfunding on autopilot, this mandatory spending idea, and then not have \nto make sometimes very tough but important choices around funding \npriorities. I ask my colleagues on the other side whether they have \never voted for amendments that actually reallocate appropriations from \nother programs in the Department of Education or anywhere else in the \nLabor-Education bill and put it into additional discretionary special \neducation funding, much less offered such an amendment? It is not \nalways an easy vote to take, but it is a vote that I have taken in the \nHouse to actually stand up and say: Given a current level of spending, \nwhatever our budget is, I am willing to vote to take funding from one \nprogram and put it into special education because we recognize that it \nis the most important funding priority we could have at the Federal \nlevel where education is concerned. I am willing to stand up and take \nthat vote.\n  I am anxious to see whether the authors of this amendment bring other \namendments to the Senate floor in the appropriations process that \nreallocate those funds. It is always easy to come to the Senate floor \nwith an amendment that adds $2 billion or $3 billion or $4 billion or \n$5 billion, increasing the deficit without regard. It is a lot tougher \nto come to the floor with an amendment that moves funding from one area \nto another and show that we are willing to set priorities and make \nsometimes difficult choices we are elected to make when we come to \nserve in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\n  I believe putting this spending on autopilot takes us away from that \ncommitment to make tough choices and set priorities. That is why I will \nnot support the Hagel-Harkin amendment and will stand with Senator \nGregg and the important work he is trying to do as chairman of our \nEducation and Health Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 10 minutes \n30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 \\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I join with my friend and colleague, Senator Harkin, in making sure \nthat this body understands, and our friends all across the country, \nthat this really isn't a partisan issue. I, quite frankly, commend the \nfact that we had an increase in IDEA funding, and I give tribute to the \nSenator from New Hampshire for that increase in funding. It is true \nthat under President Clinton we had the expansion, moving toward \nsmaller class size, afterschool programs. We had enhancement of teacher \ntraining and other kinds of factors in terms of the previous \nadministration. But there is no question that there has been an \nincrease in IDEA funding. We grant that.\n  As Senator Harkin has pointed out, the issue is what are we going to \ndo in the future. This discussion is really at a rather significant \ntime in our American history because next Monday we celebrate the 50th \nanniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, one of the most important \njudgments in terms of knocking down walls of discrimination in our \ncountry, recognizing that we were going to knock down the walls of \ndiscrimination on the basis of race.\n  Now for 29 years we knock down the walls of discrimination on special \nneeds children, but we still have not fulfilled the requirement and the \nopportunity that presents. That is what the Harkin amendment is all \nabout.\n  Pass the Harkin amendment and we meet that responsibility, and we \nmeet that obligation in 6 years. That is what we do.\n  I am going to vote for the Gregg amendment that says he will increase \nthe authorization. I am for it. If that is what passes, I will be there \nwith Senator Harkin and with Senator Hagel battling to get the \nincreased appropriations, but let's do it right. Why have we held these \nfamilies up?\n  I have four books here, a foot and a half tall, with individual life \nstories that represent families and special needs children who are \ntrying to make it in the United States. The question is, are we going \nto meet our responsibility? We have from newspaper reports now that we \nare going to have a bonus of $100 billion this June, $100 billion more. \nThe Harkin amendment says, let's take $2.2 billion of that and commit \nit to these families right here who are struggling and trying to make \nit every single day.\n  Let me read from a typical letter, and it is replicated by the \nthousands. This is from Carla Leone of Arlington, MS:\n\n       I have a 15-year-old son with Tourette Syndrome and \n     associated disorders who is on an IEP,\n\n--an individual education program--\n\n     as well as a daughter in ``regular'' education. I had to quit \n     my job in order to obtain special education services from the \n     school district for my son--it was a full-time, complex job. \n     First, the school didn't want to identify him as needing an \n     IEP, then there was a several-year battle over what services \n     he needed, and then once they agreed to services, there were \n     a lot of problems with the school failing to provide the \n     services (a common problem with implementation of IEPs).\n       The basis for the problem is lack of funding, which pits \n     regular education against special education, and gives the \n     school major impetus from keeping the kids from being \n     identified as needing special education . . . and most \n     importantly fund this heretofore unfunded mandate.\n\n  That could not be any more clear or compelling. We ought to not only \nthink of the children but of their mothers and fathers. That is what \nthis is about. Certainly, this is a question of priority. We in this \ncountry cannot afford to not meet what we committed. This body \ncommitted to this. The House of Representatives committed to it. A \nprevious administration committed to help those families all over the \ncountry. We are only reaching half of that commitment now.\n  The Harkin amendment will make sure we meet our responsibilities to \nall of them. What could be a better opportunity, a better priority? \nMoney isn't everything, Mr. President, but it is an indication of a \nnation's priorities. That is what we have the opportunity to have in \nthe Senate. That is why I believe the Harkin amendment should be \napproved.\n  I withhold the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Virginia 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Pictures of the Prisoner Abuse in Iraq\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to address my colleagues with \nregard to the pictures of prisoner abuse in Iraq which will be sent up \nby the Department of Defense and will be available for all Members to \nreview in room S-407 in 45 minutes.\n  Bottom line, I urge all Senators to avail themselves of the \nopportunity to examine this body of evidence. While I have not seen it \nspecifically, it has been described to me. It is, in my judgment, \nanother distasteful, nevertheless factual, part of this tragic incident \nregarding the allegations and the facts that document abuse by \nuniformed people of the U.S. Armed Forces against Iraqi prisoners. At 2 \np.m., I urge your attendance.\n  I thank the leadership for their assistance in this matter. \nYesterday, I contacted Senator Frist and suggested that he and I and \nSenator Daschle and Senator Levin sit down and make the arrangements \nregarding these photos, and those arrangements were concluded late \nyesterday. The pictures will be brought up. They will remain in the \ncustody at all times of the Department of Defense, and then they will \nbe returned to the Department at the conclusion of our meeting.\n  Speaking just for myself, my guidelines as I look at these pictures \nare how I am obligated to address my constituents and indeed share my \nviews with colleagues. These are the guideposts I will follow. First, \nat the hearing of the Armed Services--the first hearing on May 7--with \nSecretary Rumsfeld and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, as chairman, I \nwas privileged to ask the first question. This is my question to \nGeneral Myers:\n\n       I would anticipate that you have consulted with your \n     colleagues, not only the Joint Chiefs, but particularly in \n     Central Command, and you are making, or have made, or will \n     continue to make an assessment of the possible increase in \n     risk to the men and women of the Armed Forces, the personal \n     increase in risk to them, and indeed their colleagues in the \n     coalition forces, regarding the release of these photos, and \n     this story continues to reflect very deeply on the thinking \n     and actions of other people.\n\n  We learned yesterday of the tragic event of the Berg family having \nlost that individual. You not only have to consider men and women in \nuniform, but that brave bunch of contractors who are taking a certain \namount of risk to help rebuild the infrastructure in Iraq and to assist \nthe men and women in the Armed Forces in carrying out their missions.\n  General Myers replied very clearly:\n\n       Absolutely, we will. And we should not underestimate that \n     impact.\n\n  Further, he said:\n\n       I think we have a lot of troops in Iraq right now, after \n     talking to General Smith and others, that are probably \n     walking with--I mean, they're involved in combat, but they're \n     walking with their head just a bit lower right now because \n     they have to bear the brunt of what their colleagues up in \n     Abu Ghraib did.\n\n  That is straight talk. We have had good, straight talk from the \nSecretary of Defense and all the witnesses in the course of our \nhearings. I commend the Department of Defense, from the President on \ndown, for the manner in which they are dealing with this situation. \nThat is my principal statement.\n  Second, we are a nation which operates on the rule of law. The \nDepartment of the Army and the Department of Defense are bringing \naccountability to those who allegedly have perpetrated these \nsituations. That trial process must go forward in such a way that the \nrelease of these photos does not adversely impact or jeopardize their \nrights. It is for that reason that I\n\n[[Page S5342]]\n\nsimply say to my colleagues that I think we have to be extremely \ncautious as we finish our work this afternoon, and then fulfill our \nobligation, in verbalizing--the pictures cannot be copied--our own \ninterpretations and meaning of these photos, so as not to incite anger, \nin any way further, against our forces or others working in the cause \nof freedom. That is my view.\n  Further, I think caution should be used so as not to jeopardize under \nthe Uniform Code of Military Justice and such other laws--and others \nmay be brought to bear in accountability--in any way to jeopardize \nthose trials. This Nation is a nation of laws. We are a strong \ndemocracy.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld, in his opening remarks, said:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I know you join me today in saying to the \n     world, judge us by our actions, watch how Americans, watch \n     how a democracy deals with wrongdoing and with scandal and \n     the pain of acknowledging and correcting our mistakes and our \n     own weaknesses. And then, after they have seen America in \n     action, then ask those who teach resentment and hatred of \n     America if our behavior doesn't give lie to the falsehood and \n     the slander they speak about our people and about our way of \n     life . . . Ask them if the willingness of Americans to \n     acknowledge their own failures before humanity doesn't light \n     the world as surely as the great ideas and beliefs that made \n     this nation a beacon of hope and liberty for all who strive \n     to be free.\n\n  The strength of America will be brought to bear as we address these \nproblems in our military and go about handling this situation under the \nrule of law and holding those accountable. That shows the strength of a \ndemocracy. I think that is very important.\n  There is a Privacy Act which, in the minds of some lawyers, protects \nthese pictures in a certain way from public disclosure.\n  So I simply counsel Senators--to the extent the executive branch has \na responsibility to deal with future distribution of these pictures--to \nerr on the side of caution. I think it would not be wise at this time \nto publish them. I believe the time to publish such photos should be \nduring the course of the trials when the prosecution has a right to \nbring out certain photographs, the defense has a right to go and bring \nout other photographs, so you will have a balance of interests as to \nthe photographs that are made public. Those trials will be public. At \nthat time, no one could accuse the United States, for whatever reason, \nhaving released these photos earlier, of either jeopardizing the trial \nor trying to influence public opinion. Those procedures would be in \naccordance with the procedures of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n  Sadness, I know, fills the heart of all Americans regarding this \nepisode in the otherwise very proud history of our military. Going back \nmore than 200 years in our Republic, and looking forward, today 99.99 \npercent of the men and women in uniform are carrying out their missions \nin accordance with our finest traditions. They are going into harm's \nway, taking risks, and performing their missions. We must think of \nthem. That is very much on my mind, and I hope it is in the minds of \nothers as we look at this.\n  The Berg case has a specific reference to that heinous crime being \ncommitted to avenge the treatment of the prisoners in that prison. That \nis why I think further release at this time of these photographs, \nindeed, would put on another layer, but basically I don't think it will \ncontribute materially to a further understanding of this tragic \nproblem, to the extent that it overrides the other concerns of the \nsafety of our forces, the safety of the civilian backup infrastructure, \nand the need for these trials to go forward in such a manner that no \none can contest the integrity of the Department of Defense and the Army \nas they proceed to address this and hold those responsible accountable.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that the release of this material, which is \nnot before the Senate--I repeat, we do not have custody of the photos--\nbe considered by the executive branch--and perhaps wiser minds than I \nhave a different perspective, but in the end, I counsel all caution as \nwe verbalize our own views and understanding of these pictures, and as \nthe executive branch moves forward with a decision regarding release.\n  I yield the floor.\n   Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Harkin-\nHagel Amendment which will meet the funding promises in the Individuals \nwith Disabilities in Education Act, IDEA.\n   Almost three decades ago when Congress passed IDEA, this legislative \nbody understood the additional costs that would be associated with \nproviding an appropriate education to children with disabilities. \nCongress agreed back then that this fiscal responsibility should not \nfall entirely on the States and local communities. It decided the \nFederal Government would pick up at least 40 percent of the total cost \nof educating these children.\n   This promise was made nearly 30 years ago. Yet Congress has never \nfulfilled it. The Harkin-Hagel amendment, which has strong bipartisan \nsupport, will right this wrong by ensuring the Federal Government \nprovides its fair share of the cost to educate all children with \ndisabilities. That is why I am proud to cosponsor it.\n   The funds provided by this amendment will ensure that every child \nwith special needs receives a free, appropriate public education. \nToday, all over New York and the Nation, children with special needs \nare being shortchanged because schools are wrestling to fulfill the \ncompeting demands on their budgets. Deficits are rising and State \nbudgets are shrinking. And the funds provided by these amendments are \ncrucial to ensuring all children receive a world-class education.\n   The Republican substitute for this amendment keeps funding for IDEA \ndiscretionary, which does not guarantee full funding. As we have seen \nwith funding for No Child Left Behind, authorizations are an empty \npromise with this administration and the Republicans in Congress in \ncontrol.\n   According to a report issued by the National Education Association \nlast month, States and schools received only $18.6 billion of the $26.8 \nbillion in Federal money authorized under the law during the last \nfiscal year. This amount falls significantly short of the total cost to \nimplement No Child Left Behind, which, according to the NEA, will reach \n$41.8 billion this year. As one example of the high cost of NCLB, the \nOhio Department of Education released a study last month estimating \nthat the State will spend about $1.5 billion a year--more than twice as \nmuch as it now gets from the Federal Government to fund NCLB. And a \nrecent Phi Delta Kappan article reported that public K-12 spending \nneeds to rise by at least 20 to 35 percent to meet the goals of NCLB--\nan increase of $85 to $150 billion a year.\n   We cannot allow IDEA to continue on the same path as NCLB. Mandatory \nspending is the only way to ensure that Congress will actually fund the \nreal costs associated with meeting these requirements so that our \nchildren and their families do not shoulder this burden.\n\n  Now more than ever, our school districts desperately need this \nsupport as they grapple with deep budget cuts and rising student \nenrollments. It is unconscionable for Congress to stand by and continue \nto fail to meet its funding commitments while schools in New York and \nacross the Nation are laying off teachers, cutting critical classes and \neliminating academic services.\n  Let me paint the picture of what is happening in school districts in \nsome school districts in New York.\n  The Buffalo School district, where 80 percent of students come from \nfamilies that are at or below the poverty index, is facing a $9.7 \nmillion cut in its education budget. To balance its budget, the Buffalo \nSchool District has had to lay off approximately 700 school personnel, \ncut vital services to students, and close down 5 schools this year. \nThese choices will ultimately lower the quality of education for all of \nthe 44,000 students enrolled in Buffalo schools, including the 9,266 \nstudents with disabilities.\n  However, this issue is not about budget cuts. It is about broken \npromises.\n  The Harkin-Hagel amendment says simply--the Federal Government's \ngoing to keep its word. It ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive the programs and services they need to learn by providing the \n40 percent of the cost that was promised back in 1973.\n  These funds mean children with special needs will achieve at higher \nlevels and transition into the workforce as productive citizens. It \nguarantees the resources to recruit qualified personnel, provide \nteacher training and\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\nongoing professional development and provide supplementary services to \neffectively educate these children. Schools need actual resources to \nprovide these services, not empty promises.\n  Before the passage of IDEA, children with disabilities received \nwoefully inadequate schooling or no schooling at all. Each year \nCongress fails to live up to its commitment to adequately invest in \nIDEA our schools fall further behind in meeting their special education \ncosts and our parents of children with disabilities have to fight \nharder to ensure their children receive appropriate educational \nservices.\n  Children with special needs and their families should not have to \nshoulder this burden. We must do better by our children and their \nparents. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote yes on the Harkin-Hagel \namendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nHarkin-Hagel amendment to fully fund the Federal share of the \nindividuals with Disabilities Education Act. This proposal is long \noverdue and will help every school district in Maine.\n  IDEA is based on two fundamental principles: First, that all disabled \nchildren are entitled to a free and appropriate public education; and, \nsecond, to the maximum extent possible, these children should be \neducated alongside their nondisabled peers.\n  To help States achieve these principles, in 1975 Congress authorized \nfunding at 40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure. \nUnfortunately, this funding level has never been realized, leaving \nStates with insufficient resources and jeopardizing the achievement of \nIDEA's worthy goals.\n  In 1996, the year I was first elected to the Senate, the Federal \nGovernment provided only $2.3 billion for IDEA funding, about 7 percent \nof the promised level. Through our efforts in the Senate, IDEA funding \nhas steadily climbed, reaching nearly $10.1 billion in fiscal year \n2004, an increase of more than 300 percent. Despite this considerable \nprogress, current IDEA funding still represents only half of the \noriginal 40 percent promised by Congress. This is an unfunded mandate \nthat affects every State in the Nation.\n  Over the years, this shortfall in IDEA funding has placed a \ntremendous financial strain on communities in providing these services, \nand in particular, on small rural towns, such as those in Maine. \nAccording to recent CRS estimates, if IDEA were fully funded, Maine \nwould receive approximately $104 million in part B funding, an increase \nof approximately $56 million over current levels.\n  While the shortfalls affecting Maine and other States are startling, \nthey fail to convey the crushing financial blow which can result to a \nsmall community when a medically fragile, high-cost child with special \nneeds locates there.\n  In these cases, school systems are often forced to cut back in \nservices to all children in an attempt to meet their legal obligations. \nUnfortunately, this can result in resentment of these special needs \nchildren by members of their own community.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have consistently supported efforts \nto fully fund IDEA. In 2001, during Senate consideration of No Child \nLeft Behind, I was pleased to join Senators Hagel and Harkin in \nsponsoring another amendment to fully fund IDEA. Although the amendment \npassed the Senate, unfortunately, it was removed during conference with \nthe House.\n  After over 2 years of work, we now have before us a bill to \nreauthorize IDEA. S. 1248 has strong bipartisan support and reflects a \nbipartisan commitment to make the improvements necessary to ensure \nbetter educational services for disabled students.\n  For example, it contains modifications designed to improve parental \ninvolvement, to resolve conflicts more effectively and without \nlitigation, and to reduce unnecessary paperwork. With these reforms in \nplace, it is time for Congress to step up and meet its funding \nobligations under IDEA.\n  Our amendment would provide crucial resources necessary to support \ncommunities and special education students throughout the country. \nSpecifically, it would provide mandatory funding increases of $2.2 \nbillion each year for the next 6 years to reach full funding by 2010, \nand then maintain full funding in subsequent years.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this amendment. Let's \nmake this the year where we finally make good on the promise to fully \nfund IDEA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the other side has 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I presume the Senator from Iowa wants to \nclose.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I have no problem with that.\n  We have talked a lot about, and I think debated rather extensively, \nthe issue of what the proper way to fund this bill is. Again, I think \nour track record on funding is strong and reflects a very deep and \naggressive commitment to getting the money that is necessary to address \nspecial needs children.\n  While we are discussing this bill and there is some attention on the \nbill, I did want to, however, mention--and I know we are going to \ndiscuss it later on--this commitment in this bill. There are a couple \nof items which are very important. The first is the commitment to go to \nbasically an accountability system which looks at what a student learns \nversus what the procedure may have been to teach them. Rather than \nchecking inputs, we are interested in outputs. We are interested in \nwhether a special needs child is actually improving their academic \nability.\n  This bill changes the focus of how we view the plans that are \ndeveloped for children. It eliminates the very burdensome and \nunreasonable 813 procedural checklist that States have to follow in \norder to be deemed in compliance with IDEA. This type of checklist, in \nour opinion, was excessive bureaucracy and counterproductive to the \nbasic goal, which is to get a child in the classroom and teach them to \nthe fullness of their capabilities. So I think it makes significant \nprogress in that area.\n  It also addresses a number of other issues, but specifically the \noveridentification of children into special needs. This is a real \nproblem, excessive coding of children. It is especially a problem in \nminority communities where quite often children simply get coded \nbecause they do not have the skills when they get to school to be \ncompetitive with their peers and make a presentation on an IQ test \nwhich is adequate. This bill takes the IQ test and deemphasizes it as a \nway for coding these children and rather allows a variety of different \nproposals which came out of an extensive study in this area, the \nCommission on Excellence in Special Education, to be used for the \npurposes of deciding whether a child should be moved into the special \neducation classification.\n  It is critical that we get control over this coding area because in \nsome school systems upwards of 30 percent of the kids are being coded, \nand this is clearly inappropriate. It means the resources which should \nbe focused on the children who really need assistance are being spread \nto a lot of kids who maybe are being coded because it is the easiest \nway to handle them and to move them through the system, not necessarily \nfor their benefit but for the benefit of the administration of the \nschool system. So we have tried to address that issue.\n  I happen to see that specific issue of overcoding as probably being \nthe biggest problem we have in the whole structure of special education \nbecause not only does it mean that resources are spread too thin, but \nequally important, it means kids end up being stigmatized unfortunately \nearly on with a special education status which affects their \neducational experience for the rest of their schooling, and that is not \ngood for them if they did not need that sort of assistance.\n\n  Thirdly, it basically continues to move the goalpost. It is virtually \nimpossible for us to get the full funding if every time we start to \nmove toward full funding the goalposts of what full funding means get \nmoved down the field further. That is what happens when there is this \nexcessive coding.\n  So it has a debilitating effect not only relative to the child's \nexperience\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\nbut also on the ability of the school system to get the funds where \nthey need to be and also on the basis of how we are going to get enough \nfunds into the school systems to meet our commitments. So this is a big \nissue. I think it is one that we have tried to address. We obviously \nhave not solved the problem, but we have at least moved down the road \ntoward addressing the issue in a constructive and bipartisan way in \nthis bill.\n  So with those two points being made, I will reserve the remainder of \nmy time and turn to the Senator from Iowa to close. If the Senator from \nIowa is the last speaker, we will simply run the clock until we get to \nthe time for the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank Senator Gregg for his generosity in letting me \nclose the debate. I also thank the Senator from New Hampshire and the \nSenator from Massachusetts for putting together a good bill. This is a \ngood bill, except for the funding. There is a lot of good in this bill, \nand the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Massachusetts \nhave worked together, as we all have, to come together with a \nnonpartisan approach.\n  As I have said, this is the way we ought to deal with disability \nissues. We have in our long history, and we have continued that again \nin this bill, too.\n  When this Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act 14 \nyears ago, we stated four goals. For people with disabilities we wanted \nequal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic \nself-sufficiency. Those were basically the same goals of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. We now see people working \nmore in our society, people with disabilities being employed on jobs, \nbut the basis of it all is education. That is where it starts.\n  If families with kids with disabilities are not getting the \nsupportive services and the kind of teacher training that is needed to \nbe able to teach kids with disabilities, if they do not have the \nmaterials, say, in Braille for kids who are blind, or interpreters for \nkids who are deaf, or if they do not have some mental health providers \nwho can help kids who have perhaps mental problems in school, then all \nof the promises of the Americans with Disabilities Act is for naught \nbecause these kids will not get the education they need that will give \nthem equal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n\n  The occupant of the Chair, my colleague and cosponsor of this \namendment, Senator Hagel, stated in his comments earlier about this \nbeing an unfunded mandate. This is one of the largest unfunded mandates \nthat we have in our country. We hear about it all the time from the \nschools, from the parents, from the school boards. We have mandated \nthat they must provide these services and then we said we are going to \nprovide up to 40 percent. That was 30 years ago, and we are only at 19 \npercent.\n  So we have to ask ourselves about our priorities. This is an unfunded \nmandate. We made a promise; we have not kept the promise. Some say but \nthe Harkin-Hagel amendment will add to the deficit. Well, it will add \n$2 billion on a budget next year of $2.3 trillion--less than one-tenth \nof 1 percent. When one looks at the whole national debt of $8 trillion, \nwe are talking about a minuscule amount. For that minuscule amount, it \nmeans kids will get the services they need.\n  It means we will have more Danny Pfiffers, the young man I knew in \nIowa who went to school, who was mainstreamed, the manager of his \nfootball team, acted in a school play. Danny suffered from Downs \nSyndrome. He got out of school. He got a job. He lived by himself. He \nwas a taxpayer. This is what we want. It saves our society countless \ndollars in the long run, but even more important than that it enriches \nDanny Pfiffer's life, and it will enrich more kids' lives.\n  We have waited too long to make good on our promise. Now is the time \nto do it. It has to do with priorities. It has to do with integration. \nIt has to do with all of us living together, sharing and caring about \none another. We are all better off as a society when kids with \ndisabilities are educated and mainstreamed in our public schools.\n  Lastly, the Gregg amendment will be the first vote. I do not see \nanything wrong with the Gregg amendment. It is authorization as a \nstatement of intent, purpose, and goodwill. To quote my friend from New \nHampshire who used the words to describe authorization last year, there \nis nothing wrong with it.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is authorizing more money. That is \nfine, but it does not add one nickel to this unfunded mandate.\n  So the Gregg amendment is fine as a statement of purpose and good \nwill and intention, but statements of purpose and intention and good \nwill do not get the funds out to meet our obligation.\n  We said 30 years ago we would provide up to 40 percent. We are at 19 \npercent. This is the vote that will say to the families of kids with \ndisabilities, we are going to meet our commitments and fund this \nunfunded mandate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that we now proceed to a vote. I \nask for the yeas and nays, and we will yield back the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nPryor as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There is a sufficient second.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Could we ask consent that be for both of the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection pertaining to the yeas and \nnays on both?\n  Mr. GREGG. I intend to make a point of order on the second amendment. \nThat will not be of prejudice to us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will not be prejudicial. Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 3145. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on the Harkin amendment, on \nwhich the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we just voted--I did, and so many of us--\nto say\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\nwe want to get more money into special education. That is what the \nGregg amendment says, that we want to increase authorizations.\n  Right now, under present law, we can do whatever we want because it \nauthorizes such sums as necessary. The Senator from New Hampshire put \nin there specific amounts, but it does not add one nickel to special \neducation.\n  The next amendment, the Hagel and Harkin amendment, does that. It \nadds real money in mandatory spending, $2.2 billion a year for 6 years \nto get to that 40-percent level we promised 30 years ago.\n  This is one of the biggest unfunded mandates we have in our country. \nIt is time that Congress lives up to the promise we made 30 years ago \nto help fund special education.\n  I ask for an aye vote on the Harkin-Hagel amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this Congress and this President have an \nexceptional track record on increasing funding for special education--\nover $1 billion a year, on a cumulative basis.\n  The issue of how you fund special education is a priority, and we \nhave shown a commitment to that priority. It should be done within the \ncontext of setting priorities. Putting it into a mandatory account \nwould take it out of the ability of this Congress to have the priority-\nsetting process which is appropriate.\n  Furthermore, the way this amendment is structured, it might actually \nend up leading to a cut in discretionary funding in the special \neducation accounts because of the uniqueness of our budget rules.\n  But, in any event, I make a point of order against the amendment. The \npending amendment No. 3144, offered by the Senator from Iowa, increases \ndirect spending in excess of the allocation to the HELP Committee under \nthe most recently adopted budget resolution, H. Con. Res. 91, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2004. Therefore, I \nraise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) \nof the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A point of order is made.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant portions of \nthe Budget Act to permit the consideration of my amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSantorum) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Department of Education to participate in the \n   long-term child development study authorized under the Children's \n                          Health Act of 2000)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 501. AMENDMENT TO CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000.\n\n       Section 1004 of the Children's Health Act of 2000 (42 \n     U.S.C. 285g note) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``Agency'' and inserting \n     ``Agency, and the Department of Education''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) be conducted in compliance with section 444 of the \n     General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232g), including \n     the requirement of prior parental consent for the disclosure \n     of any education records, except without the use of authority \n     or exceptions granted to authorized representatives of the \n     Secretary of Education for the evaluation of Federally-\n     supported education programs or in connection with the \n     enforcement of the Federal legal requirements that relate to \n     such programs.''.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise in support of my amendment to the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act that is being considered \ntoday. Before I get into the amendment, I thank the chairman and the \nranking member of the committee, Senators Gregg and Kennedy, for all \ntheir hard work in bringing this bill to the floor. It has been a long \nand, at times, I know a tedious process.\n  The issues inherent in this bill are complicated, and I respect the \nstrong effort of both Senators Gregg and Kennedy to work together in a \nbipartisan fashion to move the process forward. I also thank their two \nkey staff members, Connie Garner for Senator Kennedy and Annie White \nfor Senator Gregg, because they have worked extraordinarily hard and \ndiligently to ensure that this legislation, which affects millions of \nchildren with disabilities, will be reauthorized and will improve the \nlives of so many of these children and their families.\n  I also thank Senators Gregg and Kennedy for being supportive of this \namendment.\n  My amendment is very simple and straightforward but I think very \nimportant. It proposes to make the Department of Education a key \npartner in the development and execution of the National Children's \nStudy.\n  The National Children's Study will be the most important study of \nchildren with disabilities ever undertaken. It will provide a \ncomprehensive examination of the effects of environmental influences, \nas well as many other factors affecting growth and development, from \nbirth until age 21. The overarching goal of this study is to give us \ninformation to enable us to improve the health and well-being of our \nchildren and, in particular, what more can be done to prevent, treat, \nameliorate, and cure disabilities.\n  The National Children's Study was authorized by the Children's Health \nAct of 2000. All of the key Federal departments with jurisdiction over \nchildren's health and welfare, including\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\nthe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, and the Environmental Protection \nAgency, are sponsors and partners in the completion of this critical \nstudy.\n  It is absolutely essential that these agencies work together, but \nmissing from the list is the Department of Education. Despite the fact \nthat children in our country spend 6 to 8 hours or more in school, the \nDepartment of Education is not one of the agencies explicitly included \nas a participant in the national children's study.\n  I believe this study has the potential to provide significant value, \nbut it will be missing a critical source of information if the \nDepartment of Education is not a full partner.\n  Two studies that I would remind my colleagues of, that are similar to \nwhat we are attempting to do with this national children's study, is \nthe Framingham study that followed a number of people in Framingham, \nMA, for a very long period of time. From that, we learned all kinds of \ninformation about heart attacks, cancers, and other factors that affect \nour health. Similarly the nurses study which followed several thousand \nnurses gave us other useful information.\n  So now we are trying to provide this information, based on very well \nrun studies, to not only parents but practitioners, public officials, \nand others.\n  The participation of the Department of Education will ensure that \nschool records can be, with appropriate permission, incorporated into \nthe findings. Why is that important? Because only schools have \ninformation about children's educational outcomes, about special \neducation classifications and the special services that children are \nreceiving. Without this critical piece of information, the study would \nbe incomplete.\n  The Department also needs to be a key player in order to get in on \nthe ground floor of the planning for this study. We need to make sure \nthat the educational component is considered from the very beginning.\n  It is also possible, through this amendment and the inclusion of the \nDepartment of Education, to compare how different States and schools \nclassify children with disabilities. Currently, every State has a \ndifferent standard for how they classify children with disabilities. \nThat makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for researchers and \nadvocates to compare data on children with disabilities across State \nlines. It is also very frustrating for parents who may live in one \nState where their child is classified as special education and eligible \nfor services but because of a job change or other reason for a move, \nthey move to another State where that is no longer the case.\n  If the national children's study were to collect data directly from \nschools on children's disabilities and how they are classified, we \nwould have valuable information that I think would be very informative \nfor our States and local school districts, as well as parents and \nothers.\n  In addition to all of these reasons, the participation of the \nDepartment of Education will help us better understand how \nenvironmental factors are associated with the development of \ndisabilities in childhood.\n  Every single day children are exposed to environmental hazards. They \nare exposed in their homes, neighborhoods, communities, and even in \ntheir schools. It is important that we begin to understand how to \nfigure out what it is that we need to prevent in order to deal with the \nincreasing numbers of children classified as in need of special \neducation.\n  I want to thank a number of groups that have supported this \namendment, including the Council for Exceptional Children, and Easter \nSeals, the National Education Association, the Parents Support Network \nof New York, the Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/\nHyperactivity Disorder, National Arc, the Council for Occupational \nTherapists, the Learning Disabilities Association of America, and the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities, which is a national \ndisability organization that is a coalition of 100 groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters of support on behalf of this \namendment be printed in the Record.\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The American Occupational\n\n\n                                    Therapy Association, Inc.,\n\n                                     Bethesda, MD, April 22, 2004.\n      Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n      U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n        Dear Senator Clinton: the American Occupational Therapy \n     Association (AOTA) is writing in support of your amendment to \n     S. 1248 that would expand the federal agency participants in \n     the National Children's Study. Authorized by the Children's \n     Health Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-310), this longitudinal study \n     will investigate the effects of environmental influences on \n     the health and development of children. Your amendment would \n     add the U.S. Department of Education as a participating \n     agency in the study.\n        AOTA agrees that there is a need for a long term \n     comprehensive examination of children's health, development \n     and well-being. Occupational therapists have long recognized \n     the influence of the environmental context on children's \n     ability to participate in everyday activities, or \n     occupations, at school, at home and in the community. In \n     fact, this is one of the hallmarks of occupational therapy.\n        AOTA believes with you that the study should include \n     relevant data about children's learning and educational \n     experiences and how that learning is affected by \n     environmental factors. Without including education and \n     educational outcomes in the comprehensive study, children's \n     ``development'' cannot be fully and completely assessed. The \n     addition of the Department of Education and its various areas \n     of expertise will enable the study to develop a more accurate \n     view of the child and provide for the inclusion of valuable \n     school-based data that is already available from our Nation's \n     schools.\n       Thank you for introducing this important modification to \n     the National Children's Study. Please do not hesitate to let \n     us know if we can provide any additional assistance.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                Christina Metzler,\n      Director, Federal Affairs Department.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Council for Exceptional Children,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 11, 2004.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Room 476, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: The Council for Exceptional Children \n     (CEC) is the largest professional organization of teachers, \n     administrators, parents, and others concerned with the \n     education of children with disabilities, giftedness, or both. \n     CEC supports your amendment to S. 1248, the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act to include the Department of \n     Education as one of the participants in the National \n     Children's Study. As you know, the Children's Health Act of \n     2000 (Pub. L. 106-310) authorized the study of environmental \n     influences on the health and development of children.\n       The National Children's Study will provide the most \n     comprehensive examination to date of the effects of \n     environmental influences on the health and development of \n     children, from birth until age 21, across the United States. \n     The overarching goal of the study is to improve the health \n     and well-being of all children, although children with \n     disabilities will be a special focus of the investigation. \n     The National Children's Study will be one of, if not the, \n     richest resources for answering questions related to children \n     with disabilities' health and development and will form the \n     basis of child health guidance, interventions, and policy for \n     generations to come. Yet schools, where children spend more \n     time than any place other than their homes, are not \n     integrated into this investigation. It is important that the \n     Department of Education participate in this study. CEC \n     recommends that assurances be in place that provide for \n     sufficient resources for the Department of Education to \n     participate in the study.\n       Thank you for championing this important addition to the \n     National Children's Study.

Because IDEA impacts \n     elementary and secondary schools, completing work on it is \n     essential to ensure implementation in the next school year.\n       All schools that serve learning disabled and other children \n     with disabilities have a strong stake in the reauthorization \n     of IDEA and we are very pleased that we have worked with \n     Senators of both political parties to strengthen IDEA to \n     better meet the special education needs of children enrolled \n     by their parents in our schools. While issues of importance \n     to our communities still exist, we are most eager to have \n     Congress complete action\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\n     on this legislation so that it may be signed by the President \n     and its benefit to our communities implemented in the next \n     school year. Thus, we urge you to support S. 1248's final \n     passage as well as the appointment of conferees and the \n     immediate convening of a conference committee.\n       As you are aware, a unanimous consent agreement limiting \n     the number of amendments to be offered on S. 1248 has already \n     been entered into. We hope you will take this major step \n     toward better serving America's special needs children this \n     year. Many thanks for all of your work on behalf of America's \n     children, including children attending private and religious \n     schools.\n     Rev. William F.

Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Clinton: Children & Adults with Attention-\n     Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) is writing to support \n     your efforts to provide an amendment to the Individuals with \n     Diabetes Education Act (IDEA) that will expand the \n     participants in the National Children's Study. The Children's \n     Health Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 106-310) authorized the study of \n     environmental influences on the health and development of \n     children. The Amendment would add the U.S. Department of \n     Education as one of the participating organizations in the \n     study. CHADD supports this amendment.\n       CHADD is intimately involved in the area of the \n     relationship of children's health and their educational \n     outcomes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC) funded CHADD's National Resource Center on AD/HD that \n     was established to both be the national clearinghouse for \n     science-based information on AD/HD and encourage and \n     disseminate research on AD/HD's prevalence and treatment. The \n     linkage between health and learning is of paramount \n     importance to both this aspect of our mission and most other \n     aspects as well. A May 2002 CDC Study (CDC Vital and Health \n     Statistics) documented that over 50 percent of the children \n     with AD/HD had a co-occurring learning disability. Without \n     including education and educational outcomes in the \n     comprehensive study, children's ``development'' cannot be \n     fully assessed.\n       The outline of the National Children's Study represents a \n     very expansive view of ``environmental influences'' and these \n     must include these found within the school and related areas. \n     The inclusion of the Department of Education and its various \n     areas of expertise will enable the study to take a much more \n     complete view of the child and provide for the inclusion of \n     valuable school-based data that is already provided from the \n     Nations schools.\n       Thank you for introducing this import modification to the \n     National Children's Study.\n       Further information on this issue is available from Stephen \n     Spector, CHADD's Director of Public Policy who can be reached \n     at 301-306-7070, extension 109.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                           E. Clarke Ross, D.P.A.,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Over the last several years, I have become even more \nconcerned about how the environment affects a child's health and \ncognitive development. I think we have a lot of work to do to \nunderstand this and then to act on it. We know that 25 years of \nresearch and experience with developmental disabilities has \ndemonstrated the increasing threat that these disabilities pose to our \nchildren's learning and also to the costs and expenses borne by \nfamilies, school districts, and other public agencies around our \ncountry.\n  Since 1977, enrollment in special education programs for children \nwith learning disabilities has doubled, and 12 million children under \nthe age of 18 are now diagnosed with a developmental learning or \nbehavioral disability. Now, obviously some of that is due to our \ngreater understanding and our willingness to admit that these kinds of \ndisabilities exist, but there are other reasons as well.\n  A National Academy of Sciences study suggests that 28 percent of \ndevelopmental disabilities are caused by environmental hazards. A \nrecent study in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that even \nlow levels of lead exposure can reduce a child's IQ by as much as 7.4 \npoints. For many children, this literally could mean the difference \nbetween being developmentally disabled or not.\n  According to a General Accounting Office study, almost half of all \nchildren in our country attend schools with at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental condition. I have seen a lot of those in my own travels. \nI have seen horrible mold conditions. I have seen exposed dust and \nbuilding materials. I have seen schools that were built over toxic \nwaste dumps. It goes on and on.\n  We also know that one of the most prevalent environmental health \nproblems is poor indoor air quality. According to recent studies, that \nis present in nearly half of our 115,000 schools. Almost a quarter of \nthese schools have inadequate heating, ventilation, and air-\nconditioning systems, and about 21,000 have faulty roofs.\n  Now, poor indoor air quality severely aggravates allergies, asthma, \nand other infections and respiratory diseases. It is something we know \nmore and more about but actually still have a lot of work to do.\n  I have worked to address these problems through legislation that \ncrosses different jurisdictional lines. I introduced the act to prevent \ndevelopmental disabilities in education, which has evolved into the \namendment we have before us today. I have strongly supported the 12 \ncenters for children's environmental health and disease prevention \nresearch funded by our Government because they are focusing on issues \nthat are so critically important, such as studying the potential \nenvironmental causes of autism, a condition that we know is increasing.\n  We are looking at new ways of researching, identifying, treating, and \nultimately preventing autism and other diseases that may or may not \nhave an environmental link. We just do not know enough yet.\n  Similarly, I have proposed a general health tracking bill that would \ncoordinate pollution and contamination data with disease data so we can \nlearn more about the possible links between the two. I am not one who \nthinks there are as many different problems as one can imagine \ndepending upon the environmental condition, but I think common sense \ntells us that there are a good number of them. Right now we do not know \nwhich. We cannot give good information to parents about how best to \nprotect their children.\n  In the No Child Left Behind Act, a provision that I championed called \nthe Healthy, High-Performance Schools Program was adopted. That would \nassist States in creating and disseminating information and technical \nassistance to our neediest schools to help them improve indoor air \nquality and energy efficiency, and we know it can make a difference.\n  In Greenwich, NY, a school renovation project left cement and \nconstruction dust all over the buildings, fiberglass exposed in the \nlibrary, paint fumes in the elementary classrooms, heavy equipment and \njackhammers outside, and electric wires and pipes exposed. In another \nNew York school, a parent of an asthmatic child was so upset by the \nchild's repeated absences because of being exposed to the toxic \nchemicals that were used in the installation of a gym floor.\n\n  These are just two of the multitude of examples that argue for us \nlearning more about what we are doing inside our schools to perhaps \nbetter control these problems so that, if we cannot eliminate them, \ncertainly the information will help us to decrease the health problems \nfrom which these children suffer.\n  I hope this amendment will be a real encouragement for the National \nChildren's Study because it is one of the most important research \nstudies we can undertake in our country.\n  As I said, the Framingham Heart Study, which has been going on now \nfor 50 years, has yielded remarkable advances in the prevention of \nheart disease. The Nurses Health Study that began in 1976 has given \nwomen invaluable information about how to protect our health. The \nNational Children's Study is the same. It will give us so much help, \ntrying to figure out what we should do in the public health arena in \nour schools and in our homes.\n  I am hopeful we will fully fund this National Children's Study \nbecause it is important that we begin the hard work of getting answers \nto many of the questions my constituents ask me.\n  We need an additional $15 million for this study to be carried out. \nThese are critical funds. I hope we will be able to appropriate them. \nThis amendment will enable the study to take advantage of the expertise \nin the Department\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\nof Education and particularly zero in on the needs of children with \ndisabilities.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support. I appreciate their strong \nadvocacy on behalf of this reauthorization of the bill and in \nparticular this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment would call for the inclusion \nof the United States Department of Education in a consortium of Federal \nagencies that are working on a study regarding environmental influences \non children's health and development, which may result in developmental \ndisorders in these children.\n  This consortium, which is to be headed by the Director of the \nNational Institute of Child Health and Human Development, also includes \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  This amendment ensures that, should any collection of information \nfrom the study involve student education records, parents must provide \nprior consent before the information is released. This ensures \ncompliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974) \n(20 U.S.C. 1232g) (FERPA) and comports with the federal policy of \npreserving parental consent.\n  Quite simply, information in records maintained by schools about \nindividual children should not be accessible by the CDC, or Federal \nagencies, or their contractors without the knowledge and prior consent \nof those children's parents.\n  We appreciate the amendment of the Senator from New York. It is \nconstructive and positive and we are willing to accept it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment of the Senator from New \nYork be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3146) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a moment to thank the Senator \nfrom New York for offering this amendment. She is quite right. This \nlongitudinal study that will be done with regard to children's health \nwill be the most important work outside the Academy of Sciences' work \nthat will be done on the development of children's brains and what \nearly intervention means, in terms of their educational capabilities.\n  There are a lot of different factors such as bus fumes, asbestos in \nthe schools, lead paint in the playgrounds, let alone lead paint in the \nwalls. There are a series of different issues regarding mental health \nand a wide range of different areas affecting children and children's \nhealth.\n  The fact the Department of Education was not included was a major \noversight. The amendment of the Senator from New York addresses that. \nIt is very welcome. It will make that study a much more comprehensive \nand accurate reflection of where children are in our society. I thank \nher for offering it.\n  We all know that what happens during a child's early years can mean \nthe difference between lifelong success and lifelong struggle. Good \nnutrition, a nurturing home, a healthy and safe neighborhood, and \ncountless other factors provide children with the foundation from which \nthey grow into a productive adulthood.\n  But for too many children, the basic elements of a healthy start are \nmissing. Children whose environments are lacking or even dangerous are \nat much higher risk of developing disabilities--disabilities that can \nbe prevented if we understand more about the factors at play. That is \nwhy the Children's Health Act of 2000, and its study on child \ndevelopment, is so important.\n  But, as the Senator from New York has pointed out, the study has a \nmajor flaw. It is incomplete because the Department of Education is not \nincluded as a partner and school experiences are not examined. This \nstudy cannot put together the puzzle of child development when this \ncrucial piece of every child's life is missing. The Senator from New \nYork's amendment puts the final piece into place.\n  Including the Department of Education in this study is just common \nsense. School is a child's primary environment outside the home. From \nearly childhood through adolescence, children spend a majority of their \nday in a classroom.\n  In fact, the school environment may be even more important for \nchildren with disabilities. Most disabilities are diagnosed in school, \nand most special education services are provided there. What happens \nfor disabled children in schools has a tremendous lasting effect.\n\n  The Department of Education has data to share with the study's other \npartners that is critical to capturing every aspect of disabled \nchildren's development. When this data is being shared, the amendment \nis careful to protect children's educational privacy rights.\n  The more we know about how a child's environment impacts \ndevelopmental disorders, the more we can do to prevent them and ensure \nthat all children grow to be healthy adults. This study, and the \nDepartment of Education's participation in it, will provide us with \nimportant information for years to come.\n  I applaud the Senator from New York for her advocacy on this issue \nand on so many other issues concerning the health of our Nation's \nchildren. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3147\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Enzi and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3147.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To provide for attorneys' fees)\n\n       On page 558, strike lines 7 through 12, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(B) Award of attorneys' fees.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In any action or proceeding brought \n     under this section, the court, in its discretion, may award \n     reasonable attorneys' fees as part of the costs--\n\n       ``(I) to a prevailing party who is the parent of a child \n     with a disability;\n       ``(II) to a prevailing party who is a State educational \n     agency or local educational agency against the attorney of a \n     parent who files a complaint or subsequent cause of action \n     that is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, or \n     against the attorney of a parent who continued to litigate \n     after the litigation clearly became frivolous, unreasonable, \n     or without foundation; or\n       ``(III) to a State educational agency or local educational \n     agency against the attorney of a parent, or against the \n     parent, if the parent's complaint or subsequent cause of \n     action was presented for any improper purpose, such as to \n     harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in \n     the cost of litigation.\n\n       ``(ii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subparagraph \n     shall be construed to affect section 432 of the District of \n     Columbia Appropriations Act, 2004.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gregg amendment \nto provide a little more equity to school districts in the often overly \nlitigious world of special education.\n  Currently, IDEA only allows parents who are prevailing parties to \ncollect attorney's fees. Even if the school district prevails in court, \nit must pay its attorneys out of its own budget. Under the Gregg \namendment, this would still be the case in vast majority of cases.\n  The Gregg amendment does not cap attorney's fees allowed under IDEA \nand it is not even a straight ``loser pays'' provision.\n  The Gregg amendment simply provides that State or local education \nagencies may be awarded attorney's fees, at the judges discretion, only \nin those very limited cases where the parent's case is--``frivolous, \nunreasonable, or without foundation, or the parent continued to \nlitigate even after it became clear that the case was frivolous'' or--\nif the parent's complaint was ``presented for any improper purpose.''\n  This is a very strict standard and is based on existing laws and \nprecedents.\n  This strikes me as a very limited, reasonable amendment.\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n  I should mention that in Iowa, we do not have a great many due \nprocess hearings and they rarely go to court. In fact, Iowa is a model \nof dispute resolution in the area of special education. It also helps \nthat Iowa schools generally provide an excellent education to all \nstudents.\n  However, I have heard from many Iowa educators that the Federal IDEA \nlaw is too litigious. School districts often find themselves at a \ndisadvantage when trying to prove that they have done right by a child. \nSchool districts find that it is usually easier and cheaper to give in \nto parents' demands rather than to go to court, even if school \nofficials are convinced they have acted properly.\n  I am not suggesting we tip the scales the other way so that parents \nof disabled children are less able to advocate for the education they \nfeel their children need.\n  The standard in the Gregg amendment is strict enough that it would \nstill be to the advantage of school districts to settle all but the \nmost egregious, frivolous complaints.\n  This amendment would not discourage any parent from pursuing any \nlegitimate complaint, even if the parent might ultimately lose the \ncase.\n  Parents must be able to defend the right of their child to a free, \nappropriate public education, even in court if necessary. However, \nfrivolous due process complaints under IDEA abuse the rights of parents \nand hurt children.\n  When a school district must spend money to defend against frivolous \ncases, it drains funds away from needed services for other disabled \nchildren.\n  This amendment also protects parents from unscrupulous attorneys who \nwould prey on parents when they are most vulnerable by encouraging them \nto litigate or prolong litigation in order to collect fees.\n  The law should protect children, not the pockets of trial lawyers.\n  Again, this amendment would in no way limit or discourage parents \nfrom pursuing legitimate complaints against a school district if they \nfeel their child's school has not provided a free, appropriate public \neducation. It would simply give school districts a little relief from \nabuses of the due process rights found in IDEA and ensure that our \ntaxpayer dollars go toward educating children, not lining the pockets \nof unscrupulous trial lawyers.\n   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, IDEA currently allows only parents who are \n``prevailing parties'' in disputes to collect attorney's fees, in the \ncourt's discretion. The law does not permit school districts that \nprevail in a case to recover their attorney's fees. In most cases, this \nis the right policy, as we do no want to discourage parents from \nseeking redress when they believe their child is not getting what is \npromised under IDEA.\n  However, there are sometimes cases where the parent's case was \nfrivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, or the parent continued \nto litigate the case even after it became clear that the case was \nfrivolous. Or, there are sometimes situations where a parent or their \nattorney files a number of complaints and requests for due process \nhearings, triggering the school district to spring into action to \nprepare for the hearing. The parent subsequently drops the complaint, \nbut the school has spent considerable time and money preparing for the \nhearing; a closer look at the facts reveals that the complaints were \nnot filed for any proper purpose, but instead were done to harass or \nretaliate against the school district.\n  In these limited instances, school districts should be able to \nrecover their attorney's fees.\n  This amendment makes such a change to the law. The amendment provides \nthat a court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorney's fees \nto a school district if the parent's complaint or subsequent cause of \naction is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, or the parent \ncontinued to litigate after it clearly became so, or was presented for \nany improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay \nor needless increase in the cost of litigation.\n  The legal standards in this amendment are not new concepts, but are \nbased upon well-established laws.\n  The first part of the amendment comes from the U.S. Supreme Court \ncase of Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC 1978, which involved an \nemployment discrimination claim under title vii of the civil rights act \nof 1964. Christiansburg held that a plaintiff which brings an action \nthat is frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation may be held \nliable for the prevailing defendant's attorney's fees. It is fair to \napply this same standard in IDEA. In fact, a 1985 senate labor and \nhuman resources committee report on the predecessor of idea stated the \ncommittee's intent\n\n      to adopt the policy of christiansburg garment company v. \n     eeoc, which is that a party which brings an action that is \n     `frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation' may be held \n     liable for the prevailing defendant's attorney fees.\n\n  It is important to note that this is a very high standard and \nprevailing defendants are rarely able to meet it and obtain a \nreimbursement of their attorney's fees. The Supreme Court has said: to \naward attorney fees to defendants in a civil rights suit, the \nplaintiff's action must be meritless in the sense that it is groundless \nor without foundation; the fact that plaintiff may ultimately lose his \ncase is not in itself sufficient justification for fee award.\n  Finally, case law directs courts to consider the financial resources \nof the plaintiff in awarding attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant.\n  The second provision in the amendment--that relates to bringing \nlawsuits for an improper purpose, such as to harass or cause \nunnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation--comes \nfrom another well-established Federal law: Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 11.\n  In interpreting this language from Rule 11, courts must apply an \nobjective standard of reasonableness to the facts of the case.\n  Let me give you some examples of frivolous or improper lawsuits, \nwhere the school districts had no recourse.\n  In DeLeon Indepen. Sch. Dist. v. Seth B., 4:CV-00-1770-Y (N.D. Tex. \n2001), a school district asked for injunctive relief against a parent \nwho had filed seven requests for due process hearings over the course \nof 2 years. The school district asserted that the parent required the \nschool district to convene at least 20 IEP meetings during that time, \nand claimed that the parent had abused her entitlements under IDEA by \nfiling repeated requests for hearings and later canceling or refusing \nto attend. The school district further alleged that it had spent over \n$154,000 in attorney's fees and costs to defend the parents' filings. \nThe court held that the IDEA law did not give the court subject matter \njurisdiction to provide the school's requested relief.\n  We heard from a small district with an annual budget of $10,000,000. \nAt the end of the 2001 school year an IEP student graduated and failed \nto pass an exam for entrance into a postsecondary trade school. The \nparents sued the district demanding among other things $1 million in \nlost future wages because the school had allegedly failed to address \nhis learning needs sufficiently for him to get into the trade school. \nThe district believed that it followed all legal requirements properly \nfor full parent cooperation and agreement during the child's years in \nschool. A decision was made to settle for $140,000 spread over four \nyears partially in fear of consequences if a court battle ended in \nfavor of the parents. A demand of one million dollars would have the \neffect putting the district into a negative fund balances and the risk \nof no longer being able to function.\n  A director of pupil personnel with special education responsibility \nreports:\n\n       Next month I will go to Federal court with an attorney who \n     is seeking fees for a recent Due Process Hearing. The \n     District prevailed on 100 percent of the issues, not even a \n     hand slap was given to the District. Why are we going to \n     Federal Court? Because the attorney wants fees and the only \n     way he can get them is threaten Federal court and hope we \n     settle the fees versus the cost of Federal court.\n\n   She described the situation as blackmail.\n  One principal says:\n\n       Attorneys that drag out a hearing for weeks, do so because \n     once the attorney fees equal the post of the placement, the \n     case gets resolved. I was involved in a case 9 years ago in \n     which an aggressive attorney insisted on a 10 day evidentiary \n     hearing. When it was clear the hearing officer had no control \n     over the hearing, the district caved to the parents' position \n     and wrote a settlement agreement.\n\n  But the worst example of egregious conduct comes from a suburban \nschool\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\ndistrict with over 33,000 students and 1,600 teachers. I will come to \nthat in a minute.\n  Mr. President, we need to have a mechanism to protect schools in the \nrare instances in which the complaint filed against them is frivolous, \nor when litigation is being used to harass or retaliate against the \nschool district.\n  This amendment is fair and reasonable. It would apply established \nlegal principles and standards to protect defendants from burdensome \nlitigation having no legal or factual basis.\n  The intent of this amendment is not to discourage parents from using \nthe procedural safeguards under IDEA to bring complaints against school \ndistricts. And I don't believe this amendment will do that.\n  However, other Federal attorney fee statutes--(e.g., title vii of the \ncivil rights act and section 1983 claims)--allow prevailing defendants \nto ask for attorneys' fees in egregious instances. Why can't we allow \nfor the same mechanism under IDEA?\n  We want Government dollars targeted for IDEA to go to special \neducation services for children with disabilities--not for school \ndistricts to pay attorney's fees to defend themselves in frivolous law \nsuits.\n  This amendment will not chill representation--it does not put a new \ndollar limit on attorney's fees. Rather, this amendment is intended to \ngive school districts some relief in those rare situations where a \nparent has abused their due process rights.\n  Let me tell you about the most egregious example of frivolous, \ngroundless behavior against a school.\n  I know of a suburban school district with over 33,000 students and \n1,600 teachers. Noted for excellence, student performance, and \ndistinguished programs, this district has received local, State, and \nnational recognition.\n  Within this district, ``Mrs. X,'' as I will call her for privacy \nreasons, has two children attending the schools in the district: a high \nschool-age son, identified as a special education student, and a middle \nschool regular education daughter.\n  In May of 1998, the district settled a playground injury claim \nbrought by Mrs. X resulting from her daughter's fall from monkey bars. \nThat incident has been followed by the most egregious and long-standing \nabuse of every form of complaint, fair hearing, and litigation \nprocesses.\n  In summary, Mrs. X has filed complaints with the office of civil \nrights, tort liability suits, and multiple district internal personnel \ncomplaints--ranging from senior district personnel ``dishonesty'' to a \nsubstitute teacher leaving the door open in her son's room. Mrs. X \ncurrently has six suits filed in Federal Court against the district--\nthe Board of Education Trustees, the Assistant Superintendent, the \nExecutive Director of Special Education, the Program Specialist, the \nDirector of Special Education, the Deputy Superintendent, the \nSuperintendent, the Attorney retained by the district; nine hearing \nofficers; the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, \nRegion IX; and the California Department of Education Superintendent of \nSchools.\n  As difficult and vexatious as these proceedings may be, by far the \nmost expensive and draining of all of Mrs. X's actions are those \nresulting from her rights under the IDEA. Since June 1998, she has \nfiled 15 complaints and fair hearing requests. These demands are \naccompanied by a daily barrage of letters, faxes, and telephone voice \nmessages left for various District employees. Because of IDEA \nrequirements, these need a timely response.\n  The District has spent $195,000 on attorney's fees to defend against \nthese cases.\n  In November 2001, the District office began a log these \ncommunications so that the level of harassment and disruptions to the \norganization could be documented. Since that time, 828 communications \nhave been sent to District personnel, representing well over 2,440 \npages.\n\n  Currently, one of the District's program specialists devotes the \nmajority of her time handling the issues generated by this one parent. \nThis detracts from the District's ability to deal with the urgent and \nlegitimate special education needs of students and parents.\n  Here is the list of the due process filings by Mrs. X. I ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n       Case No. 1 filed: June 30, 1998. Issue(s): Denial of FAPE \n     1997-98. Resolution: Settled by agreement at mediation.\n       Case No. 2 filed: December 26, 1998. Issue(s): Untimely \n     IEP. Resolution: Settled by mediated agreement at the hearing \n     by hearing officer.\n       Case No. 3 filed: March 28, 1999. Issue(s): Denial of FAPE \n     1997-98 and 1998-99. Resolution: District prevailed on all \n     issues on hearing officer determination.\n       Case No. 4 filed: February 10, 2000. Issue(s): Denial of \n     FAPE by placement at certain school. Resolution: District \n     Prevailed on all issues on hearing officer determination.\n       Case No. 5 filed: August 23, 2000. Issue(s): Denial of FAPE \n     by placement at certain school.

Through all this IDEA litigation, the school district has \nnever been able to collect its attorney's fees in defending any of \nthese cases.\n  And because there is no disincentive or negative consequences of \nfiling complaint after complaint, making call after call, flooding the \ndistrict with thousands of pages of documents, Mrs. X has continued her \nactions against the district.\n  Now, we know that this example is the rare exception--however, we \nneed to do something to help protect schools against frivolous, \negregious behavior, which drains resources away from providing special \neducation and related services to children with disabilities.\n  The District writes:\n\n       The purpose of IDEA is to protect the interests of special \n     education students. It would be in this interest to guard \n     against the egregious and vexatious behavior of a very small \n     minority of parents whose actions negatively impact the \n     ability of a school district to provide service to all \n     special education students.\n\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what this amendment is designed to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \namendment because no one wants to see our courts abused by frivolous \ncases and everyone wants to see less IDEA litigation.\n   While I can support preventing abuses of our legal system, I cannot \nstand by and listen to a debate that unfairly characterizes the \nmajority of parents and the majority of attorneys as eager to sue \nschools. This could not be further from the truth--and the record needs \nto be set straight.\n   No parent wants to have confrontation with their child's school. \nDespite what has been said on the Senate floor today, every parent \nwould rather be a partner in their children's education instead of an \nadversary. However, there are times that a parent has no choice but to \nright for their disabled child's educational rights. There are times \nwhen a school's violation of the law is so extreme, or when a school \nrefuses over and over to do the right thing, that a parent's only \nrecourse is to seek help from the legal system.\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\n   Parents facing this challenge need the help of attorneys who can \nrepresent the best interests of their child. But for too many low- and \nmiddle-income families the cost of an attorney is simply out of reach. \nThat is why the IDEA requires schools that violate the law to pay the \nlegal fees of parents. Without these provisions, the cost of an \nattorney to advocate for a disabled child's educational rights can mean \na family must sacrifice another child's college education or even their \nhome.\n   For example, the Hannagan family from Florida has been seeking an \nappropriate education for their disabled daughter for 5 years. They owe \n$90,000 in legal fees and have had to get a second mortgage on their \nhome, mortgage their parent's home, and use up all of their credit \ncards.\n   Or take the Bonney family from Missouri who also had to fight to \nguarantee their disabled son's right to an appropriate education. Even \nthough they asked to go to mediation instead of court, the school \nrefused. As a result, they have had to mortgage three properties--two \nof which had already been paid off--in order to cover $100,000 in legal \nfees.\n   The IDEA give parents a fighting chance to get the education their \nchildren need without bankrupting the family.\n   Schools claim that, because IDEA helps families in this way, they \nare being overrun by IDEA lawsuits and costs. But the reality is \ndifferent from the rhetoric.\n   The vast majority of IDEA parents do not file cases, and the vast \nmajority of schools are not being sued. National data showing that IDEA \nlitigation is extremely rare. A 2003 GAO study shows that nationally \nthere were only 5 due process hearings per 10,000 special education \nstudents. A 2003 Department of Education national study shows that 94 \npercent of districts had no dispute cases go to due process hearings. \nBut some will argue that a single lawsuit is one too many because IDEA \ncases are extraordinarily expensive. Again--this is not true.\n   The national data on the cost of solving IDEA problems paints a very \ndifferent picture. According to a Department of Education study, only a \nfraction of IDEA funds are spent on solving problems. In 2000, $50 \nbillion of State, Federal, and local funds were spent on special \neducation. Only .3 percent of that total went to school expenses for \nmediation, due process hearings, and court cases. With over 6 million \nstudents served by IDEA, the cost of dispute resolution was only $24 \nper student nationally.\n   Mr. President, I have listened to the debate today. I have listened \nwhile supporters of this amendment describe rapid attorneys waiting to \npounce on schools. You would think that high-priced attorneys are lined \nup around the block to take schools to court. This simply is not true.\n  Most parents don't have access to any attorney, or must rely on low-\ncost legal aid. And data from surveys shows that even this help is in \nshort supply.\n  Mr. President, 55 percent of the States lack sufficient low-cost or \nfree attorney services in their State. Only 686 low-cost or free \nattorneys regularly take IDEA cases. This is about 1 attorney for every \n10,000 special education students. Eight States have 5 or fewer \nattorneys in the entire State. One State had no free or low-cost \nattorneys in the entire State who take IDEA cases with so few attorneys \navailable to help parents, families face two grave and unpleasant \nchoices: represent their child in due process alone or allow the school \nto continue violating their child's rights.\n  Those parents who have the courage to go it alone face schools that \nare well represented. State data shows that in 2003 schools were much \nmore likely to bring an attorney to a hearing than parents were. In \nCalifornia, parents had attorneys only 21 percent of the time while \nschools had attorneys 42 percent of the time. In Missouri, parents had \nattorneys only 60 percent of the time while schools had attorneys 87 \npercent of the time. In Connecticut, parents had attorneys only 65 \npercent of the time while schools had attorneys 95 percent of the time. \nIn Illinois, parents had attorneys only 35 percent of the time while \nschools had attorneys 91 percent of the time. In New York, parents had \nattorneys only 31 percent of the time while schools had attorneys 100 \npercent of the time.\n  How can anyone look at this data and say that schools are at a \ndisadvantage in the legal system? How can anyone look at this data and \nsay that parents and their attorneys are the problem? It is parents who \ncontinue to be at a disadvantage when it comes to the IDEA.\n  For example, Sheila, the mother of a disabled child from Oklahoma, \nwrote me about her fight for her son's right to an appropriate \neducation. Her case took 3\\1/2\\ years because the school district hired \nnot one but four attorneys to fight her. The district subpoenaed dozens \nof witnesses in order to question her integrity, instead of focusing on \nthe real issue: how to help this severely autistic child as he grew \nolder and his needs became more serious.\n  I want nothing more than to reduce IDEA due process and spare \nfamilies and schools the toll it takes on them. I agree that the ideal \nnumber of IDEA cases would be zero, and the ideal cost of IDEA \nlitigation would be zero dollars because every dollar that goes to a \nparent's or school's attorney is a dollar that does not go to a \nclassroom. So I can support this amendment to deter bad cases that \nwaste time and money.\n  But I cannot agree with anyone who says that litigation is the result \nof demanding parents or greedy lawyers. It is not a result of IDEA \nattorney's fee provisions. Litigation is a direct result of a school's \nfailure to comply with the law. So long as schools continue to fail \ndisabled students, parents will continue to be the enforcers of the \nlaw. This amendment cannot change that.\n  The real solution to the so-called IDEA litigation problem is to hold \nschools accountable for providing every disabled child with an \nappropriate education. This bill delivers meaningful enforcement for \nthe first time in the history of the IDEA and this will go further to \nreduce litigation than any change to attorney's fees. Anyone who \nsupports this amendment--anyone who supports reducing IDEA litigation--\nshould also support stronger enforcement.\n  Instead of focusing the debate on parents and their attorneys, I urge \nmy colleagues to focus on fulfilling the promise of an appropriate \neducation made by the Congress nearly 30 years ago.\n  I thank the Senator for working with us on this issue. It is \nenormously important. I think we have worked out a very satisfactory \nsolution. I thank the Senator and hope the Senate will accept the \namendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New \nHampshire for his work on the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA, reauthorization bill. In particular, I appreciate his \namendment to address the issue of attorneys' fees. I agree \nwholeheartedly that every child should be adequately represented, but \nwe must ensure people do not take advantage of the system. As a member, \nand former chairman, of the DC Appropriations Subcommittee, I became \naware of how the District of Columbia Public Schools has experienced \nlarge numbers of lawsuits filed against it under IDEA and had to pay \nmillions in attorneys' fees.\n  In an effort to keep these expenditures under control, the District \nof Columbia Appropriations Acts for fiscal years 1999, 2000 and 2001 \nlimited the amount of appropriated funds that could be paid to \nprevailing parties for attorneys' fees. However, in fiscal year 2002 \nthese caps were lifted. It quickly became clear this was a mistake.\n  After lifting the cap, the number of special education related \nadministrative hearings increased in one year by 20 percent. In 2002, \nthe city received 2,750 hearing requests, up from 1,500 3 years \nearlier. The backlog of assessments increased significantly and the \nbacklog of hearings tripled. Attorneys' fees as a percentage of total \nspecial education spending tripled to almost 6 percent, increasing by \n$10 million in 1 year.\n  The problem in DC was uniquely egregious. There are numerous \ninstances in which DC had to pay outrageous sums. In one case a lawyer \ncharged $43,500 for a case that was settled and never actually went to \na hearing. On other occasions when the case was settled prior to a \nhearing ever being held, lawyers charged as much as $22,000. Some firms \napparently have split one case into multiple hearings, rather than \naddressing them in a single complaint, in order to generate excess \nfees. In addition, the DC Auditor issued a report in May 2003, on legal \nfees paid\n\n[[Page S5352]]\n\nin relation to special education and concluded that certain law firms \nhad relationships with advocacy groups that appear to have been \nunethical or illegal.\n  Clearly, some people have been using a system intended to help \nchildren in need of special education assistance for their personal \ngain. The rule that allows parents to receive payment to cover \nattorneys' fees when they win is intended to ensure parents who may not \nhave the means can get representation. It is not intended to be a cash \ncow for attorneys, soaking up money that would otherwise be spent on \neducating children.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is clear something was wrong, because DC has accounted \nfor 40 percent of all IDEA administrative due process hearing requests \nin the country but has less than one-quarter of a percent of the U.S. \npopulation. During 2000-2002, DC public schools received 7,883 due \nprocess hearing requests, more than the entire State of California, and \nthe vast majority of hearings have been for procedural and \nimplementation issues, which often could be handled outside of the \nhearing process.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator. The Federal Government has a \nparticular interest in this issue for DC because of its constitutional \nresponsibility to oversee the Nation's Capital and because it provides \napproximately twice as much in education funding, in percentage terms, \nfor DC as for the country overall.\n  In FY2003, we reinstated attorney fee caps, and they have been \nsuccessful in curbing the problem. In FY03, DCPS saved $4.4 million, or \n30 percent, due to the attorneys' fees cap. Based on those savings, \nDCPS was able to create 550 new classroom seats at 50 schools during \nthe 2003-2004 school year to serve children with special needs, \nincluding children with autism, students who are hearing or vision \nimpaired, mentally retarded, learning disabled or emotionally disabled, \nand early childhood special education students. The conflicts of \ninterests between attorneys and companies providing special education \nservices also appear to have ended as a result of this law.\n  FY04 savings from the cap can again be reinvested into capacity \nbuilding. In the 2004-2005 school year, DCPS expects to create 450 \nadditional classroom seats with the savings.\n  While the changes made by Senator Gregg's amendment make good sense \nfor most of the country, I believe in extreme circumstances, such as in \nDC caps may be necessary. That is why I supported clarifying in the \namendment that the measures for which I have fought so hard with the \nsupport of the school board president to protect DC are not intended to \nbe replaced by this provision.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Texas for her work on this issue. \nI agree that the District of Columbia is a unique situation and \nunderstand it has required unusual actions to ensure the rights under \nthe IDEA law are not abused.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Senator Gregg on attorney's fees. I am concerned about the effect \nfrivolous lawsuits are having on the ability of our schools to provide \nservices to special education students. Schools with limited resources, \nparticularly small or rural schools, are especially vulnerable to the \nfinancial impact a frivolous complaint can have on scarce resources and \nlimited funds.\n  I believe an important part of the debate on this amendment should \nfocus on the practical impact that frivolous complaints have on the \nprovision of services to students with disabilities.\n  When Federal funding was originally established for services to \nstudents with disabilities it was meant to be used for services, not \nfor legal fees. I believe that is still the case. Unfortunately, some \nfrivolous lawsuits against schools are having the effect of diverting \nfunds from necessary services.\n  There are documented cases where schools have spent hundreds of \nthousands of dollars battling frivolous complaints that were filed \nunder IDEA. As my colleague from New Hampshire has pointed out, there \nis one instance of a school spending $154,000 over a 2-year period to \naddress seven complaints from the same parent. Another school spent \n$195,000 on complaints from one parent.\n  In Wyoming, $154,000 is more than some school district's entire \nspecial education administrative budget. It is very difficult to \nimagine successfully providing services to children with disabilities \nwhen faced with this kind of legal obligation to defend frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  The piece of the puzzle that get overlooked is that school districts \ndo not have unlimited funds. If a school district spends $154,000 on \nlegal fees defending a frivolous lawsuit, that is $154,000 that does \nnot get spent on educational purposes.\n  I do not want to leave anyone with the impression that I think all \ncomplaints filed under IDEA are frivolous. We are talking about a very \nsmall minority of complaints, probably less than 1 percent.\n  Still, even though the number of frivolous complaints may not be \nsignificant to the big picture, but the cost to schools can be very \nsignificant.\n  A second major point I would like to make is that frivolous \ncomplaints undermine the effort of Congress to ``fully fund'' IDEA.\n  The issue of ``full funding'' for IDEA has received a lot of \nattention and we have been discussing it on the floor in this body as \nit relates to the underlying bill. I have never understood ``full \nfunding'' to mean that the Federal Government should fully fund the \nlegal fees for schools to resolve complaints under IDEA.\n  The ``full funding'' of IDEA that I am familiar with is the Federal \ngoal of providing 40 percent of the cost of special education services \nto students. No one that I hear speaking of full funding talks about \nlawsuits, they talk about services to children.\n  Unfortunately, schools do not have the luxury of ignoring complaints, \nhowever frivolous they may be. They must assume that every complaint \nfiled with be upheld and prepare accordingly. That diverts funds from \nother educational services.\n  Once the complaint is filed, the school must find a way to pay for \nthe legal services it will require, and local education funding is the \nonly pool of resources available to school districts.\n  This means local education will suffer when a frivolous lawsuit is \nfiled, because the school will have to divert funds away from other \npriorities, even special education services, to pay for the cost of \nresolving the complaint.\n  This body should not overlook the fact that frivolous lawsuits are \ndiverting limited resources away from services, eroding the effect of \nincreased Federal appropriations.\n  This amendment would create a simple protection to defend schools \nfrom frivolous lawsuits and help retain Federal funds in proper streams \nto provide services for disabled students.\n  Parents filing legitimate complaints would not be liable for \nattorney's fees. The standard set by this amendment is higher than the \nstandard currently followed by the courts in civil rights cases.\n  Some will argue that this amendment infringes on the rights of \nparents to pursue a complaint against a school district. That is not \nthe case at all. This amendment simply provides a means for school \ndistricts to avoid the unnecessary costs of defending themselves from a \nfrivolous lawsuit.\n  Legitimate complaints under IDEA would not be affected. Even \ncomplaints that could be considered marginally frivolous would not be \naffected. Only those complaints that meet a high standard of frivolity \nwould be met with approved sanctions by the courts.\n  I believe this is a reasonable approach to an important issue and one \nthat the Senate should be able to accept without objection.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3147) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3148\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     DeWine, and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3148.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer a \nbipartisan amendment with Senators DeWine and Feingold to ensure that \nour country's most vulnerable disabled students can reach their full \npotential.\n  Today the Senate is discussing the IDEA, the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act. It is a bill that is based on the American \nprinciple of equal opportunity. IDEA recognizes that students have a \ncivil right to a free, appropriate public education even if they have \nspecial needs that require additional resources. We still have a long \nway to go to meet the Federal Government's promise to fund 40 percent \nof special education, and we are working on that challenge.\n  In the meantime, we need to address the unique needs facing three \ngroups of disabled students, and I am honored to join with Senators \nDeWine and Feingold in offering this bipartisan amendment.\n  Our amendment makes small but very important changes to IDEA to \nensure that disabled students who are homeless or who live in foster \nhomes or who have their education disrupted because of their family's \nmilitary service get the help they need. I thank the following \norganizations for their help and support of this amendment: The \nNational Association for the Education of Homeless Children and Youth, \nthe Military Family Education Coalition, STOMP, the Specialized \nTraining of Military Parents, the National Association of Federally \nImpacted Schools, Children's Defense Fund, the National Education \nAssociation, the National PTA, the National Court Appointed Special \nAdvocates Association, the Council for Exceptional Children, and the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities Education Task Force.\n\n  The consortium represents more than 70 national disability \norganizations, including the American Occupational Authority \nAssociation, the ARC, United Cerebral Palsy Association, Easter Seals, \nthe Higher Education Consortium for Special Education and Teacher \nEducation Division, and the Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/\nHyperactivity Disorder Association.\n  All of those organizations understand the challenges facing our most \nvulnerable children, and all of them support this bipartisan amendment.\n  Congress has a long and proud tradition of supporting and protecting \neducational opportunities for our most vulnerable young people. It is \nwhat we did when we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nin 1965. It is what we did when we created Head Start. And it is what \nwe did when we started giving out Pell grants. It is time for us to \nstep up once again and make the changes needed to make IDEA work for \nhomeless and foster children with disabilities and children with \ndisabilities in military families.\n  I take just a minute to describe the special challenges facing these \nchildren and how our amendment will help them. Let me start with foster \nchildren. Today in America there are nearly 500,000 children in foster \ncare. Thirty percent of them are in special education. We know foster \nchildren often do not function as well in school because of their \nexperiences. Foster children have usually been separated from their \nbiological families because of child abuse or neglect. That can leave \nboth emotional and physical marks for life. Given the shortage of \nfoster parents in our country, children in foster care are often \nshuttled between many different homes and schools.\n  One young man shared with me his story of living in more than 100 \nhomes throughout his childhood. Often, every new home means enrolling \nin a new school. And every new school means starting over again and \ngetting the support and services they need.\n  In addition to frequent absences and transfers, foster children often \ndo not have parents to advocate for their educational needs. Almost \nevery parent whose child has a disability will tell you that their role \nas advocate for their child directly impacts the quality of the \neducation their child receives. Without a parent to advocate for them, \nfoster children can languish for years with unrecognized disabilities \nor insufficient services to help them succeed in school. These \nexperiences can leave children in foster care without the education and \nsupport to lead functional, productive lives.\n  I will share the true story of two foster children in New York City \nwho need the help this amendment provides. Eric and his sister Joanna \nhave been in foster care for 6 years. They have been in four different \nfoster homes and each home was in a different borough. Each time they \nmoved to a new home they were taken out of school in the middle of the \nschool year. Frequently, they were not reenrolled in their new schools \nfor weeks or months, and their records were not transferred from school \nto school.\n\n  Both Eric and Joanna have learning disabilities. Each time they \narrived in a new school, the teachers did not know they needed special \neducation services. So over the years, Eric and Joanna missed months of \nschool and have only occasionally received needed services.\n  Upon their last move to a foster home in Queens, Eric's new high \nschool refused to enroll him because he was 16 and he had no credits. \nThe Advocates for Children assisted Eric and Joanna's case worker in \nenrolling both students in school after they had been out of school for \n3 months. Their advocates also secured records from 2 years ago that \nshow that Eric had obtained 10 credits and passed a regent's exam. \nBecause their records were never transferred, Eric had been placed in \nthe ninth grade for the third time. Eric's current guidance counselor \nwas informed at school and Eric's records are being transferred.\n  Our amendment helps disabled foster children such as Eric and Joanna \nby ensuring that their records follow them from school to school \nquickly and that they have an advocate who is on their side in \ndeveloping an education plan.\n  Let me turn to another group of students our amendment will help. \nHomeless children in our country also face significant hurdles to \nsucceed in school, and these hurdles are higher for homeless children \nwho have disabilities. The Urban Institute estimates that 1.35 million \nchildren experience homelessness each year. A high proportion of \nhomeless children with disabilities also need special education \nservices. Yet many have trouble getting the help they need. Children \nexperiencing homelessness are diagnosed with learning disabilities at \ntwice the rate of other children. They suffer from emotional or \nbehavioral problems that interfere with learning at almost three times \nthe rate of other children. These mental and emotional difficulties \noften begin at birth as infants who are homeless have higher rates of \nlow birthweight and need special care immediately after birth, four \ntimes as often as other children.\n  Like other children and youth surviving in extreme poverty, homeless \nchildren and youth face appalling living conditions. Many of these \nhorrific conditions directly contribute to physical, mental, and \nemotional disabilities.\n  For example, students experiencing homelessness often suffer from \npoor nutrition, inadequate health care, higher rates of other health \nproblems, and severe emotional stress related to conditions of extreme \npoverty and instability.\n  Unfortunately, even though homeless children suffer from disabilities \nat a disproportionate rate, children who are homeless are underserved \nby special education programs. A recent study of children in homeless \nshelters in Los Angeles found that while 45 percent of the children met \nthe criteria for special education evaluation, only 22 percent had ever \nreceived special education testing or placement.\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\n  In 2000, 50 percent of States reporting data to the U.S. Department \nof Education reported that students in homeless situations had \ndifficulties accessing special education programs.\n  Children who experience homelessness desperately need stability in \ntheir lives. But they cannot stay in the same school or even the same \ndistrict long enough for the individualized education plan to be \ndeveloped and implemented.\n\n  In addition, like foster children, some homeless youth have no legal \nguardian to watch out for their educational needs and to advocate for \ntheir special interests or their best interests. I share the story of a \nyoung girl in Virginia our amendment would help. She is a 13-year-old \ngirl. Her mother fled domestic violence. Over the course of 2 years \nthey moved to temporary living situations in several school districts. \nThe girl suffered extreme trauma and was hospitalized on two occasions. \nThe hospital evaluations clearly show that she qualified for special \neducation, and her mother had requested special education services from \nseveral school districts. However, because they moved around, no school \never completed the evaluation process. Each successive school started \nthe process from the very beginning. Even when the girl attended a \nsingle school for several months, the school did not complete the \nevaluation process. Instead, it chose to wait it out until the family \nmoved again.\n  Finally, the girl's mother found a special education attorney to take \non her case.\n  Our amendment would help students like her by ensuring that homeless \nstudents have continuous educational services no matter how many times \nthey are forced to move.\n  Finally, I turn to a third group of disabled students whose special \ncircumstances are often overlooked. Children in military families often \nexperience disruptions in their education because they move frequently. \nAccording to the Military Child Education Coalition, 13 percent of \nchildren in military families receive special education services or \nother special support. Further, children in military families move an \naverage of every 2 to 3 years. That translates into attending six to \nnine schools from kindergarten until high school graduation. Children \nwith disabilities in these highly mobile families need consistent \nservices so they do not fall further behind each time they move.\n\n  Especially in times of war, and when parents are serving our country \non extended tours of duty, children in military families need support \nand stability in their lives and in their education.\n  I would like to share some of the words I received from military \nfamilies across the country who support my amendment. I received a \nletter from Natalie Cyphers of McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey. \nNatalie writes:\n\n       Thank you for your consideration of military families with \n     special needs children. My husband is active duty Air Force \n     and we have a 14-year-old with mild cognitive deficiency. I \n     find one of the hardest parts of our son's education occurs \n     every time we move.\n       It is difficult to implement the current IEP and often the \n     educators do not realize the importance of continuity for our \n     children.\n       Any assistance in these situations would be helpful to all \n     of us.\n\n  That is from Natalie Cyphers at McGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey.\n  I also received a letter from Kristina Rice of Boise, ID. Kristina is \na parent of a disabled child and a case manager for children with \ndisabilities. She wrote:\n\n       The members of highly-mobile military families who suffer \n     most educationally are children with disabilities as \n     transitions are more difficult, and levels of service vary \n     greatly from state to state.\n       Evaluation processes are cumbersome, expensive and time-\n     consuming, and the children being served do not have the time \n     to wait while new teachers and service providers try to re-\n     create a picture of their needs and re-determine eligibility.\n       Once several months have gone by without adequate services, \n     a child may regress so far that he or she can lose a whole \n     school year. [The] suggestions in this amendment are \n     practical, fair, and necessary.\n       Military families already sacrifice enough to serve our \n     country. They do not need the added burden of delayed \n     services for their children.\n\n  That is from Kristina Rice, of Boise, ID.\n  These stories reflect just a few of the many disabled students who \nthis amendment will help.\n  So, again, specifically, our amendment will help students who change \nschools or school districts by ensuring that all students receive \ncontinued special education services when they transfer schools.\n  Our amendment ensures that records are transferred quickly so \nstudents do not waste critical time.\n  Our amendment increases opportunities for early evaluation and \nintervention for homeless and foster infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities, and for children with disabilities in military families.\n  Our amendment also ensures that these vulnerable children are \nrepresented on the State policy committees that decide their future.\n  In addition, our amendment expands the definition of ``parent'' to \ninclude relatives or other caregivers who are equipped to make sound \ndecisions in a child's best interest when there is no biological parent \navailable to do so. Finally, our amendment improves the coordination of \nservices and information so educational and social services agencies \ncan work together more efficiently to help these students.\n  As we reauthorize IDEA, we have an obligation to pay extra attention \nto these children and to provide the resources and support they need. \nThe real test of how we treat children in America is measured in how we \ntreat the most vulnerable among us. This amendment gives us a chance to \ndo the right thing.\n  I urge the Senate to join with more than 70 national disability, \nmilitary family, foster, homeless, and education organizations in \nsupporting the bipartisan Murray-DeWine amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWashington for her attention to this issue that can make a major \ndifference to many families with special needs children, recognizing \nthe increased mobility of our population, and, most particularly, the \nneeds of those in the military who are moving through the school \nsystems in different parts of our Nation in increasing numbers, and \nalso giving special focus and attention to the too many Americans and \nAmerican families who are homeless and have some special needs.\n  So I rise in support of this amendment because it will ensure that \nthe disabled children who change schools will continue to get the \nservices they need.\n  America is increasingly a mobile society. The demands of our economy \nand shifts in our culture mean Americans will move to new communities \nduring their lives. Today, it is unlikely that a child will stay in the \nsame school district or even the State, for that matter, throughout \ntheir school years.\n  Families and schools do all they can to make the transition easier \nfor children when they move from place to place, but many children \nstill have a difficult adjustment to make in their new home and school. \nThis is especially true for students with disabilities.\n  Disabled children are extremely likely to have problems when they \nleave one school for another. Sometimes they have difficulty with \nchange because of their disability, but more often it is because their \nnew school does not provide them with the services they need. Because \neach State and school district does things differently, disabled \nstudents who move often wait months for their new school to provide \nthem with special education.\n  In the life of a disabled child--in the life of any child--missing a \nfew days, let alone a few months, of instruction is a huge loss. Many \ndisabled children actually lose skills they have already gained when \nthey go without the services they need for any length of time. These \nchildren are already struggling in school and fall further and further \nbehind.\n  Imagine what it is like, then, for a disabled child with a parent \nserving in the military. Imagine what it is like for a disabled child \nwho is homeless or in foster care. It is one step forward and two steps \nback every time they change schools.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington will help solve \nthis problem by guaranteeing that disabled students who move do not \nhave to wait. It guarantees that disabled students do not go without \nspecial education during the time it takes for the\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\nschool and the parents to decide how best to meet the child's needs.\n  Will this be difficult for some schools to do? Certainly. Every \nschool does it differently, and the flexibility in this amendment \nrecognizes this fact. There will be times that a student moves to a \ndistrict that is not ready to provide all of the services he or she \nneeds. But a disabled child's education--a disabled child's future--\nshould not suffer because the school needs time to get prepared.\n  As the Senator from Washington has explained, this amendment also \nmakes numerous changes to the IDEA that will improve special education \nfor disabled children who are homeless or in foster care. Although \nchildren who are homeless are four times more likely to have delayed \ndevelopment than other children, they have a more difficult time \naccessing special education. These children are truly more vulnerable. \nThey are the vulnerable of the vulnerable. I applaud the Senator for \nher tireless efforts on their behalf.\n  This amendment will make it easier for schools to provide disabled \nhomeless and foster children with the services they need, and will \nsmooth the transition for all disabled children who move to new \nschools.\n  Mr. President, this recognizes the reality; that is, we are in a \nmobile society. Children are moving. Families are moving. In a bill \nthat is dealing with special needs children, not to recognize that \nissue would be an omission. I think the Senator has made some excellent \nrecommendations.\n  We still have some work to do in terms of working through this issue, \nbut it does seem to me that she has identified an extremely important \narea of need, and one to which we should attend. So I thank her for \nbringing it to the attention of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we have agreed to accept this amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3148) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Photos of Iraqi Prisoner Abuse\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at 2 o'clock today, the Department of \nDefense delivered to S-407 material relating to the issue of \nmistreatment by Americans in uniform and perhaps others under contract \nagainst the prisoners in a prison in Iraq. Several hundred of these \nphotos have been shown to a large group of Senators.\n  The Department of Defense prepared a document as guidance for \nSenators as to how hopefully they will handle their knowledge of these \nphotos as they relate their responsibilities to their constituents and \nothers in giving their views.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter Senator Levin \nand I, in our capacity as chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee, wrote to the Department of Defense with regard to \nthe transmission of these documents.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2004.\n     Hon. Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n     Secretary of Defense,\n     Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: We request the Department of Defense \n     provide the Committee on Armed Services an opportunity to \n     review the photos and videos regarding the abuse of prisoners \n     at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Further, it is our intent to \n     extend this opportunity to all Members of the United States \n     Senate.\n       These materials should be brought to the Senate for review, \n     but will remain under the control of the Defense Department. \n     At no time will the Committee, the Senate, or any Member or \n     employee thereof, take custody of, or assume responsibility \n     for, these materials. A Defense Department official will \n     return these materials to the Pentagon after the materials \n     have been reviewed by Members, subject to our subsequent \n     recall if necessary.\n       Committee staff will coordinate the details of this request \n     directly with your office.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin,\n       Ranking Member.\n     John W. Warner,\n       Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to read the material that was \nprovided to Senators. It is entitled ``White Paper For Persons Who Have \nViewed The Detainee Abuse Photos.''\n\n       The Privacy Act prohibits the disclosure of ``any record \n     which is contained in a system of records'' to ``any person \n     or to another agency,'' except with ``prior written consent \n     of the individual to whom the record pertains.'' 5 U.S.C. \n     Section 552a(b). The statute applies only to records about \n     U.S. citizens or permanent resident aliens (``U.S. \n     nationals'').\n       The Iraqi detainee abuse photos and videos . . .\n\n--we saw some video--\n\n     were collected by and are maintained in the files of the \n     military criminal investigative organization in the \n     [Department of Defense]. The photos are subject to the \n     Privacy Act to the extent they disclose the identities of \n     U.S. nationals.\n       Any release of the photos to persons outside the \n     [Department of Defense] (with very limited exceptions \n     concerning releases to Congress and certain Executive Branch \n     officials) would risk liability under the Privacy Act.\n\n  That liability in this sentence is to the Department of Defense. I \nask unanimous consent to print in the Record the pertinent sections of \nthe Privacy Act.\n       (b) Conditions of Disclosure.--No agency shall disclose any \n     record which is contained in a system of records by any means \n     of communication to any person, or to another agency, except \n     pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written \n     consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains, \n     unless disclosure of the record would be--\n       (9) to either House of Congress, or, to the extent of \n     matter within its jurisdiction, any committee or subcommittee \n     thereof, any joint committee of Congress or subcommittee of \n     any such joint committee;\n\n  Mr. WARNER. There are certain exceptions as it relates to the \nCongress of the United States. Senators should read this and draw their \nown conclusions from it.\n\n       Any description of the photos (or any particular photo) \n     that would reveal the identity of a U.S. national depicted in \n     the photos would also risk liability under the Privacy Act.\n       To the extent that any description of the photos is offered \n     at all, it should be limited to generic statements about the \n     conduct depicted in the photos without any reference that \n     would tend to reveal the identity of any U.S. national \n     involved in the conduct photographed.\n       The disclosure of photographs or detainees could constitute \n     a violation of the Geneva Conventions, which provide that \n     such persons shall be protected ``against insults and public \n     curiosity.''\n\n  As I stated earlier today, speaking for myself, I believe very \nstrongly these photographs should not be made public. That is not a \ndecision that is up to the Senate or the Congress but to other \nauthorities in the executive branch. I believe it could possibly \nendanger the men and women of the Armed Forces as they are serving \nvaliantly and at great risk, not only in Iraq and Afghanistan but other \nareas of the world.\n  Secondly, this Nation is founded on the rule of law. We are \nproceeding--I say we, the Department of Defense, and they are to be \ncommended--carefully within the rule of law as it relates to this \nevidence and the trials which will be forthcoming of those who will be \nbrought to justice by virtue of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. \nAt those trials, they will be public. At those trials, such portions of \nthese photos as a prosecutor deems necessary can be released and put \ninto the public domain. As well, the defense counsel, likewise, through \ndiscovery can determine such photos that might in some way enhance the \ndefense in that case. It is not as if there will be no public \ndisclosure. It is the time and the circumstances under which that \ndisclosure is made.\n  Again, the credibility of the country is being examined in connection \nwith these tragic incidents that have taken place, tragic incidents \nagainst a background of 99.99 percent of the men and women of the U.S. \nmilitary performing\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\nall over the world at this very minute at personal risk but in the \ncause of freedom, to protect this Nation and our allies. I firmly \nbelieve the guidelines are out there certainly for colleagues. I have \ngiven you my best counsel on this. Here are the rules prescribed by the \nDepartment. I think it is in the best interest that we all, in a very \ncalm, collected manner, continue to address this issue.\n  The Committee on Armed Services has concluded two hearings. At this \nmoment the Committee on Intelligence, of which I am also a member, is \nconducting a hearing. Speaking for the Senate, and I believe the House, \nthe proper oversight is being administered. The Appropriations \nCommittee likewise addressed this issue in some context today. The \nGovernment of our Nation, the executive and the legislative branch \ntogether--I find total cooperation with the Department of Defense--is \ndoing the best we know how to protect the interests of our Nation and \nprotect the men and women of the Armed Forces and protect all others in \nthis set of very tragic circumstances.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his \nextraordinary leadership in the Senate, especially with the extremely \ndifficult issues in our country today. We are very fortunate to have \nhim as chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague. I am \nprivileged also to serve on his committee.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are fortunate to have him on our committee also. That \nis an extra plus. But his leadership on issues protecting our Nation is \nsecond to none.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3149\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment on behalf \nof Senator Santorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for Mr. \n     Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 3149.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for a paperwork reduction demonstration)\n\n       Amend section 609 of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act, as amended by section 101 of the bill, to read \n     as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 609. PAPERWORK REDUCTION.\n\n       ``(a) Report to Congress.--The Comptroller General shall \n     conduct a review of Federal, State, and local requirements \n     relating to the education of children with disabilities to \n     determine which requirements result in excessive paperwork \n     completion burdens for teachers, related services providers, \n     and school administrators, and shall report to Congress not \n     later than 18 months after the date of enactment of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of \n     2003 regarding such review along with strategic proposals for \n     reducing the paperwork burdens on teachers.\n       ``(b) Paperwork Reduction Demonstration.--\n       ``(1) Pilot program.--\n       ``(A) Purpose.--The purpose of this subsection is to \n     provide an opportunity for States to identify ways to reduce \n     paperwork burdens and other administrative duties that are \n     directly associated with the requirements of this Act, in \n     order to increase the time and resources available for \n     instruction and other activities aimed at improving \n     educational and functional results for children with \n     disabilities.\n       ``(B) Authorization.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In order to carry out the purpose of \n     this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to grant waivers \n     of statutory requirements of, or regulatory requirements \n     relating to, this part for a period of time not to exceed 4 \n     years with respect to not more than 20 States based on \n     proposals submitted by States to reduce excessive paperwork \n     and noninstructional time burdens that do not assist in \n     improving educational and functional results for children \n     with disabilities.\n       ``(ii) Exception.--The Secretary shall not waive any \n     statutory requirements of, or regulatory requirements \n     relating to, applicable civil rights requirements.\n       ``(iii) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to--\n\n       ``(I) affect the right of a child with a disability to \n     receive a free appropriate public education under this part; \n     and\n       ``(II) permit a State or local educational agency to waive \n     procedural safeguards under section 615.\n\n       ``(C) Proposal.--\n       ``(i) In general.--A State desiring to participate in the \n     program under this subsection shall submit a proposal to the \n     Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary \n     may reasonably require.\n       ``(ii) Content.--The proposal shall include--\n\n       ``(I) a list of any statutory requirements of, or \n     regulatory requirements relating to, this part that the State \n     desires the Secretary to waive or change, in whole or in \n     part; and\n       ``(II) a list of any State requirements that the State \n     proposes to waive or change, in whole or in part, to carry \n     out a waiver granted to the State by the Secretary.\n\n       ``(D) Termination of waiver.--The Secretary shall terminate \n     a State's waiver under this subsection if the Secretary \n     determines that the State--\n       ``(i) has failed to make satisfactory progress in meeting \n     the indicators described in section 616; or\n       ``(ii) has failed to appropriately implement its waiver.\n       ``(2) Report.--Beginning 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Improvement Act of 2003, the Secretary shall include in the \n     annual report to Congress submitted pursuant to section 426 \n     of the Department of Education Organization Act information \n     related to the effectiveness of waivers granted under \n     paragraph (1), including any specific recommendations for \n     broader implementation of such waivers, in--\n       ``(A) reducing--\n       ``(i) the paperwork burden on teachers, principals, \n     administrators, and related service providers; and\n       ``(ii) noninstructional time spent by teachers in complying \n     with this part;\n       ``(B) enhancing longer-term educational planning;\n       ``(C) improving positive outcomes for children with \n     disabilities;\n       ``(D) promoting collaboration between IEP Team members; and\n       ``(E) ensuring satisfaction of family members.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing morning business on Thursday, May 13, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the pending IDEA bill and there then be 30 minutes \nequally divided with respect to the pending Santorum amendment No. \n3149; provided further that there be one relevant second-degree \namendment in order to the amendment and it be offered by Senator \nBingaman; further, that the amendment be limited to the same time \nlimitation of the first degree. I further ask unanimous consent that \nthe only other amendment in order be a Gregg-Kennedy managers' \namendment to be agreed upon by both managers.\n  I further ask consent that following disposition of the above \namendments there be an additional 20 minutes of debate equally divided \nbetween the two managers for closing remarks, and following that time \nthe provisions of the previous order remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. While the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire is on \nthe floor, we could finish this bill before noon if things worked out \nright. I say, through the Chair to my friend, I spoke yesterday to the \nsenior Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici. He is interested, as are \na number of other Senators, in moving forward on the mental health \nparity legislation. This may be the window that we can do that, and I \nsay that because what we have been waiting on is a proposed amendment \ndealing with the scope of that matter from the distinguished chairman \nof the HELP Committee. I ask my friend if he has an idea when that \nmight be ready because that is all that is holding up going to our \nlegislation, as I understand it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have tried to be very cooperative with \nthe Senator from New Mexico and certainly he has tried to be \ncooperative with me. This has been an issue that has involved not only \nour body but the House and the White House. I have actually agreed that \nthis language not go through our committee, which I think is a very \ngenerous act on our part, not\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\nhaving it to mark up in committee and allowing it to move directly to \nthe floor. Of course, before we can draft our amendment we actually \nhave to see the language of the Senator from New Mexico. We have not \nseen it.\n  As soon as we get his language, we will be able to probably put \ntogether our amendment. The understanding is we are going to move \npromptly at that time because I understand Senator Domenici wants this \nmoved, and I respect him. He certainly has made a huge commitment in \nthis area and I want to try to expedite it and be constructive in this \ninitiative.\n  Mr. REID. As with all things in life, communication is everything, \nand I think this communication has been most helpful. I will do \neverything I can to get the distinguished chairman a copy of the \nproposed amendment as soon as possible. As I said, this would be an \nopportunity to do that. As I said last night in closing, this will have \nbeen a good week for us. We have been able to finish the FSC bill. We \nare going to be able to finish this IDEA legislation tomorrow, and if \nwe can do the mental health parity, that would be three very important \npieces of legislation in 1 week. For us in the Senate, that says a lot.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if we could add the confirmation of some of \nthe judges who have been waiting for months, that would make this a \ngood week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say in response to my friend, we have \nconfirmed 173. I think we are in a position to do more. Although there \nare some negotiations going on dealing with recess appointments, as \nsoon as that matter is resolved--and I think it can be with a matter of \na phone call from the White House--we could move forward and set up \nvotes on maybe not all the judges but a lot of them.\n  Mr. GREGG. Unless there is further business, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will speak on the underlying bill for \n15 minutes.\n  I wanted to take this opportunity to come to the floor and speak for \na minute about the important subject of education and, in particular, \nspecial education, which we refer to around here as IDEA. We authorize \nthis very important piece of legislation every 5 or 6 years. In the \nmidst of all that is going on with Iraq and with our debate over tax \npolicy regarding the economy, some would not consider this the most \nimportant issue before us. But for our students, our families, and for \nour educators, in particular, it is a very important issue.\n  I say on the eve of our commemorating the 50th anniversary of the \nBrown v. Board of Education decision, it is appropriate that we would \nspend a couple of days in the Senate and in Congress speaking about an \nissue that really does affect millions of our families. I know people \nin Louisiana are very concerned about special education.\n  I commend the chairman and the ranking member for bringing us a bill \nthat, in the midst of all of this rancorous debate and gridlock--some \nof it, from my perspective, deserved because there are some things that \nour side doesn't want to move forward, so we appropriately stop those \nactions. Nonetheless, in the midst of all of this, we should take some \ntime to work in a bipartisan way to move the agenda of special \neducation and make some very needed improvements. I also commend the \nadministration and the commission that worked very hard to try to \noutline for us a focus regarding special education. Some of the \nfindings of the recent study that was concluded are worth repeating. \nThey were mentioned earlier on the floor.\n  I want to say again how important I think the work of this commission \nwas when they noted that we as a Congress, as the educational leaders, \nshould focus more on student outcomes. We have been, since we created \nthis provision of the law in 1975, in my mind--and I think the Chair \nshares this opinion--too much focused on the process of making sure \nthat each of our special needs students and their families and schools \nwere following things step by step, paper trail by paper trail, and \ntaking our eyes off the outcomes. What do we want these students, who \nare called special needs students--but they are just students who need \nspecial attention. Every student needs special attention, and some \nstudents because of where they start, with challenges or disabilities, \nneed extra attention. I know that is true in Louisiana.\n  We have been, for these 30 years or so, too wrapped up in the process \nand not focused on the outcome. Are we, in fact, teaching children to \nread at grade level? Are we, in fact, intervening in the case of gross \nneglect or abuse to make sure that the proper outcome is that the abuse \nand neglect is stopped and children are placed in an environment that \nis more suitable to their needs, or are we focused on process, such as \nif the pink slip was turned in on time to match the yellow slip, or if \nthe money was appropriately recorded. I am proud that study is moving \nup toward outcome and results.\n\n  I also want to say that the study has been good about suggesting to \nus--and this bill outlines some of the new thoughts--that we should be \nfocused on prevention. Yes, we want to identify our students who need \nspecial attention, but if we could put in place better teaching \ntechniques, early intervention strategies that would prevent young \nchildren from being labeled as special education, not only would that \nbe better for the student, it would be better for the parents, the \nschool districts, and it would also save the taxpayers some money. \nToday, taxpayers would like to save money where and when they can.\n  The third finding I thought worth noting was that we should begin to \nembrace more fully the concept that we only have one educational system \nfor all of our children. We don't have, and should not have, a two-\ntiered system or separate system--one for ``regular'' children and one \nfor ``special needs'' children. They are all our children. They all \nneed special attention. But special education, or IDEA, is to give \nadded resources--we, in Louisiana, call that ``lagniappe,'' a little \nextra--to a certain group of students who might need it because of \ntheir physical or emotional or mental circumstance.\n  Those are the three very important findings of the commission. I \ncommend our leadership for helping us to focus on that. Let us not \nfocus so much on the process, let us focus on the outcomes. Are we \nsucceeding with these children? Let us not just continue to label \nchildren as the need arises, but let's focus on preventing the labeling \nat the earliest stage. Let us stop talking about two separate systems \nand realize that we are talking about one system and embrace that \nnotion.\n  There are four other short points I want to make regarding the \nunderlying bill and, in general, they are positive comments.\n  There has been great concern in Louisiana about the issue of \ndiscipline in our schools, and I think rightfully so. We want to \nsupport our teachers and our administrators. We want to empower them to \nmake good choices about maintaining an atmosphere of discipline in a \nschool so all children can learn.\n  If 1, 2, or 3 children are disruptive--it only takes 1--but if 1 \nchild is disruptive in a classroom, it wrecks the opportunity for those \nother 25, 20, 18, 15--whatever the number is--children to learn, and it \nrobs them of an opportunity to have a full and productive day.\n  Because our laws have been perhaps not as carefully written as \npossible, maybe our regulations have been too onerous, and perhaps some \ncourt decisions have led us to a place where in America today--and I \nknow in Louisiana because my teachers and superintendents tell me: \nSenator, we are afraid to discipline a child. We are afraid of a \nlawsuit. Or we don't know where to stand on this issue.\n  As an example, as hard to believe as this is--and I am going to \nsubmit for the Record information to document it--we actually had an \nincident a couple years ago where two students--I know those listening \nwill find this hard to believe--actually burned down a school, and \nbecause they were labeled\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\nspecial education children, the actions taken against them were not \nwhat you and I would think would be appropriate in that they were \nbasically allowed to go to a temporary school because they burned down \nthe original school. People of that community did not think they could \ntake appropriate action because they were prevented by some Federal law \nor regulation.\n  I am happy to say, in large measure that discipline issue is \naddressed in this bill. That is why I am happy to support it. We can \nnow, under this new bill, suspend or expel a child with no questions \nasked and no hearings necessary for bombs, guns, drugs, or bodily \ninjury to another student or a teacher. Then for issues that are not as \nclear as bombs, guns, drugs, and bodily injury to a student or teacher, \nthere is a more streamlined process that does not get everybody tied up \nin legal knots and provides discipline in the classroom, in the \nhallways, in the gym, and in other places in the school environment so \nthat learning can take place. I commend this leadership.\n  Perhaps we do not go as far as I would have liked on this issue. I \nknow the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and I have talked about \neven going further than this bill. But at least this is a step in the \nright direction to return discipline and empower our teachers to take \nappropriate actions.\n  Let me be quick to say, we do not want any child who is suffering \nfrom a physical injury or disability, particularly if a child is deaf \nor visually impaired, to suffer in any inappropriate way by disciplines \nthat might come. But it has gotten out of hand in the sense that our \nregulations have tied the hands of our principals, superintendents, and \nteachers. We have addressed that situation.\n  On the labeling issue, we have made some progress. I am going to put \nup a chart in a few moments to show that we have a long way to go.\n  One of the other issues is funding. This bill gives us a new \nauthorization level. It does not give us a funding level. This is where \nI want to express some disappointment.\n  We just had a vote to authorize this bill at $13.5 billion for 2002, \n$16 billion for 2003, $18.5 billion for 2004, and $20.5 billion for \n2005. But the numbers appropriated are $20 million for 2002, 11.69 for \n2003, 12.34 for 2004, and 13.3 for 2005.\n  There is a difference between authorized levels and appropriated \nlevels. For No Child Left Behind and IDEA, authorized levels are \npromised levels. Authorized levels are what we promise to fund; \nappropriated levels are actually what we do.\n  For today, this is a serious issue, and there is a serious \ndifferential. If we were truly funding IDEA the way we promised when we \ninitially created it and the way we continue to promise each time we \nauthorize it, Louisiana, just our State, would be getting an additional \n$240 million a year.\n  With 15 percent of our total population labeled as ``special \neducation,'' and with one out of every four children in poverty and \nwith two out of three African-American children in poverty in our \nState, this $240 million would go a long way to helping us correct the \ninequities, to close the achievement gap, and to provide a quality \neducation for all of our children.\n  When we add the shortfall in IDEA with the shortfall in No Child Left \nBehind, it comes to an astonishing $440 million shortfall for Louisiana \nalone. I have not calculated the shortfall for Maine. I am sure the \nPresiding Officer, because she is a leader in this issue, is familiar \nwith what that number would be. For the large States, such as \nCalifornia, Florida, and Texas, it would have to be millions of dollars \nshort because Louisiana, with only 4 percent of the Nation's \npopulation, is short $450 million.\n  With $440 million, we could do a lot better job helping every child \nin Louisiana learn to read at an early age and live up to the call of \nthe special education report that says an ounce of prevention is worth \na pound of cure. If we could prevent the labeling and teach children to \nread at age 6, 7, or 8, it would go a long way to preventing the \nlabeling of ``special education.''\n  Let me go to this chart that will show my point. There are almost 3 \nmillion children who are identified around the country as special \neducation children. I am almost getting uncomfortable using that term \nbecause the more we use it, the more people get the idea that these \nchildren are damaged goods, that there is something wrong with these \nchildren. They have special needs. I think it was the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, who said it so beautifully: That might be true, \nbut what these children really need is special attention.\n  I give my daughter special attention every night. I read to her for \nalmost 30 minutes, and I try to do it every night. She needs special \nattention, and I try to provide that because she is at a critical stage \nof learning to read.\n  Most of these children who are in special education, as you can see, \nthe vast majority of them, have speech or language disabilities. That \nis not to say there is something wrong with their God-given, innate \nintelligence. There is nothing wrong with the way God made their brain \nor fashioned it. He actually did a magnificent job. But we have not \ndone our job as they grow to be little humans teaching them speech or \nlanguage. So they come to school underprepared. Not mentally retarded, \nnot visually impaired, not deaf, not autistic, but they just have \ndifficulty speaking and with language.\n\n  Madam President, as you know, we are learning so much about the early \nbrain development of children from 0 to 3. We understand how critical \nit is as parents raising our own children to look directly in the eyes \nof a child, to speak with clear diction, to actually show them how to \nspeak and to talk to children, and to have a conversation with them, \neven if they are unable to speak but just hearing the language.\n  So many of our children from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds and \nsome children from actually wealthier backgrounds who are neglected, \nbut in large measure from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds, come to \nschool not hearing the language properly, not having been spoken to in \na direct way. So they start out at a tremendous disadvantage.\n  In criticism of this administration and our actions here, if we would \nput our money where our mouth is and start funding early childhood \neducation, which could be done through either funding No Child Left \nBehind fully so States have choices about where to spend their money--\nin large measure, they could spend it on early childhood education--or \nfully funding IDEA, we could eliminate 80 percent of the children \nbecause we could catch their speech or language earlier with effective \nprograms.\n  How do I know this? Because we are doing it in Louisiana. Our \nsuperintendent, even being short of Federal dollars, even after the \nyears we promised to give the money and we have not, has taken the bull \nby the horns with our Governor and our board of elementary and \nsecondary education and with State dollars are creating what we call \nLouisiana Four, LA Four.\n  We are trying to identify every 4-year-old in our State who needs \nhelp, who wants help. It is voluntary. Children are not forced to go to \nschool at 4 years old, but for the parents who do want to enroll their \nchild in a quality education, with parental involvement, we are \nproviding our own State money. Just think what we could do with $440 \nmillion. The results are astonishing.\n  Children who are taught to read at the earliest ages and given the \nbasics of phonics and language avoid being labeled as special \neducation. So then we could focus our attention on those children who \nreally are challenged by things that, in large measure, are out of our \ncontrol.\n  The jury is still out on autism. We are not sure what causes autism. \nWe do not believe, with all the studies I have read, that it is \nanything that is caused by human activity or inactivity. It seems to be \na brain malfunctioning or a nerve malfunctioning. As I said, we are not \nclear yet on the research. Such a small percentage of the children who \nare in special education are autistic and that is an appropriate place \nfor them to be, because autistic children have real special needs. It \ntakes skill to educate and deal with them.\n  Deafness and blindness, obviously, bring their own challenges.\n  Traumatic brain injury, our children are sometimes in accidents, \nsometimes it is a birth defect, but we can hardly even see this graph \nbecause it is such a small percentage of children.\n  If we could take care of children coming to school unprepared, which \nis\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\nin our power to do, if we could take care of speech and language \nimpairment, and if we would properly diagnosis mental retardation--and \nI am convinced, because I have seen studies that indicate we are not \naccurately identifying or overidentifying children who are mentally \nretarded, in other words saying they are mentally retarded but they are \nnot really; we are just testing them in that way or making that \njudgment when really they have been grossly neglected and abused and \ntheir IQ is perfectly fine. Our testing measures are just not what they \nneed to be. If we could take care of speech or language ability, which \nis in our control, we would dramatically reduce the number of children \nwho would need this special intervention and therefore do a better job \nof educating them, reducing labeling, reducing the cost to the \ntaxpayer, and making our children and their families much more \nsatisfied. We would not be labeling them and putting that moniker on \ntheir back for their life.\n  When children are labeled and told they are special education, most \nchildren receive that as there is something wrong with them. They lower \ntheir own expectations for themselves.\n  I will conclude on a couple of points. I guess having low \nexpectations from your parents is very difficult to deal with. If one \nhas a notion about themselves and their parents did not go to college \nor they did not finish high school, they set low expectations. Also, \nhaving low expectations from one's teachers is difficult, but the most \ndifficult expectation to overcome is if someone has low expectations of \nthemselves. That is almost impossible to overcome.\n  When we put labels on our children unnecessarily at an early age, \nthinking we are helping them but we are actually hurting them, those \nchildren lower their own expectations for themselves. That is very \ndamaging to them and to our society.\n\n  So let us do a better job of intervening early. The best way to do \nthat is to better use the funding we have and to demand of ourselves \nfull funding for special education and No Child Left Behind.\n  The final point I wish to mention is this bill again focuses on \noutcomes. Leave No Child Behind also attempts to focus on outcomes. \nThat is where we have to stay the course.\n  There are some who are suggesting that testing is too high stakes. \nWell, I say to them that life is a pretty high stakes game and nothing \nwe do is worth doing if it cannot be measured.\n  All action that we undertake, in almost every aspect of our life, is \nmeasurable. So schools, in their outcomes, in their processes, can be \nmeasured. We are on the road and let us stay the course. Of course, it \nwould be helpful, and I think imperative, that we fund these efforts.\n  In conclusion, we have made great progress with this bill. We have \ntaken some good steps in the area of stronger discipline. We are trying \nto address the discrepancy in funding, although we are still short in \nthis effort. We still are overlabeling our children when early \nprevention would do so much.\n  I thank the Members for allowing me to speak on behalf of the \nthousands of teachers in Louisiana and our families that are greatly \nconcerned. We see some hope in this underlying legislation that we are \nmoving in the right direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, whenever I hear the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana speak, I think of the wonderful weekend I had in New \nOrleans. We were working with her on some projects. She wanted me to \nlook at some projects that were funded in the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee that I have had the pleasure of chairing and being the \nranking member on over the years. I have been in New Orleans on other \noccasions to be a tourist, but this was the first time I had ever gone \nthere to work.\n  I had wanted to see New Orleans for years. One of the things I told \nthe Senator I wanted to see was these great pumps. New Orleans is below \nsea level, and to keep it dry their pumps go 24 hours a day. They are \nbig pumps. I had read an article in the Smithsonian Magazine about \nthese old, old pumps that had not been changed since before the turn of \nthe century that still keep New Orleans dry.\n  So I had the pleasure of going there and seeing something that I \nwanted to see. The place where these big old pumps were was as clean as \na restaurant.\n  We then went to a big lake where I was----\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Lake Pontchartrain.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, Lake Pontchartrain, and I was so educated. For \ndecades, they had been taking the shells from crustaceans out of the \nbottom of that lake and using them to pave roads around the city of New \nOrleans. They finally stopped as a matter of law, but in my mind I \ncould not imagine there could be that many shells. Anyway, it was a \nwonderful trip.\n  It was highlighted by my trip to Senator Landrieu's childhood home. \nWe took a vehicle there. They were doing a lot of construction in the \narea. Her mother and father live in the same home that she and I think \n9 of her 10 siblings were raised. She was raised in quite a small home, \nand the famous Moon Landrieu, who had served as mayor of New Orleans \nand cabinet secretary, was there making and cooking candy.\n  My payoff for going to New Orleans was I got candy from the great \nMoon Landrieu that I took home to my wife. Of course, one could see in \nthe Landrieus the pride for their famous daughter. Last year she gave a \nspeech that is one of the finest speeches I have ever heard. It was not \nlong after that that I sent a copy of her speech on the Senate floor to \nher mom and dad. The next time I saw them, you could just see the pride \nthey have telling me about the speech Senator Landrieu had given. They \nwere so proud of her.\n  So any time I hear her speak, I cannot take out of my mind from where \nshe came and what a great contribution she makes to the Senate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I thank the \nSenator for those kind remarks. The Senator is invited to come back any \ntime for that famous Moon Landrieu peanut brittle. I am motivated to \nspeak on the floor about this particular subject because in our \nhousehold our parents helped to educate nine of us on a shoestring \nbudget. It became such a passion of mine, as I could see how that has \nhelped each of us to go forward in our lives and to see what it had \ndone for my father and mother. They both came from families where only \none grandparent had gone to college. In my father's case, neither of \nhis parents even went to high school. So when I come to the floor--I \nknow you graduated from that large school of yours, with eight in the \ngraduating class--you can appreciate the importance of the work \nregarding education, fighting hard to make sure every family is like \nthe Landrieu family or Reid family--at least having a chance for a good \neducation.\n\n  If we write good laws and policies, it happens. If we don't, it \ndoesn't.\n  I thank the Senator for those comments and I am happy to share my few \nthoughts about the underlying bill.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to talk about \nan epidemic that affects not only children in my home state of New \nJersey, but 1 in 250 children across the Nation--autism spectrum \ndisorder (ASD). I have been working closely with groups such as Parents \nof Autistic Children and the New Jersey Center for Outreach and \nCommunity Services for the Autism Community (NJCOSAC) to address the \nstaggering number of children who have been diagnosed with ASD. In \nfact, I introduced legislation, the TEACH Act, S. 1422, which \nhighlights the needs of autistic children by bringing more qualified \nteachers into the classroom, helping families receive the support and \nservices they need for their children, and helping ensure vocational \nprograms to assist people with autism transition from school to work \nare functioning as intended.\n  With autism diagnoses skyrocketing, we must continue to make every \neffort to expand the quality and accessibility of treatments for \nchildren with ASD. That is why I am happy to report that some \nprovisions of the TEACH Act have been included in the Senate \nreauthorization of IDEA, S. 1248. S. 1248 contains provisions making \nfunds available to develop and improve programs using cutting-edge \nresearch in order to provide in-service training to\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\nschools and personnel who teach children with ASD. These funds will \nensure quality professional development for special education teachers \nthrough the use of scientifically based research on the treatment of \nautism.\n  With the demand for services grossly outpacing the supply of \nspecially trained teachers and therapists, these provisions are \ncritical to increasing the number of special education teachers \nqualified to teach children diagnosed with ASD. Expanding access to \ntreatment, especially at an early age, is essential to improving the \noutcomes for children affected by ASD.\n  I thank Connie Garner and the entire HELP Committee for their \nassistance in getting this important language in the bill. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my colleagues and the autism \ncommunity to ensure that all children with ASD have access to early \nintervention by quality teachers trained in providing the most \neffective treatments.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to mention a small but important part of \nthis IDEA reauthorization that is crucial to parents of children with \ndisabilities. I have had the privilege of working closely with Maura \nCollinsgru and the Parent Information Center of New Jersey to ensure \nthe rights of parents to represent their children in due process \nhearings without an attorney. I am happy to report that S. 1248 \nincludes language clarifying this right so that parents can be \neffective advocates for their children.\n  I would like to mention one New Jersey case in particular that \nhighlights the issue of parental rights in due process hearings. In \nCollinsgru V. Palmra Board of Education, Robert and Maura Collinsgru \nwere denied the right to represent their son, Francis Robert and Maura \nCollinsgru were denied the right to represent their son, Francis \nCollinsgru, during due process hearings. Far from an isolated case, the \ndecision could have broad implications that could be detrimental to \nfamilies of children with disabilities.\n  As we know, parents' access to attorneys is already very limited. Not \nonly are there very few attorneys willing to take IDEA cases, but there \nare even fewer who actually specialize in IDEA. Moreover, of those \nattorneys who do specialize in IDEA, most are already overloaded with \ncases. Finally, the cost of many of these attorneys is prohibitively \nexpensive, especially for parents who are caring for a disabled child. \nAttorney's fees are an extra cost that they often cannot afford. With \nso few available attorneys, therefore, it is essential that parents \nhave the right to stand up for their children in court when faced with \nan injustice in the system.\n  I would like to take this time to thank Connie Garner for the HELP \nCommittee for her help in getting this language included in the bill. \nHer efforts have made it possible for parents to retain their right to \ndue process and help their children receive the services they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5360-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5360-S5361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEGISLATIVE COMPROMISE\n\n  Mr. REID. One of my favorite stories is a story about David Selznik, \nthe great movie producer. He is the man who produced the movie ``Gone \nWith The Wind.'' As he had made the movie, at that time they had in \nHollywood something called the Hays Commission. It was in effect a \ncommittee of censorship. They looked at the movie and made a \ndetermination that he would have to strike from the movie the words, \n``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.'' But Selznik thought that was \nan important part of his movie and he would not back down. So they were \nat loggerheads. Would the movie be able to go forward? Because without \nthe Hays Commission stamp of approval, the movie could not go forward. \nSo they made a compromise. They said: We will compromise this. You can \ngo ahead, you can keep those words, ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a \ndamn,'' but if you keep that in the movie you are going to be assessed \na fine of $15,000, and $15,000 was a lot of money then, even as it is \nnow. But Selznik agreed to pay that. And that, of course, is one of the \nmost memorable lines in the history of Hollywood.\n  The reason I mention that is Selznik and the Hays Commission realized \nthat in life there is a time to fight and a time to compromise. The \ncompromise worked out well in this instance.\n  Compromise, in our business, being legislators, should not be a dirty \nword. Legislation is the art of compromise, the art of building \nconsensus.\n  Gerald Ford, whom I met when I was a young Lieutenant Governor and he \nwas Vice President of the United States, was such a nice man. When I \ndid meet him, the first big shot I met, shaking his hand, he sent me an \nautographed picture. My two little children at the time, when the \npicture came in, drew all over this picture as if it were a coloring \nbook. But we got the colors off of it as much as we could. It was \nalways smudged. I still have that picture.\n  Anyway, that is off the subject. But Gerald Ford was so nice--what a \nnice man. The reason I mention Gerald Ford today is because he said \nsomething I believe so strongly. He said, ``Compromise is the oil that \nmakes governments go.'' I believe that. I see the Presiding Officer \nhere--she, on a number of occasions, has been the key person in \nallowing us to get things done because she has been willing to \ncompromise, in effect, break from the pack and say this is what I need \nto do.\n  None of us should compromise our principles, but we should be willing \nto work together, to seek solutions we can live with for the good of \nthe country. I have been in Congress now more than two decades and I \nhave learned the way you get legislation done in this Congress and in \nthe Senate specifically is when people work together and are willing to \ncompromise.\n  I have had the good fortune in the years I have been a legislator to \nhave, on the State level and on the Federal level, legislation I have \nproduced that is now law. But there is not a single piece of \nlegislation I have ever written that is as I wrote it. It has all been \nchanged. That is what you have to do to get things done. If people \nare--and I use this term, not in the true sense of the word--so \nprincipled they are not willing to get anything changed, they are not \ngoing to get anything done very often.\n  I know that to be a legislator you have to be willing to compromise. \nThere are some who say this is not right. Some say you have a majority, \nyou should always be able to get your way. Our Founding Fathers didn't \nbelieve that. The majority, you see, doesn't need a Constitution to \nprotect them. The majority can get what they want wherever they are. \nThe Constitution of the United States was written to protect \nminorities. Our Founding Fathers created a government of checks and \nbalances. They wanted the majority to have power, but not all of it.\n\n  That is why, for example, we have an electoral college system. The \nelectoral college system creates some unfairness in the minds of \npeople. The result of the last Presidential election is the person who \ngot fewer votes is now President of the United States. But that is our \nsystem and the system is so embedded in our minds and our consciences \nthat following that very bitter election, where there was a dispute in \nFlorida that was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court--following that \nelection, which was decided by the Supreme Court, there wasn't any \ncivil unrest. There were no riots, no tires burned, no windows broken \nin buildings. It was decided by virtue of the fact that we have a \nConstitution.\n  In the electoral college system, the person who gets the most votes \ndoesn't always win. Why? Because we have to take care of small States, \nStates such as Maine and Nevada.\n  The Senate was also designed to protect the rights of the minority. I \nwas talking to my friend Senator Enzi, the Senator from the State of \nWyoming. I said: Mike, how is Wyoming doing populationwise? Is it \ngrowing? He said: No, we still can't break 500,000.\n  But, you see, Mike Enzi, from a State that has fewer than 500,000 \npeople, has the same power as a Senator from the State of Nevada which \nhas 2.3 or 2.4 million people. Mike Enzi has the same power as someone \nfrom the State of California which I think has 34 million people, or \nsome large number such as that. Mike Enzi has the same power as Dianne \nFeinstein and Barbara Boxer by virtue of the fact that we have a \nconstitutional system that gives a Senator that power.\n  One Senator has tremendous power. We have heard of the famous holds.\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\nYou can have something come to the Senate and a Senator can \nindividually call and say, you know, I am not going to let this move. \nYou are not going to get unanimous consent on this. I stop it.\n  That is why it takes 60 votes, not 51, not 50, not 59--60 votes to \ncut off debate, a so-called filibuster.\n  I realize the party I represent has 49 Senators in the Senate. The \nmajority has 51. There was a time, just a short time ago, when it was \n50-50, and had it not been for the untimely death of Paul Wellstone it \nwould be 50-50 now.\n  So we have a Senate that is so closely divided now, by the smallest \nof margins, but we all represent this country. Democrats, 49 of us, 51 \nRepublicans, we all represent approaching 300 million people in \naddition to what we are obligated to do to represent our individual \nStates.\n  While we recognize the right of the majority to set the agenda, we on \nthe minority side also believe the rights of the minority shouldn't be \ntrampled. That means not excluding us from conference committees.\n  David Broder, a long-time syndicated columnist who is nonpartisan and \nfair, recently wrote about the exclusion of Democrats from conference \ncommittees in Congress this year. He wrote:\n\n       These conferences are no longer the representative bodies \n     they once were. Under the current Republican control of the \n     House and Senate, Democrats are routinely excluded from the \n     discussions after the ceremonial opening day. The real \n     negotiations involve only top Republicans in Congress and \n     representatives of the White House.\n\n  These conference committees have not only disregarded the views of \nDemocratic Senators, but they have disregarded the views of the Senate \nitself.\n  On a number of issues, conferees appointed by the Senate leadership \nhave gone against the will of this body.\n  Am I making things up? No. Let us talk about a few of them.\n  Media ownership: What is this all about? The decision was made in \nlegislative session that you couldn't have more than a certain \npercentage of ownership of a media market by votes on both sides--House \nand Senate. In fact, when it went to the full committee when we were \nincluded in these meetings at that time, the full conference voted to \nmaintain the position we had in the Senate. The conference committee \nwas ended, and sure enough we get on the Senate floor and they have \ntaken that out because the White House told them to. That has never \nbeen done before.\n  Another example, overtime pay. This was an issue where the \nadministration wanted to change the way overtime is paid in this \ncountry. It affects 8 million people. On this side, we said it \nshouldn't be done. We voted accordingly and were joined by friends on \nthe other side of the aisle. The House voted by a large majority to \nhave their conferees do what the Senate did on this vote. On the floor, \nit was stripped from the conference.\n  Pensions: Senator Daschle agreed to allow the conference to go \nforward. Of course, that didn't turn out as well as it was represented \nit would. That doesn't mean that everything should have gone exactly \nthe way it came out of here. Of course not. But that is an example of \nwhat is happening in conferences.\n  Another example is an amendment we agreed to that said when you are \nbuying meat you should know from where it comes. People are entitled to \nknow that. Where is the beef that you are eating coming from? Both \nbodies said, yes, that is a great idea. In conference, it was taken \nfrom the bill.\n  The Senate voted for these things and the conferees disregarded the \nvotes of the Senate--not individual Senators, they disregarded the \nvoice of the American people. That is whom we represent.\n  We have to be able to work together for the good of the American \npeople. That is what the people want us to do.\n  We have done very well this week. We were able to pass the FSC bill. \nIt was a struggle. We got votes on overtime, on unemployment \ncompensation, and we passed this most important bill. Tomorrow, we are \ngoing to pass the IDEA legislation which is very important. I hope \ntomorrow we can also get to the mental health parity legislation. It is \nmy understanding that Senator Domenici has given his legislation to the \nchairman of the HELP Committee. Senator Gregg has that now, and \nhopefully we are in a position to have an agreement to work on this \nlegislation in the near future.\n\n  We have to work together for the good of the people. I understand \nthat being in the majority confers power, but with that power comes the \nresponsibility to make sure the views of Senators are respected and the \nrights of the minority are not trampled.\n  We all have a responsibility to work together. But I believe those \nwho control the agenda have the greatest duty to seek compromise and \nconsensus. That is part of leadership. You have to know when to reach \nout and meet people at least halfway.\n  I think what we have heard around here far too often is \nobstructionism. I hope no one is deliberately trying to obstruct the \nbusiness of our country. I don't think that is the case, but without \ncompromise the Senate simply doesn't function.\n  President Gerald Ford--this nice man--was right. Compromise is the \noil that keeps government running. But I believe that today our \ngovernment needs an oil change and maybe even a lube job. We have to \nlook under the hood and make the proper adjustments to get the engine \nrunning smoothly again in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5361-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the Local \nLaw Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new categories \nto current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind \nis unacceptable in our society.\n  On October 7, 2001, in Palm Spring, CA, Eric Bridge told police he \nwas robbed and beaten unconscious by four men who chased him from a \ndowntown bar after accusing him of being gay and hurling anti-gay slurs \nat him. Bridge was treated for cuts and bruises at a local medical \ncenter and released. The victim said he was not gay but believes he was \ntargeted based on perception.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. By \npassing this legislation and changing current law, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5361-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5361-S5362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STRENGTH (JOBS) ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in favor of the Jumpstart Our \nBusiness Strength (JOBS) Act.\n  This is far from a perfect bill.\n  But without this legislation, U.S. companies will face increasing \ntariffs as a result of a World Trade Organization ruling that \ndetermined that significant portions of our Federal tax code ran \ncounter to international trade laws.\n  Additionally, I voted for it because on balance it provides important \ntax relief for California businesses and labor protections for \nCalifornia workers.\n  This bill will: effectively provide a 3 percent tax cut for \nmanufacturers; give manufacturers a 50 percent tax credit for the cost \nof adding jobs; extend the research tax credit through 2005; protect \nhundreds of thousands of workers from cuts in Federal overtime \nprotections; prevent the Federal Government from spending taxpayer \ndollars on contracts with companies that use foreign labor when there \nare domestic alternatives; provide a tax credit for companies which \nproduce energy by using underbrush and other potentially hazardous \nfuels found in our forests; provide a tax credit for consumers who buy \nhybrid vehicles; and protect the California film industry and the jobs \nit creates.\n  Since January 2001, California has lost 350,000 manufacturing sector \njobs.\n  A 3 percent tax cut for manufacturers, coupled with a 50 percent tax \ncredit for the cost of adding new jobs, will help us create more jobs \nin California.\n  The research tax credit will also help California, potentially more \nthan any\n\n[[Page S5362]]\n\nother State. Productivity growth in recent years has been driven by the \ncombination of new technology and investments in capital goods, \nresearch and development, workers, and public infrastructure.\n  To continue this pattern of growth, the focus must now be on \nproviding incentives to companies that invest, innovate, and create the \nnew capital and knowledge that drive the U.S. economy.\n  Since its enactment in 1981, the research tax credit has provided a \npowerful and effective incentive for firms to increase research \nspending.\n  The tax credit lowers the cost of conducting research in the United \nStates.\n  This credit makes a real difference in the amount of research \nundertaken and jobs created in the U.S.\n  I also support the Harkin amendment which was adopted as part of this \nlegislation. This amendment will prevent the White House from \nimplementing changes in existing overtime laws that reduce the number \nof workers protected by labor laws.\n  Last year the White House proposed redefining the job descriptions of \nmillions of workers, thereby eliminating their right to Federal \novertime protection.\n  After many in this chamber raised serious concerns over such a \nchange, the administration released final rules that made a \nsignificant, yet insufficient, change to those draft rules.\n  Unless we act, these rules will take effect later this year.\n  If the Department of Labor's own numbers are correct, then more the \n117,000 individuals could lose overtime protection. If they are wrong, \nit could be millions.\n  These rule changes would wipe out overtime pay protections and \nincrease work hours. In California alone, several hundred thousand \nworkers could lose their Federal overtime protection. However, State \nlaw will continue to protect most workers from the most harmful effects \nof this rule change.\n\n  But, some public employees and many in the film industry won't be so \nlucky.\n  Although most workers in California will maintain their right to \novertime through protections granted by State law, the rule change \nrepresents a movement in the wrong direction when it comes to \nprotecting working families.\n  I also support provisions in the bill that will prevent the Federal \nGovernment from spending taxpayer money on contracts that use labor \nlocated outside of the United States.\n  Although our Nation has entered a period of economic recovery with \nsignificant productivity gains in the last several quarters--it is \nclear that a great deal of this productivity comes from two things: 1. \ndownsizing of employees, and 2. outsourcing--turning to foreign labor \nin foreign countries.\n  In the past decade, General Electric sent 10,000 information services \njobs to India; Electronic Data Systems exported 13,800 jobs to several \nnations; Microsoft spent $100 million on a new call center in the \nPhilippines; and Citigroup and Bank of America both sent software \ndevelopment jobs to India.\n  And while corporate earnings are up and the stock market remains \nhigh, we are continuing to lose service sector and manufacturing jobs.\n  I realize that many firms benefit greatly from outsourcing, but it \ndamages the long term health of our communities unless we vigorously \nsupport new job growth.\n  We must give companies incentives to keep jobs here, and we must \nensure that taxpayer money is not used to subsidize outsourcing.\n  This legislation will also help protect our environment by providing \ntax credits that encourage companies to produce energy by using \nunderbrush and other hazardous fuels from our forests.\n  By providing an incentive to companies to remove these hazardous \nfuels from our forests, we will reduce the chance of forest fires in \nthe western United States and provide much needed energy to this region \nof the Nation.\n  Additionally, this bill contains tax credits directly to consumers \nwho purchase hybrid vehicles. These vehicles reduce air pollution and \ncut ozone in California.\n  Having said this, however, I recognize that there are significant \nproblems with this bill.\n  For instance, it is clear that multinational corporations are not \npaying their fair share of taxes.\n  This bill allows companies to bring foreign-earned profits back into \nthe United States at a greatly reduced tax rate--reduced from the \ncurrent 35 percent to 5.25 percent. This is half as much as the lowest \npersonal tax rate paid by individuals--10 percent.\n  Under an amendment which I sponsored with Senator Breaux, companies \nwould have been allowed to bring foreign-earned profits back to this \ncountry at the reduced 5.25 percent rate provided that they use those \nrepatriated profits for activities that promote job growth or benefit \nemployees.\n  Sadly, a lobbying effort by large multinational companies helped to \ndefeat that amendment.\n  What is disturbing about this provision is that an unconscionable \nnumber of American companies are taking advantage of loopholes in U.S. \ntax law and paying no taxes.\n  According to a recent Government Accounting Office report, entitled \n``Comparison of the Reported Tax Liabilities of Foreign and U.S. \nControlled Corporations, 1996-2000'', 61 percent of U.S.-controlled \ncorporations and 71 percent of foreign-owned corporations operating in \nthe U.S. reported no tax liability during the period studied.\n  This means that approximately two-thirds of all companies operating \nin the U.S. paid absolutely no corporate income taxes between 1996 and \n2000.\n  This is stunning.\n  Corporate tax receipts used to account for a much greater percentage \nof Federal revenues than they currently do.\n  According to the Brookings Institution, in 1945, income taxes from \ncorporations accounted for 35.4 percent of Federal receipts. In 1970, \nincome taxes from corporations accounted for only 17 percent of Federal \nrevenues.\n  Today, however, corporate income taxes account for only 7.8 percent \nof Federal revenues.\n  This means that corporations are paying a smaller percentage of taxes \nthan they have in the past five decades.\n  We have got to change the way we tax corporations in America. We have \ngot to provide incentives to encourage corporate responsibility.\n  Corporations have got to worry about more than just the bottom line. \nThey have got to become good corporate citizens. Unfortunately, this \nbill does not do enough to encourage that kind of corporate \nresponsibility.\n  Going forward, I will seek to return balance to our tax system.\n  The middle class is being squeezed, while multi-nationals continue to \noutsource jobs and receive tax breaks for doing it.\n  Nevertheless, I will vote to protect California workers by helping to \nfoster an environment where manufacturers can hire again. I will \nsupport research and development in our labs and factories. And, I will \nsupport protecting overtime protections for California citizens.\n  This is by no means a perfect bill.\n  But taken as a whole, I believe it is worthy of passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5362-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5362-S5363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPPORT OF THE MCCAIN AMENDMENT TO S. 1637\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nthe amendment offered by the senior Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nto strike the energy tax title from the Foreign Sales Corporation bill. \nI recognize the need for a comprehensive energy policy and incentives \nfor alternative energy development. I also believe that the tax package \noffered by the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Montana was more \nbalanced than the energy tax title from the H.R. 6. energy conference \nreport. However, I am disappointed that the energy tax title in the \nFSC/ETI bill did not extend these tax credits in a more fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  I support many of the tax credits in this legislation, such as \nextension of the wind energy producer credit. The wind energy tax \ncredit is an important step in the continued effort to increase our \nenergy security and to decrease our reliance on carbon-based energy \nsources. Wisconsin has a lot to offer in this area. I support tradeable \ntax credits for rural cooperatives, and the other provisions that would \nspecifically benefit rural cooperatives and\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\nsmall renewable fuel producers. I also support many of the other \nprovisions that increase energy efficiency and promote renewable fuels \nand alternative energy sources.\n  The energy tax title as written, however, will cost from $15-20 \nbillion dollars. The oil and gas incentive section would cost taxpayers \n$6.5 billion and allows companies to deduct the costs of mineral \nexploration and marginal oil wells. The nuclear power incentives total \n$1 billion, and the so-called ``clean coal'' incentive is $2.2 billion. \nIn addition to these credits to mature industries, the ``non-\nconventional fuel credit'' that supports the synfuels industry and \ncoalbed methane industry would cost the taxpayers an additional $2.5 \nbillion. According to a Time magazine article entitled ``The Great \nEnergy Scam,'' some plants merely spray newly mined coal with diesel \nfuel or pine-tar resin to qualify for the synfuel tax credit. We also \nneed to consider the detrimental environmental impacts of these tax \nbreaks. A proposed coalbed methane project in Wyoming, for example, \ncould draw on 1 billion gallons of groundwater a day and would benefit \nfrom this provision.\n  I remain committed to supporting legislation to encourage alternative \nenergy research and production. In terms of overall energy policy, I \nbelieve we must develop cleaner, more efficient energy sources and \npromote conservation. We need a comprehensive energy policy, but it \nmust be balanced and fiscally responsible. I believe that we can meet \nthese goals, but unfortunately, this energy tax title falls short of \nthat goal. Therefore, I support the McCain amendment to strike it from \nthe bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5363-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5363-S5364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PROPOSED 90-DAY DELAY IN FEC RULEMAKING\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined on the floor today by my good \nfriend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, to speak briefly about a \nrecent recommendation by the general counsel of the Federal Election \nCommission, FEC, to delay the 527 rulemaking another 90 days. \nAdditionally, we would like to express support for an excellent \nbipartisan proposal by two members of the FEC to resolve the issue of \n527 groups spending illegal soft money to influence Federal elections. \nAs my colleagues know, the problem of 527 groups raising and spending \nsoft money has somehow become a very contentious and partisan issue. \nThat is unfortunate, because it need not be, and the Toner/Thomas \nproposal proves the point.\n  As my colleagues know, the general counsel of the FEC made a \nrecommendation yesterday to delay the 527 rulemaking which the \ncommission is to rule on tomorrow. This is a terrible idea. There is \nsimply no reason for the commission to continue fiddling while Rome \nburns. The commissioners need to decide the 527 issue tomorrow, on \nschedule, without more pointless delays. Everyday, 527 groups whose \npurpose is to influence the presidential election are breaking the law. \nThey are spending millions of dollars in soft money to influence \nFederal elections in plain violation of the Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1974, which the commission has failed to enforce for a \ngeneration. And these groups are now using the FEC inaction to blow a \nhole in the soft money ban upheld by the Supreme Court.\n  In the middle of an election cycle, the FEC is considering taking a \npass on the most critical issue on its plate. If they do, it will be \njust one more example of the agency's utter inability to enforce \nelection law. My colleague, Trent Lott, recently said he was \nconsidering hearings on FEC reform, and if this absurd delay happens, I \nthink we may be talking about hearings sooner rather than later. The \nFEC is responsible for the start of soft money in the first place. They \nmust not get away with it again.\n  This is particularly galling because the main reason the general \ncounsel office gives for its delay--the size and complexity of the \nrulemaking, and the possible impact on 501(c) organizations--is a \ncanard. There is an excellent, bipartisan proposal on the table from \nCommissioners Toner and Thomas that would deal with the 527s in a \nsimple, straightforward way. With their proposal, the commission has \nthe perfect opportunity to prove they can uphold the election laws that \nwere passed by Congress more than 25 years ago, signed by the \nPresident, and upheld by the Supreme Court. It may sound a little odd \nto be excited at the prospect of a Federal agency properly upholding \nexisting law, but in the case of the FEC, it would be something of a \nnew phenomenon.\n  There is absolutely nothing in the general counsel's rationale for \ndelaying action here that justifies refusing to act now to fix the \nFEC's absurd allocation regulations that are being used to spend 98 \npercent soft money to influence the presidential election. The general \ncounsel's recommendation provides no excuse for failing to act tomorrow \non the portion of the Toner/Thomas proposal that would fix the \nallocation rules and correct the FEC's mistake in adopting them, a \nmistake made clear by the Supreme Court decision McConnell v. FEC. The \nonly conclusion that can be reached if action to correct the allocation \nrules is rejected by the FEC is that the commission wants to protect \nand license the illegal use by 527 groups of soft money to finance \npartisan voter mobilization efforts to influence the 2004 presidential \nelection.\n\n   The bipartisan proposal by Commissioner Michael Toner, a Republican, \nand Commissioner Scott Thomas, a Democrat provides a clear, effective \nand immediate solution to the soft money problems that have arisen with \nthese 527 groups. The FEC is supposed to meet tomorrow to consider this \nproposal, and I strongly urge them to adopt the proposal and seize this \nopportunity to enforce the law.\n   First, I note that their proposal would explicitly apply only to 527 \npolitical committees, and not to 501(c) nonprofit groups, which should \ntake care of the concerns of those in the nonprofit community that the \nFEC would overreach, and affect their own important work. That is \nsimply no longer an issue, and the commission can act tomorrow, rather \nthan waiting around until a more convenient moment to enforce the law.\n   The Toner/Thomas proposal deals with what we believe to be the two \nmain problems with the 527 groups. First, their plan would fix the \ncommission's absurd allocation rules, which control the mix of soft and \nhard money these groups can spend. Under the current rules, 527s can \nsimply claim that they're involved in both Federal and State elections, \neven though they're obviously and admittedly clearly working for the \nsole purpose of defeating or electing a presidential candidate. That \nclaim, and the absurd FEC rules that currently exist, has led one such \n527 group to use 98 percent soft money for their partisan vote \nmobilization activities to influence the presidential election and only \n2 percent hard money. That is an obvious circumvention of the \nlongstanding Federal Election Campaign Act, FECA, as well as the new \nban on soft money in Federal elections, and a hole in the dike that \nabsolutely must be plugged.\n   The Toner/Thomas plan would deal with this by simply requiring \ngroups involved in partisan voter mobilization activities in Federal \nelections to use a minimum of 50 percent hard money to pay for those \nactivities. that straightforward, easy to understand rule will have the \neffect of substantially limiting the amount of soft money a 527 group \ncan use on these activities, and I believe it is an effective way to \ndeal with the problem at this time.\n   The second issue the two commissioners' plan would address is the \nuse of soft money by these 527 groups to run attack ads attacking and \npromoting presidential candidates. These groups are claiming that they \nare exempt from the normal Federal rules prohibiting the use of \nsoft money to fund such ads because they are not political committees \nunder FEC rules. In essence, these political organizations are claiming \nthat as long as their ads do not use words like ``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst,'' they can spend as much soft money as they please attacking \nand promoting Federal candidates.\n\n  That argument is simply absurd, even though the FEC's failure to \nproperly enforce the law has allowed it to gain currency over the \nyears. In order to qualify for their 527 tax status, these \norganizations have to meet the IRS test of being groups that are \n``organized and operated primarily'' to influence elections. And under \nthe Federal\n\n[[Page S5364]]\n\nElection Campaign Act, which has been around since 1974, groups that \nhave a primary purpose of influencing Federal elections and raise or \nspend $1,000 to do so have to register as political committees and \ncomply with Federal campaign finance laws. 527 political groups have \nsprung up in this election with the clear and sole purpose of \ninfluencing the presidential election. Under existing laws and Supreme \nCourt rulings these groups can run whatever ads they want--but they \nhave to register as Federal political committees and they do have to \nabide by the same Federal campaign finance rules as all other political \ncommittees and candidates have to play by, and pay for those ads with \nhard money.\n  The Toner/Thomas proposal clears up this issue by correctly deeming \nany organization operating as a political group under section 527 of \nthe tax code to have a ``major purpose'' of influencing Federal \nelections, unless the group falls within certain specified exemptions. \nThis common-sense approach simply corrects the FEC failure to properly \ninterpret the law in the past as it applies to 527 groups. It makes it \nclear that 527 political groups that have a major purpose to influence \nFederal elections and spend more than $1,000 to influence a Federal \nelection have to comply with Federal campaign finance rules, regardless \nof whether their communications contain express advocacy.\n  Again, we have a golden opportunity here to fix an emerging problem \nbefore it gets out of hand. The Commission should take this rare \nopportunity to show they can do their job in a bipartisan way. They \nshould approve the Toner/Thomas proposal on Thursday.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, like Senator McCain, I see this \nrulemaking on 527s quite simply as a test of the FEC's willingness to \nenforce the law. As we have noted many times, the Supreme Court in the \nMcConnell v. FEC decision concluded that the FEC improperly interpreted \nfederal election law and allowed the growth of the soft money loophole \nthat made necessary our 7-year reform effort.\n  We have been watching the agency closely since the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act was signed into law in March 2002, looking for \nsigns that it will not repeat its past mistakes. For the most part, we \nhave been sorely disappointed. The announcement yesterday that the FEC \ngeneral counsel's office wants the commission to delay action on the \nrulemaking for 90 days is the latest example of this agency's failure \nto carry out its responsibilities.\n  It is important to remember that the issues the FEC has been \nconsidering recently arise not under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \nthat we passed a few short years ago, but rather under the Federal \nElection Campaign Act of 1974. The question of whether an organization \nis a political committee subject to the Federal election laws is \nsometimes a complicated question, but it is not a new one.\n  The McConnell decision made it clear that the FEC's previous \napproach, which was to allow 527s to avoid registering as political \ncommittees if they didn't use ``express advocacy,'' was wrong. The FEC \nneeds to enforce the law so that groups whose major purpose is to \ninfluence Federal elections are subject to the Federal election laws.\n  I believe that when an organization tells the IRS that its primary \npurpose is to influence candidate elections in order to qualify for 527 \nstatus, it should not in most cases be able to turn around and tell the \nFEC that its major purpose is not to influence elections. To me, that \njust doesn't make sense.\n  It is unfortunate that the FEC initially approached this issue in a \nway that frightened legislative advocacy groups into thinking that they \nmight become political committees and have to completely change their \nfundraising and operations. It is also unfortunate that the nonprofit \ncommunity in opposing the erroneous FEC proposals took the position \nthat nothing should be done about 527s that are very much involved in \nelection activities but are seeking to operate outside of the election \nlaws.\n  Senator McCain and I, working with Representatives Shays and Meehan, \nour reform partners in the House, filed comments with the FEC arguing \nthat there are narrow and targeted things that the FEC should do to \nprotect the integrity of the election laws, without affecting \nlegitimate 501(c)s. A bipartisan proposal announced recently by \nCommissioners Michael Toner and Scott Thomas takes this approach.\n  The Toner-Thomas proposal addresses only 527 organizations. It does \nnot change the regulations that apply to 501(c)s. In addition, the \nproposal would change the allocation rules that apply to 527s that have \nboth a Federal and a nonfederal account. It simply cannot be a correct \ninterpretation of the law that an organization that has publicly \ndeclared that it will carry out partisan voter mobilization activities \nin battleground states this fall can use 98 percent soft money to pay \nfor those activities. The Toner-Thomas proposal would require that at \nleast half of the expenditures on these activities come from a hard \nmoney account. That certainly makes sense given that the groups \nthemselves proclaim that their purpose is to influence the presidential \nelection.\n  But now, the FEC's general counsel has proposed that the FEC delay \nits vote on the rulemaking for 90 days. This will only assure that the \nFEC will do nothing about 527s until after the 2004 elections. That is \nnot an acceptable result. It is crucial that the FEC act now. It should \nadopt the Toner-Thomas proposal, but at the very least, it should \nmodify the allocation rules applicable to 527s doing voter \nmobilization. There is absolutely no reason to postpone action on that \nissue.\n  I hope that some day it will not be a cause for celebration when the \nagency charged with enforcing the election laws look like it might \nactually do its job. Unfortunately, the FEC has not been an effective \nagency, and this latest proposed delay only confirms that it may not be \nup to the task that Congress has given it. Senator McCain and I have \nintroduced legislation to replace the FEC with a very different \nregulatory agency. I was pleased to read this week that the chairman of \nthe Rules Committee agrees that the Senate should take a very hard look \nat the FEC and consider legislation to fundamentally change it.\n  For now, however, we will be watching closely to see how the FEC \ndeals with the challenge of the 527s. I once again commend the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his dedication to this cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5364-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5364-S5366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HEALTH CARE AND THE UNINSURED\n\n  Mr.VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the dilemma \nthis Nation is facing regarding access to quality, affordable health \ncare. Next to the economy, it is the greatest domestic challenge facing \nour Nation. In fact, the rising cost of health care is a major part of \nwhat is hurting our competitiveness in the global marketplace.\n  Throughout my career in public service, health care has been one of \nmy top legislative priorities. Unfortunately, despite increased \nspending on public and private health care programs, millions of \nAmericans are without health care coverage. Although, my State of Ohio \nhas one of the lowest percentages of uninsured.\n  The statistics are overwhelming. For the fourth year in a row, health \ncare spending grew faster than the rest of the U.S. economy in 2003. \nThe average cost of family coverage was $9,018, with employees covering \n27 percent, or $2,412, of the cost. During that same period of time, \nthe average family's contribution to their health insurance increased \n16 percent.\n  Total spending on health care is now approximately $1.6 trillion or \n$5,440 for every man, woman and child in the United States, which \ntranslates into almost 15 percent of our GDP--the largest share ever.\n  If we look at this in an international context, the statistics become \neven more glaring. Per capita health care spending in the United States \ncontinues to exceed other nations. In its May 2004 issue, ``Health \nAffairs'' reports that the Swiss spent only 68 percent as much as the \nUnited States per capita on health care in 2001. Even more troubling, \nCanada spent as little as 57 percent as much as the U.S. Both nations \nhave a lower number of uninsured citizens than the United States.\n  Despite all the spending some 44 million Americans--15 percent of the \npopulation--had no health insurance at some point last year. This \nnumber has increased steadily. In 2000, that number\n\n[[Page S5365]]\n\nwas 39.8 million. In 2002 it was 43.6 million. In 2 years, the country \nadded almost four million uninsured individuals.\n  Just this week, the Cincinnati Enquirer told the story of Yolanda \nWebb, who left her Hamilton County, OH, job to begin her own cosmetic \nbusiness. However, after opening her own shop, she realized that due to \na chronic condition she was diagnosed with 20 years ago, a health \ninsurance policy would cost her $800 a month. Unfortunately, this is an \nexpense she can not afford and as a result, Ms. Webb is one of the \n200,000 people in just the greater Cincinnati area that lives without \nhealth insurance coverage.\n  In addition, with increased costs, employers are facing difficult \noptions. A poll of over 3,200 employers conducted by the Kaiser Family \nFoundation indicates that 56 percent of large firms increased \nemployees' share of health costs in 2001. I have consistently heard \nfrom employers throughout Ohio that they want to continue to offer \nhealth insurance for their employees, but it hurts their ability to be \ncompetitive in the global market.\n  In light of these startling statistics, I was eager to join my \ncolleagues on the Senate Republican Health Care Task Force to provide \nsome solutions for dealing with these trends.\n  I have been in this situation before. As Governor of Ohio, I had to \nwork creatively to expand coverage and deal with increasing health care \ncosts for a growing number of uninsured Ohioans. I am happy to report \nthat we were able to make some progress toward reducing the number of \nuninsured during my time as the head of the State by negotiating with \nthe state unions to move to managed care; by controlling Medicaid costs \nto the point where from 1995 to 1998, due to good stewardship and \nmanagement, Ohio ended up under-spending on Medicaid without harming \nfamilies; and implementing the S-CHIP program to provide coverage for \nuninsured children. In fact, I recently learned from the Cuyahoga \nCommissioners that in our county, 98 percent of eligible children are \ncurrently enrolled in this program.\n  Learning from this experience, I was especially encouraged by Senator \nFrist and Senator Gregg's commitment to solving the national health \ncare crisis and applaud their decision to form the Senate task force to \nexplore the issue. I am convinced that my colleagues and I have been \nable to identify some very viable and immediate solutions for reversing \nthe trend of the growing uninsured and for dealing with the rapid \nincrease in the cost of quality health care coverage.\n  We can make this a reality by addressing the underlying factors that \nare contributing to dramatic increase in health care costs and the \nsubsequent reduction in access to quality care. I have worked hard in \nthe past on this issue, and am pleased that the package the task force \nreleased this week addresses the biggest factors driving health care \ncosts.\n  The first is medical lawsuit reform. I have been concerned about this \nissue for quite some time--in fact, since my days as Governor of Ohio. \nI wish we had the outpouring of support for medical liability reform \nsix years ago that I see now. In 1996, I essentially had to pull teeth \nin the Ohio Legislature to pass my tort reform bill.\n  I signed it into law in October 1996. Three years later, the Ohio \nSupreme Court ruled it unconstitutional, and if that law had withstood \nthe Supreme Court's scrutiny, Ohioans wouldn't be facing the medical \naccess problems they are facing today: doctors leaving their practice, \npatients unable to receive the care they need and costs of health \ninsurance going through the roof.\n  Continuing down this path, during my time in the Senate, I worked \nwith the American Tort Reform Association to produce a study that \ncaptured the impact of this crisis on Ohio's economy. In Ohio, the \nlitigation crisis costs every Ohioan $636 per year, and every Ohio \nfamily of four $2,544 per year. These are alarming numbers! In these \neconomic times, families can not afford to pay $2,500 for the lawsuit \nabuse of a few individuals.\n  The Medical Liability Monitor ranked Ohio among the top five States \nfor premium increases in 2002. OHIC Insurance Co., among the largest \nmedical liability insurers in the State, reports that average premiums \nfor Ohio doctors have doubled over the last 3 years.\n  In a very real sense, I have heard from young physicians in Ohio who \ntell me they are considering relocating to a place where the ability to \npractice medicine is better and the liability situation is more stable. \nA friend of mine shared with me a letter from an OB-GYN in Dublin, OH, \nwho had decided to retire from his practice. He wrote the following to \nhis patients:\n\n       On June 17, 2003, I received my professional liability \n     insurance rate quote for the upcoming year, and it is 64% \n     higher than last year's rate. I have seen my premiums almost \n     triple during the past two years, despite never having had a \n     single penny paid out on my behalf in twenty seven years as a \n     physician. Even worse, during this time the insurance company \n     has reduced the amount of coverage that I can purchase from \n     $5 million to only $1 million, while jury verdicts have \n     skyrocketed, often exceeding $3-4 million. If I were to \n     purchase this policy, I would be putting all of my family's \n     personal assets at risk every time that I delivered a baby or \n     performed surgery. I refuse to do that.\n       I have therefore decided to retire from private practice on \n     July 31, 2003, the final day of my current liability \n     insurance policy. This is not a decision that I take lightly, \n     but unfortunately it has become necessary. For many of you, I \n     have been part of your life for years. I have delivered your \n     babies, and helped you through some of life's most difficult \n     challenges. It has truly been an honor.''\n\n  And for those of my colleagues who think medical liability reform is \na State issue, I would ask them to read a letter, which I submitted for \nthe record on February 24, 2004, and see how the medical liability \ncrisis transcends State lines--particularly my friends from the \nneighboring state of West Virginia. Our Ohio physicians, who practice \nalong the border, are feeling the effects of their proximity to West \nVirginia and its favorable plaintiff's verdicts. They are feeling these \neffects in their increasing insurance premiums. And unfortunately, \nOhio's physicians are not alone.\n  And it is not only doctors crossing State borders to find better \ninsurance rates--it is patients as well. Citizens living along the \nthousands of miles of State borders very often obtain their medical \ncare across that line. Federal action is appropriate and critically \nnecessary. Even more so because this crisis affects Federal health care \nprograms, including Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Overall, the cost of this crisis to the economy is quite staggering. \nThere is evidence that physicians are now practicing medicine \n``defensively'' in order to protect themselves from lawsuits. In fact, \na March 3, 2003 report by the Department of Health and Human Services \ncalculated the practice of defensive medicine costs the United States a \ntotal of between $70-126 billion a year and estimates that the cost for \nthe Federal Government alone is between $35 and $56 billion.\n  As a cosponsor of the HEALTH Act, the Patients First Act, The Healthy \nMothers and Babies Access to Care Act, and the Pregnancy and Trauma \nCare Access Protection Act, I will continue to work with my colleagues \nto find a way strike a delicate balance between the rights of aggrieved \nparties to bring lawsuits and receive rapid and fair compensation and \nthe rights of society to be protected against frivolous lawsuits and \noutrageous rewards for noneconomic damages that are disproportionate to \ncompensating the injured and made at the expense of society as a whole.\n  We can no longer allow unchecked, excessive litigation to continue to \ndrive up the cost of health care and limit access for so many \nAmericans.\n  Beyond medical lawsuit reform, the task force has identified another \nway to limit the rapid increase in health care costs, that is to reduce \nregulations and paperwork requirements that burden out nation's health \ncare providers.\n  Whether due to Federal privacy regulations or insurance requirements, \nthis is an important issue to providers in Ohio. Last November, I \nvisited a small hospital in the southern part of my State, Marietta \nMemorial Hospital, to discuss health care reform. At this meeting, I \nspent some time discussing the administrative process the hospital was \nrequired to follow in order to treat the patients that come through \ntheir doors each day.\n\n[[Page S5366]]\n\n  The hospital provided me with a binder full of paperwork that was \ncompleted, in this case, for a total hip replacement procedure on an \nelderly patient. As you can see, Mr. President, this 72 page binder is \nfull of more than 50 forms that either the hospital or the patient and \ntheir family were required to complete, some time multiple times, in \norder to for the patient to receive treatment.\n  This is a big enough challenge for large hospital groups, but for \nsmall providers like Marietta Memorial with just 204 beds and 90 \nphysicians, this paperwork and regulatory demand can be crippling.\n  For this reason, I worked with the task force to include in our \nreform package ways to limit bureaucratic demands. We believe that this \ncould save our Nation approximately $47 billion without risking patient \nsafety, privacy or the quality of health care.\n  In addition, the task force found that there were ways to increase \nhospital's and provider's use of technology to lower their costs and \neliminate duplicative test and procedures. Fortunately, President Bush \nhas taken a huge step forward in this area and has created a new \nposition at the Department of Health and Human Services to coordinate \nthe Nation's health information technology efforts. I am pleased that \nSecretary Thompson recognized the importance of and the immediate need \nto develop standards that help to create electronic medical records and \nother technology efforts.\n  I have no doubt these standards when implemented will help improve \nquality and cost efficiency of care and will eventually help hospitals, \nespecially smaller hospitals like Marietta Memorial, reduce duplicative \ncosts and services to their patients and improve the quality of the \ncare they can provide.\n  These are only some of the ways we can act immediately to put an end \nto the increase in health care costs and reduce the number of Americans \nthat find themselves without quality health care coverage.\n  However, these are steps that will only provide interim relief.\n  Like I said, health care reform has always been one of my top \npriorities and I have been studying this issue for some time. In the \npast 2 years, I have met with experts and other interested parties to \nget the full picture of the state of health care in the United States \nand learn about possible efforts for reform. I have discussed reform \nproposals with individuals as diverse as former Ohio Congressman Bill \nGradison to John Sweeney, President of the AFL-CIO to Dr. Donald \nPalmisano, President of the American Medical Association, to Stuart \nButler with the Heritage Foundation.\n  And over the past year and a half, I have been traveling throughout \nmy State of Ohio and have held 14 roundtables to specifically discuss \nhealth care reform with employers and employees, business and labor \nleaders, the uninsured and the underinsured.\n  In fact, in Ohio I have even formed my own health care task force \nmade up of representatives from physician and other provider groups, \nsmall and large employers, labor, policy experts, and others who have \nan interest in reforming our current health care environment. Together \nwe have analyzed a variety of popular health care reform proposals to \nincrease access to health insurance coverage. And what I have heard \neven from my most conservative friends--is that this health care system \nis broken.\n  People are telling me we need to think about plowing new ground. I \nagree and believe we have to reevaluate the way we are spending the \n$1.6 trillion that is dedicated to health care in this county. We need \nto look at the big picture and determine how we can realign our system \nto more efficiently provide quality health care that maintains choices \nand responsibility for consumers.\n  This, of course, will not happen overnight and, as a result, I am \nencouraged by and supportive of some of the interim and immediate \nsolutions proposed by the Senate Task Force. My colleagues and I have \ntaken a step in the right direction toward identifying immediate \nchanges that will bring down the prices people are paying for their \nhealth care today, help those who have insurance retain it at \nreasonable rates, and expand access to affordable insurance for those \nwho are currently uninsured and underinsured.\n  Should I have the opportunity to serve my fellow Ohioans for an \nadditional 6 years, reforming our Nation's health care system will be \nmy highest priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5366-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5366-S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am proud today to cosponsor S. \n2411, the Assistance to Firefighters Act of 2004. This legislation, \nintroduced by my colleagues Senators Dodd and DeWine, would reauthorize \nthe FIRE Act grant program through 2010, as well as make a number of \nimprovements to the existing program. This legislation will improve the \nability of firefighters across to the country to do their jobs more \nsafely and effectively.\n  Four years ago, I was proud to be an original cosponsor of the \nFirefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act, which has \ngenerated nearly $2 billion in grants since the program was enacted. It \nhas provided critical dollars enabling fire departments to pay for the \npurchase of new equipment, to better train their personnel, and to \nestablish fire prevention campaigns. Although this is a notable step \nforward, in West Virginia, and throughout the country, fire departments \nremain seriously underfunded. I hope my colleagues will agree that much \nmore needs to be done before we can feel comfortable about the level of \npreparedness of our firefighters.\n  In West Virginia, almost every single one of our approximately 460 \nfire departments is undermanned and without the necessary equipment \nthey need to do their jobs. I worry, as I'm sure many of my colleagues \ndo, that communities could find themselves in the unacceptable position \nof being ill-prepared to respond to an emergency. Very few towns and \ncities in West Virginia can afford to hire and train more firefighters, \nor to purchase new firefighting equipment without additional Federal \nassistance.\n  I will bet most of my colleagues would be surprised at the number of \nvolunteers who currently make up the majority of our Nation's fire \nservice. Volunteers compose nearly 75 percent of all firefighters \nnationwide. That percentage is much higher in rural States like West \nVirginia, where 95 percent of our firefighting personnel are \nvolunteers. We rely on firefighters in most communities to assist us \nnot only to put out fires, but also in cases of natural disasters, car \naccidents, hazardous material spills, and this mostly volunteer fire \nservice would be called upon to respond to any acts of terrorism that \nmight occur. Additional firefighters are needed, as well as an \nimmediate infusion of new and better equipment so that they can do \ntheir jobs more effectively. Currently there are not enough portable \nradios or breathing apparatus equipment, and many departments lack the \nresources needed for proper vehicle maintenance. Reauthorizing the FIRE \nAct grant program will allow fire departments to hire more full-time \npersonnel and further alleviate the costs of maintaining up-to-date \nequipment and training.\n  After 4 years, there are many facets of the program that need \nupdating to reflect the learning process both Congress and the Fire \nService we have undergone. This bill would make several improvements to \nthe existing law that reflect the changing nature of the world we live \nin today and acknowledge that there are better and more efficient ways \nto administer the program. The measure would align the FIRE Act with \nnew standards in Federal emergency management put in place since the \ncreation of the Department of Homeland Security. It also lowers the \nmatching funds requirement by a third for fire departments serving \ncommunities of 50,000 residents, and cut requirements in half for \ncommunities of 20,000 people or fewer, in order to lessen current \nbudget strains. It would also open up funding to nonprofit Emergency \nMedical Service units not affiliated with fire departments. Right now, \nonly EMS units attached to fire departments are eligible for funding. \nThis provision in particular will improve the safety and security of \nWest Virginians, where many of our EJMS units are independent of the \nlocal fire department.\n  I agree with the statements that have been made by virtually every \nMember of Congress that the world we\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\nlive in today sits in stark contrast to that of the one we knew prior \nto the tragedies of September 11, 2001. Probably no group knows this \nbetter than the dedicated firefighters who place themselves in harm's \nway every time they respond to a call. Fortunately, we have an \nopportunity here to demonstrate that we recognize the importance of the \nwork these firefighters do, and help them to protect us by quickly \nenacting this bill.\n  The Assistance to Firefighters Act of 2004 would translate directly \ninto saved lives and will increase the safety of West Virginians and \nAmericans in communities across this country. I encourage my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5367-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MUTUAL FUND REFORM ACT OF 2004\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Fitzgerald, and several other members of the Senate \nin sponsoring S. 2059, the Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004.\n  Mutual funds traditionally have been seen as safe havens for long-\nterm investments. This perception of mutual funds as secure investment \nvehicles has certainly contributed to the industry's grow. Two decades \nago, the mutual fund industry was relatively small; only a small \npercentage of Americans invested in mutual funds, and the assets of the \nindustry were $115 billion. Today, the mutual fund industry has $7.5 \ntrillion in assets, over 90 million investors, and more than 10,000 \nfunds.\n  Unfortunately, as the industry has grown, some mutual fund managers \nand boards of directors have ignored their most basic role as \nfiduciaries. Recent State and Federal investigations have revealed \ntrading irregularities at several of funds, including many that are \nwell known. These scandals have shed light on the disregard shown by \nmany mutual fund managers and directors for the individuals who invest \ntheir hard-earned money in mutual funds. They have also drawn attention \nto inflated mutual fund fees that often are not in the best interests \nof mutual fund shareholders and too frequently are not properly \ndisclosed to such shareholders.\n  The Mutual Fund Reform Act would improve the integrity of the mutual \nfund industry by restoring investors' trust in the mutual fund managers \nand boards that are responsible for investing much of our citizens' \nhousehold, college, and retirement savings. Most importantly, the act \nwould strengthen the governance of mutual funds by, among other things, \nensuring that mutual fund company boards would be truly independent and \nempowered. In addition, the act would establish disclosure requirements \ndesigned to provide mutual fund investors with a clearer picture of \nfund management and fund fees.\n  I thank Senator Fitzgerald for introducing this important bill, and I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation in order to further \nencourage investor confidence in the mutual fund industry and in our \ncapital markets.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5367-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n   (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                           WHY WE'RE IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I recently wrote a guest column on ``Why \nWe're in Iraq'' for The State in Columbia, SC. I want to share it with \nmy colleagues, and ask that the May 7 article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n                         ``Why We're in Iraq''\n\n                         (By Ernest F. Hollings)\n\n        With 760 dead in Iraq and more than 3,000 maimed for life, \n     folks continue to argue over why we are in Iraq--and how to \n     get out.\n       Now everyone knows what was not the cause of this war. Even \n     President Bush acknowledges that Saddam Hussein had nothing \n     to do with 9/11. Listing the 45 countries where al Qaeda was \n     operating on Sept. 11 (70 cells in the United States), the \n     State Department did not list Iraq.\n       Richard Clarke, in ``Against All Enemies,'' tells how the \n     United States had not received any threat of terrorism for 10 \n     years from Saddam at the time of our invasion. On page 231, \n     John McLaughlin of the CIA verifies this to Paul Wolfowitz. \n     In 1993 President Clinton responded to Saddam's attempt on \n     the life of President George Herbert Walker Bush by putting a \n     missile down Saddam's intelligence headquarters in Baghdad. \n     Not a big kill, but Saddam got the message: Monkey around \n     with the United States and a missile lands on his head.\n       Of course there were no weapons of mass destruction. \n     Israel's intelligence, Mossad, knows what's going on in Iraq. \n     It is the best. It has to know; Israel's survival depends on \n     knowing. Israel long since would have taken us to the weapons \n     of mass destruction if there were any, or if they had been \n     removed. With Iraq no threat, why invade a sovereign country? \n     The answer: President Bush's policy to secure Israel.\n       Led by Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz and Charles \n     Krauthammer, for years there has been a domino school of \n     thought that the way to guarantee Israel's security is to \n     spread democracy in the area. Wolfowitz wrote: ``The United \n     States may not be able to lead countries through the door of \n     democracy, but where that door is locked shut by a \n     totalitarian deadbolt, American power may be the only way to \n     open it up.'' And on another occasion: Iraq as ``the first \n     Arab democracy . . . would cast a very large shadow, starting \n     with Syria and Iran but across the whole Arab world.''\n       Three weeks before invasion President Bush stated: ``A new \n     regime in Iraq would serve as a dramatic and inspiring \n     example for freedom for other nations in the region.''\n       Every president since 1947 has made a futile attempt to \n     help Israel negotiate peace. But no leadership has surfaced \n     among the Palestinians that can make a binding agreement. \n     President Bush realized his chances at negotiation were no \n     better. He came to office imbued with one thought--re-\n     election. Bush felt tax cuts would hold his crowd together \n     and spreading democracy in the Mideast to secure Israel would \n     take the Jewish vote from the Democrats.\n       You don't come to town and announce your Israel policy is \n     to invade Iraq. But George W. Bush, as stated by former \n     Secretary Paul O'Neill and others, started laying the \n     groundwork to invade Iraq days after inauguration. And, \n     without any Iraq connection to 9/11, within weeks he had the \n     Pentagon outlining a plan to invade Iraq. He was determined.\n       President Bush thought taking Iraq would be easy. Wolfowitz \n     said it would take only seven days. Cheney believed we would \n     be greeted as liberators. But Cheney's man, Ahmed Chalabi, \n     made a mess of the de-Baathification of Iraq by dismissing \n     Republican Guard leadership and Sunni leaders, who soon \n     joined with the insurgents.\n       Worst of all, we tried to secure Iraq with too few troops. \n     In 1966 in South Vietnam with a population of 16.5 million, \n     Gen. William C. Westmoreland with 535,000 U.S. troops was \n     still asking for more. In Iraq with a population of 24.6 \n     million, Gen. John Abizaid with only 135,000 troops can \n     barely secure the troops, much less the country. If the \n     troops are there to fight, they are too few. If there to die, \n     they are too many.\n        To secure Iraq we need more troops at least 100,000 more. \n     The only way to get the United Nations back in Iraq is to \n     make the country secure. Once back, the French, Germans and \n     others will join with the United Nations to take over.\n        With President Bush's domino policy in the Mideast gone \n     awry, he keeps shouting ``War on Terror.'' Terrorism is a \n     method, not a war. We don't call the Crimean War, with the \n     Charge of the Light Brigade, the Cavalry War. Or World War II \n     the Blitzkrieg War. There is terrorism in Ireland against the \n     Brits. There is terrorism in India and in Pakistan. In the \n     Mideast, terrorism is a separate problem to be defeated by \n     diplomacy and negotiation, not militarily.\n        Here, might does not make right--right makes might. Acting \n     militarily, we have created more terrorism than we have \n     eliminated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5367-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5367-S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BOYD STEWART: IN MEMORIUM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I honor and share with my \ncolleagues the memory of a very special man, Boyd Stewart of Marin \nCounty, who died April 17, 2004. He was 101 years old.\n  Boyd Stewart was born at the Old Cottage Hospital in San Rafael in \n1903. He grew up in a time when students rode horses to school. His \nfamily ran a cattle ranch in Nicasio and then moved it to Olema while \nBoyd was growing up. After 3 years at Stanford University, he came back \nto the ranch when his father passed away and managed it for the rest of \nhis adult life.\n  Boyd Stewart deeply felt the need to preserve open space for future \ngenerations, and he knew it could be done in a way that was compatible \nwith agriculture. He was instrumental in the creation of Point Reyes \nNational Seashore and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. \nConcerned about the loss of farmland to urban development, in the 1960s \nhe advocated the controversial idea that the Federal Government buy \nWest Marin ranches for inclusion in the park and lease them back to the \nranchers. His family's ranch transferred ownership to the National Park \nService in 1970.. For decades he remained committed to his\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\nconvictions, often in the face of opposition from powerful forces.\n  Mr. Stewart served as a leading member of the Marin County Farm \nBureau for more than 80 years. He also sat on the boards of the West \nMarin Chamber of Commerce and the Marin Humane Society. A cattle \nrancher by profession, he was given the Marin Humane Society's Humane \nMan of the Century award. Two years ago, Boyd Stewart was honored with \nthe California Excellence in Range Management Award, along with his \ndaughter, Jo Ann Stewart, and his granddaughter, Amanda Wisby, who \ncontinue to run the Stewart family ranch today.\n  Boyd was a dynamic figure in West Marin. My staff and I always knew \nwe could call on him for invaluable information and sound advice. He \nwas the leading expert on West Marin agriculture, to whom agriculture \ncommissioners turned for advice and information. His presence and his \naccomplishments in preserving Marin open space were greater than any \nother single person in Marin County in the last century. He was also a \ndeeply-loved member of the Marin community and a wonderful, unique man \nwith a clear mind and steady presence who will be deeply missed. We \ntake comfort in knowing that countless future generations will benefit \nfrom his courage, his vision and his leadership. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5368-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5368]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATIONS TO KEVIN CONWAY\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Prior to his work at Rural/Metro \nAmbulance, Mr. Conway was an Army Ranger. After his completion of \nactive duty, he joined the Army Reserve as a senior drill sergeant.\n  The citizens of Kentucky are fortunate to have the leadership of \nKevin Conway. His example of dedication, hard work, and compassion \nshould be an inspiration to all throughout the Commonwealth. He has my \nmost sincere appreciation for this work, and I look forward to his \ncontinued service to Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5368-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5368-S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CHEMISTS WORKING COOPERATIVELY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my \ncolleagues news of a truly historic conference of Middle Eastern \nchemists held December 6 through 11, 2003, in Malta. Chemists from \nEgypt, Iran, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Palestinian \nAuthority, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates gathered in \nMalta to attend the conference, which was entitled: ``Frontiers of \nChemical Sciences: Research and Education in the Middle East.'' The \nconference was chaired by Dr. Zafra Lerman of Columbia College Chicago. \nThe purpose of the conference was to bring scientists from Middle \nEastern countries together under the same roof to work on different \nissues of common concern.\n  The Malta Conference was a phenomenal success. The multinational \nexchange of ideas and information led to the creation of new \npartnerships in the areas of science and education. The conference was \nso effective that all the participants involved agreed upon the need \nfor a second conference, tentatively scheduled for 2005.\n  The Malta Conference permitted participating scientists to address \nimportant scientific issues pertinent to the future of the Middle East, \nbut it did more than that. All areas within the Middle East were \nrepresented, demonstrating there are some issues that can bring \neveryone together around a common goal of improving our world and \nsociety. This meeting reinforced the fact that the advancement of \nscientific research and education are vital forces for all nations of \nthe world, and it demonstrated that science and education can help \nnations that are distrustful of each other to reach across borders and \nwork cooperatively to address common concerns.\n  The conference chairperson, Dr. Lerman, is the distinguished \nProfessor of Science and Public Policy and head of the Institute for \nScience Education and Science Communication at Columbia College \nChicago. Dr. Lerman received her Ph.D. in chemistry from the Weizmann \nInstitute of Science in Israel. She founded and chaired the Department \nof Science and Mathematics at Columbia College, where she developed an \ninnovative approach to teaching science to non-science majors which \nreceived international recognition. Dr. Lerman is active professionally \nwith national and international associations in the fields of science, \nscience education, and scientific freedom and human rights. For 15 \nyears, she has chaired the national American Chemical Society \nSubcommittee on Scientific Freedom and Human Rights. She also serves as \nVice-Chair for Chemistry for the Board of the Committee of Concerned \nScientists and chairs the International Activities Committee of the \nAmerican Chemical Society, in addition to numerous other positions.\n  Dr. Lerman has received the Presidential Award for Excellence in \nScience, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring and is a 1998 Kilby \nAward Laureate for extraordinary contributions to society through \nscience, technology, invention, innovation, and education. In February \n2001, she was elected a Fellow of the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Dr. Lerman and \nthe organizers and delegates of the conference for their superb work. \nThis event serves as a shining example of the progress available to \nnations that make the effort to promote understanding and cooperation.\n  I ask that Dr. Lerman's summary of the conference be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The summary follows.\n\n                       Summary of Malta Conference\n\n        From 6 to 11 December, 2003, chemists from Egypt, Iran, \n     Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestinian Authorities, \n     Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and United Arab Emirates gathered in \n     Malta to attend the conference ``Frontiers of Chemical \n     Sciences: Research and Education in the Middle East.''\n        The success of this conference tells us that science and \n     scientific research are not just methods of improving the \n     human condition but can also be ways of crossing illusive \n     national and political barriers that bar effective \n     collaboration among neighbors. The invited participants \n     included presidents of universities, members of the \n     respective countries' national academies of science, and a \n     former minister of science. By engaging a stunning array of \n     world-class scientists from the Middle East, as well as \n     selected scientists from England, France, Germany, South \n     Africa, Taiwan, and the U.S., the resulting discussion \n     broadly enriched our understanding of specific scientific \n     issues important to the area's future. The fact that all \n     segments of the Middle East were represented suggests that \n     there are fundamental scientific issues that connect us all.\n        Six Nobel Laureates served as working group leaders on \n     subjects of common interest to Middle Eastern countries. The \n     subjects of these working groups included: ``Environment, \n     Water and Renewable Energy,'' ``Research and New \n     Methodologies in Science Education,'' ``Cultural Heritage and \n     Preservation of Antiquities,'' ``The Use of the Synchrotron \n     to Facilitate Research in the Middle East (SESAME Project),'' \n     among others. Participants committed themselves to continue \n     working together after the conference via e-mail and through \n     smaller regional meetings. Among suggestions offered for \n     future topics were: nanotechnology, computational chemistry, \n     and solar energy.\n        All participants wrote that the conference organization \n     was excellent, that the conference exceeded their \n     expectations, and that the opportunity to work with the Nobel \n     laureates was especially appreciated and it led to \n     stimulating and informed discussion. 100% of the participants \n     felt that a second conference, probably in 2005, would be \n     needed. All indicated that they would want to attend and that \n     they would recommend it to their colleagues. Most expressed \n     willingness to participate in the organization of such an \n     event.\n        A joint proposal between Israeli and Palestinian \n     participants in the Malta conference was written on water \n     purification and submitted to USAID-MERC.\n        One of the conference working groups, which concentrated \n     on the synchrotron being built in Jordan (supported by \n     UNESCO) for all the Middle East scientists, raised the urgent \n     need for scientists trained in the use of a synchrotron. \n     Dr. Yuan T. Lee, the Nobel Laureate who is science advisor \n     to\n\n[[Page S5369]]\n\n     the President of Taiwan, offered during the conference \n     three full scholarships for scientists from the Middle \n     East to spend a year learning to use the synchrotron in \n     Taiwan. An agreement is already signed, and the selection \n     of the three Middle Eastern scientists is in progress.\n       The President of the Technion (Israel Institute of \n     Technology) offered to provide three full Technion \n     scholarships for any interested student from an Arabic \n     country.\n       A group of Palestinian participants met in February with \n     their Israeli colleagues in the Weizmann Institute of \n     Science. As a result, an agreement was signed for Palestinian \n     students to study for MSc and PhD at the Weizmann Institute \n     of Science; a committee is now working on financial \n     arrangements needed to run the program.\n       One of the Israeli participants has been invited to present \n     a lecture in Egypt. All the Egyptian participants expressed \n     their interest in attending his lecture; some extended \n     additional invitations for him to visit and present seminars \n     at their institutions.\n       Dr. Roald Hoffmann, one of the American Nobel laureates, \n     offered to run an intensive workshop in a Middle East \n     location for graduate students from all the participating \n     countries. This idea was accepted quite favorably by the \n     participants; the location is now being discussed.\n       Ultimately, all the participants agreed that science is, \n     indeed, a shared language between them all, and that the \n     things they have in common are more numerous than the \n     differences that separate them. The desire among the \n     participants to continue the collaborations and to meet again \n     is proof that the conference succeeded in overcoming barriers \n     heretofore perceived as insurmountable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5369-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SISTER JEANNE O'LAUGHLIN\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I honor a wonderful \nleader and inspirational person, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin. Sister \nJeanne is retiring as President of Barry University in Miami Shores, \nFL, after more than 20 years as its president and more than 50 years as \nan educator. Under her tenure the student population at Barry more than \nquadrupled and became co-ed and diverse, the budget grew tenfold, the \ncampus added 38 new buildings and Barry became the fourth largest \nprivate university in Florida.\n  But, Sister Jeanne is more than just a president or professor, she is \na fixture of the Miami community, a tireless advocate for the indigent \nand less fortunate and a prolific fundraiser. She has been honored by \nthe Pope and selected for Presidential Commissions. She was the first \nfemale member of the Orange Bowl Committee and the Non-Group, chaired \nthe Victory Foundation for the Homeless, the Miami Coalition for a Safe \nand Drug-Free Community, the Religious Task Force for We Will Rebuild \nand the Miami Blue-Ribbon Aviation Panel. And in the name of Barry \nUniversity she would take on any challenge or bet even if it meant \nsinging and dancing.\n  When important decisions or events were happening in Miami she was \nthere. Many will remember that she rescued three Chinese women from \npolitical prosecution and pushed for 14 months for their political \nasylum request to be accepted.\n  Her tireless devotion to Barry, her infectious spirit and devotion to \nmaking the world a better place one good deed at a time, make Sister \nJeanne a truly remarkable person. I am honored to know her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5369-2", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DuPONT DeLISLE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this month DuPont Chemical and the \npeople of the Mississippi Gulf Coast region together celebrate the 25th \nanniversary of the DuPont Chemical Plant in DeLisle, MS. DuPont began \nmanufacturing in DeLisle in 1979 and in 1991 underwent an expansion. \nThe plant now employs over 1,000 people who are residents of both \nMississippi and Louisiana. These employees are the No. 1 reason the \nplant has achieved some very impressive production rates. In fact, its \nhigh productivity levels have made the DuPont DeLisle plant the second \nlargest titanium dioxide producing plant in the world. This is truly \ncause for the plant's employees, management and all local residents to \nbe proud.\n   The plant's success over the past 25 years is directly attributable \nto the partnership between DuPont DeLisle and the city of DeLisle, the \nMississippi gulf coast region, and the State of Mississippi. The local \ncommunity and State maintain a strong interest in supporting the plant \nand ensuring its continued success, while the plant and its employees \nwork to give back to and improve the local community. For example, over \nthe years DuPont DeLisle and its employees have worked in cooperation \nwith the Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College to offer extensive \non-site operator training in electrical, machine shop, and computer \nskills. In addition, employees have conducted American Red Cross blood \ndrives and United Way campaigns, donated equipment to local schools and \nfire departments, and participated in State and local organizations \nthat are focused on improving Mississippi's workforce.\n   In addition to their work in the community, the plant's employees \nhave strived to make it the best. As a result, the plant today is the \ntop performer in its business group organization. DuPont DeLisle also \nwork 4 times more safely than comparable industrial plants in the \nchemical industry using OSHA measurements. In fact, in October 2003, \nDuPont DeLisle employees exceeded their previous all-time safety record \nand early this year completed a full year without a single injury \nrequiring medical treatment. These are truly significant \naccomplishments by employees who are obviously dedicated and committed \nto their employees' safety.\n   As one can see, DuPont in DeLisle has been good for the Mississippi \neconomy by creating and sustaining high paying technical jobs. For the \npast 25 years, Mississippi has been proud to call itself home to this \nplant and we look forward to our continued partnership for the next 25 \nyears. Congratulations to DuPont DeLisle and its local and State \npartners on this most noteworthy anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5369-3", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4299.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the automatic enrollment of medicaid beneficiaries for \nprescription drug benefits under part D of such title, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nentitled the ``Medicare Assurance of Rx Transitional Assistance Act of \n2004'' with Senators Lincoln, Daschle, Lautenberg, Stabenow, Kennedy, \nand Clinton. The bill would assure that all 700,000 low-income seniors \nand people with disabilities who are currently enrolled in a Medicare \nSavings Program (MSP) receive the $600 in transitional assistance in \n2005 and 2006 available to them through passage of last year's Medicare \nprescription drug bill.\n  On April 2, 2004, I wrote a letter with 10 other senators to Health \nand Human Services Department Secretary Tommy Thompson urging his \ndepartment to automatically enroll all MSP beneficiaries, which are \nthose low-income people currently enrolled in State Medicaid programs \nto assist them with Medicare out-of-pocket expenses, into a Medicare \ndrug discount card in order to receive the $600 subsidy available under \nthe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of \n2003 (MMA).\n  In light of the fact that there is growing evidence that the savings \noffered via the drug discount card may be either minimal or illusory, \nthe only clear benefit is the $600 in transitional assistance that is \noffered to individuals whose income is less than $12,569 this year or \nto married couples whose income is less than $16,862. For those MSP \nbeneficiaries who do not have prescription drug coverage, they clearly \nmeet the income criteria under the act and their automatic enrollment \nis the only way to assure that they will receive the $600 subsidy that \nwas intended for them.\n  When the prescription drug bill was passed, the administration \nclaimed that they would enroll 65 percent of those eligible for the \n$600 in transitional assistance into the drug discount card. According \nto the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency \nexpects a total of 5 million of the 7 million eligible to enroll, \nincluding 29,000 of the estimated 45,000 in New Mexico who would be \neligible. Under CMS's assumptions, these beneficiaries would save a \ntotal of $5 billion nationally and $35 million in New Mexico over the \n2-year period.\n  Unfortunately, due to a poor advertising campaign which has been \ncriticized by the General Accounting Office where ads have run in \nCapitol Hill newspapers such as Roll Call and The Hill, which are not \nnormally subscribed to by low-income senior citizens or people with \ndisabilities, very few people even know the $600 subsidy exists. \nAccording to a recent national survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, \nonly 18 percent of senior citizens are aware that the low-income \ntransitional assistance program was included in the Medicare \nprescription drug bill. It is hard to believe that 65 percent of those \neligible will enroll when less than one-fifth of them even know it \nexists.\n  Fortunately, CMS has already laid the groundwork for auto-enrollment, \nas just two weeks ago the agency issued guidance for how state pharmacy \nassistance programs, or SPAPs, can automatically enroll their members \nwho have income below 135 percent of poverty in the low-income \nassistance. Second, CMS created a standardized enrollment form for low-\nincome assistance to be accepted by all companies offering Medicare \ndrug discount cards. Now, CMS can take a third step to automatically \nenroll MSP members who do not have prescription drug coverage.\n  Although I believe CMS has the authority to take this third step on \nits own, the legislation I am introducing today would clarify and \nensure low-income seniors and people with disabilities receive the \ntransitional assistance promised them by the Administration and \nCongress. As the Medicare Rights Center asks, ``Given their definite \neligibility and clear need for help to pay for their prescription \ndrugs, why not save these people and the government the hassle of \napplication and automatically enroll them?''\n  Some in CMS have argued that this might somehow limit the ``choice'' \nof a low-income Medicare beneficiary. this stated concern is \ninaccurate, however. As the Medicare Rights Center adds, ``Nothing \nwould prevent members of MSPs from voluntarily enrolling in the low-\nincome assistance and picking a drug discount card before automatic \nenrollment began. Even once enrolled in the transitional assistance, \nindividuals would enjoy access to the same broad range of prescription \ndrugs, since the $600 in annual assistance is not limited to the \nmedicines on any specific card's formulary.''\n  As for the value of having the ``choice'' of choosing among the 73 \ncompeting drug cards, that is far less valuable than insuring that \npeople get the $600 subsidy. According to a story in this morning's New \nYork Times entitled ``73 Options for Medicare Plan Fuel Chaos, Not \nPrescriptions,'' that highlights that for many retirees the plethora of \ndiscount cards is complicated, overwhelming, and not too helpful. \nFlorence Daniels, an 85 year-old retired engineer, says she cannot use \nthe government website to compare drug costs because she cannot afford \na computer. She said, ``I'm trying to absorb all the information, but \nit's ridiculous. Not just ridiculous, it's scary. If there was a single \ncard and it was administered by Medicare, and it got the cost of drugs \ndown--wonderful, marvelous. But with these cards, the only thing we \nknow is that we'll have to pay money to other people to administer what \nwe can get and can't get.''\n\n[[Page S5374]]\n\n  The interim final rule made available on December 10, 2003, describes \na process where low-income Medicare beneficiaries will have to apply \nfor assistance with one of the newly established drug discount cards. \nThere are a number of low-income seniors and people with disabilities \nthat are very sick, have cognitive and mental illnesses, and do not \nhave access to or comfort with the Internet. Many will wrongly slip \nthrough the cracks and fail to get the $600 subsidy that they could \nbenefit from unless we act.\n  In such cases, if an individual has not enrolled for whatever reason, \nit begs the question as to what ``choice'' automatic enrollment would \ntake away at that point? Many low-income seniors or the disabled will \nnot even be aware of the drug cards or the $600 subsidy for which they \nqualify.\n  As a result, by mid-August, either CMS or the states should take the \naffirmative step of automatically enrolling them into the program. If \nwe fail to assist them in this manner, what is really lost is not \n``choice'' but the $1,200 in real prescription drug assistance that \nthey qualify for and could receive. As a Kaiser Family Foundation study \nlast year indicated, Medicare beneficiaries with no drug coverage were \nnearly three times more likely than people with drug coverage to forego \nneeded prescription drugs.\n  While CMS has estimated that 65 percent of the eligible low-income \nbeneficiaries will sign up, that goal will not be met unless some \nproactive steps are taken. Our goal should be to leave none of our \nNation's low-income seniors and people with disabilities behind. \nAnything less should be considered unacceptable.\n  While some of the proponents of the drug discount card have been \ncritical of those that have questioned whether the drug discount card \noffers real discounts, they needlessly have tried to make this a \npartisan issue when it is not. There are legitimate and important \npublic policy questions as to how effective the prescription drug \ndiscount card will be.\n  However, no matter whether you think the card offers real savings or \nnot, everybody should be able to agree on the point that the $600 \nsubsidy should be provided to as many low-income Medicare beneficiaries \nas possible.\n  As a result, I once again call upon the Administration to take this \nimportant step itself. If it fails to do so, I hope that congressional \nleadership will see fit to move this legislation as quickly as \npossible. There is over $1 billion in prescription drug assistance for \nmany of our Nation's most vulnerable citizens at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the April 2, 2004, letter to \nSecretary Thompson, today's New York Times article I cited in my \nstatement, and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 2004.\n     Hon. Tommy Thompson,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: As the Administration prepared to \n     implement the new prescription drug card, we urge CMS to use \n     a combination of provisions in the new Medicare prescription \n     drug law to make an immediate, major and dramatic improvement \n     in the level of help for low-income Medicare beneficiaries.\n       Specifically, we urge you to use the authority in the new \n     law to automatically enroll all current Medicare Savings \n     Program (MSP) beneficiaries (QMB, SLMB, and QI-1 individuals) \n     in the transitional assistance and special transitional \n     assistance programs, thus making these individuals \n     automatically eligible for the $600 per year in low-income \n     discount card assistance without requiring a separate time-\n     consuming and inefficient enrollment process. Under this \n     proposal, the current MSP beneficiaries would be told about \n     the new discount cards serving their area and asked to make a \n     selection by mailing a postcard back. If the MSP beneficiary \n     does not make a selection, they can be assigned at random to \n     a plan serving their area.\n       Despite years of work and millions of dollars spent on \n     outreach, the level of participation in the MSP programs is \n     very low. The millions of eligible low-income Medicare \n     beneficiaries who are not enrolled in the MSP program miss \n     out on the Part A and Part B deductible, co-pay, and premium \n     assistance provided by these MSP programs. In 2004, this \n     assistance is worth a minimum of $799 and for Qualified \n     Medicare Beneficiaries who live on incomes under 100 percent \n     of the poverty level, it can easily be worth much more than \n     that.\n       The interim final rule made available on December 10, 2003, \n     describes a system where low-income Medicare beneficiaries \n     will have to apply for assistance with one of the new \n     endorsed discount card companies. This is a population of \n     seniors and people with disabilities that is often very sick, \n     that often has cognitive and mental illnesses, and that often \n     does not have access to or comfort with the Internet. In \n     short, it is a very difficult population to reach out to and \n     enroll in a new program.\n       By automatically enrolling the MSP population, about \n     700,000 individuals will be immediately enrolled. The \n     millions of dollars in outreach, education, and paperwork \n     expenses thus saved can be used to target and outreach to: \n     (1) those eligible beneficiaries not currently in the MSP \n     programs; and (2) to the 2.5 million low-income who live on \n     incomes below 135 percent of poverty but who do not qualify \n     for MSP. Hopefully, when those eligible for the MSP who are \n     not currently enrolled are signing up for the prescription \n     drug discount card program, they can also be enrolled in the \n     MSP.\n       Mr. Secretary, you have estimated that 65 percent of the \n     eligible beneficiaries will sign up for the low-income \n     assistance. You goal should be to leave none of our nation's \n     low-income seniors and people with disabilities behind. \n     Anything less should be considered unacceptable.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important request.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jeff Bingaman, John F. Kerry, Joseph I. Lieberman, Debbie \n           Stabenow, Charles E. Schumer, Tom Harkin, Blanche L. \n           Lincoln, Ron Wyden, Christopher J. Dodd, Hillary Rodham \n           Clinton, Barbara A. Mikulski.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 12, 2004]\n\n       73 Options for Medicare Plan Fuel Chaos, Not Prescriptions\n\n                            (By John Leland)\n\n       When Mildred Fruhling and her husband lost their \n     prescription drug coverage in 2001, they suddenly faced drug \n     bills of $7,000 a year. Mrs. Fruhling, now 76, began \n     scrambling to find discounts on the Internet, by mail order, \n     from Canada and through free samples from her doctors.\n       ``It's the only way I can continue to have some ease in my \n     retirement,'' she said.\n       Last week, when the federal government rolled out a new \n     discount drug program, Mrs. Fruhling studied her options with \n     the same thoroughness. What she found, she said, was \n     confusion: 73 competing drug discounts cards, each providing \n     different savings on different medications, and all subject \n     to change.\n       ``I personally feel I can do better on my own,'' she said. \n     But she added, ``At this point, I don't think anyone can make \n     an evaluation.''\n       Even before they go into effect on June 1, the cards--which \n     are approved by Medicare but offered by various companies and \n     organizations--have been the subject of heated political \n     debate, and AARP advertising campaign about how confusing \n     they are and anxious speculation from those they are supposed \n     to help. Among retirees of different income groups \n     interviewed last week, the initial reaction was \n     incomprehension.\n       ``Even the person who came to explain it to us didn't \n     understand it,'' said Mary Shen, 77, at the Whittaker Senior \n     Center on Manhattan's Lower East Side. ``It's not fair to \n     expect seniors, who have enough difficulties already, to have \n     to figure this out.''\n       Shirley Brauner, 75, pushed a metal walker through the \n     center's lunchroom. ``All I've got to say is they confuse the \n     elderly, including me,'' she said. ``I'm furious. They're \n     taking advantage of the seniors. How can the seniors \n     understand it?''\n       The prescription drug discount cards are a prelude to the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization \n     Act, which will provide broad drug coverage starting in 2006. \n     The federal government projects that 7.3 million of \n     Medicare's 41 million participants will sign up for the \n     cards.\n       Those who wish to do so, however, face the daunting task of \n     choosing the right card.\n       ``What it's like is a bunch of confusion,'' said Katharine \n     Roberts, 77, who said she had not been to a movie in six \n     years, in part because of her drug expenses. ``You might find \n     you really need three cards, and you can only choose one.''\n       The cards are a 19-month stopgap measure to provide \n     discounts of 10 percent to 25 percent for Medicare \n     participants who have no other prescription drug coverage. In \n     addition, low-income participants are eligible for subsidies \n     of $600 a year.\n       The Department of Health and Human Services approved 28 \n     companies or organizations to issue cards; among them are \n     AARP, insurance companies and health maintenance \n     organizations. Cards cost up to $30 a year. Each card \n     provides different discounts on different drugs, and is \n     accepted by different pharmacies. Participants can choose \n     only one.\n       To help people sort through the options, Medicare and a \n     company called DestinationRx set up a database on its Web \n     site, medicare.gov, that lists the prices charged under \n     various plans for whatever medications a user types in. \n     People can get similar help by telephone at 1-800-\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\n     MEDICAR. But some providers complained that the prices on the \n     site were inaccurate, and some cards are not listed at all.\n       For many retirees, it is too much.\n       ``I'm 85, do I have to go through this nonsense?'' asked \n     Florence Daniels, a retired engineer who said she received \n     less than $1,000 a month from Social Security, of which she \n     paid $179 a month for supplemental medical insurance. She \n     gets drugs through a New York State program, which provides \n     any prescription for $20 or less. To make ends meet and \n     afford her drugs, she said she bought used clothing and put \n     off buying new glasses. Some of her friends travel by bus to \n     Canada to buy drugs; others do without, she said.\n       Ms. Daniels did not use the government Web site to compare \n     drug cards, in part because she cannot afford a computer. \n     ``I'm trying to absorb all the information, but it's \n     ridiculous,'' she said. ``Not just ridiculous, it's scary. If \n     there was a single card and it was administered by Medicare, \n     and it got the cost of drugs down--wonderful, marvelous. But \n     with these cards, the only thing we know is that we'll have \n     to pay money to other people to administer what we can get \n     and can't get.''\n       The discount program, which is financed largely by the \n     cards' sponsors, reflects the Bush administration's desire to \n     open Medicare to market principles without allowing \n     participants to import drugs from other countries, which many \n     Democrats favored.\n       Mark B. McClellan, an administrator at the Center for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the complexity of the \n     plan encouraged competition. ``We're seeing more plans \n     offering better benefits,'' he said, estimating that people \n     will be able to save 15 percent or more using the cards.\n       But the complexity of choices will keep many people away \n     from the program, said Marilyn Moon, director of health at \n     the American Institutes for Research, a nonprofit research \n     organization in Washington.\n       Often, the discount provided by the cards is not as good as \n     what people can get from existing state programs, union plans \n     or consumer groups, said Robert M. Hayes, president of the \n     Medicare Rights Center, a nonprofit organization that helps \n     individuals with Medicare problems.\n       Sydney Bild, 81, a retired doctor in Chicago, compared the \n     discount cards with the prices he paid ordering his drugs by \n     mail from Canada. Dr. Bild pays $4,000 to $5,000 a year for \n     five medications. When he checked the government Web site, he \n     said the best plans were about 50 percent to 60 percent \n     higher than what he was paying.\n       But Dr. Bild said his main objection to the new plans was \n     that companies could change prices on drugs, or change the \n     drugs covered. Medicare requires plans to cover only one drug \n     in each of 209 common categories. Consumers can change cards \n     only once a year. Committing to a card is ``like love--\n     it's a something thing,'' Dr. Bild said. ``What if I chose \n     one? They could drop my drugs two weeks later.''\n       Companies began soliciting customers for their discount \n     drug cards last week. When the first pamphlets arrived at \n     Beverly Lowy's home in New York City, Ms. Lowy said, she \n     looked at them carefully. She does not have drug coverage and \n     last year spent about $3,000 on prescription drugs. But the \n     more brochures she reads, Ms. Lowy said, the less clear \n     things became.\n       ``You really have to be a rocket scientists,'' Ms. Lowy, \n     71, said. ``It takes time, energy, and you don't even save \n     money. I thought, `This one is offering this, this one is \n     offering that.' Finally I decided this isn't for me.''\n       At the Leonard Covello Senior Center in East Harlem, the \n     new cards seemed opaque. Ramon Velez, 72, a retired taxi \n     driver, said he had watched AARP advertisements in which \n     people read the dense language on the federal Medicare bill.\n       ``I was laughing at the people in the ads, but it's true,'' \n     Mr. Velez said. ``Everyone's confused.''\n       Mr. Velez received $763 a month from Social Security, and \n     often skips his psoriasis medication because he cannot afford \n     the $45 co-payment under this Blue Cross/Blue Shield plan. He \n     wondered if the new drug cards could save him money.\n       ``But it's very confusing,'' he said. ``I'd go to the \n     Social Security office to ask about the cards, but I don't \n     think they'd know.''\n       Alejandro Sierra, 67, a retired barber, paced around the \n     center's pool table. Mr. Sierra takes six medications for \n     diabetes and complications from cataracts and colon cancer, \n     and sometimes skips a medication because he cannot afford it.\n       ``I'm interested in the cards,'' he said. ``But I can't \n     figure it out on the computer, because I can't see.''\n       Carlos Lopez, the director of the center, said the cards \n     had so far produced little but anxiety. Mr. Lopez asked \n     participants to bring any applications to him before signing \n     them, and warned them about people selling phony cards.\n       ``They're not nervous, but concerned,'' he said. ``They \n     feel, why now? Why do I suddenly need a card for \n     medications?''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

\nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n       Whereas community, migrant, public housing, and homeless \n     health centers are nonprofit, community owned and operated \n     health providers and are vital to the Nation's communities;\n       Whereas there are more than 1,000 such health centers \n     serving 15,000,000 people in over 3,500 communities in every \n     State and territory, spanning urban and rural communities in \n     all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, \n     and the Virgin Islands;\n       Whereas these health centers have provided cost-effective, \n     high-quality health care to the Nation's poor and medically \n     underserved (including the working poor, the uninsured, and \n     many high-risk and vulnerable populations), acting as a vital \n     safety net in the Nation's health delivery system, meeting \n     escalating health needs, and reducing health disparities;\n       Whereas these health centers provide care to individuals in \n     the United States who would otherwise lack access to health \n     care, including 1 of every 8 uninsured individuals, 1 of \n     every 9 Medicaid beneficiaries, 1 of every 7 people of color, \n     and 1 of every 9 rural Americans;\n       Whereas these health centers and other innovative programs \n     in primary and preventive care reach out to over 621,000 \n     homeless individuals and more than 709,000 migrant and \n     seasonal farm workers;\n       Whereas these health centers make health care responsive \n     and cost effective by integrating the delivery of primary \n     care with aggressive outreach, patient education, \n     translation, and enabling support services;\n       Whereas these health centers increase the use of preventive \n     health services such as immunizations, Pap smears, \n     mammograms, and glaucoma screenings;\n       Whereas in communities served by these health centers, \n     infant mortality rates have been reduced between 10 and 40 \n     percent;\n       Whereas these health centers are built by community \n     initiative;\n       Whereas Federal grants provide seed money that empowers \n     communities to find partners and resources and to recruit \n     doctors and needed health professionals;\n       Whereas Federal grants on average form 25 percent of such a \n     health center's budget, with the remainder provided by State \n     and local governments, Medicare, Medicaid, private \n     contributions, private insurance, and patient fees;\n       Whereas these health centers are community oriented and \n     patient focused;\n       Whereas these health centers tailor their services to fit \n     the special needs and priorities of communities, working \n     together with schools, businesses, churches, community \n     organizations, foundations, and State and local governments;\n       Whereas these health centers contribute to the health and \n     well-being of their communities by keeping children healthy \n     and in school and helping adults remain productive and on the \n     job;\n       Whereas these health centers engage citizen participation \n     and provide jobs for over 70,000 community residents; and\n       Whereas designating the week of August 8 through August 14, \n     2004, as ``National Health Center Week'' would raise \n     awareness of the health services provided by health centers: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of August 8 through August 14, \n     2004, as ``National Health Center Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe the \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \ndeclaring the week of August 8, 2004, as a National Health Center Week \ndedicated to raising awareness of health services provided by \ncommunity, migrant, public housing, and homeless health centers. I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by Senator Durbin and 31 of our \ncolleagues.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of Congress that these health \ncenters contribute to the health and well-being of their communities by \nkeeping children healthy and in school and helping adults remain \nproductive and on the job.\n  The resolution also recognizes health centers for providing cost-\neffective, high-quality health care to the Nation's poor and medically \nunderserved, and by acting as a vital safety net in the Nation's health \ndelivery system. These nonprofit, community-based centers are \nperforming a vital service to our country's more vulnerable populations \nand they are to be commended for their efforts.\n  Health centers throughout the country have a 30-year history of \nsuccess. Studies continue to show that the centers effectively and \nefficiently improve our Nation's health.\n  Last year, the community health centers in my State of Colorado \nprovided care to 372,000 patients, and 41 percent of those patients \nwere children under the age of 19. Of the patients seen in Colorado in \n2003, 45 percent had no health insurance, 30 percent were Medicaid \nrecipients and 87 percent had family incomes less than $36,200 a year \nfor a family of four. Community health centers are truly America's \nhealthcare safety net.\n  I believe it is important that we support and honor this nationwide \nnetwork of community based providers. That is why I urge my colleagues \nto act quickly on this legislation. Let's show our community health \ncenter network that we value its significant contribution to the health \nof our citizens by declaring the week of August 8, 2004, a National \nHealth Center Week.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 358--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT NO LATER \nTHAN DECEMBER 31, 2006, LEGISLATION SHOULD BE ENACTED TO PROVIDE EVERY \nINDIVIDUAL IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE HEALTH \n INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT IS THE SAME AS, OR IS BETTER THAN, THE HEALTH \n  INSURANCE COVERAGE AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AT THE SAME OR \n                              LOWER RATES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \nEdwards, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. \nLeahy) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 358\n\n       Whereas the number of uninsured people in the United States \n     has grown to 43,600,000, an increase of 3,800,000 since 2000;\n       Whereas nearly 20 percent of uninsured Americans are \n     children;\n       Whereas 8 out of 10 uninsured people in the United States \n     come from working families;\n       Whereas members of racial and ethnic minority groups at all \n     income levels are more likely to be uninsured than their \n     white counterparts;\n       Whereas the United States is the only major industrialized \n     country that does not guarantee health care to all of its \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the United States has the highest health care \n     spending per capita, but consistently scores near the bottom \n     in infant mortality and life expectancy when compared with \n     other developed, high-income countries;\n       Whereas those without insurance are more likely to go \n     without necessary medical care and preventive services;\n       Whereas millions of Americans who have insurance coverage \n     are underinsured;\n       Whereas the Institute of Medicine has estimated that the \n     lost economic value of uninsurance is between $65,000,000,000 \n     and $130,000,000,000 each year, and the Kaiser Family \n     Foundation has concluded that uninsured Americans could incur \n     nearly $41,000,000,000 in health care treatment in 2004;\n       Whereas the financial consequences of uninsurance are \n     disastrous for families, as demonstrated by a recent study \n     that found medical problems were a factor in 45 percent of \n     all non-business bankruptcy filings;\n       Whereas employer-based insurance premiums grew 13.9 percent \n     between 2002 and 2003, the third consecutive year of double-\n     digit increases;\n       Whereas a recent study by the Commonwealth Fund concluded \n     that small employers that provide health insurance to their \n     employees pay more but receive less for their money while \n     suffering faster increases in premiums and steeper jumps in \n     deductibles than large firms;\n       Whereas public programs such as medicare, medicaid, the \n     State Children's Health Insurance Program, the Indian Health \n     Service, the Veterans Health Administration, and TRICARE, \n     play a critical role in providing coverage for millions of \n     Americans, but are often underfunded;\n       Whereas the market for individual insurance policies is \n     extremely expensive and allows for discrimination based on \n     health status, age, and gender; and\n       Whereas members of Congress and their families have the \n     opportunity to select among many benefit choices and to \n     purchase high quality, group health insurance coverage at \n     reasonable rates: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that no later \n     than December 31, 2006, legislation should be enacted to \n     provide every individual in the United States with the \n     opportunity to purchase health insurance coverage that is the \n     same as, or is better than, the health insurance coverage \n     available to members of Congress, at the same or lower rates.\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 359--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF APRIL 11 THROUGH APRIL \n            17, 2004, AS ``FREE ENTERPRISE EDUCATION WEEK''\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n       Whereas Congress hosted the first American Association for \n     the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Congressional Science and \n     Engineering Fellows in 1973;\n       Whereas the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering \n     Fellowship Program was the first to provide an opportunity \n     for Ph.D.-level scientists and engineers to learn about the \n     policymaking process while bolstering the technical expertise \n     available to members of Congress and their staff;\n       Whereas members of Congress hold the AAAS Congressional \n     Science and Engineering Fellowship Program in high regard for \n     the substantial contributions that AAAS Congressional Science \n     and Engineering Fellows have made, serving both in personal \n     offices and on committee staff;\n       Whereas Congress is increasingly involved in public policy \n     issues of a scientific and technical nature, and recognizes \n     the need to develop additional in-house expertise in the \n     areas of science and engineering;\n       Whereas more than 800 individuals have held AAAS \n     Congressional Science and Engineering Fellowships since 1973;\n       Whereas the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering \n     Fellows represent the full range of physical, biological, and \n     social sciences and all fields of engineering;\n       Whereas the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering \n     Fellows bring to Congress new insights and ideas, extensive \n     knowledge, and perspectives from a variety of disciplines;\n       Whereas the AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering \n     Fellows learn about legislative, oversight, and investigative \n     activities through assignments that offer a wide array of \n     responsibilities;\n       Whereas AAAS Congressional Science and Engineering \n     Fellowships provide an opportunity for scientists and \n     engineers to transition into careers in government service; \n     and\n       Whereas many former AAAS Congressional Science and \n     Engineering Fellows return to their disciplines and share \n     knowledge with students and peers to encourage more \n     scientists and engineers to participate in informing \n     government processes: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the significance of the 30th anniversary of \n     the American Association for the Advancement of Science \n     Congressional Science and Engineering Fellowship Program;\n       (2) acknowledges the value of over 30 years of \n     participation in the legislative process by the AAAS \n     Congressional Science and Engineering Fellows; and\n       (3) reaffirms its commitment to support the use of science \n     in governmental decisionmaking through the AAAS Congressional \n     Science and Engineering Fellowship Program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 108--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n                        TINNITUS AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Wyden) submitted \nthe following concurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed \nto:\n\n       Whereas 50,000,000 individuals in the United States have \n     experienced tinnitus, the perception of noises or ringing in \n     the ears and head when no external sound source is present;\n       Whereas 12,000,000 individuals in the United States \n     experience tinnitus to an incessant and debilitating degree, \n     such that the sounds in their ears and heads never abate, \n     forcing them to seek assistance from a health care \n     professional;\n       Whereas tinnitus is frequently caused by exposure to loud \n     noises in the workplace, where an estimated 30,000,000 \n     individuals in the United States are exposed to injurious \n     levels of noise each day, and where noise-induced hearing \n     loss is the most common occupational injury;\n       Whereas tinnitus is also caused by exposure to loud noises \n     in recreational settings, where levels of sound can reach \n     traumatic levels, and where individuals frequently are not \n     aware that temporary ringing in the ears can become permanent \n     after continued exposure to loud levels of sound;\n       Whereas in many cases, simply wearing proper hearing \n     protection would protect individuals from damaging their \n     hearing;\n       Whereas many individuals with tinnitus are told that the \n     only solution to their condition is to learn to live with it, \n     even though treatments for tinnitus are available that can \n     help reduce the stress of the incessant ringing and increase \n     the coping skills and quality of life for individuals who \n     experience this condition; and\n       Whereas the American Tinnitus Association has designated \n     the week beginning May 15, 2004, as the first National \n     Tinnitus Awareness Week, in order to raise public awareness \n     and to further its mission to silence tinnitus through \n     education, advocacy, research, and support: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Tinnitus \n     Awareness Week, as designated by the American Tinnitus \n     Association;\n       (2) encourages interested groups and affected persons to \n     promote public awareness of tinnitus, the dangers of loud \n     noise, and the importance of hearing protection for all \n     individuals; and\n       (3) commits to continuing its support of innovative hearing \n     health research through the National Institutes of Health, \n     particularly through the National Institute on Deafness and \n     Other Communication Disorders, so that treatments for \n     tinnitus can be refined and a cure for tinnitus can be \n     discovered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/05/12/senate-section/article/S5377-1", "month": "05", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3144.
