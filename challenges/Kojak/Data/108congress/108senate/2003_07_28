Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 14, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 14) to enhance the energy security of the United \n     States, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Campbell amendment No. 886, to replace ``tribal consortia'' \n     with ``tribal energy resource development organizations.''\n       Durbin amendment No. 1384, to amend title 49, United States \n     Code, to improve the system for enhancing automobile fuel \n     efficiency.\n       Durbin modified amendment No. 1385, to amend the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional tax incentives for \n     enhancing motor vehicle fuel efficiency.\n       Bond amendment No. 1386, to impose additional requirements \n     for improving automobile fuel economy and reducing vehicle \n     emissions.\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The acting leader.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this morning the Senate has resumed \nconsideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. The chairman and ranking \nmember will continue to consider amendments during today's session.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  On behalf of the leader, I encourage Members who want to offer \namendments to do so as early as possible this week. Those Members \nshould contact the bill managers for an orderly consideration of those \namendments.\n  Under a previous agreement, at 5:20 p.m. the Senate shall proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the nomination of Earl Yeakel to be U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Western District of Texas. The Senate will vote \non the Yeakel nomination at 5:30. That will be the first rollcall vote \nof the day. Members should anticipate additional votes in relation to \nEnergy amendments or any other items that can be cleared for action.\n  In addition, the Senate will consider the trade amendments with Chile \nand Singapore. If all debate can be completed on those bills, the votes \nwill also occur during today's session of the Senate.\n  Today begins the final week prior to the August recess. Senators can, \ntherefore, expect busy sessions with rollcall votes throughout each day \nand Members should schedule themselves accordingly.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just received a phone call from a Senator, \nand the Senator is on an airplane. Therefore, I will have to protect \nher rights. She has indicated she does not wish us to move off the \namendment that is now before the Senate, so there will be no way to \noffer other amendments until\n\n[[Page S9994]]\n\nwe have this matter resolved. I am not able to speak to her at this \nstage, but I will attempt to do so.\n  She simply will not allow anything to be set aside until we dispose \nof the amendment that is before us.\n  The other thing I want to say is, if the distinguished acting \nmajority leader would be generous, the Senator from Florida is here and \nwishes to speak for up to 3 minutes as in morning business prior to our \ngetting on to the legislation. I would ask if that would be OK with the \nacting majority leader.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have no objection to the 3 minutes. I \nwould like to ask unanimous consent that we be able to go ahead and \nspeak on the electricity amendment even though we will not be able to \noffer it.\n  Mr. REID. We would not need unanimous consent to do that anyway, so \nthat would be fine.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Very well. I have no objection.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Florida be recognized to speak for up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in keeping with the agreement with the \nminority leader, I will not introduce the amendment at this time, but I \nwould like to talk about the amendment.\n  Mr. President, what we are going to deal with today is an amendment, \nwhich will be a second-degree amendment and substitute for the electric \ntitle in the Energy bill. As you know, we have talked about the Energy \nbill for a good long time on the Senate floor. We have talked about it \nin committee, and we talked about it last year. So what has happened is \nthe chairman of the committee has done a great job of seeking to take \nthe information that came forward in our discussions in the past about \nthe electric title of the Energy bill and make it more compatible with \nthe issues that have arisen during the previous discussions, and to put \nit together into an amendment. That is what we will be dealing with.\n  I am very pleased we have come together on the committee with an \namendment that deals with most of the concerns about people, with a \nrecognition that there is a changing world in terms of electrical \nsupply and the way it is distributed throughout the country. If we are, \nin fact, to develop an Energy policy that is designed to give guidance \nto what happens regarding energy over the next several years, then this \nis a very important amendment and very important portion of the Energy \nbill.\n  As we look at ourselves and our families and businesses and our \neconomy, there is probably nothing that impacts us more than \nelectricity. It is in everything we do--whether it is lights, heat, \nbusinesses, whatever, we are involved with electricity. Each of us \nwants to have it for ourselves and our families. So we need to make \nsome changes and some policy that moves us in that direction. The \nchallenges facing the electric industry affect our economy and our \nenvironment, and developing a policy on this electric component is one \nof the most challenging aspects of the entire energy debate.\n  Chairman Domenici's efforts and his leadership on this issue have \nbeen tremendous. He has worked with all the interested parties to \ndevelop a very carefully crafted and balanced product. I will comment a \nlittle later on the whole package of letters of support we have \nreceived from various associations and users. These letters of support \ncome from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, American \nPublic Power Association, the Large Public Power Council, each \nadvocating passage of the electric substitute amendment without \nmodification.\n  We have talked about the number of amendments that are out there. \nHere is one we have already gone through, seeking to talk about and \nhaving opportunity for input from all the various interests. We believe \nthis section is ready for adoption without modification. There are \nletters of support from the electric industry itself. The \nadministration has also expressed its support for the electricity \namendment.\n  In a letter dated July 25, the Secretary of Energy wrote that the \nDomenici amendment ``will effectively modernize our Nation's antiquated \nelectricity laws.'' Secretary Abraham stated that the amendment \n``protects consumers, ensures the development of wholesale markets that \nare transparent and free of manipulation, facilitates open access to \nthe transmission system, increases electric supply, promotes energy \nefficiency, improves reliability, encourages demand response, and \nappropriately balances Federal and State responsibilities.''\n\n  These supporters in the administration are right. The proposed \nelectricity title is much needed and will accomplish some of the \nfollowing: It establishes mandatory reliability rules. What is more \nimportant to us in electricity than reliability? It expands the \ntransmission system efficiently on a regional basis. It will promote \nmore open access to the transmission grid. The way things have changed, \nmore and more electricity is developed in market generators and has to \nbe moved to the market in order to make it work. You have to have a \ntransmission grid.\n  It ensures priority on transmission lines for native load customers. \nThis is so that where transmission lines serve certain areas, they are \nthe first priority, and later you can add to the transmission grid.\n  It will allocate the costs of expanding the transmission system \nfairly, so that the cost doesn't have to be shared excessively by those \nalready on the line with new users.\n  It repeals the PUHCA to allow for more investment. This law was \npassed some time ago. It limits who can be involved in the ownership \nand investment of electric utilities and transmissions. It changes that \nso that there still are restrictions to be enforced by the enforcement \nagencies, but it allows for more investment.\n  It reforms PURPA. That is the law that required the purchase of \nvarious kinds of alternative energies at a lower price than the market \nmight demand. It still allows for that purchase, and it will require it \nin some instances, but it takes away that mandatory aspect and allows \ncompetitive markets to work. It strengthens consumer protection also \nwith increased transparency and oversight.\n  In the last several years, on the west coast we have seen the need \nfor oversight and transparency. This provides for that. These are \nimportant issues that need to be addressed as part of a comprehensive, \nintegrated, strategic energy policy.\n  Let me remind us that this is a policy we are talking about. So we \nneed to have some foresight into it. It is not daily detail, it is a \npolicy for where we go in the future to provide the kind of result that \nwe would like to see.\n  Our action now on this amendment will help reduce regulatory \nuncertainty. It will provide much needed direction in an industry that \nis at a crossroads. That is where we are. The Domenici electricity \namendment is the best solution available, and it deserves all of our \nsupport. It also deserves it soon, so that we can complete this job and \nget it out on the ground in the country.\n  Let me take some time to describe the electricity amendment in a \nfairly broad sense. The first part of the electricity amendment \nproposes modifications and additions to the Federal Power Act's \ndefinitions. These proposed changes are needed to accommodate \nconforming changes and defining terms of art used by the industry. \nSpecifically, the terms affected are: electric utility; transmitting \nutility; regional transmission organizations, RTOs; independent \ntransmission organizations, or ITOs.\n  Subtitle A has to do with reliability. The reliability subtitle sets \nforth a new framework to ensure greater reliability in the transmission \ngrid. Today, transmission grid stability is maintained through \nvoluntary compliance with reliability rules promulgated by the North \nAmerican Electric Reliability Council.\n\n  This subtitle directs FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nto implement a final rule to certify an electric reliability \norganization that will set and enforce mandatory reliability rules for \nthe safe operation of the transmission grid.\n\n[[Page S9995]]\n\n  Mandatory reliability rules are needed due to the increased number \nand the complexity of transmission on the grid and more extensive \nwholesale competitive markets. This reliability subtitle is based on \nconsensus language developed by the North American Electric Reliability \nCouncil and the Western Governors Association.\n  I will point out here that there are substantial differences in \ndifferent parts of the country with respect particularly to the \nmovement of energy. In the West where there is more generated, \nsometimes the movement is out of the generation market into the \nconsumptive market, where in the Northeast, for example, there is less \ngeneration and more movement there. So you need to make these changes \nand that is what the reliability subtitle seeks to do.\n  The provision is supported by a number of other groups and \nassociations because they know greater reliability means greater \nopportunity--greater opportunity for investment.\n  In addition to NERC and the Western Governors Association, supporters \nof the reliability section include the Edison Electric Institute, the \nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Canadian \nElectricity Association, the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners, the National Association of State Utility Consumer \nAdvocates, the American Public Power Association, the National \nElectrical Manufacturers Association, the National Rural Electric \nCooperative Association, American Electric Power, Pepco Holdings, Inc., \nthe Transmission Access Policy Study Group, TXU Corporation, and the \nWestern Electricity Coordinating Council.\n  That is a broad representation of the whole Nation in terms of what \nwe need to be doing with reliability.\n  As to subtitle B, regional markets, here again the subtitle \nrecognizes the regional differences and seeks to promote the regional \nmarket in a careful and fair manner.\n  The first section of this subtitle delays the finalization of the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission's standard market design proposed \nrulemaking until July 1, 2005. This was a rule that came out from FERC \nsome time ago that, in the view of most people, took too much authority \nto the national level and did not leave enough with the local and \nregional level. This is designed to change that situation. FERC seems \nagreeable to that change. This delays any order of that kind until July \n1, 2005.\n  Given the controversy surrounding SMD and FERC's willingness to \nrevisit and revise its approach in the white paper, a delay until July \n1, 2005, preceded by a notice of proposed rulemaking and opportunity \nfor public comment is, we believe, a balanced solution. The timeframe \nallows FERC to develop a rulemaking true to the principles and terms \noutlined in the white paper regarding deference to the States--that is \nvery important, deference to the States--and permits those regions that \nare working on their own unique marketing designs to continue to do so.\n  This is a recognition of the fact there needs to be some Federal \noversight. We are going to have a national movement of electricity and, \nat the same time, recognize those unique aspects of various regions, \nand this is designed to balance that situation.\n  This subtitle includes a sense of Congress that RTO formation be \nvoluntary. The subtitle also provides that nothing in the Energy bill \nauthorizes FERC to mandate the formation of RTOs. We will hear more \nabout that point, I am sure. The fact is it does not mandate; it allows \nthe States and regions to make these decisions, which I think is very \nimportant.\n  This subtitle emphasizes RTO formation, which is very important, and \nit promotes fair and open access to electric transmission service; \nbenefits retail consumers; facilitates wholesale competition; improves \nefficiencies in the transmission grid management; promotes grid \nreliability; removes opportunities for unduly discriminatory or \npreferential transmission practices; and provides for efficient \ndevelopment of transmission infrastructure needed to meet the growing \ndemands of competitive wholesale markets.\n  There has been a great change in how electricity is generated and \ndistributed. A number of years ago, a company had the job of being a \ndistribution unit, to go to the retail, to go to your house, my house, \nand businesses in a community. They generated their own electricity, \nand it was a confined package right there. Over the last number of \nyears, more than 30 percent of wholesale power is generated by what we \ncall market generators that do not make retail distribution. Therefore, \nto be competitive and to give us a better price, that electricity has \nto move about to the companies that do the distribution, and that is \nwhat this whole issue is about.\n  This subtitle authorizes Federal power marketing agencies, such as \nthe Bonneville Power Administration and Western Area Power \nAdministration, to join RTOs. They are a very important part of the \ngeneration and distribution in these areas, and they, too, can come \nalong with the States to put together these regional organizations.\n  This subtitle includes a regional consideration section which \nencourages discussion between States and FERC on how to improve \ntransmission and wholesale markets. Issues to be considered include \nelimination of pancake rates, that is, multiple cumulative charges for \ntransmission service across successive locations in a single region, \nand the resolution of seams issues, to improve transmission exchanges \nbetween regions. These are very important to a uniform statewide \naverage rate of transmission pricing.\n\n  Subtitle C, which involves transmission access and protecting service \nobligations, is very important. The first section of this subtitle is \ndesigned to ensure load-serving entities are a priority on the \ntransmission grid to fulfill their service obligation to the native \nload end users. This section balances the service obligation needs of \nboth transmission owners and transmission-dependent entities, such as \nmunicipals and co-ops. The section allows this priority only to the \nextent required to provide the load-serving entities' native load \nobligation. This means if you have powerplants, retail merchants, and \ncustomers, and you want to use that line to go on to new customers, the \nfirst priority is to those being served, the native load, and that is \nimportant to our part of the country.\n  FERC-lite is just what it says: The ideas that were put forth by the \nFederal agency now are toned down with more emphasis given to the \nopportunity for States and regions to have input.\n  The open access, or FERC-lite section, promotes principles of fair \naccess to the transmission system by requiring that all transmitting \nutilities, regulated or unregulated, have rates, terms, and conditions \nfor transmission service that are not discriminatory or preferential.\n  The FERC-lite provision will not diminish the local control benefits \nupon which many unregulated transmitting utilities depend. Small \nunregulated transmitting utilities, such as distribution co-ops, as \nwell as unregulated transmitting utilities that do not own or operate \nsignificant transmission facilities, are exempt from the FERC-lite.\n  The section on participant funding directs FERC to issue regulations \nabout the allocation of costs associated with transmission expansion. \nThis section clarifies who has to pay for what in transmission \nexpansion. This clarification will promote certainty and investment in \nour energy infrastructure. It really defines benefits. Those who \nbenefit from the expansion will be expected to pay for the expansion.\n  Under this section, a regional transmission organization, an RTO, or \nan independent system operator may submit a plan regarding transmission \ncosts to FERC, and FERC will give substantial deference to the comments \nfiled by State regulatory authorities, other appropriate State \nofficials, and stakeholders of the RTO or ISO regarding such a plan.\n  With regard to subtitle D, amendments to the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act of 1978, the most challenging part of the PURPA \nreform addressed in this section has to do with mandatory purchase and \nsale requirements affecting qualified facilities, or QF. Many have \nargued that PURPA has resulted in above-market electricity prices \nbecause it forces utilities to buy power they may not need. Thanks to \nthe hard work of Senators Nickles, Landrieu, and Alexander, a \ncompromise was reached which will ensure\n\n[[Page S9996]]\n\nthat qualifying facilities are legitimate and not just generation \nfacilities masquerading as QFs and abusing QF benefits.\n  The compromise prospectively terminates the mandatory purchase and \nsale requirements affecting QFs when a competitive wholesale market \nexists and sets forth new criteria for future QFs to ensure they are \nfundamentally designed to support commercial or industrial processes.\n\n  The stakeholders, which include the American Chemistry Council, \nInternational Paper, and the Alliance for Competitive Energy, worked \ntogether to help craft this language with the Senators and strongly \nsupport the principles of ensuring fair and legitimate practices.\n  This subtitle also includes provisions on net metering, smart \nmetering, and demand response that require States to consider the \nbenefits of these policies. What this really means is instead of being \nforced to buy the energy that is excessive to some manufacturing group, \nit will have to be in a competitive market. They will be legitimate \nqualifying facilities and will not be forced, as it was in the past, \nbut yet will still be able to include these producers as available \nenergy.\n  Subtitle E is provisions regarding the Public Utility Holding Company \nAct of 1935. This is an outdated statute that imposes barriers to \ncompetition and discourages investment in generation and transmission. \nPUHCA limits that are now in place limit geographic and product \ndiversification and impose many burdensome filing requirements.\n  PUHCA is also a barrier to the formation of regional energy markets \nbecause it would apply to regional transmission organizations.\n  Repealing PUHCA does not preclude State and Federal regulators from \nprotecting ratepayers. They can still take a look at who is doing the \ninvesting and whether the returns generated go back to the right group \nand create a good price for users, and they will be able to invest, not \ndivert, the money, but they will continue to be overseen by existing \nregulators. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission \nwill continue to protect against antitrust violations.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission, which currently oversees \nPUHCA, has recommended on a number of occasions that PUHCA be repealed \nand certain consumer protections transferred to FERC. That is what we \nseek to do here.\n  Market transparency and antimanipulation enforcement, of course, are \nvery important subjects, now more than ever because of what happened in \nCalifornia and elsewhere on the west coast.\n  This subtitle directs FERC to issue rules to establish an electronic \ninformation system to provide information about the availability and \nthe price of wholesale market and transmission services to ensure that \nsuch information will be treated with confidentiality, when necessary, \nand used to protect consumers in competitive markets.\n  Here again the allegation--and I am sure to some extent it is true--\nwas these are the kinds of manipulations that happened in California \nand on the west coast, and this is designed to prohibit the filing of \nfalse information regarding the price of wholesale electricity and the \navailability of transmission capacity. It prohibits round-trip trading, \nwhere there were apparently some funny tricks played on the west coast. \nThis will prohibit those kinds of things. It expands those who can file \ncomplaints and who will be subject to FERC investigation; increases the \npenalty under the Federal Power Act and the National Gas Act; amends \nthe Federal Power Act refund effective date to the date of filing. It \nmakes it work so the purpose for which it was designed can be carried \nout.\n  Subtitle G is consumer protections. Of course, all of us are \ninterested in that. A number of consumer protections are included in \nthe amendment. The first one includes a revised section 203 of the \nFederal Power Act which will offer FERC limited expansion of its merger \nreview authority. Justification for this expansion review is needed to \nbalance the repeal of PUHCA, which we just talked about, and the \npotential effects on holding company structures. So we are making some \nof the changes that need to be made because of outdated laws and we are \nreplacing the oversight that needs to be there so it will still be \ntransparent and visible.\n  The new section would apply to transactions only that are in excess \nof $10 million. So this is designed to deal with major transactions.\n  In addition, 203 would highlight factors such as consumer protection \nfinancial integrity, evaluating whether a transaction is consistent \nwith the public interest. These are things that all of us recognize \nneed to be there. That is why utility commissions have been in effect \nin States to sort of have an oversight. Even though we want the private \nmarket to be stronger and more effective, there still needs to be \nprotection for consumers because there are not lots of choices always \nin terms of energy.\n  A new section requires FERC to adopt rules for consideration of \napplicants. It also directs the Federal Trade Commission to issue rules \nregarding information disclosures.\n  So overall, the Domenici electricity amendment is balanced. It is a \nfair package that creates a more efficient electricity grid, increases \ninvestment in utility infrastructure, and enhances consumer \nprotections. These are basically the issues we will be faced with again \nin the future. We want electricity available. We want it at a \nreasonable price. We know the market can have something to do with that \nif there is competition, but if there is competition there has to be \noversight.\n  If we are going to be able to move electricity, there has to be a \ngrid. If there is going to be a grid, there has to be agreement among \nStates in regions. These are the kinds of things we deal with. It is \nfairly complicated. On the other hand, there are pretty basic things \nthat need to be done and have not been done for a very long time.\n  Of course, we must keep in mind, as we do all of these things, some \nof the basic fundamentals we want to protect, and that is there are \nState opportunities to make a decision for local power; that we can \nshow the difference between regional needs by having RTOs that have the \nauthority to do this. If we are going to have a nationwide grid to be \nable to move power to make it more efficiently used, there has to be \nsome Federal authority as well. This seeks to develop that balance.\n  This amendment is balanced. It is a fair package. It creates a more \nefficient grid, increases investment, and enhances consumer \nprotections. The amendment is supported by the administration as well \nas a number of stakeholders' groups such as the National Rural Electric \nCooperative.\n  I have a number of letters in support of the amendment and I ask \nunanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The purpose of this letter is to provide \n     the Administration's views on your proposed electricity \n     substitute amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2003. The \n     Administration applauds your efforts and leadership to ensure \n     that a balanced electricity title is included in the energy \n     bill under consideration by the Senate.\n       We support your substitute electricity amendment and \n     believe it will effectively modernize our Nation's antiquated \n     electricity laws. Your amendment promotes transmission \n     expansion, facilitates open access to the transmission \n     system, increases electricity supply, promotes energy \n     efficiency, improves reliability, encourages demand response, \n     and appropriately balances Federal and State \n     responsibilities.\n       Furthermore, we believe your amendment will protect \n     consumers and ensure that developing wholesale markets are \n     transparent and free of manipulation. Repealing the Public \n     Utility Holding Company Act (PUHCA) and reforming the Public \n     Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) will eliminate \n     outdated laws on the books and infuse much needed capital \n     into this sector.\n       The Administration applauds your commitment to passing \n     comprehensive energy legislation and looks forward to working \n     with you in conference to ensure the final bill reflects the \n     President's priorities as set forth in the National Energy \n     Policy and promotes energy and economic security for America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Spencer Abraham.\n\n[[Page S9997]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: I am writing to express my support \n     for your efforts to develop comprehensive energy legislation \n     and to share my views on some issues which I believe to be \n     critical to the establishment of a competitive electricity \n     market that will benefit our nation's consumers.\n       The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources with \n     your leadership has grappled with a number of complex and \n     contentious issues with respect to electricity. From my \n     perspective, the central issues at stake in the debate \n     surrounding the energy bill's electricity title involve the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (``FERC'') authority \n     over regional transmission organizations (``RTO''), its \n     proposed rules for the implementation of standard market \n     design (``SMD''), and the repeal of the Public Utility \n     Holding Company Act of 1935 (``PUHCA'').\n       As you know, in an effort to bring greater order to the \n     currently balkanized national grid, the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission issued FERC Order No. 2000, which \n     directed utilities with transmission assets within their \n     jurisdiction to join RTOs on a voluntary basis. Although FERC \n     Order No. 2000 contained permissive language with respect to \n     participation in an RTO, FERC maintains authority under the \n     Federal Power Act to mandate participation. While most \n     utilities have joined an RTO, some still have not, and the \n     FERC, in the interests of promoting open and competitive \n     interstate markets for electricity, may deem it necessary to \n     compel a utility's participation in an RTO. Further, FERC's \n     ability to mandate participation in an RTO serves as an \n     important remedy where a utility is found to have abused \n     market power. I am concerned that legislation might be \n     adopted to eviscerate this agency's existing authority and \n     thwart its efforts at promoting competition and a level \n     playing field. I encourage you to preserve the FERC's \n     authority with respect to RTOs.\n       I am also concerned about efforts to curtail the FERC's SMD \n     rules. As you are aware, the rulemaking that is presently \n     underway at the FERC seeks to establish a single cohesive set \n     of rules governing the procedures and pricing of the \n     transmission of electricity. SMD represents an important step \n     toward a truly seamless and competitive national grid. Any \n     delay in this effort would only slow our nation's progress \n     toward this important goal. I urge you to omit language \n     delaying the implementation of this rule from comprehensive \n     energy legislation.\n       I would also like to express my support for the repeal of \n     the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (``PUHCA''). \n     PUHCA was enacted to eliminate unfair practices and other \n     abuses by electricity and gas holding companies by requiring \n     federal control ad regulation of interstate public utility \n     holding companies. However, in the decades following the \n     passage of this Depression-era law, the proliferation of \n     federal, state, and local regulators and changes in market \n     conditions have led to questions regarding the relevance of \n     PUHCA in today's marketplace. As electricity markets have \n     grown more competitive, PUHCA has hampered investment in new \n     transmission lines, rendering our already taxed transmission \n     assets more burdened than they need be. PUHCA repeal, in \n     conjunction with reasonable safeguards for consumers, is an \n     essential ingredient in moving towards a competitive national \n     marketplace for electricity.\n       As you work to complete comprehensive energy legislation, I \n     urge you to resist efforts to curtail FERC efforts to promote \n     competition and support the repeal of PUHCA. Thank you for \n     your attention to this matter.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Peter G. Fitzgerald.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman: We are \n     writing to urge you to continue our nation's efforts to move \n     toward competitive wholesale electricity markets that will \n     benefit consumers and businesses. National competitive \n     markets, where multiple buyers and sellers can negotiate \n     bargains and pass cost savings along to consumers, are the \n     best approach to the challenges facing the electricity \n     industry.\n       We would like to bring to your attention a number of issues \n     addressed in the electricity title of the Senate Energy Bill \n     (S. 14) that have implications for residents and businesses \n     in the Northeast-Midwest region.\n       Delay of Standard Market Design--S. 14 and the proposed \n     substitute amendment delays the implementation of the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) standard market design \n     until July 2005. Electricity markets have outgrown state \n     boundaries. We are writing to express our concern with the \n     proposed delay of standard market design and the provision to \n     make participation in regional transmission organizations \n     voluntary. The delay has serious implications for residents \n     and businesses in the Northeast-Midwest region and throughout \n     the nation.\n       A standard market design would streamline the wholesale \n     electricity industry, encourage transmission investments and \n     move the lower 48 states toward a more competitive \n     electricity market. Congested power lines, which are the \n     result of the current electricity system, cost customers and \n     businesses throughout the United States billions of dollars \n     each year, whereas competitive wholesale power markets could \n     deliver billions of dollars in economic benefits.\n       Schwab Capital Markets detailed the importance of \n     standardized markets to increasing investment in our nation's \n     transmission grid and electricity generation. Testifying \n     before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Air Quality, \n     Christine Tezak with Schwab stated: ``We believe that capital \n     will be less expensive for all market participants if FERC \n     continues (and is permitted to continue) its efforts to \n     provide reasonably clear and consistent rules for this \n     business . . . Schwab WRG continues to view continued efforts \n     to move forward with the restructuring of the electricity \n     industry to be the best investment environment for the widest \n     variety of participants in the electricity marketplace--\n     whether they provide generation, transmission, distribution \n     or a combination of these services--and most importantly, the \n     most likely to provide sustained long-term benefits to \n     consumers.'' Further, Ms. Tezak stated: ``Congress needs to \n     decide whether or not it still believes in the 1992 Energy \n     Policy Act. Today, Congress is becoming an increasing part of \n     the reason capital is hard to attract to this business. \n     Congress is calling for FERC to slow down, Wall Street is \n     frustrated FERC won't move faster.''\n       S. 14 makes participation of Federal utilities in Regional \n     Transmission Organizations voluntary. Federal taxpayer \n     dollars were used to develop and maintain Federal power \n     marketing agencies such as the Tennessee Valley Authority and \n     Bonneville Power. The energy generated by these facilities \n     should benefit all Americans. TVA and Bonneville should be \n     required to participate in RTOs so communities throughout the \n     United States have access to the power generated at these \n     Federal facilities.\n       The Energy Bill must put national interest above the \n     interest of a few vertically-integrated utilities that want \n     to maintain regional monopolies. We encourage you to support \n     standardizing electricity markets and prevent further delay \n     of these efforts.\n       Participant Funding--S. 14 and the proposed substitute \n     amendment directs FERC to establish rules to ``ensure that \n     the costs of any transmission expansion or interconnection be \n     allocated in such a way that all users of the affected \n     transmission system bear the appropriate share of costs.'' \n     The language requires FERC to fairly align the costs and \n     benefits of transmission upgrades, a judgment that can \n     include a consideration of relevant local factors. This is \n     not only the most equitable approach but also the one most \n     likely to ensure that transmission development will keep pace \n     with growing electricity demand.\n       Combined Heat and Power--S. 14 currently contains the \n     ``Carper-Collins'' language which keeps in place incentives \n     to operate combined heat and power facilities until true \n     competition exists in electricity markets. This language \n     retains, for a limited time, the provisions of the Public \n     Utility Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA) which requires \n     utilities to provide back-up power and buy electricity from \n     qualifying combined heat and power facilities. As soon as \n     competitive electricity markets are established, these \n     requirements are repealed. Since combined heat and power \n     saves energy, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, increases \n     energy independence, and is good for the competitiveness \n     of American manufacturing, we urge you to retain such \n     provisions.\n       We urge you to complete the work Congress started with the \n     Energy Policy Act of 1992 to provide reliable, low-cost \n     electricity to customers. Please stand strong against \n     pressure to reverse course on Congress' efforts to establish \n     better working, competitive markets, and to continue working \n     towards competitive electricity markets.\n     Sincerely,\n     Jack Reed.\n     Olympia J. Snowe.\n     Edward M. Kennedy.\n     Arlen Specter.\n     Susan Collins.\n     Debbie Stabenow.\n     Frank R.

Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: On behalf of the American Public \n     Power Association (APPA), I want to express our strong \n     support for your substitute amendment for the electricity \n     title of S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003.\n       The substitute represents a balanced approach that makes \n     several improvements to the electricity title as it was \n     reported out of your Committee. In particular, APPA \n     appreciates your inclusion of additional consumer protections \n     by providing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) \n     with additional authority to review mergers while not \n     including inflexible time constraints upon FERC review of \n     merger applications. In addition, your substitute provides \n     clear direction to FERC to establish a policy on market-\n\n[[Page S9998]]\n\n     based rates that assures rates will be just and reasonable. \n     While we remain concerned over the repeal of the Public \n     Utility Holding Company Act, the inclusion of these \n     additional consumer protections helps to mitigate those \n     concerns.\n       We also commend you for your efforts in drafting service \n     obligation/native load language that preserves the existing \n     firm transmission rights of load-serving entities. APPA \n     strongly supports the service obligation/native load language \n     in your substitute as it equally protects the rights of \n     transmission owners and transmission dependent utilities.\n       Your substitute is a very carefully crafted package. While \n     we do not necessarily support each individual provision, we \n     do strongly support the compromise in its totality without \n     modification. In addition, we will ask APPA members to urge \n     their Senators to support your substitute. We anticipate that \n     you will resist changes to your substitute during floor \n     consideration and that you will support all aspects of the \n     substitute in the House-Senate conference.\n       We appreciate your efforts to improve the electricity title \n     and look forward to working further with you and your staff \n     to preserve the language in your substitute through \n     conference committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Alan H.

Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \n         Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: On behalf of the Large Power Public \n     Council (LPPC) I am writing to let you know that we support \n     the electricity substitute, without modification, which you \n     plan to offer during Senate consideration of the Energy \n     legislation.\n       We are grateful for your attention to our concerns and your \n     willingness to craft solutions to the problems of large \n     public power systems. It has been a pleasure working with you \n     and with your staff.\n       LPPC is comprised of 24 of the largest locally owned and \n     operated electric systems in the nation. LPPC members have \n     long supported a truly competitive electricity market that is \n     designed to benefit consumers. Your tireless efforts toward \n     that end deserve our endorsement.\n       As a separate matter, we would urge you to consider \n     favorably efforts to modernize TVA's organic statute.\n       Thank you again for your hard work. We look forward to \n     helping you pass this substitute next week on the Senate \n     floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Jan Schori,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Rural Electric\n\n\n                                      Cooperative Association,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 25, 2003.\n     Re Domenici amendment to the Electricity Title of S. 14.\n\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: The National Rural Electric \n     Cooperative Association (NRECA) supports passage of the \n     carefully crafted Domenici amendment without modification.\n       NRECA represents over nine hundred consumer-owned electric \n     cooperatives that serve more than 36,000,000 electric \n     consumers. Our priority in the national energy policy debate \n     is consumers. NRECA believes that S. 14, as modified by the \n     Domenici amendment, protects consumers while providing the \n     opportunity for growth and stability in competitive wholesale \n     electric markets.\n       The language in the Domenici amendment will protect \n     electric cooperatives from unnecessary costs and regulations. \n     Your amendment closely parallels the small utility provisions \n     included in last year's electricity title (HR 4).\n       The merger review language in your amendment establishes a \n     framework ensuring that utility mergers adequately protect \n     the public interest. This consumer protection package is \n     vitally important to offset the potential consequences of the \n     repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act.\n       We commend you for your work in the difficult drafting of \n     the service obligation and native load language that \n     preserves the existing firm transmission rights of load-\n     serving entities. NRECA supports the equal protection for the \n     rights of transmission owners and transmission dependent \n     utilities.\n       On behalf of electric consumers, NRECA urges adoption of \n     the Domenici amendment to S. 14 and applauds you for your \n     leadership.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Glenn English,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Over the past several years, \n     Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission have \n     struggled to create a definitive set of rules with respect to \n     establishing restructured wholesale electricity markets. As \n     state regulators from diverse regions of the country, we are \n     concerned that continued and prolonged uncertainty at the \n     federal level could ultimately impede our efforts to provide \n     reliable and affordable power to our states' homes and \n     businesses.\n       Positive steps in recent months taken by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission have begun to establish clear rules and \n     defined roles for market participants and stakeholder \n     organizations, opening the door for increased benefits in our \n     states for consumers and industries. FERC has been working \n     closely with state regulators, and in regional technical \n     conferences, to cooperatively develop the flexible tools \n     needed to strengthen our electric markets.\n       The U.S. Congress is positioned to empower the FERC to move \n     forward with necessary reforms by adopting language in S. 14, \n     The National Energy Policy Act that would promote the \n     development of wholesale markets and electricity grids. \n     Supporting the creation of dynamic wholesale power markets \n     could be one of the most significant legacies of this Act.\n       That said, as Congress considers the electricity title of \n     the National Energy Policy Act, we are concerned with two \n     specific points that are being raised in the debate on this \n     legislation:\n       1. There should be no language that would delay FERC's \n     efforts to develop rules governing the wholesale electricity \n     market, as these rules are essential to ensuring the creation \n     of robust wholesale markets that benefit consumers. Delay may \n     seem like a safe or appealing compromise, however, this will \n     undoubtedly lead to lengthy and costly regulatory and \n     judicial challenges that could impact pending docket items \n     and cost consumers millions of dollars. Congress should not \n     create further roadblocks to the regulatory process of \n     creating RTOs. States and regions, working with FERC, must \n     begin the formation of RTOs without delay.\n       2. We oppose any Congressional action that would make RTO \n     participation voluntary, as this would be harmful to existing \n     and emerging RTOs. FERC should be permitted to oversee the \n     process of RTO formation and serve as regional traffic cop to \n     ensure that consumers benefit from competition in terms of \n     competitive prices, increased choices, and improved services \n     and reliability.\n       America's electricity network is at a crossroads. \n     Individual states are moving forward, but the FERC must be \n     empowered to take the necessary steps to ensure our nation \n     has the electricity and transmission grid to meet the needs \n     of our states' consumers and industries. Wholesale markets \n     are putting downward pressure on prices and leading to \n     greater investment in infrastructure and supply, resulting in \n     greater reliability. We encourage Congress to adopt national \n     energy legislation that would advance the nation's electric \n     systems and the development of RTOs.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our thoughts and \n     concerns. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have \n     any questions regarding this issue or the perspective and \n     views of our states.\n           Sincerely,\n       Thomas L.

Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: I am writing to express MidAmerican \n     Energy Holding Company's unqualified support for the \n     substitute electricity title you have developed for the \n     comprehensive energy bill, MidAmerican is a diversified \n     energy company operating in twenty-five states, with electric \n     and gas utility, interstate natural gas pipeline, renewable \n     energy, and independent generation operations.\n       These electricity modernization provisions will create a \n     more efficient electricity grid, increase investment in \n     utility infrastructure, and enhance our nation's consumer \n     protection laws. The United States' electricity system \n     desperately needs new infrastructure to support the \n     competitive wholesale electricity markets that the Energy \n     Policy Act of 1992 created. By eliminating existing barriers \n     to investment and clarifying the regulatory landscape, the \n     provisions of this title will help open the doors to new \n     capital entering the industry.\n       We strongly support your efforts and oppose any amendments \n     that would upset this carefully balanced proposal. Having \n     spent much of the last ten years working to help build \n     consensus on the need to modernize our electricity laws, I \n     hope the Senate will move quickly to approve the substitute \n     electricity title and the comprehensive energy bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David L.

Joining NERC in support of the \n     reliability language are the following: American Electric \n     Power, American Public Power Association, Canadian \n     Electricity Association, Edison Electric Institute, Institute \n     of Electrical and Electronics Engineers--USA, National \n     Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, National \n     Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates, National \n     Electrical Manufacturers Association, National Rural Electric \n     Cooperative Association, Pepco Holdings, Inc., Transmission \n     Access Policy Study Group, TXU Corporation, Western \n     Electricity Coordinating Council, and the Western Governors \n     Association.\n       These provisions meet the fundamental need for \n     establishment of a system of mandatory and enforceable \n     reliability rules applicable to all users, owners, and \n     operators of the North American bulk power grid. The \n     provisions build on the existing voluntary reliability system \n     by authorizing an independent, industry-led organization to \n     set and enforce such mandatory reliability rules, subject to \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversight in the United \n     States.\n       The legislative provisions are carefully crafted to bring \n     the expertise of industry to bear in the formulation, \n     implementation, and ultimately enforcement of the reliability \n     rules. The amendment in the nature of a substitute adds a \n     savings clause to the reliability language clarifying that \n     the Electric Reliability Organization provided for in the \n     legislation will not be considered an agency of the United \n     States Government. We support that addition. That \n     clarification is fully consistent with the determinations \n     already made regarding the functions to be exercised by the \n     Electric Reliability Organization in the new mandatory \n     reliability system.\n       We commend you for your commitment to passage of this vital \n     legislation before the upcoming Congressional recess, and \n     look forward to working with you to support enactment of the \n     reliability language as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michehl R. Gent,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Interstate Natural Gas\n\n\n                                       Association of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Interstate Natural Gas Association \n     of America (INGAA) wants to thank you for your tenacious \n     efforts to move comprehensive energy legislation through the \n     Senate. We believe that the Energy Policy Act of 2003 (S. 14) \n     strikes a fair balance between energy efficiency, \n     environmental protection, and the need for increased energy \n     resources. This legislation will also play an important role \n     in addressing the nation's tight natural gas supply \n     situation, and INGAA urges its swift adoption.\n       As you know, North America is blessed with abundant natural \n     gas supplies. Unfortunately, conflicting government policy \n     has both encouraged the increased use of natural gas, while \n     hindering the further development of natural gas supplies and \n     infrastructure. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \n     has observed, the conflict between increasing demand and \n     decreasing supply has to be resolved in some way, and it is \n     currently being resolved through higher natural gas prices.\n       INGAA strongly supports your efforts to increase natural \n     gas exploration and production on federal lands. We also \n     support your provisions regarding natural gas market \n     transparency and prohibitions on fraudulent and/or \n     manipulative trading practices, which will help to restore \n     stability and confidence to the market. With respect to \n     natural gas infrastructure, INGAA supports provisions \n     encouraging the construction of an Alaska natural gas \n     pipeline and the development of new LNG importation \n     facilities.\n       We appreciate the comprehensive approach you have taken in \n     addressing natural gas supply and infrastructure needs. INGAA \n     will continue supporting your efforts to enact balanced \n     energy policy legislation during the current session of \n     Congress. Please let us know if we assist in your efforts.\n           Respectfully,\n                                             Donald F. Santa, Jr.,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete Domenici,\n      Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Natural Gas Supply Association \n     (NGSA) and the Independent Petroleum Association of America \n     (IPAA) representing the majority of natural gas producers in \n     the United States want to take this opportunity to comment on \n     your legislative proposal to ban fraud and manipulative \n     behavior during the reporting of natural gas transactions to \n     energy price indices.\n       As you know from our previous communications, we have been \n     working hard to find workable solutions for greater market \n     transparency, which should enhance the confidence of \n     stakeholders in the natural gas markets. In fact, the \n     industry has been successful in crafting an industry \n     consensus document (also referred to as the ``Kennesaw \n     agreement'') supported by many stakeholders in the natural \n     gas market. Attached is a copy of that document.\n       We fully support your desire to bring greater transparency \n     to the energy markets, prevent manipulative behavior in those \n     markets, and punish those that knowingly and willfully report \n     false information. Consequently, we support your proposal and \n     look forward to working with you to ensure that the energy \n     marketplace reflects these objectives.\n           Sincerely,\n       Independent Petroleum Association of America.\n       Natural Gas Supply Association.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. There is a letter from the Secretary of Energy:\n\n       We support your substitute electricity amendment and \n     believe it will effectively modernize our Nation's antiquated \n     electricity laws.\n\n  There is also a letter from Senator Fitzgerald of Illinois. There is \nanother letter that talks about the amendment. It is signed by eight \nSenators who are looking more for the effects of a competitive \nwholesale electric system, and a standard market design. They are \nsupporting what is done with respect to the standard market design.\n  Another letter is from the American Public Power Association. It \nsays:\n\n       . . . I want to express our strong support for your \n     substitute amendment . . .\n\n  They are a very important player, of course, in this.\n  The Large Public Power Council also says:\n\n       . . . we support the electricity substitute, without \n     modification . . .\n\n  According to this group, we do not get into trying to make a number \nof changes now.\n  The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, which, of \ncourse, serves more than 36 million electric consumers, particularly \nfor those of us who live in rural States, supports the passage of the \ncarefully drafted Domenici amendment without modification.\n  We also have a letter from the Interstate Natural Gas Association of \nAmerica. Remember that natural gas people have a real interest in this \nas well in terms of the generation of electric power. They say:\n\n       We believe that the Energy Policy Act of 2003 strikes a \n     fair balance between energy efficiency, environmental \n     protection, and the need for increased energy resources.\n\n  America's Oil and Gas Producers Independent Petroleum Association, \nthe American Gas Association, all of these groups are in complete \nsupport of moving ahead with the amendment without modification. I \nthink it is pretty impressive that all of these groups are in support, \nsuch as the North American Electric Reliability Council, which is the \none that has to do with reliability. So these are some of the areas \nthat are covered and are supported on this particular amendment.\n  I know this is detailed and lengthy, but this is a very important \naspect and a very important element. It is something that has been \nworked on for a couple of years, by both the committee and on the \nfloor. This whole title having to do with the electricity part of \nenergy has been redrafted and this institution will bring it together \nso that hopefully we can move forward with very few, if any, \namendments, to this section.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished \npresiding Senator, the great Senator from the State of Alaska. I had \nthe privilege of visiting his State en route to China with the majority \nleader a couple months ago. We used, as a convenient place for \nrefueling, the Air Force base in Anchorage. That is a wonderful land \nthe Presiding Officer comes from. It\n\n[[Page S10000]]\n\nwas a great privilege to visit, especially with our troops that are \nproviding for the defense of our country.\n  Speaking of that, I continue to be amazed at the courage and the \nability of our men and women in uniform in service to this country and \nthose not in uniform in places such as Iraq, where I visited 2 weeks \nago. In talking with those soldiers, anyone could see how dedicated \nthey are. At the same time, we recognize those soldiers are \nuncomfortable. It is hot, 120 degrees, and it is dangerous.\n  As a matter of fact, we see the effects of premeditated \nassassination, the so-called resistance. It is taking form in three \ndifferent ways. It is extremely lethal. Indeed, over the past week, on \nthe average, two of our American soldiers per day have been murdered, \nsome of them by RPGs, rocket-propelled grenades, often fired into \narmored convoys; some of them by landmines detonated by remote control \ndevice placed usually where the road narrows; and some of them purely \nby assassination with a small handgun, as in the case of the Florida \nsoldier killed the night before I arrived. The Florida soldier was \npulling guard duty. A delegation had gone into the university and they \nwere protecting them, looking out for their interests. In the midst of \nthe melee, someone in the crowd comes up behind him and taps him on the \nshoulder. He turns around and they shoot him in that unprotected area \nabove the body armor and below the helmet.\n  This is the kind of premeditated assassination we see. It is clearly \nmy hope, and the hope of everyone, that we would have some diminution \nof this killing as the Saddam Hussein regime is brought to account now \nwith the demise of the two sons and along with what I think will be the \ncapture--whether alive or not, I don't know--of Saddam Hussein himself.\n  Iraq has become a place, as reports in the press have indicated, \nwhere others are coming into Iraq to try to do damage to American \ninterests. So it is going to cause us to be all the more vigilant. \nClearly, the stakes have never been higher for the United States to \nstabilize Iraq, both politically and economically, just as we need to \ndo so in Afghanistan in our war against terror.\n\n  I came here today to speak on the Energy bill which is before us. I \nwant to discuss this issue that not only affects the lives of every \nAmerican but also impacts the Nation's security. That is what we are \ndebating, energy policy. These energy issues we are going to be \ndebating this week affect everyone. They affect the air we breathe. The \npolicy affects the cars we drive, the lights that illuminate our lives, \nand the electricity bills we pay.\n  I would like to be able to go home this August, after we recess, and \ntell people in my home State of Florida that the Senate made a \ndifference, that we have changed some of the energy policy so that we \nare going to, hopefully, have more efficient homes and more efficient \ncars and cleaner air and, most importantly, more peace of mind. It is \nmy hope what this Senate will do is decrease our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  I served in the House of Representatives years ago. I had come into \nthe Congress in 1978. We were in an energy shortage. A bunch of nations \non the other side of planet Earth had joined a cartel and decided to \nreduce production. That had caused panic buying, it caused the price of \nenergy--the price of oil--to go way up. The United States, as it was \ntrying to enact an energy policy at the time, looking for alternative \nfuels, looking toward encouraging renewable sources of energy such as \nwind and Sun, also did something else. We have salt domes underneath \nthe ground, down in Louisiana. We started filling those salt domes with \na strategic petroleum reserve so we would be able to tap into an \ninstantly ready source of oil if the spigot in those foreign lands was \nshut off. What is the likelihood of that in the future?\n  A study of military history will teach us about certain chokepoints, \ngeographical chokepoints. For example, the Straits of Gibraltar are \nconsidered a military chokepoint. Let me tell you about one of the most \ndramatic chokepoints I ever saw, and I saw it from the window of a \nspacecraft, 203 miles above the Earth as our ground track on the orbit \ncame right down the Persian Gulf, looking straight down at the Strait \nof Hormuz, a 19-mile-wide area, a chokepoint, a military chokepoint of \nthe Persian Gulf, that 19-mile-wide strait through which most of the \nsupertankers of the world have to pass.\n  Talk about a target for a terrorist. Indeed, the Strait of Hormuz--if \nthe terrorists were ever to be successful in sinking a couple of \nsupertankers there, you can imagine what would happen to the flow of \nthe oil to the industrialized world. We would immediately be in crisis.\n  Are we going to continue to rely on foreign oil for our daily \nconsumption?\n  Remember back a while, we made a commitment that we would stabilize \nour greenhouse gas emissions. That was done over 10 years ago. I hope \nnow the Senate has decided to make good on that promise and put in \nplace a climate change policy and a modest cap and trade system that is \ngoing to help us stop our ever increasing emission of harmful \npollutants into our fragile atmosphere.\n  I am somewhat amused and perplexed that there continues this debate \nover whether or not global warming is real. About 98 percent of the \nscientists say it is real. If you come from a State such as mine, \nFlorida, with its hundreds and hundreds of miles of coastline, you had \nbetter be prepared for it being real. Yet almost all of those \naffected--the business industry, the insurance industry--are ignoring \nthe fact the climate on planet Earth is warming.\n\n  Let me tell you what that will do for a place such as Florida. As the \nseas rise, as the temperature rises, the coastal areas are threatened. \nThey are threatened not only by the rise of the level of the sea but by \nthe rise of the level in temperature which brings about much more \nviolent storms and much greater plague and pestilence.\n  So often we do not confront a problem until it is upon us. Yet the \nfact is, global warming is upon us. So what should we do? We should be \nconcerned about that outer layer of the atmosphere, of it having the \nappropriate environmental ability to deflect the ultraviolet rays that \ncome into the atmosphere and eat up the atmosphere. Emissions from \nfossil fuel burning go into the atmosphere, and they start to diminish \nthat ozone layer which protects against the ultraviolet rays, the \nresult of which is that it has this greenhouse effect on planet Earth, \nstarting to warm up the planet.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to have to face the music. That is what \nis happening to our planet. Yet are we enacting governmental policies \nthat will protect us? That is what I am hoping, that we will have a \nSenate that will stand up, before the heat of this August recess, and \nsay we are going to do something about it.\n  I would also like to go home this August and say to my constituents \nthat, although we have been talking about diversifying our fuel sources \nfor years, we are now starting to make progress; we have tax credits; \nwe have tax incentives; we have loan guarantees; we have renewable \nportfolio standards in place to spur production and use of clean and \nrenewable fuels. I hope this is possible because we are living in \nhistoric times and the policies we enact should reflect the gravity of \nthe issues we face.\n  I am intrigued that all across this land, particularly in areas of \nhigh wind velocity, now we are building wind farms. To farmers, a wind \nfarm can now be a profitable venture, leasing their land for the \nerection of high-technology windmills that will generate electricity.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to figure out how to harness another \nmajor source of energy, the energy of the tides of the ocean.\n  We already know how to harness the energy of the sun. Everything here \nis a question of economics. Is it economical to do so? It is, the more \nthe price of oil goes up. As the cost of oil goes up because of \ndiminishing supply--be that just by virtue of time or be that by virtue \nof interdiction of that supply such as a terrorist sinking a \nsupertanker or whatever the reason is--we ought to be looking to these \nalternative and renewable fuels.\n  Over and over again, Members of the Senate and Members of the House \nhave decried the fact that our Nation's energy consumption is held \nhostage by the oil production of these other nations, some of which we \ndon't get along\n\n[[Page S10001]]\n\nwith too well. That should bother us. It should make us want to enact \npolicies we know will lessen our consumption of foreign oil.\n  (Mrs. DOLE assumed the Chair.)\n  I would like to go home this August and tell our constituents we are \nenacting changes in those policies, and we are going to protect \nourselves.\n  I see our new Presiding Officer, the great Senator from the State of \nNorth Carolina. I will never forget when I was in the House and one of \nthe first wind energy systems was built in Boone, NC. This is going \nback 20 years. I will never forget it. Everybody was upset because the \nmore the windmill turned, the more it disrupted the television coverage \nin Boone, NC. But today we have the benefit of propeller technology in \nthe placing of these wind energy systems, which are these tall \nwindmills with propellers which are as sophisticated in their design as \nthose for airplanes. So we don't have to have all of that outcry that \noccurred in Boone two decades ago. Boone, NC was a pioneer. It was part \nof a NASA research project. We were looking for opportunities other \nthan the consumption of foreign oil then. We are doing a lot better in \nour technology today. But we have to enact policies that will wean us \nfrom our dependence on that foreign oil.\n  One policy that has a proven track record for decreasing our \nconsumption of oil is increasing the miles per gallon on our \nautomobiles. It has a fancy name. It is called Corporate Average Fuel \nEconomy, otherwise known as CAFE. From 1975 to 1985, when CAFE or the \nmileage-per-gallon increases were mandated, we dramatically lowered our \nconsumption of foreign oil.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences, the increase in fuel \neconomy standards in that decade, 1975-1985, saved--get this--43 \nbillion gallons of gasoline, which is the equivalent of 2.8 million \nbarrels of oil per day. But since 1985, our Nation's fuel economy has \nstagnated, and our consumption of foreign oil has skyrocketed. Indeed, \nbetween 1990 and 1999, oil consumption in the United States rose 15 \npercent and, unfortunately, American oil imports from foreign lands \nrose 40 percent. Why? Because we stopped requiring increases in fuel \neconomy standards.\n  In our last few attempts to restart the program, we were stopped by a \ncombination of very powerful lobbying groups. One of them--the \nautomobile makers--said they could not do it. They said it was going to \ncost jobs. They said it was going to decrease consumer choice and that \nit was going to hurt vehicle safety. But that is exactly what they said \nin the 1970s. The auto makers successfully rose to the challenge then, \nand they can successfully rise to that challenge now. In fact, the \nincrease in the fuel economy standards helped the auto makers stay \ncompetitive with their Japanese competitors in the 1970s and the 1980s. \nSmaller vehicles did not take over their fleets as they predicted. \nEighty-five percent of the historical fuel economy gains came from \ntechnology with no impact on the vehicle weight or the vehicle size.\n\n  I encourage this Senate on the eve of us going home to be forward \nthinking and not backward looking. This is the 21st century. We know \nthat American auto manufacturers have the technological capability to \nincrease CAFE standards and to maintain safety without denying the \nAmerican public any choices in the type of vehicle they drive. It can \nbe done. We just have to have the will to do it.\n  The American people, after this traumatic experience of losing over \n3,000 people on September 11 of 2001, clearly have a renewed desire to \nsee their Members of Congress act in the best interests of national \nsecurity. Is weaning ourselves from our dependence on oil from foreign \nlands in the interest of national security? Can you imagine what our \nMiddle East policy would be if we didn't have to import oil from the \nPersian Gulf region? Our foreign policy would be a lot easier to \nconduct.\n  Senator Durbin is going to have an amendment that will require cars \nand SUVs and minivans and cross-over utility vehicles to achieve CAFE \nstandards of 40 miles per gallon by when, by next year? No. By 2015. \nThat would be 11 or 12 years from now. It would require by the same \nyear of 2015 trucks and vans to have a mile-per-gallon standard of 27.5 \nmiles per gallon. It can be done. I certainly urge our colleagues here \nto support Senator Durbin's amendment.\n  I guess one of the bigger disappointments I have had legislatively in \nthe 2\\1/2\\ years I have been in the Senate is that we can't come \ntogether and recognize something that has so much common sense. We \nalready have hybrid vehicles driving around getting 50-plus miles per \ngallon, and they get it not only on the open road but they get it in \ncity driving. That is because the technology has developed to the point \nwhere a computer will switch that engine from a gasoline engine over to \nan electric engine and back and forth.\n  When we are using the gasoline engine we are powering the battery so \nthe electric engine can be used, and it goes back and forth without any \nnotice to the driver or the passenger and with no diminution on the \nelectrical needs of the automobile and no diminution on any sane driver \nwho doesn't want to squeal their wheels at every stoplight. The \ntechnology is there.\n  I urge the Senate to go beyond with technology.\n  On board every space shuttle is a machine that makes electricity. It \nmakes electricity from a combination of two fuels: hydrogen and oxygen. \nAnd it has as a byproduct--water. As a matter of fact, so much water is \nproduced that at the end of every flight day, the crews will have to \ndump excess water. It is amazing, when you dump that water out into the \ncold vacuum of space, you see that dumped water spray out, and all of a \nsudden those water particles crystallize. In the glint of the sunlight, \nit is a beautiful view.\n  But what started this process was that we were making electricity on \nboard for the space shuttle with the fuel of hydrogen. We can do the \nsame to power our vehicles. We know most of our consumption of energy \nis done in the transportation sector--airplanes, trains, buses, cars, \nships. We know most of the consumption of that energy is automobiles \nand trucks. So can you imagine, if we would put our minds to it--just \nlike we put our minds to it when President Kennedy said: We are going \nto the moon and back within the decade of the 1960s--and we did it--can \nyou imagine, if we would put our minds to it, in an Apollo-like \nprogram, if we developed a hydrogen engine that was cheap enough that \ncould power our automobiles, the new ones, and the trucks? The \ntechnology is there. The capability is there. The application of the \nnew technologies can bring the cost down. The only thing we are lacking \nis the will.\n  Can you imagine if, suddenly, we did not have this dependence on \nforeign, imported oil how much freer the United States would be in our \nconduct around the world, in our military policy, in our foreign \npolicy, in our ability to be self-sustaining in our own energy needs, \nand not giving up any of the creature comforts that we Americans are so \nblessed to have to our advantage? Yet when we get to a vote on some of \nthese items on this Energy bill, we may get beat. I just simply do not \nunderstand that.\n  So I am pleading with our colleagues in the Senate, as we debate this \nEnergy bill, let's think about America in the future, over the course \nof the next decade, over the course of the next 25 years. Let's think \nabout the decisionmakers on this floor in future decades and what we \nare shackling them with as a matter of military and foreign policy if \nwe do not break our habit of depending on foreign oil. We can do it. We \njust have to have the will.\n  Madam President, I thank you for this opportunity to share these \nideas. Unless the manager of the bill wants otherwise, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I am pleased that we are able to go \nahead and talk about energy. I must say, I am not as pleased by the \nfact that we seem to be holding things up a bit. We have been on this \nissue now for 2 years. We have also, this year, already been on the \nSenate floor for 10 or 12 days on this issue.\n  Last year, we were not able to complete the Energy bill because it \nwas pulled out of committee. We did not go through the committee. This \nyear, we\n\n[[Page S10002]]\n\nwent through the whole process in committee. We brought forth a bill \nthat was approved by the committee. Now we find ourselves, however, \nheld up because somebody objects to moving forward.\n  Really, we have a week to do a job that deals with one of the most \nimportant bills we have before us. Frankly, it is discouraging when we \nfind obstacles to moving forward simply because somebody has to wait \nuntil they get here on the Senate floor before an amendment can be \noffered. In any event, that is where we are. I object to the obstacles \nthat are being put forward to the idea that we ought to move forward \nwith this bill.\n  In any event, let me talk just generally about the bill. The Senator \nfrom Florida has talked about some of the needs that are required. \nThere is nothing more important to our economy, to employment, and to \nour families in this country than energy. We have an opportunity to \ndeal with some of the problems that obstruct us from moving forward \nwith energy. We seem to become all wrapped up in little regional \npolitical issues that keep us from accomplishing the goal of moving \nforward, and it is frustrating. But there is a need to have a policy \nthat moves us forward.\n  One of the things, of course, we hear about more than anything else, \nin terms of energy, is natural gas. We had our Federal Reserve Chairman \nhere to talk about the need for gas supply and the potential shortage \nof gas we anticipate, partly because of the need for air-conditioning \nin the heat of summer and, certainly, the need for heat in the cold of \nwinter. So natural gas is one of the things we have talked about the \nmost.\n  Quite frankly, there are some opportunities for increased domestic \nproduction of gas. The idea of importing gas is not, in my view, the \nbest solution. We have an opportunity to have domestic production. We \ncan do that. That is partly what this bill is about. We have provisions \nin the finance section of this bill that are incentives for production.\n  We also find that we have a substantial amount of natural gas \nresources in the West. Much of it is on Federal land. We find \nourselves, however, inhibited by the permitting process and the time it \ntakes to do permitting in order to get gas on to the market. That is an \narea of potential. We can do that and, at the same time, protect the \nenvironment. We have already shown we can do that.\n  There has to be a movement of gas from the source to the supplier. \nThat requires pipelines. It is very clear that some of these things \nneed to be done.\n  This bill is a comprehensive and balanced bill. It deals with \nconservation. The Senator from Florida was talking about CAFE \nstandards, but we have been through CAFE standards a number of times. \nThere will be bills on the Senate floor that have to do with CAFE \nstandards, and we will be supporting the movement of CAFE standards.\n  This bill talks about alternative sources of energy, which is \nsomething we ought to be looking at, whether they be wind or sun or \nhydrogen. The President has in his budget proposal over $1 billion to \ndo research on hydrogen. Well, it is great to talk about hydrogen and \nto talk about using those types of automobiles, but we are not ready \nfor that. Not only do we not have the system to produce it, we do not \nhave the distribution system. But we will have it, and it is something \nwe ought to work on. It is already in the process; it isn't as if it is \na brand-new idea. We are looking for some opportunities to use the coal \nsupply to develop hydrogen, which would give us a fuel more easily \nmoved about than coal. Hydrogen can be made from coal. So there is a \ngood deal of attention in this bill for alternatives.\n  We talk about conservation, alternatives, and also research and \ncleanliness in our energy supply. Again, coal is the largest fossil \nfuel supply we have in this country.\n  We need to continue to work on clean coal. We need good air quality. \nThere is a good deal of money in this bill for moving forward.\n  One of the problems with our gas supply is, over the last number of \nyears the 30 plants that have been developed for electric generation \nare all gas fired. On the other hand, coal is really, for a number of \nreasons, probably the best source. You can see that in prices, in the \nsupply available. But still, because of not having a policy, we have \nused small gas plants close to the market and have used the wrong fuel.\n  We need domestic production. Sixty percent of our oil is brought in \nfrom other places. We can do something about that. We can do it with \ndomestic production and other uses.\n  Certainly, this bill also addresses the modernization of the system \nof electricity, the modernization of the system of oil and gas. That is \none of the most vital issues before us, to get a policy and a plan to \nmove forward to make sure that energy is available, to the extent \npossible, domestically and that we don't depend on other countries for \noil.\n  Wyoming, of course, is a State that has a good deal of energy \nresources. A number of years ago, I attended a meeting. Someone was \nthere from England saying: We have never run out of a fuel. That is \ninteresting, isn't it? We started with wood. We moved to coal. We moved \nto others. But after a while, we always find some other fuel to go \nforward. That is part of the science and research that is in this bill, \nso that as we find shortages, as we find more efficiencies, we can move \nforward into other kinds of opportunities.\n  I hope we can move forward and are not held up excessively to get the \njob done. It is here. We have a challenge to get it done this week. We \nhave already discussed all these issues. We should be able to come to a \ndecision on those issues that are still controversial, or, where there \nare different views, everyone who has a different view should be able \nto express that and vote on them when we have to. But we need to move \nforward. The idea that we are unable to get together to move seems to \nme to be inconsistent with the purpose of our being here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am a member of the Energy Committee \nalong with my colleague from Wyoming. I happen to share his desire to \nget the Energy bill done. With regard to the statement by the majority \nleader that it is going to have to be done this week, with the number \nof amendments out there and the difficulty we have, it is very unlikely \nit will get done this week. My hope is that we can find a way to move \nmost of the way down the road, and understand that, if necessary, when \nwe come back we will finish it quickly.\n  We need to get an Energy bill to the President's desk on a timely \nbasis. It should not be just any Energy bill. It has to be an Energy \nbill that works, one that advances the interests of America. We have 5 \ndays in the workweek. We end on Friday. Today the chairman and ranking \nmember are both out for a funeral. That is something no one can \ncontrol. So at least much of today is not going to be particularly \nproductive in advancing the bill.\n  Given what we are going to face this winter in natural gas prices, \ngiven the problems we have in a range of areas, it would be in the \ninterest of the country, Republicans and Democrats, to finish an Energy \nbill.\n  Let me mention a couple things we need to do in a serious way. Simply \nto paste together an electricity title and say, let's get it out there \nand get it voted on--if you missed what happened in California and this \n``restructuring'' notion that has been around, you missed one of the \nlargest bilking of consumers ever to occur. A circumstance existed in \nCalifornia where some companies were able to control supplies and, as a \nresult of controlling and manipulating supplies and recreating \ncongestion, they bilked California and west coast consumers to the tune \nof billions of dollars.\n  We need some consumer protection. I need to understand what the \nelectricity title does. This headlong rush to restructure in \nelectricity is one that can pose some significant problems for \nconsumers. Restructuring means you will move electricity around the \ncountry from low-cost areas to high-cost areas and replace electricity \nfrom low-cost areas with more expensive electricity. Studies I have \nseen tell us that rural States such as North Dakota and others are \ngoing to lose and will have to pay much higher costs for electricity. \nPerhaps if we are past the urge\n\n[[Page S10003]]\n\nto restructure and to create the circumstance that allowed what \nhappened on the west coast, particularly in California, we can have an \nelectricity title that really works for energy and for consumers.\n  There are four steps to this bill that are necessary. One is to \nincentivize production. I agree with my colleague from Wyoming. Oil, \nnatural gas, coal--all can and will play a significant role in our \nfuture. We should incentivize that in thoughtful ways. If debate on the \nEnergy bill this year becomes a debate about ANWR and CAFE, then the \nAmerican people lose. These are just two hood-ornament debates, and we \nwill lose.\n  What we need to do is find a way to pole-vault over what we have been \ndoing and do something dramatically different in the future.\n  I introduced the first bill this year, before the President called \nfor it in his State of the Union Address, to move us towards a hydrogen \nfuel cell future. We have been putting gasoline through America's \ncarburetors for almost a century. If our future is to find a way to \nkeep putting gasoline through carburetors and debate how efficient they \nare, in my judgment we don't have much of a future with respect to \nenergy; we will always be dependent on finding energy from off our \nshores.\n\n  Fifty-five percent of the oil is now found outside our borders, much \nof it from very troubled areas of the world. We could wake up one \nmorning and discover that the supply of oil coming in has been \ninterrupted by the concerted act of terrorists, and we could find our \neconomy flat on its back, because the American economy runs on energy. \nThe assured future supply of energy is essential to jobs and economic \nopportunity. Fifty-five percent of our oil now comes from offshore. \nThat is set to go to 68 percent. It is an unforgivable dereliction of \nduty if we policymakers don't decide that that has to change. That is \ndangerous to our future, and we must change it.\n  How do we do it? Four steps: Incentivize additional production in a \nthoughtful way and compatible with our environmental interests. Two, \npromote conservation. We waste an enormous amount of energy. \nConservation should be a significant part of any Energy bill. Three, an \nefficiency title that provides efficiencies with respect to all those \nappliances we use every single day. And four, the development of \nincentives for limitless and renewable sources of energy.\n  Let me talk for a moment about that because that is one of the \nreasons I believe so strongly this bill must move. I am a big believer \nin wind energy. My State is ranked No. 1 by the Department of Energy in \nwind energy potential. We understand that the new turbines with which \nyou can take energy from the wind and turn it into electricity are much \nmore effective and much more efficient than they have ever been in the \npast. The ability to put up a 1-megawatt turbine and take energy from \nthe air and turn it into electricity and put it on the line and use it \nto extend the energy supply makes great sense. It is nonpolluting. It \nis available wherever the wind blows. That makes great sense.\n  The problem is, we have a lot of interests and a lot of projects on \nwind energy on the drawing boards ready to go, and we have this \nproduction tax credit that starts and stops and starts and stops, that \nis available for a year, 2 years, 3 years--maybe 1 year, and by the \ntime it is implemented, if you put a new 3-year provision in, you may \nonly get a year and a half or 2 years out of it because by the time the \nbill is implemented, you have already wasted part of that.\n  For those who are interested in developing these new sources of \nenergy, renewable and limitless sources of energy, this Congress ought \nto pass an Energy bill, and that Energy bill should have a 5-year \nextension on the production tax credit. This one only has 3. \nNonetheless, whether it is 3 or 5, you need to get a bill passed in \norder for that to be part of the calculation of those who have projects \non the boards and want to build these projects.\n\n  Speaking for me, although I regret I don't think we will be able to \nfinish the Energy bill this week, I want an Energy bill. I want one \nthat works. I want a good bill, one that goes to the White House for \nsignature. I don't know what we are going to get done this week. I know \ntoday, as I said, the chairman and ranking member are necessarily \nabsent for a funeral. Tomorrow there is a meeting at the White House \nthat, I suppose, will take an hour and a half or 2 hours out of the day \nfor Energy Committee members. There are a series of things going on. I \nfeel strongly we need to send some signals to our country, to the \nAmerican people, that we are putting together policies for the future.\n  I mentioned a moment ago that a hydrogen fuel cell future is very \nimportant for our country. This Congress passed my amendment--frankly, \nI was surprised by it--that said let's set targets and timetables for \nthis. We all say use hydrogen, which is ubiquitous--use it to power \nfuel cells and then to power our vehicles. It is twice as efficient in \ngetting power to the wheel as putting gasoline through a carburetor. So \nlet's do that, we say. In order to do that, you cannot decide tomorrow \nthat is going to happen because we are still in the development stage \nof fuel cells. There are fuel cells that are commercially available and \noperating. I have ridden on a fuel cell bus, driven a fuel cell car run \nby hydrogen. They exist, but they still literally are in the \ndevelopmental stage.\n  Then, in addition to deciding here is our future, you have to do a \nnumber of other things. You have to deal with the issues of the \nproduction of hydrogen, exactly how to produce it and from what. There \nare a series of opportunities. You can produce it from natural gas or \nfrom coal. You can take electricity from the wind and use the \nelectricity in electrolysis and separate hydrogen from oxygen and water \nand pull the hydrogen out of the water.\n  In addition to production, you have storage, transportation, and \ninfrastructure. Who will build the service stations where you can fill \nup with hydrogen? These are things I think will last some while in \nterms of their early stages to solve and to create an infrastructure \nthat leads us to a new energy day. The President spoke about it in the \nState of the Union Address. Prior to that, I offered legislation in the \nCongress calling for a fuel cell hydrogen future. So I embrace the \nPresident's goals. In fact, I significantly enhanced them with my \ncolleagues on the Energy Committee, nearly tripling the amount of money \nthe President suggested. I got the full Senate to set targets and \ntimetables--150,000 vehicles by 2010, 2 million vehicles by 2020--\nsaying let's set targets and timetables, instead of saying 20 years \nfrom now, where are we, and saying that is where we are. We need to set \nup a road map and say, here is what we as a country aspire to do, here \nis what we aspire to achieve for our country's energy future.\n  The reason using a hydrogen fuel cell economy to solve this country's \nenergy future is important is these significant increases in energy use \nin the country are through transportation--particularly vehicles, but \ntransportation. That is where the line is. That is the line that is \ngoing up. With CAFE standards, which we will debate on the floor of the \nSenate, people will say, let's solve that line that goes up with more \nefficient carburetors or engines. Look, I am for more efficient \ncarburetors and engines, but that will not solve the problem, as long \nas we have gasoline that costs less than bottled water. By the way, you \ncan do that with an SUV. You may have four kids in the back and you \ndrive up to the gas station and buy gas and then buy bottled water for \nthe occupants in the car. Per gallon, it will cost you more for the \nwater. As long as gasoline costs more than water, people are going to \nwant to drive 5,000-pound vehicles.\n\n  The fact is, they are going to want to drive the big vehicles. That \nis a fact. That is what is happening in this country. The conversion \nhas been quite extraordinary. Although I think CAFE standards are \nuseful, and it is a provocative debate, and to the extent we can \nencourage additional efficiencies with internal combustion engines and \ncarburetors through which all of the gasoline flows, that is fine, but \nthat is not going to solve the problem of the increasing transportation \nline of energy usage. As long as we import most of our oil, with much \nof it coming from troubled parts of the world, this country is held \nhostage. How do you resolve that? You pole-vault to a different ground, \nit seems to me.\n  After three-quarters to one whole century of putting gasoline through\n\n[[Page S10004]]\n\ncarburetors, I agree with the President; let's decide to have a \ndifferent energy future and use hydrogen and fuel cells that are twice \nas efficient as now exist in getting power to the wheel from an \ninternal combustion engine. Let's use the fuel cells and hydrogen as a \nfuel source and have our children and grandchildren be able to escape \nbeing held hostage from foreign supplies of oil.\n  Now, let me say again, I want to end where I started. I want this \nbill to pass. I want a bill to pass and I want it to be a good bill. \nThat means the bill can be improved with amendments. You have to have \ndebate on issues on which Senators have a right to offer amendments. I \nwould like to see a bill pass the Senate and the House. If we can get \nto conference in September, perhaps we can get a bill to the President \nand have it signed in late September or October.\n  I would like to be able to say--especially in my State, where we have \nthese promising wind energy projects--that the production tax credit \nhas been extended, it is certain, and it is done, and you can count on \nit. As a result of that, we are going to produce more energy.\n  As I conclude, I will say, incidentally, we have had a rewrite of the \nelectricity title. I believe that was made available Thursday night. \nThere were rumors the majority party was rewriting an electricity \ntitle, but I was not aware of how it was being written or by whom. \nSomeone just pushed aside all these issues that have been raised about \nrestructuring.\n  As you know, for 4 or 5 years, we have had this urge for \nrestructuring. Where does that come from? From some of the biggest \nusers of electricity who want to pay lower costs for electricity. They \nwant there to be retail competition for electricity. That retail \neconomy situation--called restructuring--would embrace wholesale and \nretail competition for electricity and would give the opportunity in \nthis country for electricity to flow to various marketplaces unimpeded. \nThere has been a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture about the \nultimate impact of restructuring. I can tell you what it says about my \nState. It says consumers of North Dakota would end up paying a \nsubstantial additional price for electricity under so-called \nrestructuring. Aside from the dislocations of it all, if you want to \nwonder about what restructuring might mean, especially when you have \nvery big interests controlling energy--and that is not like a phone \ncall, by the way, when you make a phone call and you may get a busy \nsignal. Energy is different. When you need energy and energy isn't \nthere, you are cold or hot. They are both universal in nature in terms \nof need, but energy is different.\n\n  We need a supply of energy in this country that moves to the areas of \nneed in a way where you don't have large interests in supply and \nmanipulating the marketplace. The FERC has just released a study with \nrespect to the west coast. We all know what happened there. We know \npeople colluded with--Enron had plans and they were named and we \nuncovered them--Fat Boy, Get Shorty, Death Star. Sounds like comic \nbooks, doesn't it? Those are not comic books; they are internal memos \nfrom one corporation that was using strategies to cheat and to steal. \nThat cheating and stealing from west coast consumers amounted to \nbillions and billions and billions of dollars.\n  Now, is it important to have in an energy bill protections for \nconsumers to make sure that doesn't ever happen again? Some would push \nit away and say let's put some soft words in here. We will get a \nthesaurus and find out what seems appealing, and we will put all these \nsoft words and say we have done it. Well, take a hard look at the \nenergy title and make sure that even as we have done what is necessary \nto make sure we have a supply of energy, we have also done what is \nnecessary to protect the American consumer against the manipulation of \nthat supply and the overpricing of that supply to the detriment of the \nAmerican consumers.\n  There is a lot to do. I followed my colleague from Wyoming in his \npresentation, and I must say to Senator Thomas, we don't disagree that \nwe should do this bill. Speaking for myself, I will do everything I can \nthis week to try to cooperate.\n  I hope we can offer amendments, have the debate, dispose of \namendments, and move on to the next subject. I hope at the end of the \nday we have passed an Energy bill of which we are proud, one that \nreally does advance this country's energy interests because as we head \ninto this fall, we understand, more than ever, what is going to happen \nto natural gas prices. They are going to spike dramatically. But even \nmore than that immediate natural gas price spike, we understand, with \nthe mosaic of what we see in the Middle East and elsewhere around the \nworld, this country will be enormously foolish if it does not pay \nsubstantial attention to the fact that we are held hostage to foreign \nsupplies of oil in a way that is very detrimental to our long-term \neconomic outlook.\n  I hope we can work together. Speaking for myself, I want us to move \nand get our work done, get a bill to the President's desk, and when his \nsignature is put on that bill, we can all say: We really did advance \nthis country's energy future in a significant way.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank my friend from North Dakota for \njoining in wanting to get our work done and pointing out the importance \nof doing that work. Certainly that is what we are here to do, and I \nhope we can continue to do our work.\n  I agree with the point of view of the Senator from North Dakota in \nterms of transparency, antimanipulation, and enforcement. Actually, \nthis subtitle deals with that issue. Certainly, there is no reason why \nwe should not deal with it. It directs FERC to issue rules to establish \nan electronic information system to provide information on the \navailability and the price of wholesale energy and transmission \nservices, to ensure such information is treated confidentially, and \nprohibit the filing of false information regarding the price of \nwholesale electricity and availability of capacity. These are some of \nthe items that were used in the California/west coast experience.\n  It prohibits round-trip trading, which was one of the issues Enron \nwas most involved with apparently--at least that is what they were \naccused of doing. This subtitle expands who can file complaints in a \ncase which is the subject of a FERC investigation. It deals with this \nwhole question of what happened in California. It amends the Power Act \nto refund effective dates of filing. Many of these items in this \nchapter were designed to deal with the issue in California.\n  I think it would be a mistake to seek to blame the California crisis \nsolely on manipulation. There were a number of issues involved in the \nCalifornia case. California designed their own market rules, if we \nrecall, when they insisted there be a limit on the price for retail but \ndid not do so on wholesale. Those are issues that cannot continue. It \nwas flawed. They also had a shortage of supply. They did not want to \nwork on supply at all. They expected somebody else to bring in the \nsupply, and it did not happen.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator makes two important points. On the supply \nside, we have evidence that the supply was manipulated. That has been a \ngreat concern to FERC. While supply is important in terms of price, \nwhen there are large participants in the marketplace that take plants \noffline for the purpose of reducing supply and jacking up the price \nthey receive, that is manipulation. We want to have an electricity \ntitle which deals with all of these issues, all forms of manipulation.\n  The Senator mentioned supply, and I wanted to make the point, that \nespecially in California substantial criminal behavior existed. As we \nknow, FERC has already prevented some companies now from trading. \nEnron, of course, is essentially bankrupt and cannot trade there. There \nwas substantial wrongdoing and criminal activity, much of which is \nstill under active investigation by the Department of Justice. That is \nwhy having an electricity title that is good and well done is very \nimportant.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I certainly agree with the Senator's \npoint. That, of course, is one of the reasons we need to finish this \nbill. We talk\n\n[[Page S10005]]\n\nall the time about restructuring. Frankly, the fact is, the electric \nindustry and the suppliers have already changed, and we are behind \ntimes.\n  This is not so much a matter of restructuring as it is to design a \nset of policies and a set of restrictions and constraints that fit with \nwhat is happening in the industry. Much of that a few years ago--\nselling power three times and going through a number of people and \ndifferent hands--did not happen. Now it is happening. Now we have to do \nsomething to catch up. That is part of what we are doing in this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, if, in fact, these are \nimage trades or virtual trades to crank up a price and injure the \nconsumer, in which a company is moving a kilowatt hour or MCF to \nanother State, then back in, buying and selling to and from itself to \njack up the price and cheat the consumer, in some cases, I am sure the \nSenator from Wyoming agrees, we should not conform to a new practice, \nbut when we think the new practice is stealing from consumers, we ought \nto stop it and prevent it from ever happening again.\n  Mr. THOMAS. That is exactly what we are seeking to do, and that is \nwhat price transparency will help eliminate. I could not agree more.\n  Also, there has been a good deal of discussion about CAFE standards. \nObviously, that has to do with conservation. It has to do with being \nmore efficient in our use of fuel. We will be talking about CAFE \nstandards. In fact, there will be a number of different amendments \noffered on CAFE standards. We look forward to those amendments. We \nspent a good deal of time last year discussing three amendments, and, \nas a consequence, we should be able to discuss and dispose of these \namendments more easily this year because we have already been through \nthe debate.\n  The Senate has already adopted an amendment by Senator Landrieu that \nwill require the President to develop a plan to reduce domestic \npetroleum consumption by 1 million barrels a day by 2013. A major \nreduction in oil consumption most likely will be achieved through \nreduction in the use of transportation fuels. As a result, the Landrieu \namendment probably will focus on measuring fuel economy. That amendment \nmay take the place of other amendments that will be offered.\n  I think we will support an amendment offered by Senators Bond and \nLevin. Under that amendment, standards will be based on sound science \nand solid technical data. It is one thing to say, Gee, we would like to \nhave increased mileage; we would like to make 40, 50 miles on SUVs, but \nthe idea of using sound science and technical data is something we have \nto consider.\n  This amendment we will support mandates the experts to set new CAFE \nnumbers considering jobs, safety, technology, and other factors because \nthere are factors that go into what we can do, what will be available \nto consumers, what will be possible in the marketplace. This amendment \nwe will support has a commonsense approach which will not adversely \naffect employment, safety, and consumer choice.\n  The Bond-Levin amendment is supported by the National Chamber of \nCommerce, AFL-CIO, National Manufacturers Association, and the National \nFarm Bureau, and 30 other organizations. It is combined with tax \nincentives for advanced vehicle technologies. That provision, \nobviously, has to be in the bill. That is in the finance package.\n  The amendment offers a sensible way to achieve fuel efficiency and \nreduce dependency on foreign oil. It does it in a way that will not \nhurt the economy, increase the cost of vehicles to consumers, or \nendanger lives by reducing the safety aspects.\n  By comparison, there is another amendment that will increase the cost \nof new cars, trucks, and SUVs by as much as $1,200, according to the \nEnergy Information Administration. It would limit consumer choice by \nforcing automakers to produce smaller vehicles that do not meet the \nconsumers' needs; it will lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of \njobs of hard-working Americans; reduce economic growth by as much as \n$107 billion over 20 years and have adverse impacts.\n  Again, we are faced with finding a goal we want to achieve and a \nsensible, legitimate way to reach that goal. We will continue talking \nabout that issue.\n  We will be looking at new fuels, such as hydrogen. As I said before, \nthe President has already in his budget a tremendous amount of money \nfor that kind of research. We will be looking for the opportunity to \nmake sure there are positive opportunities to review how sales of \nenergy are being made so that what happened in California will not \nhappen again.\n  We will be looking at ways to conserve energy, such as CAFE \nstandards, without impeding the safety and the marketability of \nvehicles. So these are all things that go there. We are ready to talk \nabout them. We have some plans to accommodate them and to achieve them, \nbut, quite frankly, in order to do that, we have to get at it, get our \namendments in, and take away some of the objections to moving forward \nso that we are not caught up in another sort of quiet filibuster.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I think, while we are waiting, I would like to review \nagain some of the general concepts that are in the bill. We have talked \nsome, of course, and will continue all week, to talk about energy. That \nis what we are focused on. Unfortunately, we seem to be held up moving \nforward. However, that is not always a new thing on Mondays.\n  I would like to briefly comment on what we hope will be the pending \namendment, the electric title, but there is much more to the bill than \nthat, of course. I would like to comment on what I think generally are \nthe titles and the highlights of the Energy bill.\n  Title I is on oil and gas. It does a lot. No. 1, it permanently \nauthorizes this strategic petroleum reserve, the reserve held by the \nGovernment in case there are crises. This will permanently authorize \nthat strategic reserve.\n  It provides for production incentives for marginal wells. We find in \nWyoming, where we have had oil production for a good many years, when \nmarginal wells get down to having low production they become uneconomic \nto produce. Yet the accumulation of all the production from small \nproducing wells is substantial. This provides for incentives to \nencourage continued production--done mostly by taxes.\n  Royalty relief for deepwater production, that is exactly the same \nkind of thing. They can be in the gulf, for example. They are sometimes \nmore expensive, but a great opportunity for more energy production. \nThat is part of it as well, incentives for those kinds of wells.\n  Streamlining permitting is also something that is very important. We \nhave a great opportunity, particularly in the West, to produce more oil \nand gas. We have people willing to do that. One of the problems right \nnow in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, where they are having a \nsubstantial amount of production on coal bed methane, which is a new \nprocess, it is taking an excessive amount of time to get permitting to \ndo that. Therefore, the production has not gone on as it might. So \nthere are efforts to streamline the permitting for critical energy \ncorridors.\n  I have to also add it is not done to the detriment of the \nenvironment. The same rules are there. It is simply that it can be done \nby the agencies much more quickly than it has been in the past.\n\n[[Page S10006]]\n\n  Another is the authorization for an Alaska natural gas pipeline. This \nwould facilitate bringing 35 trillion cubic feet of gas to the lower \nStates. There will be debate about how it is funded. Nevertheless, \ncertainly over the long period of time a lot of the resources can come \nfrom there.\n  Title II deals with coal. I mentioned this morning, coal is our \nlargest supply of fossil fuels. Of course, one of the difficulties has \nbeen making it a clean air proposition. We are certainly looking for \nmore research to do that. We are looking for more clear air regulation \nthat will allow for the production of electricity with coal without \ndamaging the air--and there is a good deal of dollars. The bill \nauthorizes $2 billion for the deployment of clean air technology.\n  There is a title on Indian energy. Many Indian reservations have \nsubstantial supplies of energy, coal, and gas and other supplies that \nhave not been in production. Part of it is because of all the \nrequirements they have had to go through, even more than on other \nFederal lands. They have to go through the BIA, as well as the Bureau \nof Land Management, as well as the State, and the result of that has \nbeen it has been higher cost to produce on reservations, so they have \nnot produced. Therefore we have not had the production for all of us in \nthe country and at the same time not had the economic assistance for \nthe tribes, which is also very important.\n\n  Nuclear energy is involved here, the permanent reauthorization of \nPrice-Anderson, a liability insurance system. There would not be any \nnuclear plants without that assistance. The fact is, there have not \nbeen new nuclear plants for a good long time, despite the fact that in \nIllinois, for example, I think 28 percent--a good percentage of the \nelectricity is produced by nuclear plants. It is a clean air deal. It \nis the best thing you can do in order to produce electricity and take \ncare of the air. But, of course, we are all a little skeptical of \nnuclear and what to do with the waste. But there should be and will be \nresearch as to how to better produce.\n  As we know, France, Norway, and the Scandinavian states do a great \ndeal of nuclear production. They also have better means of taking care \nof nuclear wastes than we do here in the United States. So here is an \nopportunity to do that.\n  Title V involves renewable energy. Here again, we have already heard \nabout some of it today. There is a great deal of interest in renewable \nenergy, whether it be wind energy or Sun energy, other kinds--\ngeothermal energy. All those things have great potential.\n  The fact is, production by renewables only amounts to about 3 percent \nof total production in the country at this time, so it is not a major \nelement, but it has the potential to be, and therefore we need to be \ncontinuing to work to provide an opportunity to make that more \nefficient. We have a considerable amount of wind energy in Wyoming. We \nhave a lot of wind. As a matter of fact, the first windmill that was \nput up in Medicine Bow, WY, was an experiment a number of years ago. It \nhad a huge propeller, and it blew away before it was able to be \neffective. Now they have changed them. Some are even cylindrical pipes, \nand the wind goes in and around. Perhaps those will be better over \ntime. We need more research on doing that.\n  Transportation, of course. We have already talked a great deal about \nCAFE standards. There will be more discussion about that. I don't think \nanyone is not agreeable to the idea that we ought to increase the \nstandard of fuel consumption for automobiles, but we have to do it \nwhere the expectations of technology are such that you can do it, and \nit has to be in a way that does not impose excessive costs on everyone \nimmediately. Again, that is a good one.\n  This bill authorizes $1.8 billion for the present hydrogen fuel cell \ninitiative, to develop clean, renewable hydrogen power for cars. I \ndon't think there is any doubt that we can do it. As a matter of fact, \nthere are hydrogen cars now. But there are some basic problems that we \nhave not yet resolved. How do you make hydrogen? From where do you get \nit? Someone on the floor this morning was talking about doing it in \nspace vehicles. The cost for space vehicles is quite different from \nthat for my Ford Explorer. I think it will have to go a long way before \nthat analogy fits in the cars you and I want to use. The other real \nissue is distribution. Think how many gasoline stations there are \naround where we drive our cars. I suppose you are going to have to have \nsomething similar to that for hydrogen, if that is going to happen.\n  Will it happen? Sure. I think it is one of the things that will \nhappen in the future. So that is here.\n  Research and development, of course, in general is here. There is a \ngood deal of authorization and funding authority there. Again, it is \nthe kind of thing we need to work on.\n  We have already talked this morning about the electric title, which \nis very important.\n  We have not yet considered but will consider soon the tax incentives. \nHere again is the effort we are making to increase domestic production. \nThat will be a result of the incentives that we put into place through \ntaxes. The same is true with alternative energy for vehicles and fuel \nincentives. This will be done by tax incentives. Conservation \nefficiency, clean coal, and all of those things are very important.\n\n  This is really a far-reaching bill. I think most people will agree \nwith most aspects of it. If we can get it going and get it to the \nPresident soon, I think that is essential. I believe we are going to do \nsome other things this afternoon, but I hope we continue moving back to \nenergy. That is the challenge we have for this week. I hope we take \nfull advantage of it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amazing clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1386\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am speaking this afternoon in support \nof the pending Bond-Levin amendment relative to fuel efficiency in our \nautomobiles and how we achieve that fuel efficiency.\n  Our amendment will increase fuel economy in automobiles. It will \nprotect the environment. It will decrease our dependence on foreign \noil. But it will do this in a way that will not harm the U.S. economy \nor put hard-working Americans out of work.\n  Our amendment achieves the goal of better fuel economy with greater \nreliance on positive incentives to advance leap-ahead technologies such \nas hybrids and fuel cells. That includes promoting these technologies \nwith greater increases in joint research and development and Government \npurchases.\n  Our amendment requires the Department of Transportation to increase \nthe CAFE standard. It is a mandate, but the key difference between our \namendment and some of the alternatives is that our mandated increase \nwill be left up to the Department of Transportation and will not be \njust an arbitrarily determined number on the part of the Senate.\n  Let me go through some of the goals and how we achieve those goals in \nthe Bond-Levin amendment.\n  First, we need to improve fuel economy. We can, and we should, do it \nin a way that protects the environment, that diminishes our dependence \non imported oil, and that allows the U.S. economy and our domestic \nmanufacturing industry to thrive.\n  Those goals are not in conflict with each other. We can improve fuel \neconomy, but we can do it in a way that does not harm domestic \nmanufacturing and the U.S. economy if we do it right. And that is a big \n``if.'' If we do it wrong, we could have a very negative effect on jobs \nand the American economy. And, as a matter of fact, if we do it wrong, \nwe not only can damage the American economy, but we could see little \nimprovement in the environment, given the way in which the current \nstructure of fuel economy mandates is set up.\n  It is a discriminatory structure that has discriminated against \ndomestics in ways that were probably unforeseen\n\n[[Page S10007]]\n\nwhen this structure was adopted 30 years or so ago, but nonetheless it \nhas had that effect.\n  What we do is ensure that fuel economy will be improved. But we do \nnot set an arbitrary standard. We require the agency that has the \nexpertise and the experience to set an increased fuel economy standard \nfor both trucks and for light vehicles.\n  This is not the place, on the Senate floor, to make a complex \ndecision that should involve a whole host of factors: What is \nachievable technologically, what is the cost, what are the safety \nimpacts, what are the impacts on American jobs, and a whole host of \nother factors that need to be considered before a new fuel economy \nstandard is set. That should not just be seized out of the air \narbitrarily and put into law on the Senate floor. That ought to be done \nby an agency that has the expertise and experience to do it, that looks \nat all of the factors that should go into the decision, and then does \nit in an usual, regulatory way with notice and comment.\n  The second part of our three-part policy is to increase funding for \nresearch, development, and demonstration of new, advanced, clean and \nfuel-efficient vehicles. We provide $50 million. We would authorize \nthat in funds for the Department of Energy to develop advanced hybrid \nvehicles. And that would be a significant increase.\n\n  Hybrids run on both gasoline and electricity and are far more fuel \nefficient than conventional vehicles. We would provide an increase in \nfunds for the Department of Energy to work collaboratively with \nindustry to do some research and develop clean diesel technologies. It \nwould be a significant increase in what is otherwise provided.\n  Because diesel engines are much more fuel efficient than gasoline \nengines, furthering clean diesel will help reduce gasoline consumption. \nAnd because diesel vehicles must meet very stringent emissions \nstandards in the very near future, this will not be detrimental to the \nenvironment. Again, diesel vehicles are subject to the new clean air \nstandards. These emissions standards must be met by diesels. If we can \nadvance clean diesel technology, we will be saving gasoline because \nthey are more fuel efficient than gasoline.\n  The third part of our policy harnesses the purchasing power of the \nFederal Government. In order to try to get the vehicles we are talking \nabout--including hybrids and fuel cell vehicles--commercially adopted \nonto the roads, we have to use the purchasing power of the Federal \nGovernment. So we would require the Federal Government, when it is \npurchasing vehicles, to purchase hybrid trucks for its fleets of light \ntrucks that are otherwise not covered by the Energy Policy Act.\n  Using hybrid trucks in Federal fleets will improve the fuel \nefficiency of the Federal fleet because hybrids are far more fuel \nefficient than conventional gasoline vehicles. And, at the same time, \nwe would be creating a significant and reliable market for hybrid \ntrucks. This is not buying vehicles that are otherwise not needed. This \nwould be a requirement to purchase vehicles that the Federal Government \nis buying but to require that we buy the hybrids so we can help create \nthe market that is so essential for the auto industry in order to have \nconfidence that the vehicles will be purchased when they produce them.\n  In a related amendment, not part of the Bond-Levin amendment--I will \nbe offering an amendment to the energy tax amendment which will come \nfrom the Finance Committee--we will be providing tax incentives to help \nadvance the purchase of clean vehicles and clean fuel.\n  Our tax amendment--again, this is not part of Bond-Levin; it will be \noffered as an amendment to what is offered by the Finance Committee--\nwould increase the tax credit available to consumers who purchase \nhybrid vehicles and provide a new tax credit for fuel-efficient lean-\nburn vehicles, to help push these vehicles into the marketplace. We \nwould also extend the period of time for tax incentives for fuel cell \nvehicles for 3 additional years, from 2011 to 2014.\n  We would also provide tax credits for consumers who buy heavy-duty \ndiesel vehicles that are significantly cleaner than what is required by \nlaw.\n  Finally, we would provide producers with tax credits for purchasing \nultra-low-sulfur diesel fuel which the next generation of diesel \nvehicles would need to meet the upcoming round of extremely low \nemission standards.\n  I want to spend a few more minutes discussing the fuel economy part \nof our amendment. Clearly, we all want to improve fuel economy. That is \na goal all of us share. But how we increase it is absolutely critical. \nOur amendment increases it by requiring the Department of \nTransportation to increase CAFE. However, rather than setting an \narbitrary number for fuel economy on the floor of the Senate, we \nrequire the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, to \nconduct a rulemaking process to increase fuel efficiency. The resulting \nrules will apply to both passenger cars and light trucks. Pickup \ntrucks, minivans, and SUVs are included in the definition of light \ntrucks.\n  But rather than legislating an arbitrary number, what the Bond-Levin \namendment does is to tell NHTSA--the agency designed to do this--to \nrationally take into account a number of important considerations when \nsetting a new standard: safety; consumer choice; the need for oil \nindependence; the need for fuel savings; any unfair or competitive \ndisadvantage that is created or continued by use of the CAFE system; \nimpact on jobs; and a number of other factors. If NHTSA fails to act in \nthe required timeframe under our amendment, Congress can consider \nlegislation under expedited procedures to mandate an increase in fuel \neconomy standards.\n  If we fail to set fuel economy standards in a deliberate manner, if \nwe just do it arbitrarily by adopting a number in the Senate floor, we \ncreate a further competitive disadvantage to domestic manufacturers.\n  From its inception, CAFE has given an unfair competitive advantage to \nforeign manufacturers, not because they have more fuel efficient \ntechnologies; they do not. I emphasize that because there are folks who \ndo believe that foreign cars are more fuel efficient than domestic \ncars. In the same category of cars, the same weight classifications, \nthey are not. American-made cars are at least comparable in terms of \nfuel efficiency, and in many cases they have superior fuel efficiency \nto foreign-made models in that same weight class, the ones with which \nthey compete.\n  It is because foreign manufacturers have historically focused more on \nsmaller cars and smaller trucks than American manufacturers that they \nhave that advantage. It is not because their vehicles are more \ntechnologically advanced or more fuel efficient in the same weight \nclass. The reason this has worked this way is that the CAFE system, \nwhen it was designed, gave an advantage to manufacturers by looking at \nthe entire fleet of cars rather than dividing the fleet into comparable \nsize vehicles or comparable weight vehicles. Any automaker that built \nprimarily small cars found it easy to meet the CAFE standard, while the \nmanufacturers that built the full line of cars, including five-and six-\npassenger cars that American families have traditionally bought, found \nit much more difficult to meet the fleet average requirement of CAFE. \nSo the fleet average does not reflect the efficiency of comparably \nsized vehicles.\n  In looking at the fleets as a whole, there is a built-in bias against \ndomestic manufacturers although, again, domestically built vehicles are \nat least equally fuel efficient, pound for pound, in the same weight \nclassification, as are the imported vehicles.\n\n  Foreign car manufacturers have been able to expand their production \nof larger cars and pickup trucks, minivans, and SUVs under the fleet \naverage methodology that is called CAFE.\n  CAFE did not constrain them. The historic focus of those \nmanufacturers on small vehicles gave them the headroom to sell large \nnumbers of larger vehicles while still meeting the CAFE requirements \nfor the fleet average; again, not because they are more fuel efficient.\n  So CAFE has had an unfair discriminatory impact against U.S. jobs \nbecause of how it was designed. I hope that was an inadvertent design \nand not an intended consequence when CAFE was designed many decades \nago, but it has been the consequence. It is utterly amazing that we \nwould tolerate the continuation, much less the expansion, of that \nconsequence without considering the impact of all the factors that go \ninto CAFE.\n\n[[Page S10008]]\n\n  The proposals that have been supported by some in the Senate to \nprovide an arbitrary increase in CAFE standards do not solve the \nproblem of unfair competitive disadvantage. Instead, that arbitrary \nselection of a number would make it worse. Manufacturers who have \ntraditionally produced smaller vehicles would have considerably less \ndifficulty meeting the new standards than domestic manufacturers would.\n  The National Academy of Sciences recognizes this in its 2001 report. \nIn talking about the current CAFE system, the National Academy of \nSciences said the following:\n\n       . . . one concept of equity among manufacturers requires \n     equal treatment of equivalent vehicles made by different \n     manufacturers. The current CAFE standards fail this test.\n\n  The National Academy went on to say the following:\n\n       A policy decision to simply increase the standard for \n     light-duty trucks to the same level as for passenger cars \n     would operate in this inequitable manner. . . .those \n     manufacturers whose production was concentrated in light-duty \n     trucks [that is SUVs, minivans, and pickups] would be \n     financially penalized relative to those manufacturers whose \n     production was concentrated in cars.\n\n  Well, domestic manufacturers have a high concentration in light truck \nproduction, and they will be unfairly disadvantaged by this approach. \nYet that is the approach advocated by some of our colleagues.\n  The competitive disadvantage of increased CAFE standards on domestic \nmanufacturers is an important factor, but it is ignored in CAFE \namendments that just set arbitrary standards. This competitive \ndisadvantage for domestic manufacturers is not some abstract issue, \nthis is an American jobs issue.\n  It is difficult to overestimate the importance of the automotive \nsector to the American economy. The automotive manufacturing sector \nalone is directly responsible for over 2 million jobs, and there are \nabout 10 million people who are employed in fields directly related to \nmotor vehicles.\n  Advocates of setting an arbitrary higher CAFE standard assert that \nthe economic impact of CAFE will be minimal.\n  They claim that lost auto industry jobs will be offset by jobs \ncreated elsewhere. If they are wrong--and I believe they are--the \npotential negative impacts are massive.\n  According to the National Academy of Sciences report on the impacts \nof the CAFE program, union membership has fallen from 1.4 million \nmembers in 1980 to only 670,000 by the year 2000. U.S. automakers are \nlosing jobs and market share partly due to the arbitrary CAFE program. \nIn the last 20 years, this hemorrhaging of over 700,000 U.S. jobs was \ncountered by the creation of only 35,000 jobs in assembly plants built \nin the United States by foreign-owned manufacturers. That is a National \nAcademy of Sciences finding from their report.\n  Over the last 4 years alone, the big three have lost 34,000 jobs.\n  That is an 11-percent loss of jobs in just 4 years. There is a better \nway than just an arbitrary increase by the Senate in the CAFE number. \nWe can achieve our shared goals of decreasing our dependence on foreign \noil and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by developing innovative, new \ntechnologies that will, hopefully, ultimately eliminate or \nsignificantly reduce the use of fossil fuels that create those \nemissions.\n  Our approach, the Bond-Levin amendment, and a separate tax amendment \nthat will be offered, would require an increase in fuel economy by \nNHTSA but require consideration of all the factors relevant to any \nincrease and not simply derive an arbitrary figure on the floor of the \nSenate. We would ramp up public-private cooperative investment in \nresearch and development of advanced vehicle technologies. We will use \nthe purchasing power of Government to speed up the commercial \nproduction of these technologies. And, again, in a separate amendment, \nwe would use tax credits to provide powerful incentives for the \npurchase of advanced clean technology vehicles.\n  I have been a supporter for a long time of developing fuel cell \nvehicles. The Administration's FreedomCAR and FreedomFuel programs are \na good step but they are not sufficient to move us forward quickly to a \nhydrogen future. So we offered an amendment in last year's Energy bill \nthat pushed the development of hydrogen vehicles and infrastructure.\n  This year, provisions such as these are already incorporated in the \nunderlying bill. The amendment that will be offered separately to the \ntax section of the bill would extend the fuel cell vehicle credits \nprovided in the finance package from 2011 to 2014.\n  We must lay the groundwork for the development of a hydrogen future. \nWe also need to focus on the immediate future and provide incentives \nfor efficient hybrid vehicles and clean diesel vehicles. Hybrid \nvehicles, which draw power from both electric motor and an internal \ncombustion engine, can be up to 100 percent more efficient than \nconventional vehicles. Clean diesel vehicles, which new regulations \nmake just as clean vehicles running on gasoline, also provide important \nefficiency gains that are important, especially in light and heavy-duty \ntrucks.\n  The Department of Energy has calculated that if diesel were used in \nonly 30 percent of potential light truck applications by the year 2020, \nit would reduce U.S. crude oil imports by 700,000 barrels per day. \nClean diesel increases fuel economy by 20 to 40 percent and decreases \ncurrent engines' carbon dioxide emissions by that same percentage.\n  We must put the pieces in place today that will lead to revolutionary \nbreakthroughs in automotive technology tomorrow. If we take this \napproach, we will do far more to make this Nation less dependent on \nforeign oil and far more to reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases \nthan we will ever accomplish with increased CAFE standards. The \nincremental gains are so costly to achieve and but use the resources \nthat otherwise would be used for leap-ahead technologies that would \nachieve so much more.\n  Currently, auto companies around the world are working on longer \nterm, breakthrough technologies that will provide potentially dramatic \nincreases in vehicle fuel economy. This research work--on projects such \nas fuel cells, advanced batteries, and hybrid technologies--requires \nsubstantial resources.\n  These resources should be invested in leap-ahead technologies. The \nmore we spend on the very marginal increases in technology, which would \nbe at great cost required, we are going to be misusing the resources \nthis Nation should be placing on the leap-ahead technologies.\n  Technology changes require very long times to be introduced into the \nmanufacturer's product lines. Any policy that is implemented too \nquickly and too aggressively has the potential to adversely affect \nmanufacturers, their suppliers, their employees, and consumers. If the \nautomakers are required to focus so much on dramatic near-term \nimprovements in vehicle fuel economy, resources will have to be \ndiverted from those promising longer term projects and from providing \nthe amenities desired by American families.\n  The Bond-Levin approach preserves the appropriate balance between \ndevelopment of near-term technologies for fuel economy improvement and \nthe development of promising longer term projects. We use greater \nincentives; we use partnerships; we rely less and less on these \narbitrary mandates. Where a mandate is appropriate, the agency with \nexpertise, the agency with experience, the agency that would use all of \nthe relevant factors in the determination of that new mandate would be \nthe one that would be given the responsibility to increase those fuel \nstandards. That is our approach. It is a positive approach toward \ngreater energy efficiency, and it does so in a way which does not cost \njobs--important jobs, manufacturing jobs in this country.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1386, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this subtitle:\n       (1) Alternative fueled vehicle.--The term ``alternative \n     fueled vehicle'' means--\n       (A) an alternative fueled vehicle, as defined in section \n     301(3) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 13211(3));\n       (B) a motor vehicle that operates on a blend of fuel that \n     is at least 20 percent (by volume) biodiesel, as defined in \n     section 312(f) of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. \n     13220(f)); and\n       (C) a motor vehicle that operates on a blend of fuel that \n     is at least 20 percent (by volume) bioderived hydrocarbons \n     (including aliphatic compounds) produced from agricultural \n     and animal waste.\n       (2) Heavy-duty emission standards of 2007.--The term \n     ``heavy-duty emission standards of 2007'' means the motor \n     vehicle emission standards promulgated by the Administrator \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency on January 18, 2001, \n     under section 202 of the Clean Air Act to apply to heavy-duty \n     vehicles of model years beginning with the 2007 vehicle model \n     year.\n       (3) Hybrid vehicle.--The term ``hybrid vehicle'' means--\n       (A) a motor vehicle that draws propulsion energy from on \n     board sources of stored energy that are both--\n       (i) an internal combustion or heat engine using combustible \n     fuel; and\n       (ii) a rechargeable energy storage system; and\n       (B) any other vehicle that is defined as a hybrid vehicle \n     in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Energy for the \n     administration of title III of the Energy Policy Act of 1992.\n       (4) Motor vehicle.--The term ``motor vehicle'' means any \n     vehicle that is manufactured primarily for use on public \n     streets, roads, and highways (not including a vehicle \n     operated exclusively on a rail or rails) and that has at \n     least four wheels.\n       (5) Tier 2 emission standards defined.--The term ``tier 2 \n     emission standards'' means the motor vehicle emission \n     standards promulgated by the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency on February 10, 2000, under \n     section 202 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7521) to apply to \n     passenger automobiles, light trucks, and larger passenger \n     vehicles of model years after the 2003 vehicle model year.\n       (6) Terms defined in epa regulations.--The terms \n     ``passenger automobile'' and ``light truck'' have the \n     meanings given such terms in regulations prescribed by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for \n     purposes of the administration of title II of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7521 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nremarks by the distinguished Senator from Idaho, I be allowed to speak \nas in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments on the \nLevin-Bond, Bond-Levin amendment, which is critical to a clarification \nand establishment of the CAFE standards as we understand them and that \nfit the industry of our country--the automobile industry--and that \neffectively match up with where we want to take fleet averages and all \nof that over the course of time. It is certainly, in my opinion, a much \nmore responsible approach than that which is being proposed by the \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  I do believe the Durbin amendments on CAFE standards would have a \ndevastating impact on the automobile industry. As the Senator from \nMichigan has said, new technologies introduced into the automobile \ntransportation fleets of this country not only take time but cost a \ntremendous amount of money and, in the course of that, oftentimes \nchange the whole character of industries. We need to be extremely \ncareful about that.\n  For example, the Durbin amendment proposal calls for passenger cars \nand light truck CAFE standards to be set at 40 miles per gallon and \n27.5 miles per gallon, respectively, by 2015. At the same time, \nminivans and other SUVs are shifted from a light truck fleet to a car \nfleet; vehicles up to 14,000 pounds are added to the regular fleet. It \nis a combination and a formula that, while I have spent a good deal of \ntime over the years trying to understand, I am not at all confident I \ncan effectively explain it for the record or for those who are \nadvocating it or for those who are simply listening and trying to \nunderstand the importance of this debate.\n  We do have an alternative in the Bond-Levin approach, which I think \nbalances out what we have said historically in CAFE standards that \ncause our industry, in a progressive fashion, to drive in the right \ndirection, to do what is appropriate and necessary within the confines \nof not only building safe automobiles, safe transportation, but that \nwhich is increasingly efficient for the consuming public.\n  We are on S. 14, a comprehensive Energy bill for this country. The \nSenate has been working to pass a comprehensive Energy bill for 3 \nyears. I find it fascinating that it is so impossible to do. We passed \nthe Department of Homeland Security bill in 1 day. In 1 day of debate, \nthe Senate took a very huge portion of Government and over 100,000 \nemployees and changed their direction and future. We have already been \non an Energy bill this year and in this session for several weeks. Yet \nwe are being told we cannot get it done this week, with some 300 \namendments offered.\n  Then when we suggested we would come in and start early and work \nlate, the minority recommended that they would offer optimum \nflexibility, and\n\n[[Page S10011]]\n\nthey have just denied us now in the last several hours the very \nflexibility they promised--that we could offer amendments, lay them \naside, go to other amendments, debate those, lay them aside until the \nappropriate number were assembled, and then we could use the process of \nstacking and do so to bring about the votes that would expedite the \ntime and effectively utilize the very limited time we have--the time \nthat we think is extremely necessary and that we can, in fact, complete \nour work.\n  The Senate already this year, as I have mentioned, has considered an \nEnergy bill for 12 days, and the bill before us is not some secret. It \nis not like the bill last year that was crafted in the office of then-\nMajority Leader Daschle and was brought to the floor and substituted \nseveral times in a way we did not know what it was made up of or where \nit was going until we saw it when it was before the Senate for \nconsideration.\n  This bill was crafted in the committee. It was brought up in a normal \nfashion, it was voted out in a bipartisan fashion, and the only real \nunknown was the electrical title which was available by Friday of this \npast week to all who had not been involved in its crafting. My \ncolleagues had the opportunity over the weekend to look at it.\n  We wanted to offer that electrical title amendment to the bill this \nafternoon so we could all see it, begin to understand it, debate it, \nand, if necessary, leave it before the Senate a day or so to be sure we \ncould clearly deal with it in the appropriate fashion.\n  I hope that what happened several hours ago, denying us the ability \nto lay aside amendments and move to other amendments, does not become a \npattern. If it does, then this Senator will come to the Chamber and \ntalk about the good faith or the lack thereof, the desire or the lack \nthereof, in wanting to produce a national energy policy for our \ncountry. I wish to talk about the need of that policy now and into the \nfuture.\n  If one reads the St. Louis newspaper today, one will read about \nnatural gas prices taking a Missouri farmer from $295 a ton for \nnitrogen fertilizer to as much as $430 a ton because of the runup in \ngas prices. If that is happening in Missouri, I darn well bet it is \nhappening to my farmers in Idaho or the U.S. chemical companies closing \nplants and laying off workers and looking to expand their production \noverseas as a result of high gas prices. The Wall Street Journal said: \nThe United States is expected to import approximately $9 billion more \nin chemicals this year than last year. Why? Because we are running the \nchemical industry out of our country because this Congress, this \nSenate, in 3 years has refused to produce a national energy policy for \nour country that, once again, not only recognizes that energy will be \navailable but that it will be stable, that there will be a reliable \nsupply at a predictable cost, and not one that goes from $3 a cubic \nthousand feet to $6, as we have seen gas spike in just the last several \nmonths, totally disallowing any industry that uses large volumes of \nnatural gas any way of predicting or projecting costs of development, \ncosts of refinement and, therefore, price to consumer in the market.\n  We cannot afford for this country to increasingly buy its chemicals \noverseas as we buy our crude oil from overseas. It will result in $9 \nbillion more in the imbalance of our trade simply because Congress \ncannot function. The blame will lie at our feet because we have been 3 \nyears trying to perfect a national energy policy for our country.\n  I oftentimes remember the first meeting I had with President-elect \nGeorge W. Bush in the majority leader's office. He had been talking \nabout a lot of issues for our country--education, Leave No Child \nBehind, a whole combination of issues. But that day he said: While all \nof these other issues are important, and we will get to them--and, of \ncourse, we all remember his high priority in the campaign about \ndelivering tax cuts--what we have to do right now is develop a national \nenergy policy. He said: I know of nothing more critical to our Nation \nand its future than doing just that.\n\n  As we know, the moment he was our President, he immediately appointed \nour Vice President to head up a task force to build a national energy \npolicy strategy and, out of that strategy, to recommend to Congress \nchanges in law and provisions we might undertake to build a strong, \nstable national energy base for our country.\n  Oh, my goodness, that was well over 2 years ago. They got their work \ndone in less than 6 months, and yet we cannot get our work done here at \na time when gas prices are spiking, at a time when the memories of the \nblackouts and brownouts in California are still very much alive in the \nminds of most citizens on the west coast who either lost their jobs or \nhad their jobs damaged and which created less security.\n  I was in San Jose, CA, about a month ago talking to the high-tech \ncommunity. Oh, they had a lot of priorities, but their first priority \nwas energy, and they needed to know if there was going to be a stable \nsupply of energy because if there was not, they knew they would have to \nmove their production facilities to a location where that energy supply \nexisted.\n  The Silicon Valley not the high-tech hub of the Western World? It is \nvery feasible that could happen someday because the State of California \nand our country as a whole have not developed a national energy policy. \nIf chemical companies move offshore because of the price of energy, \nhigh-tech can follow, and will follow, and shame on us as a people and \nshame on us as a Senate if we cannot produce a national energy policy \nand put it on the President's desk so that those fears can be laid \naside and we produce a source of energy for our country that is highly \nstable and secure.\n  ``Rising prices, combined with a cold winter, are adding an extra \n$500 to $700 per month to the gas bill of the Villa Pizza Restaurant in \nHanford, CT.'' So speaks the Hanford newspaper.\n  ``Eighty percent of our Nation's 35,000 laundromats have raised \nprices in the past year due to high natural gas prices.'' That is \naccording to the Associated Press.\n  Mr. President, did you ever think your laundry bill was going to go \nup because the Congress of the United States could not act? It is \nhappening, and that is exactly what the Associated Press is saying. \nBecause of the gas that feeds the dryers at the laundromat, it now \ncosts double what it cost a year ago. A couple more quarters need to go \ninto the machine every time someone activates it.\n  We do not think about that at the time, but collectively, for the \neconomy of our country, these kinds of implications in an energy \npolicy, or absence thereof, are devastating in the broad sense.\n  Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the Energy \nCommittee just a few weeks ago, was talking about the stability of an \neconomy and the growth of an economy built upon the foundation of a \nstable supply of energy of all kinds for this Nation.\n  S. 14 is the most comprehensive national energy policy statement I \nbelieve the Senate has produced in my time in the Senate. It talks \nabout production of all kinds of energy--from wind to solar, nuclear, \nhydro, coal, and gas. It talks about restructuring in the new \nelectrical title to create greater uniformity and to create a national \ntransmission system for wholesale electricity in this country, about \nwhich we ought to be talking.\n  It talks about conservation because while we are producing more \nenergy for a growing economy, we ought to be using less energy per item \nof work, per unit of production. That is called conservation, and any \none of us who has ever studied national energy policy in our country \nclearly recognizes the value and the importance of conserving while we \nproduce more. We cannot conserve our way out, and we cannot conserve \nourselves into a growing economy, but at the same time the balance and \nthe greater efficiencies produced by conservation are critical as we \ncombine them with new and increased production.\n  S. 14 is clearly written in the backdrop and the understanding that \nthe American people want clean sources of energy, that our environment \nis critical and important, that we want to be able to work, we want to \nbe able to produce jobs, and we want to be able to do so in a clean \nenvironment.\n\n  America's environmental ethic is profound today and S. 14 clearly \nreflects the importance of that. It clearly\n\n[[Page S10012]]\n\nreflects the importance of producing new energy sources and old energy \nsources made cleaner, and all of that being strong and important as it \nrelates to new jobs.\n  Let's talk about jobs for a moment. I am very pleased we passed new \ntax laws. I am very pleased those new tax incentives and rewards are \nhitting the marketplace at this moment and the consumer's and \ninvestor's pocket. I believe out of that, new jobs will be created and \npossibly there will be a bit more consumer spending.\n  That child tax credit check that is hitting America's homes, I see \nHome Depot has picked up on it. They are saying, come out and spend \nyour money and build a better home, make an addition, do some \nremodeling, and we will help you do it. That is called the free \nenterprise system at work, and that will generate jobs.\n  If we want to talk about a jobs bill, then pass S. 14. Pass a bill \nthat will bring natural gas out of Alaska through Canada and into the \nlower 48. There will be hundreds of thousands of new jobs that will be \ncreated for the construction of that pipeline--not only those who will \nmanufacture the pipe, but those who will clear the right-of-way and \nbuild the foundation and create the connectivity that will be combined \nto bring that gas to the lower 48, and of course, all of the other \nkinds of jobs, exploration, development and the new technologies.\n  The Senator from Michigan was talking about fuel cells a few moments \nago. I was up in his State. I was at the Ford Laboratories at Dearborn \na couple of years ago and drove a new hydrogen fuel-celled car. I hope \nthat in my senior years I can buy a hydrogen fuel-celled car; its only \npollution is a drop of water being emitted out the tailpipe of the car. \nI hope that is a form of new transportation for the future. If it is, \nit will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs; not just in crafting \nthe car but in producing the hydrogen, in supplying the hydrogen, in \nbuilding the refuel stations and the combination of things that go \nalong with building a new energy source for a transportation fleet for \nour country.\n  That is what this bill is all about. Why is there so much resistance \nto it? Why some 300-plus amendments? I have looked at many of them, and \nfrom what I could see there are 25 or 30 amendments within that 300 \nthat are legitimate, that have reasonable concern. I believe there are \nat least 200 of them that are there for a political statement or for \nblocking purposes.\n  The other side argues that we just cannot get our work done, that we \nneed weeks more to deal with something we have already spent 12 days \non, that we have already spent 3 years on. Why do we need 3 weeks more? \nWhy can we not begin to work at 9 tomorrow morning and work until 8 \ntomorrow night and everybody come to the floor and, in a timely way, \ndebate amendments, vote them up or down, move to table them, move \nourselves through this issue, and offer to the American people a \ncomprehensive national energy policy that can make it to the \nPresident's desk, that can become law, that begins to put the kind of \neffort together to produce the nearly 400,000-plus jobs that are \navailable inside this bill spread over a decade of development and \ngrowth of the kind reflective in S. 14?\n\n  How many of us got up this morning and simply walked over and flipped \non the light switch and the lights came on? And how many mornings in \none's life have they done that and the lights came on? Why, they come \non every morning. We expect them to. We Americans have grown to believe \nthat our energy is always there and always around us, and we take it \nfor granted.\n  My wife and I flew back from Idaho yesterday. With my wife and I \nsitting on that jet airliner, it consumed hundreds of gallons of jet \nfuel just to get us from Idaho to Washington, DC. We took it for \ngranted. Thousands of other Americans were doing the same thing \nyesterday. They do it every day of the week. They go to the airport. \nThey get on an airplane. Thousands of gallons of jet fuel later, they \narrive at their destination and they take it all for granted.\n  Somebody had to find it. Somebody had to transport it. Somebody had \nto refine it and somebody had to put it in the airplane. It is all \nenergy.\n  Our great country is as rich as it is today, and our people are as \nfortunate as they are, in large part because we have always been able \nto look 10, 15, and 20 years down the road and build the infrastructure \nand do the research and do the exploration that brought on continual \nflows of abundant, reasonably priced energy. It has only been in the \nlast two decades that we stopped producing, but we kept on consuming, \nand gas prices began to go through the roof. Brownouts and blackouts \nbegan to occur because we were not allowed to look into the future and \nsay: Here is where we are going and here is what we are going to \nproduce.\n  That is what S. 14 does. That is why it is so critical to our country \nat this moment in time that we become less dependent on foreign \nsources, more dependent on ourselves and our own production, our own \ninitiative, our own capability, and we do so with conservation, with \nproduction, and that we are environmentally sensitive when we do it. \nThat is all embodied in S. 14.\n  Why are we going to let this languish when we need to be passing it \nand getting it to the President's desk? One more year? Two more years? \nLet gas prices to the average consumer go up $200 or $300 a month and \njust say that is okay when we know that through increased exploration \nand development that does not have to happen?\n  So I challenge my colleagues over the course of the week that is at \nhand that we start tonight and we work through Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday and, as our leader said, Friday and Saturday and beyond if \nnecessary, and let's get our work done for the American people, let's \namend, let's pass S. 14, a national energy policy, and get ourselves to \nconference with the House to make this issue happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I understand there is a unanimous consent \nthat I be recognized for such time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I say to the Senator from the great State of Idaho how \naccurate he is. If there is anything he overlooked, it was in addition \nto our having electricity, power, and energy in the country, it is also \nthe No. 1 national security issue.\n  I can remember, as can the Senator from Idaho, way back in the Reagan \nadministration when we were about 37 percent dependent on foreign \ncountries for our ability to fight a war, and we still did not have an \nenergy policy. As did the Senator from Idaho, I talked to President \nBush, then-Governor Bush, before he ran, and he committed himself to an \nenergy policy. It is absolutely essential. I agree we should stay \nwhatever time it takes to get it done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10012-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10012-S10023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SCIENCE OF CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the comments made by the Senator from \nIdaho are such a good prelude to work into what I am about to say. I am \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and in this \ncapacity I have a responsibility because the decisions the committee \nwill reach impact and influence the health and security of America.\n  What I am about to do--and it is for this reason that I am doing \nsomething that is politically stupid--I am going to expose the most \npowerful, most highly financed lobby in Washington, the far left \nenvironmental extremists.\n  The Senator from Idaho talked about the fact that we have to have \nelectricity. Right now, we are dependent upon fossil fuels for 52 \npercent of our electricity in America. There are people trying to get \nus to do away with that. If that should happen, I think he has \narticulated very well what would happen to America if all of a sudden \nwe had to go to natural gas. Already we are seeing some companies \nmoving to Europe and other places because they are thinking that maybe \nwe will buy on to this hoax that will stop us from being able to have \nfossil fuels. That is why when I became chairman of the committee, I \nestablished three guiding principles for that committee.\n  No. 1, we are going to make our decisions not on a political agenda \nbut on sound science. No. 2, we are going to have a cost-benefit \nanalysis. At least let the American people know what types of costs are \ninvolved in some of\n\n[[Page S10013]]\n\nthese regulations that do not make any sense. No. 3, to change the \nattitude, an attitudinal change on the various bureaucracies, so they \nwill be there not to rule the people but to serve the people. Without \nthese principles we cannot make effective public policy decisions. They \nare necessary to both improve the environment and encourage economic \ngrowth and prosperity.\n\n  To the average person hearing, all you want is sound science, that \nsounds perfectly normal. Why would we not want sound science? Why \npredicate decisions on something that has nothing to do with sound \nscience? But leftwing environmental communities insist sound science is \noutrageous. For them a pro-environment policy can only mean top-down \ncommand-and-control rules dictated by bureaucrats; science is \nirrelevant, instead for extremists. Politics and power are the \nmotivating forces for making public policy. Sadly, that is true in the \ncurrent debate over many environmental issues. Too often, emotions \nstoked by irresponsible rhetoric rather than facts based on objective \nscience shape the contours of environmental policy.\n  A rather telling example arose during President Bush's first days in \noffice when emotionalism overwhelmed science in the debate over arsenic \nstandards in drinking water. Environmentalist groups, including the \nSierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council, vilified \nPresident Bush for poisoning children because he questioned the \nscientific bases of the arsenic regulation implemented in the final \ndays of the Clinton administration. The debate featured television ads \nfinanced by environmental extremist groups with children asking for \nanother glass of arsenic-laced water. The science underlying the \nstandard, which was flimsy, was hardly mentioned or held up to any \nscrutiny. In other words, millions of dollars were spent to make people \nthink President Bush wanted to kill children. This is the kind of \nextremism we are facing on a daily basis.\n  The Senate went through a similar exercise we all remember in 1992. I \nwas serving in the other body, but I was here during debate. That year \nsome Members seized on data from NASA suggesting that an ozone hole was \ndeveloping in the Northern Hemisphere. The Senate then rushed into \npanic mode, ramming through by a vote of 96-0 an accelerated ban on \ncertain chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants. Only 2 weeks later NASA \nproduced new data showing that their initial finding was a gross \nexaggeration and the ozone hole never appeared.\n  The issue of catastrophic global warming, which I will speak about \ntoday, fits perfectly this mode. Much of the debate over global warming \nis predicated on fear rather than science. Global-warming alarmists see \na future plagued by catastrophic flooding, war, terrorism, economic \ndislocations, drought, crop failures, mosquito-borne diseases, and \nharsh weather, all caused by manmade greenhouse gas emissions. Hans \nBlix, the guy who could not find anything with both hands, chief of the \nU.S. weapons inspectors, sounded both ridiculous and alarmist when he \nsaid in March: I am more worried about global warming than I am of any \nmajor military conflict.\n  It is no wonder he could not find any weapons of mass destruction.\n  Science writer David Appell, who has written for such publications as \nthe Scientist News and Scientific American, parroted Blix when he said \nglobal warming would ``threaten fundamental food and water resources, \nit would lead to displacement of billions of people in huge waves of \nrevenues, spawn terrorism, topple governments, spread disease across \nthe globe.''\n\n  Appell's next point deserves special emphasis because it demonstrates \nthe sheer lunacy of the environmental extremists. He said global \nwarming would be chaos by any measure, far greater even than the sum \ntotal of chaos of the global wars of the 20th century, and so in this \nsense, Blix is right to be concerned.\n  Sounds like a weapon of mass destruction to me. And that is what we \nare hearing.\n  No wonder the late political scientist Aaron Wildavsky called global \nwarming alarmism the mother of all environmental scares.\n  Appel and Blix sound very much like those who warned us in the 1970s \nthat the planet was headed for a catastrophic global cooling.\n  On April 28, 1975, Newsweek printed the article ``The Cooling World'' \nin which the magazine warned:\n\n       There are ominous signs that the earth's weather patterns \n     have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may \n     portend a drastic decline in food protection--with serious \n     political implications for just about every nation on earth.\n\n  Wait, these are the same guys who talk about global warming today.\n  In a similar form, Time Magazine, June 24, 1974, declared ``Another \nIce Age.''\n\n       However widely the weather varies from place to place and \n     time to time, when meteorologists take an average of \n     temperatures around the globe, they find that the atmosphere \n     has been growing gradually cooler for the past 3 decades.\n\n  Then we had the Science News article that talks of the same thing, \nand an article from Science Digest titled ``Earth's Cooling Climate.''\n\n       Decline in temperatures since 1940 raises question of man's \n     role.\n\n  In 1974, the National Science Board, the governing body of the \nNational Science Foundation, stated: During the last 20 to 30 years, \nworld temperature has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply \nover the last decade.\n  Two years earlier, the board had observed\n\n       judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the \n     present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end \n     . . . leading into the next glacial age.\n\n  That was the same timeframe that the global-warming alarmists are \nconcerned about global warming. How quickly things change. Fear of the \ncoming ice age is old hat, but fear that manmade greenhouse gases are \ncausing temperatures to rise to harmful levels is in vogue now. That is \npopular. Go in any establishment in Washington and the liberals are \ntalking about global warming. They do not care about what is happening \nwith other countries and the weapons of mass destruction. They are \nconcerned about global warming. That is the in thing to talk about.\n  Alarmists brazenly assert that this phenomenon is fact and the \nscience of climate change is settled. In fact, it is far from settled. \nIndeed, it is seriously disputed.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed at the end of my remarks a \nJuly 8th editorial of this year by former Carter administration Energy \nSecretary James Schlesinger on the science of climate change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. INHOFE. Dr. Schlesinger takes issue with alarmists who assert \nthere is a scientific consensus supporting their views. He says, \n``There is an idea among the public that `the science is settled.' That \nremains far from the truth.''\n  Keep in mind, this is not someone from a Republican administration.\n  I refer to a chart demonstrating this is not really a partisan issue. \nThere is no one more knowledgeable on energy than the former Secretary \nof Energy under the Carter administration. He has been saying there is \nscientific disagreement over global warming. It is controversial.\n  But anyone who pays even cursory attention to the issue understands \nthat scientists vigorously disagree over whether human activities are \nresponsible for global warming or whether those activities will \nprecipitate national disasters. Only the scaremongers agree. I submit, \nfurthermore, that not only is there a debate but the debate is shifting \naway from those who subscribe to global-warming alarmism.\n  After studying the issue over the last several years, I believe the \nbalance of the evidence offers strong proof that natural variability, \nnot manmade, is the overwhelming factor influencing climate, and that \nmanmade gases are virtually irrelevant.\n  It is also important to question whether global warming is even a \nproblem for human existence. Thus far, no one has seriously \ndemonstrated any scientific proof that increased global temperatures \nwould lead to the catastrophic predictions by alarmists. In fact, it \nappears just the opposite is true, that increases in global temperature \nhave a beneficial effect on how we live our lives.\n  For these reasons, I will discuss an important body of scientific \nevidence and research that refutes the anthropogenic--which means \nmanmade--theory\n\n[[Page S10014]]\n\nof catastrophic global warmings. I believe this research offers \ncompelling proof that human activities have little or no impact on \nclimate. This research, well documented in scientific literature, \ndirectly challenges the environment world view of the media, so they \ntypically do not receive proper attention and discussion.\n  Certainly, members of the media would rather level personal attacks \non scientists who question ``accepted'' global warming theories than \nengage on the science. So you have two groups at work here: The \nenvironmental extremists doling out to you the lies and the money to \npoliticians and the liberal media that nests with them. This is an \nunfortunate artifact of the debate, a relentless increase in personal \nattacks on certain members of the scientific community who question so-\ncalled conventional wisdom.\n  I believe it is extremely important for the future of this country \nthat the facts and the science get a fair hearing. Without proper \nknowledge and understanding, alarmists will scare the country into \nenacting its ultimate goal: Making energy suppression in the form of \nharmful mandatory restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \nemissions the official policy of the United States of America.\n  Such a policy would induce serious economic harm, especially for the \nlow-income and minority populations. Energy suppression, as official \nGovernment and nonpartisan private analyses have amply confirmed, means \nhigher prices for food, higher prices for medical care, and higher \nprices for electricity, as well as massive job losses and drastic \nreductions in gross domestic product, all the while providing virtually \nno environmental benefit. In other words, it is a raw deal for the \nAmerican people but especially the poor.\n  In a minute we are going to shift to the Kyoto Treaty. The issue of \nglobal warming garnered significant international attention through the \nKyoto Treaty, which requires signatories to reduce their greenhouse gas \nemissions by considerable amounts below the 1990 levels. The Clinton \nadministration, led by former Vice President Al Gore, signed the Kyoto \nTreaty on November 12, 1998, but never submitted it to the Senate for \nratification. Let's remember what our Constitution says: If we want to \njoin a treaty, the President takes the lead and then he submits it to \nbe ratified by the U.S. Senate. It has never been submitted to us.\n  The treaty explicitly acknowledges as true that manmade emissions, \nprincipally from the use of fossil fuels, are causing global \ntemperatures to rise, eventually to catastrophic levels. Kyoto \nenthusiasts believe if we dramatically cut back or even eliminate the \nuse of fossil fuels, the climate system will respond by sending global \ntemperatures back to normal levels--whatever normal levels would be.\n  In 1997, the Senate sent a powerful message that Kyoto was not \nacceptable. In this resolution that was passed, called the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution, they said it is the sense of the Senate--this is very \nsignificant--that:\n\n       The United States should not be a signatory to any protocol \n     to, or other agreement regarding, the United Nations \n     framework convention on climate change of 1992, at \n     negotiations in Kyoto in December of 1997, or thereafter, \n     which would--\n\n  Would do what? No. 1:\n\n     mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions for the Annex 1 parties, unless the protocol or \n     other agreement also mandates new specific scheduled \n     commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for \n     developing country parties within the same compliance period.\n\n  What they are saying, and what we voted on here right in this room, \nin this body, is that we are not going to ratify anything that does not \nimpose the same regulations on developing countries as it does \ndeveloped nations.\n\n  And second:\n\n     that it would result in serious harm to the economy of the \n     United States.\n\n  Obviously, that is very significant at this time. The treaty would \nhave required the United States to reduce its emissions 31 percent \nbelow the level otherwise predicted for 2010. Put another way, the \nUnited States would have had to cut 552 million metric tons of \nCO2 per year by the year 2008 through 2012.\n  As the Business Roundtable pointed out:\n\n       [That target is] the equivalent of having to eliminate all \n     current emissions from either the United States \n     transportation sector--\n\n  That is everything that is moving out there in transportation--\n\n     or the utilities sector, [that would be] residential and \n     commercial, or industry.\n\n  In other words, you have to eliminate everything in order to reach \nthat.\n  The most widely cited and definitive study came from Wharton \nEconometric Forecasting Associates. According to Wharton Econometric \nForecasting Associates' economists, Kyoto would cost 2.4 million U.S. \njobs and reduce GDP by 3.2 percent, or about $300 billion annually, an \namount greater than the total expenditure on primary and secondary \neducation in America. Certainly that would result in the serious harm \nto the economy of the United States that was voted on by this body \nwithout one dissenting vote.\n  Because of Kyoto, American consumers would face higher food, medical, \nand housing costs. For food, an increase of 11 percent; for medicine, \nan increase of 14 percent; and for housing, an increase of 7 percent. \nAt the same time, an average household of four would see its real \nincome drop by $2,700 in 2010, and each year thereafter.\n  Under Kyoto, energy and electricity prices would nearly double and \nthe gasoline prices would go up an additional 65 cents a gallon.\n  I hope somebody is listening out there.\n  Some of the environmental community have dismissed the Wharton report \nas a tainted product. I point them to the 1998 analysis of the Clinton \nEnergy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the \nDepartment of Energy, which largely confirmed Wharton's analysis. Keep \nin mind, all these disastrous results of Kyoto are predicted by the \nWharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, a private consulting \ncompany founded by professors from the University of Pennsylvania's \nWharton Business School.\n  This month the Congressional Budget Office provided further proof \nthat Kyoto-like carbon regulatory schemes are regressive and harmful to \neconomic growth and prosperity.\n  As the CBO--that is, the Congressional Budget Office--found:\n\n       The price increases resulting from a carbon cap would be \n     regressive--that is, they would place a greater burden on \n     lower-income households than higher-income households.\n\n  As to the broader macroeconomic effects of the carbon cap and trade \nschemes, the CBO said:\n\n       A cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions could impose \n     significant costs on the economy in the form of welfare \n     losses. Welfare losses are real costs to the economy in that \n     they would not be recovered anywhere else in the form of \n     higher income. Those losses would be borne by people in their \n     role as shareholders, consumers and workers.\n\n  Some might respond that the Government can simply redistribute the \nwealth, redistribute the income, in a form of welfare programs to \nmitigate the impact, but the CBO found otherwise. The CBO said:\n\n       The Government could use the allowance value to partly \n     redistribute the costs of a carbon cap-and-trade program, but \n     it could not cover these costs entirely. [And, further,] \n     Available research indicates that providing compensation \n     could actually raise the cost to the economy of a carbon cap.\n\n  That is what CBO said just this month.\n  Despite these facts, groups such as Greenpeace blindly assert that \nKyoto ``will not impose significant costs'' and ``will not be an \neconomic burden.''\n  Among the many questions this provokes, one may ask: Won't be a \nburden on whom exactly? Greenpeace doesn't elaborate. But according to \na recent study by the Center for Energy and Economic Development \nsponsored by the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce, if the U.S. ratifies the Kyoto or passes \ndomestic climate policies effectively implementing the treaty, the \nresult would be to:\n\n     disproportionately harm America's minority communities and \n     place the economic advancement of millions of U.S. Blacks and \n     Hispanics at risk.\n\n  This was the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce.\n  Among the study's key findings--and this is one that is very \nsignificant here, too, when we talk about unemployment rates--this line \nwould be unemployment rates without Kyoto. It goes straight across. We \ncan see it starting at about 10.5 percent, going across from the \ncurrent time to 2012.\n\n[[Page S10015]]\n\n  This line down here is the line for Hispanics. This is unemployment \nrates.\n  The study concluded, if we should have to comply with Kyoto \nregulations, it would go up, unemployment would go up at that \nparticular rate and, for Hispanics, at this particular rate.\n  It also affects the poverty rates for Blacks and Hispanics. Again, \nfor Blacks, the poverty rate, if you take this as a baseline and take \nit straight across from the year 2000 to 2012, this being a little over \n26 percent, then you follow with Kyoto, look at what happens to the \npoverty rate--the same thing happening down here for Hispanics. In \nother words, it is discriminatory against these particular individuals.\n  Among the study's key findings--again, let me remind you, this is not \nsome organization that should be questioned; this is the National Black \nChamber of Commerce and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and \namong their findings: Kyoto will cost 511,000 jobs held by Hispanic \nworkers and 864,000 jobs held by Black workers. Poverty rates for \nminority families will increase dramatically, and because Kyoto will \nbring about higher energy prices, many minority businesses will be \nlost.\n  This is not Senator Jim Inhofe talking, this is the National Black \nChamber of Commerce and U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.\n  It is interesting to note, the environmental left purports to \nadvocate policies based on their alleged good for humanity, especially \nthe most vulnerable.\n\n Kyoto is no exception. Yet Kyoto and Kyoto-like policies developed in \nthis body would cause the greatest harm to the very poorest of \nAmericans.\n\n  Environmental alarmists, as an article of faith, peddled the notion \nthat climate change, as Green Peace put it, is ``the biggest \nenvironmental threat facing . . . developing countries.''\n  Such thinking runs totally contrary to the public declaration of the \n2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development, a program sponsored by \nthe United Nations, which found that poverty is the No. 1 one threat to \ndeveloping countries.\n  I would like at this point to talk a little bit about John Christy. \nDr. John Christy is director of the Earth System Science Center at the \nUniversity of Alabama, Huntsville, who passionately reiterated the \npoint about poverty in the May 22 letter to the House Resources \nCommittee Chairman, Richard Pombo of California. As an addendum to his \ntestimony during the committee's hearing on the Kyoto Protocol, Dr. \nChristy, an Alabama State climatologist, talked eloquently about his \nservice as a missionary in Africa.\n  I am going to dwell a little on this because I have had a mission in \nwest Africa for quite a number of years and I have been there and have \nseen what he is about to describe as a reality. We talked about the \npoverty in America. We talked about what is going to happen to \nminorities--Blacks and Hispanics in America.\n  Let us look at where the poverty is the worst. Dr. Christy said, \n``Poverty is the worst polluter.'' As he noted, bringing modern, \ninexpensive electricity to developing countries would raise living \nstandards and lead to a cleaner environment. Kyoto, he said, would be \ncounterproductive, and, as I interpret him, immoral, for Kyoto would \ndivert precious resources away from helping those truly in need to a \nproblem that doesn't exist and a solution that would have no \nenvironmental benefit.\n  The following is an excerpt of a letter worth quoting at length. This \nis Dr. Christy talking about his experience in Africa:\n\n       The typical home was a mud-walled, thatched-roof structure. \n     Smoke from the cooking fire fueled by undried wood was \n     especially irritating to breathe as one entered the home. The \n     fine particles and toxic emissions from these in-house, open \n     fires assured serious lung and eye diseases for a lifetime. \n     And, keeping such fires fueled and burning required a major \n     amount of time, preventing the people from engaging in other \n     less environmentally damaging pursuits.\n       I've always believed that establishing a series of coal-\n     fired power plants in countries such as Kenya (with simple \n     electrification to the villages) would be the best \n     advancement for the African people and the African \n     environment. An electric light bulb, a microwave oven and a \n     small heater in each home would make a dramatic difference in \n     the overall standard of living. No longer would a major \n     portion of time be spent on gathering inefficient and toxic \n     fuel. The serious health problems of hauling heavy loads and \n     lung poisoning would be much reduced. Women would be freed to \n     engage in activities of greater productivity and advancement. \n     Light on demand would allow for more learning to take place \n     and other activities to be completed. Electricity would also \n     foster a more efficient transfer of important information \n     from radio or television. And finally, the preservation of \n     some of the most beautiful and diverse habitats on the planet \n     would be possible if wood were eliminated as a source of \n     energy.\n       Providing energy from sources other than biomass (wood and \n     dung), such as coal-produced electricity, would bring longer \n     and better lives to the people of the developing world and \n     greater opportunity for the preservation of their natural \n     ecosystems. Let me assure you, notwithstanding the views of \n     extreme environmentalists, that Africans do indeed want a \n     higher standard of living. They want to live longer and \n     healthier with less burden bearing and with more \n     opportunities to advance. New sources of affordable, \n     accessible energy would set them down the road of achieving \n     such aspirations.\n       These experiences made it clear to me that affordable, \n     accessible energy was desperately needed in African \n     countries.\n       As in Africa, ideas for limiting energy use, as embodied in \n     the Kyoto protocol, create the greatest hardships for the \n     poorest among us. As I mentioned in the Hearing, enacting any \n     of these noble-sounding initiatives to deal with climate \n     change through increased energy costs, might make a wealthy \n     urbanite or politician feel good about themselves, but they \n     would not improve the environment and would most certainly \n     degrade the lives of those who need help now.\n\n  Some in this body have introduced Kyoto-like legislation that would \nseriously hurt low-income and minority populations.\n  Last year, Tom Mullen, president of the Cleveland Catholic Charities, \ntestified against S. 556, the Clean Power Act of last year, which would \nhave had a lot of Kyoto-type implications; that it would impose onerous \nand unrealistic restrictions, including a Kyoto cap on carbon monoxide \nemissions by electricity.\n  That was Tom Mullen before the committee which I chaired. He is the \npresident of Catholic Charities in Cleveland. He has devoted his whole \nlife to helping poor people.\n  He noted that this regime would mean higher electricity prices for \nthe poorest citizens of Cleveland.\n  For those on fixed incomes, as Mr. Mullen pointed out, higher \nelectricity prices present a choice between eating and staying warm in \nthe winter. As Mr. Mullen said:\n\n       The overall impact on the economy in Northeast Ohio would \n     be overwhelming, and the needs that we address at Catholic \n     Charities in Ohio with the elderly and poor would be well \n     beyond our capacity and that of our current partners in \n     government and the private sector.\n\n  That is the sworn testimony of Mr. Mullen before my committee.\n  I see that Senator Voinovich from Ohio has approached the floor. He \nremembers very well when Tom Mullen of Catholic Charities of Ohio was \nin testifying. Senator Voinovich made several comments as to the \nseriousness that he believed this would impose upon the poor people of \nOhio. There is no one more concerned about the poor people in Ohio than \nSenator Voinovich.\n  In addition to its negative economic impacts, Kyoto still does not \nsatisfy Byrd-Hagel's concerns about developing countries. Though such \ncountries as China, India, Brazil, South Korea, and Mexico are all \nsignatories to Kyoto, they are not required to reduce their emissions \neven though they emit nearly 30 percent of the world's greenhouse \ngases.\n  It says we have to treat the developing nations the same as these \ncountries that have signed onto the protocol. But they don't have to do \nit. Within a generation, they will be the largest emitters of carbon, \nmethane, and other such greenhouse gases.\n  Despite the fact that neither of Byrd-Hagel's conditions has been \nmet, environmentalists echoed by the liberal media have bitterly \ncriticized President Bush for abandoning Kyoto. But one wonders why. \nWhy don't they assail the 95 Senators--both Democrats and Republicans--\nwho, according to Byrd-Hagel, presumably oppose ratification if the \ntreaty came up on the Senate floor?\n  Why don't they assail former President Clinton or Vice President Gore \nwho signed the treaty but never submitted it for ratification?\n  To repeat, it was a unanimous vote saying we cannot ratify Kyoto--the \nKyoto Treaty that the President had\n\n[[Page S10016]]\n\nsigned--unless they would take care of these needs; that is, treating \ndeveloping countries the same as other countries and if it would \nprovide for any kind of damaging economic effect.\n\n  So when you look at it, you see it was 95 to 0. You have Senators who \nare of the liberal persuasion--fine people but certainly a different \nphilosophy than mine; Senators Boxer, Collins, Feingold, Dorgan, \nGraham, Jeffords, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Moseley-Braun, \nRockefeller, and many others--who are really sincerely talking in favor \nof this Kyoto Treaty, but they cast their vote against it. They said: \nWe don't want to ratify this treaty, and we are not going to ratify \nthis treaty unless it treats the developing countries the same as it \ndoes the developed nations and unless it doesn't perform any kind of \ndamage to the economy.\n  If Byrd-Hagel would not ratify Kyoto if it caused substantial harm \nand if the developing countries were not required to participate in the \nsame timetable, now it brings us to a very significant question: If the \nByrd-Hagel conditions are ever satisfied, should the United States \nratify Kyoto? Answering that question depends on several factors, \nincluding whether Kyoto would provide significant needed environmental \nbenefits.\n  First, we should ask what Kyoto is designed to accomplish. According \nto the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Kyoto will \nachieve ``stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \natmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic \ninterference with the climate system.''\n  What does this statement mean? The IPCC offers no elaboration and \ndoesn't provide any scientific explanation about what that level would \nbe. Why? The answer is simple: thus far no one has found a definitive \nscientific answer.\n  Recently scientists have answered that question.\n  Dr. Fred Singer, an atmospheric scientist at the University of \nVirginia, who served as the first Director of the U.S. Weather \nSatellite Service, which is now part of the Department of Commerce, and \nmore recently has served as a member and vice chairman of the National \nAdvisory Committee on Oceans and Atmosphere, said:\n\n       No one knows what constitutes a ``dangerous'' \n     concentration. There exists, as yet, no scientific basis for \n     defining such a concentration, or even of knowing whether it \n     is more or less than current levels of carbon dioxide.\n\n  One might pose the question: If we had the ability to set the global \nthermostat, what temperature would we pick? Would we set it colder or \nwarmer than it is today? What would the optimal temperature be? The \nactual dawn of civilization occurred in a period climatologists call \nthe ``climatic optimum,'' when the mean surface temperature was about 1 \nto 2 degrees Celsius warmer than it is today. If we could choose, what \nwould we choose? Why not go 1 degree or 2 degrees higher, or 1 degree \nor 2 degrees cooler, for that matter?\n  The Kyoto emissions reduction targets are arbitrary, lacking any real \nscientific basis. Kyoto, therefore, will have no impact on global \ntemperatures. This is not just my opinion but the conclusion that is \nreached by the country's top climate scientists.\n  Dr. Tom Wigley, a senior scientist at the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research, found that if the Kyoto protocol were fully \nimplemented by all signatories--now, I will note this next point \nassumes that the alarmist science is correct, which, of course, it is \nnot--if the Kyoto protocol were fully implemented, it would reduce \ntemperatures by a mere .07 degrees Celsius by 2050 and .13 degrees \nCelsius by 2100.\n\n  What does this mean? Such an amount is so small that ground-based \nthermometers cannot even measure it. If you look at this chart, this \nshows the difference all the way from 2000 to 2050. You can see, while \nwe have ups and downs, it is not measurable. We do not have equipment \nthat could measure that precisely.\n  Dr. Richard Lindzen, an MIT scientist and member of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, who has specialized in climate issues for over 30 \nyears, told the Committee on Environment and Public Works--the \ncommittee I chair--on May 2, 2001, that there is a ``definitive \ndisconnect between Kyoto and science. Should a catastrophic scenario \nprove correct, Kyoto would not prevent it.''\n  Similarly, Dr. James Hansen of NASA, considered the father of global \nwarming--he is the guy who thought of all this stuff--said the Kyoto \nprotocol--keep in mind, he is the father of this concept--``will have \nlittle effect'' on global temperature in the 21st century. In a rather \nstunning followup, Hansen said it would take 30 Kyotos--let me repeat \nthat--30 Kyotos to reduce warming to an acceptable level. If 1 Kyoto \ndevastates the American economy, what would 30 Kyotos do?\n  So this leads to another question: If the provisions in the protocol \ndo little or nothing measurable to influence global temperatures, what \ndoes this tell us about the scientific basis for Kyoto?\n  Answering that question requires a thorough examination of the \nscientific work conducted by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change. I am going to refer to this as the IPCC. It is the \nU.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which provides the \nscientific basis for Kyoto. In other words, that is what everything is \nbased on. So I want to talk about that for a few minutes. The \ninternational climate negotiations and substance of claims were made by \nalarmists.\n  In 1992, several nations from around the world gathered in Rio de \nJaneiro for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nThis meeting was premised on the concern that global warming was \nbecoming a problem. The United States, along with many other countries, \nsigned the Framework Convention, committing them to making voluntary \nreductions in greenhouse gases. OK. That was 11 years ago.\n  Over time, it became clear that signatories were not going to reach \ntheir reduction targets as stipulated under Rio. This realization led \nto the Kyoto protocol of 1997, which was an amendment to the Framework \nConvention and which prescribed mandatory reductions only for developed \nnations; that is, the United States. Of course, you know that is \nanother violation of Byrd-Hagel, that it would just affect the \ndeveloped nations, not the developing nations.\n  The science of Kyoto is based on the assessment reports conducted by \nthe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC. Over the last \n13 years, the IPCC has published three assessments, with each one, over \ntime, growing more and more alarmist.\n  The first IPCC assessment report, in 1990, found that the climate \nrecord of the past century was ``broadly consistent'' with the changes \nin the Earth's surface temperature, as calculated by climate models \nthat incorporated the observed increase in greenhouse gases.\n  This conclusion is absurd, considering the climate cooled between \n1940 and 1975, just as industrial activity grew rapidly after World War \nII. It has been difficult to reconcile this cooling with the observed \nincreases in greenhouse gases.\n\n  Let's be sure we understand what is happening. In 1940, and then \nafter the war, is when we had the huge increase in CO2 and \nthe greenhouse gases. Yet that precipitated a cooling period, not a \nwarming period, totally contradicting the science.\n  After its initial publication, the IPCC's second assessment report, \nin 1995, attracted widespread international attention, particularly \namong scientists who believed that human activities were causing global \nwarming. In their view, the report provided the proverbial smoking gun.\n  The most widely cited phrase from that report--which actually came \nfrom the report summary, as few in the media actually read the entire \nreport--was that ``the balance of the evidence suggests a discernible \nhuman influence on global climate.'' This, of course, is so vague that \nit is essentially meaningless.\n  What do they mean by ``suggests''? For that matter, what do they mean \nby ``discernible''? How much human influence is discernible? Is it a \npositive or negative influence? Where is the precise scientific \nquantification?\n  Unfortunately, the media created the impression that man-induced \nglobal warming was fact. On August 10, 1995,\n\n[[Page S10017]]\n\nthe New York Times published an article titled ``Experts Confirm Human \nRole in Global Warming''--not just inaccurate but just an outrageous \nlie. According to the Times account, the IPCC showed that global \nwarming ``is unlikely to be entirely due to natural causes.'' That is \nwhat they said.\n  Of course, when parsed, this account means fairly little. Not \nentirely due to natural causes? Well, how much then? One percent? \nTwenty percent? Eighty-five percent?\n  The IPCC report was replete with caveats and qualifications, \nproviding little evidence to support anthropogenic theories--and \n``anthropogenic'' means manmade--of global warming. The preceding \nparagraph in which the ``balance of evidence'' appears makes exactly \nthat point. It reads:\n\n       Our ability to quantify the human influence on global \n     climate is currently limited because the expected signal is \n     still emerging from the noise of natural variability, and \n     because there are uncertainties in key factors.\n\n  That is the IPCC. Those are their words which totally refute the case \nthey are trying to make. Moreover, the IPCC report was quite explicit \nabout the uncertainties surrounding the link between human actions and \nglobal warming.\n\n       Although these global mean results suggest that there is \n     some anthropogenic component in the observed temperature \n     record, they cannot be considered compelling evidence of a \n     clear cause-and-effect link between anthropogenic forcing and \n     changes in the Earth's surface temperature.\n\n  Remember the IPCC provides the scientific basis for the alarmists' \nconclusion about global warming. But even the IPCC is saying their own \nscience cannot be considered compelling evidence.\n  Dr. John Christy, professor of Atmospheric Science and director of \nthe Earth Systems Science Center at the University of Alabama, a key \ncontributor to the 1995 IPCC report, participated with the lead authors \nin drafting the sections in the detailed review of the scientific text. \nHe wrote--this isn't the IPCC; this is Dr. John Christy--in the \nMontgomery Advertiser, February 22, 1998, that much of what passes for \ncommon knowledge in the press regarding climate change is ``inaccurate, \nincomplete, or viewed out of context.''\n  Many of the misconceptions about climate change originated from the \nIPCC's six-page executive summary. It was the most widely read and \nquoted of the three documents published by the IPCC working group but--\nand this point is crucial--it had the least input from scientists and \nthe greatest input from nonscientists.\n  Let me go to the third assessment. Five years later, the IPCC was \nback again, this time with the Third Assessment Report on Climate \nChange. In October of 2000, the IPCC ``Summary for Policymakers''--that \nis not what the scientists said; that is what the politicians said--was \nleaked to the media which, once again, accepted the IPCC's conclusions \nas fact. Based on the summary, the Washington Post wrote on October 30:\n\n       The consensus on global warming keeps strengthening.\n\n  In a similar vein, the New York Times competently declared on October \n28:\n\n       The international panel of climate scientists, considered \n     the most authoritative voice on global warming, is now \n     concluding that mankind's contribution to the problem is \n     greater than originally believed.\n\n  Look at how these accounts are couched. They are worded to maximize \nthe fear factor. But upon closer inspection, it is clear that such \nstatements have no compelling intellectual content. ``Greater than \noriginally believed,'' what is the baseline from which the Times makes \nthat judgment? Is it .01 percent or 25 percent? And how much greater? \nDouble? Triple? An order of magnitude greater?\n  Such reporting prompted testimony by Dr. Richard Lindzen before the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, the committee I now chair. \nThis was in May of 2001.\n  Dr. Lindzen said:\n\n       Nearly all reading and coverage of the IPCC is restricted \n     to the highly publicized Summaries for Policymakers, which \n     are written by representatives of government, NGO's, and \n     business; the full reports, written by participating \n     scientists, are largely ignored.\n\n  That is what Dr. Lindzen, who is one of the contributing scientists \nto the IPCC, has said. As it turned out, the policymakers' summary was \npoliticized and radically different from the earlier draft. For \nexample, the draft concluded the following concerning the driving case \nfor climate change:\n\n       From the body of the evidence since IPCC (1996), we \n     conclude there has been a discernible human influence on \n     global climate. Studies are beginning to separate the \n     contributions to observed climate change attributable to \n     individual external influences, both anthropogenic and \n     natural. This work suggests that anthropogenic greenhouse \n     gases are a substantial contributor to the observed warming, \n     especially over the past 30 years.\n\n  Keep in mind their conclusion:\n\n       However, the accuracy of these estimates continues to be \n     limited by uncertainties in estimates of internal \n     variability, natural and anthropogenic forcing, and the \n     climate response to external forces.\n\n  In other words, they go all the way through the IPCC, the document on \nwhich all the extremists are basing their conclusions that \nanthropogenic actually contributes to global warming. Yet then they \nhave a disclaimer at the very end.\n  The final version looks quite different and concluded instead:\n\n       In light of new evidence taking into account the remaining \n     uncertainties, most of the observed warming over the last 50 \n     years is likely to have been due to increases in greenhouse \n     gas concentrations.\n\n  Keep in mind ``warming over the last 50 years.'' Remember we showed \nyou those charts going back 25 years. These same people were yelling \nand screaming and complaining that there is a cooling period coming. \nThey had all these fearful statements made about what is going to \nhappen. Now they are saying over the past 50 years, when they \nthemselves said 25 years ago that the concern was cooling.\n  This kind of distortion was not unintentional, as Dr. Lindzen \nexplained for the Environment and Public Works Committee. Dr. Lindzen \nsaid:\n\n       I personally witnessed coauthors forced to assert their \n     ``green'' credentials in defense of their statements.\n\n  This is testimony before our committee. This is from Dr. Lindzen, one \nof the contributors to the IPCC on which they base this premise.\n  In short, some parts of the IPCC process resemble a Soviet-style \ntrial in which the facts are predetermined and ideological purity \ntrumps technical and scientific examinations. The predictions in this \nsummary went far beyond those in the IPCC's 1995 report.\n  The second assessment of the IPCC predicted that the Earth could warm \nby 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2100. The best estimate was a \n2-degree Celsius warming by 2100. Both are highly questionable at best. \nThat was the 1995 report.\n  In the third assessment, the IPCC dramatically increased that \nestimate to a range between 1.4 percent and 5.8 degrees Celsius, even \nthough no new evidence had come to light to justify a dramatic change. \nIn fact, the IPCC's median projected warming actually declined from \n1990 to 1995. IPCC's 1990 initial estimate was 3.2 degrees Celsius. \nThen the IPCC revised 1992--2 years later--estimate was 2.6 degrees \nCelsius, followed by the IPCC revised 1995 estimate of 2.0 degrees \nCelsius. What changed?\n\n  As it turned out, the new prediction was based on faulty, politically \ncharged assumptions about trends in population growth, economic growth, \nand fossil fuel use. The extreme case scenario of a 5.8-degree warming, \nfor instance, rests upon an assumption that the whole world will raise \nits level of economic activity and per capita energy use to that in the \nUnited States. That is what it is based on. That energy use will be \ncarbon intensive. This scenario is simply ludicrous. This essentially \ncontradicts the experience of the industrialized world over the past 30 \nyears. Yet the 5.8 degree figure featured prominently in news stories \nbecause it produced the biggest fear effect.\n  Moreover, when regional climate models of the kind relied upon by the \nIPCC attempt to incorporate such factors as population growth, ``the \ndetails of future climate recede toward unintelligibility,'' according \nto Jerry Mahlman, Director of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics \nLaboratory.\n  Even Dr. Stephen Schneider, an outspoken believer in catastrophic \nglobal warming, criticized the IPCC's assumptions in the journal Nature \non May 3,\n\n[[Page S10018]]\n\n2001. In his article--this is the promoter of the catastrophic global \nwarming fear mongers--Schneider asks:\n\n       How likely is it that the world would get 6 degrees \n     [centigrade] hotter by 2100? [That] depends on the likelihood \n     of the assumptions underlying the projections.\n\n  Keep in mind that Schneider is on the side of the alarmists. \nSchneider's own calculations, which cast serious doubt on the IPCC's \nextreme prediction, broadly agree with an MIT study published in April \nof 2001.\n  It found that there is a ``far less'' than one percent chance that \ntemperatures would rise to 5.8 degrees C or higher, while there is a 17 \npercent chance the temperature rise would be lower than 1.4 degrees.\n  That point bears repeating: even global warming alarmists think the \nlower number is 17 times more likely to be right than the higher \nnumber. Moreover, even if the earth's temperature increases by 1.4 \ndegrees Celsius, does it really matter? The IPCC doesn't offer any \ncredible science to explain what would happen.\n  Gerald North of Texas A University in College Station, agrees that \nthe IPCC's predictions are baseless, in part because climate models are \nhighly imperfect instruments. As he said after the IPCC report came \nout: ``It's extremely hard to tell whether the models have improved'' \nsince the last IPCC report. ``The uncertainties are large.'' Similarly, \nPeter Stone, an MIT climate modeler, said in reference to the IPCC, \n``The major [climate prediction] uncertainties have not been reduced at \nall.''\n  Dr. David Wojick, an expert in climate science, recently wrote in \nCanada's National Post:\n\n       The computer models cannot . . . decide among the variable \n     drivers, like solar versus lunar change, or chaos versus \n     ocean circulation versus greenhouse gas increases. Unless and \n     until they can explain these things, the models cannot be \n     taken seriously as a basis for public policy.\n\n  In short, these general circulation models, or GCMs as they're known, \ncreate simulations that must track over 5 million parameters. These \nsimulations require accurate information on two natural greenhouse gas \nfactors--water vapor and clouds--whose effects scientists still do not \nunderstand.\n  Because of these and other uncertainties, climate modelers from four \nseparate climate modeling centers wrote in the October 2000 edition of \nNature that, ``Forecasts of climate change are inevitably uncertain.'' \nThey go on to explain that, ``A basic problem with all such predictions \nto date has been the difficulty of providing any systematic estimate of \nuncertainty,'' a problem that stems from the fact that ``these \n[climate] models do not necessarily span the full range of known \nclimate system behavior.''\n  Again, to reiterate in plain English, this means the models do not \naccount for key variables that influence the climate system.\n  Despite this, the alarmists continue to use these models and all the \nother flimsy evidence I've cited to support their theories of man-made \nglobal warming--theories they so desperately want to believe.\n  Before I get into another subject, I see the Senator from Ohio, \nSenator Voinovich. I have been talking a little about the committee \nhearing we had. I believe it was at your invitation that Tom Mullins \ncame and testified. I ask you if I am accurately portraying the \ncomments he made concerning the poor people of your State of Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Senator portrayed Tom Mullins' \ncomments accurately. In the statement I am going to be making, I will \nrefer to those remarks--the indication that many of the people who are \npromoting capping carbon at the altar of responding to the climate \nchange promotion are not seeking to affect the impact that capping \ncarbon would have on natural gas questions and on those people in our \ncountry who are least able to pay their energy costs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator. I recall that he almost had tears in \nhis eyes when he talked about the poor people of Ohio and the fact they \nhave to make decisions about eating and heating their homes. It is a \nvery serious thing.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I think the main purpose of his testimony was that in \ndecisions we make in the Senate regarding environmental legislation, we \nought to take into consideration the impact it is having on those who \nhave to pay the energy costs that are increased as a result of those \ninitiatives. There seems to be some type of disconnect between our \nenvironmental policy and our energy policy. What we are hoping to do \nhere is to harmonize our environmental and energy policies so we can \nput together a policy that will reduce emissions and at the same time \nnot destroy our economy and impact on the least of our brethren who pay \na large percentage of what they have toward the cost of energy.\n  Mr. INHOFE. What Tom Mullins said is totally consistent with what I \ntalked about earlier. In the National Black Chamber of Commerce and the \nU.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce they talked about the unemployment \nrate and how it hurts poor people. I think that to be very true.\n  Now I want to turn to temperature trends in the 20th Century. GCMs \npredict that rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations will \ncause temperatures in the troposphere, the layer from 5,000 to 30,000 \nfeet, to rise faster than surface temperatures--a critical fact \nsupporting the alarmist hypothesis.\n  But in fact, there is no meaningful warming trend in the troposphere, \nand weather satellites, widely considered the most accurate measure of \nglobal temperatures, have confirmed this.\n  To illustrate this point, just think about a greenhouse. The glass \npanes let sunlight in but prevent it from escaping. The greenhouse then \nwarms from the top down. As is clear from the science, this simply is \nnot happening in the atmosphere.\n  Satellite measurements are validated independently by measurements \nfrom NOAA balloon radiosonde instruments, with records extending back \nover 40 years. This is very critical. The extremists will tell you \nwarming is occurring.\n  If you look at this chart of balloon data, extremists will tell you \nthat warming is occurring, but if you look more closely you see that \ntemperature in 1955 was higher than temperature in 2000.\n  A recent detailed comparison of atmospheric temperature data gathered \nby satellites with widely-used data gathered by weather balloons \ncorroborates both the accuracy of the satellite data and the rate of \nglobal warming seen in that data.\n  To reiterate, the best data collected from satellites validated by \nballoons to test the hypothesis of a human-induced global warming from \nthe release of CO2 into the atmosphere shows no meaningful \ntrend of increasing temperatures, even as the climate models \nexaggerated the warmth that ought to have occurred from a build-up in \nCO2.\n  Some critics of satellite measurements contend that they don't square \nwith the ground-based temperature record. But some of this difference \nis due to the so-called ``urban heat island effect.'' This occurs when \nconcrete and asphalt in cities absorb--rather than reflect--the sun's \nheat, causing surface temperatures and overall ambient temperatures to \nrise. Scientists have shown that this strongly influences the surface-\nbased temperature record.\n  In a paper published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological \nSociety in 1989, Dr. Thomas R. Karl, senior scientist at the National \nClimate Data Center, corrected the U.S. surface temperatures for the \nurban heat-island effect and found that there has been a downward \ntemperature trend since 1940. This suggests a strong warming bias in \nthe surface-based temperature record.\n  Even the IPCC finds that the urban heat island effect is significant. \nAccording to the IPCC's calculations, the effect could account for up \nto 0.12 degrees Celsius of the 20th century temperature rise, one-fifth \nof the total observed.\n  When we look at the 20th century as a whole, we see some distinct \nphases that question anthropogenic theories of global warming. First, a \nstrong warming trend of about 0.5 C began in the late 19th century and \npeaked around 1940. Next, the temperature decreased from 1940 until the \nlate 1970s.\n  Why is that decrease significant? Because about 80% of the carbon \ndioxide from human activities was added to the air after 1940, meaning \nthe early 20th century warming trend had to be largely natural.\n  Scientists from the Scripps Institution for Oceanography confirmed \nthis phenomenon in the March 12, 1999 issue\n\n[[Page S10019]]\n\nof the journal Science. They addressed the proverbial ``chicken-and-\negg'' question of climate science, namely: when the Earth shifts from \nglacial to warm periods, which comes first: an increase in atmospheric \ncarbon dioxide levels, or an increase in global temperature?\n  The team concluded that the temperature rise comes first followed by \na carbon dioxide boost about 400 to 1,000 years later. This contradicts \neverything alarmists have been saying about manmade global warming in \nthe 20th century. Repeat: The temperature precipitates the carbon \ndioxide increase.\n  We can go even further back, some 400,000 years, and see this \nphenomenon occurring, as the chart clearly shows. Yet the doomsayers, \nundeterred by these facts, will not quit. In February and March of \n2002, the New York Times and the Washington Post, among others, \nreported on the collapse of the Larsen B ice shelf in the Antarctic \nPeninsula, causing quite a stir in the media, and providing alarmists \nwith more propaganda to scare the public.\n  When we look at this chart, we can see this goes back 400,000 years. \nNo one is going to refute this, but the Earth's natural 12,000-year \ncycle of increases and decreases in temperatures is followed by an \nincrease and decrease in CO2. We can see the trends going \nall the way back. It has not really made a major change.\n  Although there was no link to global warming, the Times could not \nhelp but make a suggestion in its March 20 edition:\n\n       While it is too soon to say whether the changes there are \n     related to a buildup of ``greenhouse'' gas emissions that \n     scientists believe are warming the planet, many experts said \n     it was getting harder to find any other explanation.\n\n  The Times, however, simply ignored a recent study in the Journal of \nNature which found the Antarctic has been cooling since 1966.\n  Another study in Science recently found the West Antarctic ice sheet \nto be thickening rather than thinning. University of Illinois \nresearchers also reported a net cooling on the Antarctic Continent \nbetween 1966 and 2000. In some regions, such as the McMurdo dry \nvalleys, temperatures cooled between 1986 and 1999 by as much as 2 \ndegrees during that timeframe.\n  In perhaps the most devastating critique of glacial alarmism, the \nAmerican Geophysical Union found the Arctic was warmer in 1935 than it \nis today.\n  That bears repeating. Eighty percent of the carbon dioxide from human \nactivities was added to the air after 1940. Yet the Arctic was warmer \nin 1935 than it is today.\n  So not only is glacial alarmism flawed, there is no evidence, as \nshown by measurements from satellites and weather balloons, of any \nmeaningful warming trends in the 20th century.\n  I will now talk about health risks. The subject I am going to talk \nabout is probably the most significant, so I hope people will not go \naway.\n  Even as we discuss whether temperatures will go up or down, we should \nask whether global warming will actually produce the catastrophic \neffects the alarmists confidently predict.\n  What gets obscured in the global warming debate is the fact that \ncarbon dioxide is not a pollutant. It is necessary for life. Numerous \nstudies have shown that global warming can actually be beneficial to \nmankind.\n  Most plants, especially wheat and rice, grow considerably better when \nthere is more CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 works \nlike a fertilizer; higher temperatures further enhance the \nCO2 fertilizer effect.\n  In fact, the average crop, according to Dr. John Reilly of the MIT \nJoint Program on Science and Policy of Global Change, is 30 percent \nhigher in a CO2-enhanced world. I repeat that: 30 percent \nhigher in a CO2-enhanced world. This is not just a matter of \nopinion but a well-established phenomenon.\n\n  With regard to the impact of global warming on human health, it is \nassumed that higher temperatures will induce more deaths and massive \noutbreaks of deadly diseases. In particular, a frequent scare tactic by \nalarmists is that warmer temperatures will spark malaria outbreaks. Dr. \nPaul Reiter convincingly debunks this claim in a 2000 study for the \nCenters for Disease Control. As Reiter found:\n\n       Until the second half of the 20th century, malaria was \n     endemic and widespread in many temperature regions--\n\n  This next point is critical--\n\n     with major epidemics as far north as the Arctic Circle.\n\n  Reiter also published a second study in the March 2001 issue of \nEnvironmental Health Perspectives showing that ``despite spectacular \ncooling, malaria persisted throughout Europe.''\n  Another myth is that warming increases morbidity rates. This is not \nthe case, according to Dr. Mendelsohn, environmental economist from \nYale University. Mendelsohn argues that heat stress deaths are caused \nby a temporary variability and not warming. In other words, you do not \ndie of heat because of heat temperature; you die as a result of the \nvariable change.\n  I wish to now go back to the IPCC's third assessment. In addition to \ntrying to predict the future, the third assessment report looked into \nthe past. The IPCC released a graph depicting global temperatures \ntrending slightly downward over the last 10 centuries and then rather \ndramatically increasing beginning around 1900. The cause for such a \nshift, of course, is attributed to industrialization and manmade \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  The now infamous ``hockey stick'' graph was enthusiastically embraced \nby IPCC which used it as a basis for the third assessment. Dr. Michael \nMann at the University of Virginia was its principal authority. The \nstudy, which Mann and others conducted, examined climate trends over \nthe past 1,000 years. As many scientists have pointed out since its \npublication, it contains many flaws.\n  Stay with me. First, Mann's study focuses on temperate trends only in \nthe northern hemisphere. Mann extrapolated that data to reach the \nconclusion that global temperatures remained relatively stable and then \ndramatically increased at the beginning of the 20th century. That leads \nto Mann's conclusion that the 20th century has been the warmest in the \nlast 1,000 years. As is obvious, however, such an extrapolation cannot \nprovide a reliable global perspective of long-term climate changes.\n  Moreover, Mann's conclusions were drawn mainly from 12 sets of \nclimate proxy data, of which 9 were tree rings, while the remaining 3 \ncame from ice cores. Notably, some of the ice core data was drawn from \nthe southern hemisphere--one from Greenland and two from Peru. What is \nleft is a picture of the northern hemisphere based on eight sets of \ntree ring data--again, hardly a convincing global picture for the last \n1,000 years.\n  Mann's hockey stick dismisses both the Medieval Warm Period--and that \nwas roughly 800 A.D. to about 1300, 1350 A.D.--and the Little Ice Age \nwhich was from 1350 to 1850, two climatic events that are fairly widely \nrecognized in the scientific literature to be accurate.\n\n  Mann believes that the 20th century is ``nominally the warmest'' of \nthe past millennium and that the decade of the 1990s was the warmest \ndecade on record.\n  The Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age are replaced by a largely \nbenign and slightly cooling linear trend in climate until 1900. But as \nis clear from a close analysis of Mann's methods, the hockey stick is \nformed by crudely grafting the surface temperature record of the 20th \ncentury into a pre-1900 tree ring record.\n  This is a highly controversial and scientifically flawed approach. As \nis widely recognized in the scientific community, two data series \nrepresenting radically different variables--temperature and tree \nrings--cannot be grafted together credibly to create a single series. \nIn simple terms, as Dr. Patrick Michaels of the University of Virginia \nexplained, this is like comparing apples to oranges.\n  Even Mann and his coauthors admit that if the tree ring data set were \nremoved from their climate reconstruction, the calibration and \nverification procedures they used would undermine their conclusions.\n  A new study from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, \nwhich I will comment on shortly, strongly disputes Mann's methods and \nhypotheses. As coauthor Dr. David Legates wrote:\n\n       Although [Mann's work] is now widely used as proof of \n     anthropogenic global warming, we've become concerned that \n     such an analysis is in direct contradiction to most of the \n     research and written histories available.\n\n[[Page S10020]]\n\n       Our paper shows this contradiction and argues that the \n     results of Mann . . . are out of step with the preponderance \n     of the evidence.\n\n  The scientific evidence. That is worth repeating: Mann's theory of \nglobal warming is out of step with most scientific thinking on the \nsubject.\n  What we are talking about in plain English is the science news by the \nenvironmental alarmist is not just flawed; it is just not there. But \nthere is more.\n  Based in part on the data supporting the IPCC's key reports, \nthousands of scientists have rejected the scientific basis of Kyoto. \nRecently, 46 climate experts wrote an open letter to Canada's National \nPost on June 3 of this year claiming that the Kyoto Protocol lacks \ncredible science. This is 46 leading climate experts.\n  I ask that the entire text of the letter from these 46 leading \nclimate experts be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. The scientists wrote that the Canadian Prime Minister \nessentially ignored an earlier letter they drafted in 2001. In it, they \nwrote:\n\n       Many climate science experts from Canada and around the \n     world, while still strongly supporting environmental \n     protection, equally strongly disagree with the scientific \n     rationale for the Kyoto Accord.\n\n  In their June 3 letter, the group wrote to Paul Martin, a Canadian \nmember of Parliament, urging him to consider the consequences of a \nKyoto ratification. This is the country of Canada. Quoting now from \nthat letter:\n\n       Although ratification has already taken place, we believe \n     that the government of Canada needs a far more comprehensive \n     understanding of what climate science really says if \n     environmental policy is to be developed that will truly \n     benefit the environment while maintaining the economic \n     prosperity so essential to social progress.\n\n  Many scientists share the same view. I mentioned several other \ncountries' leading climate scientists earlier in this speech. In \naddition, over 4,000 scientists, 70 of whom are Nobel Prize winners, \nsigned the Heidelberg Appeal, which says that no compelling evidence \nexists to justify controls of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; \nthat is, manmade emissions.\n  Let me repeat that. Over 4,000 scientists, 70 of whom are Nobel Prize \nwinners, signed the Heidelberg Appeal which says that no compelling \nevidence exists to justify controls of greenhouse gas emissions, \nmanmade greenhouse gas emissions. They agree it is a hoax.\n  Now, I also want to point to a 1998 survey of State climatologists, \nwhich reveals that a majority of respondents have serious doubts about \nwhether anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases present a serious \nthreat to climate stability.\n  Then there is Dr. Frederick Seitz, a past president of the National \nAcademy of Sciences and a professor emeritus at Rockefeller University, \nwho compiled the Oregon Petition, and it reads as follows:\n\n       We urge the United States Government to reject the global \n     warming agreement that was written in Kyoto, Japan, in \n     December, 1997, and any other similar proposals. The proposed \n     limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder \n     the advance of science and technology, and damage the health \n     and welfare of mankind.\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases \n     is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, \n     cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and \n     disruption of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is \n     substantial scientific evidence that increases in \n     atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many beneficial effects \n     upon the natural plant and animal environments of the \n     earth.\n\n  That is Dr. Frederick Seitz, former president of the National Academy \nof Sciences.\n  The petition has 17,800 independently verified signatures, and for \nthose signers who hold a Ph.D., 95 percent have now been independently \nverified. Environmental groups have attacked the credibility of this \npetition based on one false name sent in by some green pranksters. \nSeveral names are still on the list even though biased press reports \nhave ridiculed their identity with the names of famous personalities. \nThey are actual signers.\n  A guy named Perry Mason, for example, is a Ph.D. chemist. He was one \nof the signers.\n  The most significant thing that just recently came out is the Harvard \nSmithsonian 1,000-year climate study. Let me turn to an important new \nstudy by the researchers. The study entitled ``Proxy Climatic and \nEnvironmental Changes of the Past 1,000 Years'' offers a devastating \ncritique of Mann's hypothesis calling into question the IPCC's Third \nAssessment, and indeed the entire intellectual foundation of the \nalarmists' views. It draws on extensive evidence showing that major \nchanges in global temperatures result not from manmade emissions but \nfrom natural causes.\n  Smithsonian scientists, Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas, with \ncoauthors Craig Idso, Sherwood Idso, and David Legates, compiled and \nexamined results from more than 240 peer-reviewed papers published by \nthousands of researchers over the past four decades. In contrast to \nMann's flawed, limited research, the Harvard-Smithsonian study covers a \nmultitude of geophysical and biological climate indicators. While \nMann's analysis relied mostly on tree-ring data from the Northern \nHemisphere, the researchers offer a detailed look at climate changes \nthat occurred in different regions around the world over the last 1,000 \nyears.\n  The range of the climate proxies--now, keep in mind, we are talking \nabout one of them that was just primarily looking at tree rings, but \nthese 240 studies that were analyzed in the Smithsonian-Harvard report \nlooked at borehole data, cultural data, glacier advances or retreats, \ngeomorphology, isotopic analysis from lake sediments or ice cores, tree \nor peat celluloses, corals, stalagmite or biological fossils, net ice \naccumulation rate, including dust or chemical counts, lake fossils and \nsediments, river sediments, melt layers in ice cores, phenological and \npaleontological fossils, pollen, seafloor sediments, luminescent \nanalysis, everything that fit every kind of proxy that could be known \nto science.\n  Based on this proxy data drawn from the 240 peer-reviewed studies, \nthe authors offered highly convincing evidence to support the Little \nIce Age and the Medieval Warm Period. As coauthor Dr. Sallie Baliunas \nexplained:\n\n       For a long time, researchers have possessed anecdotal \n     evidence supporting the existence of these climate extremes.\n\n  What happened during these periods? We remember what happened during \nthese periods. Baliunas notes that, during the Medieval Warm Period:\n\n       The Vikings established colonies in Greenland at the \n     beginning of the second millennium that died out several \n     hundred years later when the climate turned colder.\n\n  In England, she found that:\n\n       Vineyards had flourished during the medieval warmth.\n\n  In their study, the authors accumulated reams of objective data to \nback up these cultural indicators.\n  The Medieval Warm Period, or Medieval Optimum, occurred between 800 \nto 1300. Among the studies surveyed by the authors, 112 contained \ninformation about the warm period. Of these, 103 showed evidence for \nthe Medieval Warm Period; two did not; seven had equivocal answers.\n  Looking just at the Southern Hemisphere, the authors found 22 \nstudies, 21 of which confirmed the warm period and only one that did \nnot.\n  The authors also looked at the 20th century and examined 102 studies \nto determine whether it was the warmest on record. Three studies said \nyes, 16 had equivocal answers, and of the remaining 83, 79 showed \nperiods of at least 50 years that were warmer than any 50-year period \nin the 20th century.\n  I must say, to any reasonable person, these ratios appear very \nconvincing and undoubtedly rest on a solid scientific foundation. \nAgain, remember, the conclusions of this study are based on 240 peer-\nreviewed studies, and this chart shows what the Harvard-Smithsonian \nresearchers concluded.\n  Peer review means they were rigorously reviewed and critiqued by \nother scientists before they were published. This climate study, \npublished in March of 2003, is the most comprehensive of its kind in \nhistory. According to the authors, some of the global warming during \nthe 20th century is attributable to the climate system recovering from \nthe Little Ice Age. Global warming alarmists, however, vehemently \ndisagree, and pull a scientific sleight of hand by pointing to the 140-\nyear direct temperature record as evidence of warming caused by humans. \nBut as the authors note:\n\n       The direct temperature measurement record is too short . . \n     . to provide good measures of natural variability in its full \n     dynamic range.\n\n\n[[Page S10021]]\n\n\n  This research begs an obvious question: If the Earth was warmer \nduring the Middle Ages than the age of coal-fired powerplants and SUVs, \nwhat role do manmade emissions play in influencing climate? I think any \nperson with a modicum of common sense would say, not much and maybe \nnone.\n  How did the media report on the Harvard-Smithsonian study? The big \ndailies, such as the New York Times and the Washington Post, basically \nignored it. I was impressed by a fair and balanced piece in the Boston \nGlobe. Unfortunately, some of the media could not resist playing \npolitics of personal destruction.\n\n  Before I move on, I add another point about climate history. For the \nlast several minutes, I have talked about natural climate variability \nover the past 1,000 years. We can go back even further in history to \nsee dramatic changes in climate that had nothing to do with SUVs or \npowerplants. During the last few hundred thousand years, the Earth has \nseen multiple repeated periods of glaciation. Each ice age has ended \nbecause of dramatic increases in global temperatures which had nothing \nto do with fossil fuel emissions.\n  In fact, the last major glacier retreat, marking the end of the Wurm \nGlaciation, was only 12,000 years ago. At the end, the temperature was \n14 degrees Celsius lower than today and climbed rapidly to present day \ntemperature--and did so in as little as 50 years. Thus began our \ncurrent Holocene Age of warm climates and glacier retreat.\n  These cycles of warming and cooling have been found so frequent and \nare so often so much more dramatic than the fractional degree changes \nmeasured over the last century that one wonders if the alarmists are \nsimply ignorant of geological and meteorological history or simply \nignoring it to advance their agenda.\n  What is the real story behind Kyoto? As I pointed out, the science \nunderlying the Kyoto Protocol has been thoroughly discredited. But for \nsome reason the drive to implement Kyoto continues apace in the United \nStates and more fervently in Europe. What is going on here?\n  The Europeans continue to insist that the United States should honor \nits international responsibilities and ratify Kyoto. In June of 2001 \nGermany released a statement declaring the world needs Kyoto because \nits greenhouse gas reduction targets are indispensable.\n  Similarly, Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson, in June of 2001, \nsaid flatly and without explanation that ``Kyoto is necessary.'' The \nquestion is, indispensable and necessary for what?\n  Certainly not for further reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as \nEurope has proven. According to news reports earlier this year, the \nEuropean Union has failed to meet its Kyoto targets. As we know, \naccording to the best scientific evidence, Kyoto will do nothing to \nreduce global temperatures.\n  As it turns out, Kyoto's objective has nothing to do with saving the \nglobe. In fact, it is purely political. The case in point, French \nPresident Jacques Chirac said during a speech at The Hague in November \nof 2002 that Kyoto represents ``the first component of an authentic \nglobal governance.'' Keep in mind who we are talking about--Jacques \nChirac of France. He wants the authentic global governance. You have to \nask if we are going to let the French dictate our United States policy.\n  Margot Wallstrom, EU environment commissioner, takes a different view \nbut one instructive about the real motives of Kyoto proponents. She \nasserts that Kyoto is about ``the economy, about leveling the playing \nfield for big businesses worldwide.'' In other words, we in this \ncountry should level the playing field so we are equal with the \nEuropean Union. That is very significant in terms of what the real \nmotives are.\n  Chirac and Wallstrom's comments mean two things: Kyoto represents an \nattempt by certain elements within the international community to \nrestrain United States interests; second, Kyoto is an economic weapon \ndesigned to undermine the global competitiveness and economic \nsuperiority of the United States.\n  I am mystified that some in this body and in the media blithely \nassert that the science of global warming is settled; that is, fossil \nfuel emissions are the principal, driving cause of global warming.\n  In a letter to me concerning the next EPA administrator, two Senators \nwrote, ``The pressing problem of global warming'' is now ``established \nscientific fact,'' and demanded that the new administrator commit to \naddressing it.\n  With all due respect, this statement is baseless for several reasons, \nas I outlined in detail above. The evidence is overwhelmingly in favor \nof those who do not see global warming proposing harm to the planet and \nwho do not think human beings have an insignificant influence on the \nclimate system.\n  This leads to another question: Why would this body subject the \nUnited States to Kyoto-like measures that have no environmental \nbenefits and cause serious harm to the economy? There are several \npieces of legislation, including several that have been referred to my \ncommittee, that effectively implement Kyoto without ratifying the \ntreaty. From a cursory read of the Senate politics, it is my \nunderstanding some of these bills enjoy more than a modicum of support.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject them and follow the science to the \nfacts. Reject approaches designed not to solve an environmental problem \nbut to satisfy the ever-growing demand of environmental groups for \nmoney and for power and other extremists who simply do not like \ncapitalism, free markets, and freedom.\n  Climate alarmists see an opportunity here to tax the American people. \nConsider the July 11 Op-ed by J.W. Anderson of the Washington Post. \nAnderson, a former editorial writer of the Post and now a journalist in \nresidence with Resources for the Future, concedes that climate science \nstill confronts uncertainties, but his solution is a field tax to \nprepare for a potentially catastrophic future. Based on the case I have \noutlined today, such a course of action fits a particularly ideological \nagenda but is entirely unwarranted.\n  It is my fervent hope Congress will reject prophets of doom who \npeddle propaganda masquerading as science in the name of saving the \nplanet. I urge my colleagues to put stock in scientists who rely on the \nbest, most objective scientific data and reject fear as a motivating \nbasis for making public policy decisions.\n  Let me be very clear: Alarmists are attempting to enact an agenda of \nenergy suppression that is inconsistent with American values, freedom, \nprosperity, and environmental problems.\n  Over the past hour and a half I have offered compelling evidence that \ncatastrophic global warming is a hoax. That conclusion is supported by \npainstaking work of the Nation's top planet scientists. We have those \nscientists who concluded that the Kyoto protocol has no environmental \nbenefits; natural variability, not fossil fuel emissions, is an \noverwhelming factor influencing climate change; satellite data, \nconfirmed by NOAA, confirms that no meaningful warming has occurred \nover the last century; and climate models predicting dramatic \ntemperature increases over the next 100 years are flawed and highly \nimperfect.\n  These scientists include Dr. Fred Singer, from the University of \nVirginia; Dr. Tom Wigley, senior scientist at the National Center for \nAtmospheric Research; Dr. Richard Lindzen from the National Academy of \nScience. Everyone listed is someone whose credentials cannot be \nquestioned.\n  If you study that, you will come to the same conclusions. These are \nobjective scientists, not fundraisers for some far-left environmental \nextremist groups.\n  Finally, I return to the words of Dr. Frederick Seitz, a past \npresident of the National Academy of Sciences, a professor emeritus at \nRockefeller University, who compiled the Oregon Petition. He said:\n\n       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human \n     release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse \n     gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause \n     catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption \n     of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial \n     scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon \n     dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural \n     plant and animal environments of the Earth.\n\n  These are sobering words which the extremists have chosen to \nignore. So what could possibly be the motivation for global warming \nalarmism? Since I have become the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee,\n\n[[Page S10022]]\n\nit has become pretty clear. It is fundraising. Environmental extremists \nrake in millions of dollars, not to solve environmental problems but to \nfuel their ever-growing fundraising machines, part of which are \nfinanced by the Federal taxpayers.\n\n  So what have we learned from the scientists and economists I talked \nabout today? Five things, briefly:\n  No. 1, the claim that global warming is caused by manmade emissions \nis simply untrue and not based on sound science.\n  No. 2, CO2 does not cause catastrophic disasters. \nActually, it would be beneficial to our environment and the economy.\n  No. 3, Kyoto would impose huge cost on Americans, especially the \npoor.\n  No. 4, the same environmentalists who are hysterical over global \nwarming today were just as hysterical in the 1970s over global cooling.\n  And, No. 5, the motives for Kyoto are economic, not environmental; \nthat is, proponents favor handicapping the American economy through \ncarbon taxes and more regulations.\n  So I will just conclude by saying: Wake up, America. With all the \nhysteria, all the fear, all the phony science, could it be that manmade \nglobal warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American \npeople? I believe it is.\n  And if we allow these detractors of everything that has made America \ngreat, those ranging from the liberal Hollywood elitists to those who \nare in it for the money, if we allow them to destroy the foundation, \nthe greatness of the most highly industrialized nation in the history \nof the world, then we don't deserve to live in this one nation under \nGod. So I say to the real people: Wake up, make your voice heard. My 11 \ngrandchildren and yours are depending on you.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 7, 2003]\n\n               Climate Change: The Science Isn't Settled\n\n                         (By James Schlesinger)\n\n       Despite the certainty many seem to feel about the causes, \n     effects and extent of climate change, we are in fact making \n     only slow progress in our understanding of the underlying \n     science. My old professor at Harvard, the great economist \n     Joseph Schumpeter, used to insist that a principal tool of \n     economic science was history--which served to temper the \n     enthusiasms of the here and now. This must be even more so in \n     climatological science. In recent years the inclination has \n     been to attribute the warming we have lately experienced to a \n     single dominant cause--the increase in greenhouse gases. Yet \n     climate has always been changing--and sometimes the swings \n     have been rapid.\n       At the time the U.S. Department of Energy was created in \n     1977, there was widespread concern about the cooling trend \n     that had been observed for the previous quarter-century. \n     After 1940 the temperature, at least in the Northern \n     Hemisphere, had dropped about one-half degree Fahrenheit--and \n     more in the higher latitudes. In 1974 the National Science \n     Board, the governing body of the National Science Foundation, \n     stated: ``During the last 20 to 30 years, world temperature \n     has fallen, irregularly at first but more sharply over the \n     last decade.'' Two years earlier, the board had observed: \n     ``Judging from the record of the past interglacial ages, the \n     present time of high temperatures should be drawing to an end \n     . . . leading into the next glacial age.'' And in 1975 the \n     National Academy of Sciences stated: ``The climates of the \n     earth have always been changing, and they will doubtless \n     continue to do so in the future. How large these future \n     changes will be, and where and how rapidly they will occur, \n     we do not know.''\n       These statements--just a quarter-century old--should \n     provide us with a dose of humility as we look into the more \n     distant future. A touch of that humility might help temper \n     the current raging controversies over global warming. What \n     has concerned me in recent years is that belief in the \n     greenhouse effect, persuasive as it is, has been transmuted \n     into the dominant forcing mechanism affecting climate \n     change--more or less to the exclusion of other forcing \n     mechanisms. The CO2/climate-change relationship \n     has hardened into orthodoxy--always a worrisome sign--an \n     orthodoxy that searches out heretics and seeks to punish \n     them.\n       We are in command of certain essential facts. First, since \n     the start of the 20th century, the mean temperature at the \n     earth's surface has risen about 1 degree Fahrenheit. Second, \n     the level of CO2 in the atmosphere has been \n     increasing for more than 150 years. Third, CO2 is \n     a greenhouse gas--and increases in it, other things being \n     equal, are likely to lead to further warming. Beyond these \n     few facts, science remains unable either to attribute past \n     climate changes to changes in CO2 or to forecast \n     with any degree of precision how climate will change in the \n     future.\n       Of the rise in temperature during the 20th century, the \n     bulk occurred from 1900 to 1940. It was followed by the \n     aforementioned cooling trend from 1940 to around 1975. Yet \n     the concentration of greenhouse gases was measurably higher \n     in that later period than in the former. That drop in \n     temperature came after what was described in the National \n     Geographic as ``six decades of abnormal warmth.''\n       In recent years much attention has been paid in the press \n     to longer growing seasons and shrinking glaciers. Yet in the \n     earlier period up to 1975, the annual growing season in \n     England had shrunk by some nine or 10 days, summer frosts in \n     the upper Midwest occasionally damaged crops, the glaciers in \n     Switzerland had begun to advance again, and sea ice had \n     returned to Iceland's coasts after more than 40 years of its \n     near absence.\n       When we look back over the past millennium, the questions \n     that arise are even more perplexing. The so-called Climatic \n     Optimum of the early Middle Ages, when the earth temperatures \n     were 1 to 2 degrees warmer than today and the Vikings \n     established their flourishing colonies in Greenland, was \n     succeeded by the Little Ice Age, lasting down to the early \n     19th century. Neither can be explained by concentrations of \n     greenhouse gases. Moreover, through much of the earth's \n     history, increases in CO2 have followed global \n     warming, rather than the other way around.\n       We cannot tell how much of the recent warming trend can be \n     attributed to the greenhouse effect and how much to other \n     factors. In climate change, we have only a limited grasp of \n     the overall forces at work. Uncertainties have continued to \n     abound--and must be reduced. Any approach to policy formation \n     under conditions of such uncertainty should be taken only on \n     an exploratory and sequential basis. A premature commitment \n     to a fixed policy can only proceed with fear and trembling.\n       In the Third Assessment by the International Panel on \n     Climate Change, recent climate change is attributed primarily \n     to human causes, with the usual caveats regarding \n     uncertainties. The record of the past 150 years is scanned, \n     and three forcing mechanisms are highlighted: anthropogenic \n     (human-caused) greenhouse gases, volcanoes and the 11-year \n     sunspot cycle. Other phenomena are represented poorly, if at \n     all, and generally are ignored in these models. Because only \n     the past 150 years are captured, the vast swings of the \n     previous thousand years are not analyzed. The upshot is that \n     any natural variations, other than volcanic eruptions, are \n     overshadowed by anthropogenic greenhouse gases.\n       Most significant: The possibility of long-term cycles in \n     solar activity is neglected because there is a scarcity of \n     direct measurement. Nonetheless, solar irradiance and its \n     variation seem highly likely to be a principal cause of long-\n     term climatic change. Their role in longer-term weather \n     cycles needs to be better understood.\n       There is an idea among the public that ``the science is \n     settled.'' Aside from the limited facts I cited earlier, that \n     remains far from the truth. Today we have far better \n     instruments, better measurements and better time series than \n     we have ever had. Still, we are in danger of prematurely \n     embracing certitudes and losing open-mindedness. We need to \n     be more modest.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n     The Hon. Paul Martin, P.C.,\n     Member of Parliament, House of Commons, Ottawa, Ontario.\n       Dear Mr. Martin: We understand from media reports that you \n     believe that more consultation with the provinces should have \n     taken place before moving forward with ratification of the \n     Kyoto Accord. We would like to alert you to the fact that the \n     current government neglected to conduct comprehensive science \n     consultations as well. The statements by current Minister of \n     the Environment David Anderson that Prime Minister Jean \n     Chretien's decision to ratify the Kyoto accord was based \n     merely on a ``gut feeling,'' not an understanding of the \n     issue, clearly illustrates that a more thorough examination \n     of the science should have taken place before a ratification \n     decision was made.\n       If you are to lead the next government, we believe that a \n     high priority should be placed on correcting this situation \n     and conducting wide ranging consultations with non-\n     governmental climate scientists as soon as possible in order \n     to properly consider the range of informed opinion pertaining \n     to the science of Kyoto.\n       Many of us made the same suggestion to the Prime Minister \n     in an open letter on Nov. 25, 2002, in which we alerted Mr. \n     Chretien to the fact that Kyoto was not justified from a \n     scientific perspective. That letter called on the government \n     of Canada ``to delay a decision on the ratification of the \n     Kyoto Accord until after a thorough and comprehensive \n     consultation is conducted with non-governmental climate \n     specialists.'' It was explained to the Prime Minister that, \n     ``Many climate science experts from Canada and around the \n     world, while still strongly supporting environmental \n     protection, equally strongly disagree with the scientific \n     rationale for the Kyoto Accord.''\n       Unfortunately, the Prime Minister took no action on the \n     issue and proceeded to ratify the accord without the \n     government and the public having had the benefit of hearing a \n     proper science debate on an issue that is sure to affect \n     Canadians for generations to come.\n       We strongly believe that important environmental policy \n     should be based on a strong\n\n[[Page S10023]]\n\n     foundation of environmental science. Censoring credible \n     science out of the debate because it does not conform to a \n     pre-determined political agenda is clearly not a responsible \n     course of action for any government. Your openness to re-\n     examining the recent approach to the Kyoto file encourages us \n     to believe that you may also be open to reconsidering the way \n     in which the scientific debate was suppressed as well. We \n     certainly hope so. Although ratification has already taken \n     place, we believe that the government of Canada needs a far \n     more comprehensive understanding of what climate science \n     really says if environmental policy is to be developed that \n     will truly benefit the environment while maintaining the \n     economic prosperity so essential to social progress.\n       In the meantime, we would be happy to provide you with more \n     information on this important topic and, for those of us who \n     are able, we would like to offer to meet with you personally \n     to discuss the issue further in the near future.\n       Above letter signed by:\n       Dr. Tim Ball, Environmental Consultant, 28 years Professor \n     of Climatology, University of Winnipeg.\n       Dr. Madhav Khandekar, Environmental Consultant, former \n     Research Scientist with Environment Canada. 45-year career in \n     the fields of climatology, meteorology and oceanography.\n       Dr. Tad Murty, private sector climate researcher. \n     Previously Senior Research Scientist for Fisheries and \n     Oceans; conducted official DFO climate change/sea level \n     review; Former Director of the National Tidal Facility of \n     Australia; Current editor--``Natural Hazards''.\n       Dr. Chris de Freitas (Canadian), Climate Scientist and \n     Professor--School of Geography and Environmental Science, The \n     University of Auckland, NZ.\n       Dr. Vaclav Smil, FRSC, Distinguished Professor of \n     Geography; specialization in climate and CO2, \n     University of Manitoba.\n       Dr. I.D.

Mr. President, I speak today on the subject: A fast track, \na fast way around the Constitution.\n  Last Friday, I listened with great interest to the concerns that were \nraised in opposition to the free-trade agreements negotiated by the \nadministration with Chile and Singapore.\n  Senators cited an abuse of Executive authority and the undermining of \nCongress' plenary powers. I was perplexed,\n\n[[Page S10024]]\n\nto put it mildly--not at the arguments against such abuses by the \nExecutive but at the fact that some Senators were only now waking up to \nthe potential for such a power grab.\n  To those who now express concerns that the plenary powers of the \nCongress are under attack by this administration, I say that we have no \none to blame but ourselves. The Congress inflicted this wound upon \nitself. We have plunged the knife into our own throats. It is our hands \non the hilt of that knife.\n  I refer to the Congress' massively destabilizing decision to disrupt \nthe balance of powers between the executive and legislative branches by \ngranting fast-track trade negotiating authority to the President.\n  So many of the objections expressed last week in opposition to these \nfree trade agreements have been raised before, time and time again on \nthis Senate floor. Just last summer, they were raised by me, by our \ncolleague Senator Hollings, by our colleague Senator Dorgan; by our \ncolleague Senator Dayton, and others, warning of the abuse of Executive \npower we were inviting by handing over to the President the authority \nto regulate trade and international commerce.\n  We stood on this very floor and spoke to our colleagues, to the \npeople in the galleries here and to the public across the land about \nwhat could be expected from the use of fast-track authority should such \nlegislation be passed. We also spoke of the Constitutional \nramifications of fast track. At the time, our expressions of concern \napparently fell upon deaf ears.\n  Sixty-seven Senators, some of whom are now so urgently speaking in \nopposition to these free trade agreements pending before the Senate, \nvoted to grant fast-track authority to the President.\n  I can pound my fist on my desk. I can shout with brass lungs. But, \nultimately, it's not until it's too late, not until the Senate has been \nrelegated to the sidelines, not until this Trojan horse has entered \nthis sacred chamber that Senators begin to realize just what we have \ngiven away.\n  Shame on us!\n  This month, the administration submitted the free trade agreements it \nnegotiated with the nations of Chile and Singapore. Included in those \nagreements are proposed changes to U.S. immigration and naturalization \nlaws that would create what is effectively a permanent visa worker \nprogram for Chile and Singapore.\n  The trade agreements negotiated by the administration would unfairly \nlower the threshold for up to 1,400 Chileans and 5,400 Singaporeans to \nobtain American jobs. These foreign nationals could renew their worker \nvisas indefinitely, year after year, with no limitation, while \nadditional foreign workers enter the country to fill the annual \nnumerical limitations for new visas.\n  Chilean and Singaporean nationals who enter the United States under \nthese agreements would effectively be exempted from prevailing wage \nlaws. Even though employers must attest that foreign workers will be \npaid the prevailing industry wage and not displace U.S. workers, the \nLabor Department would be prohibited from investigating and certifying \nthese attestations prior to the worker entering the country.\n  Further, the Congress would have no recourse to remedy any injustice, \neither by setting numerical caps or requiring a Labor Department \ncertification, without violating the trade accord.\n  With 9.4 million Americans out of work, and an economy that has \nstalled for America's workers, the administration's immigration \nproposals are perhaps the most egregious that I have seen in some time. \nThey are a direct threat to American workers who have already been hit \nhard by the Bush administration's economic policies. And now, what jobs \nthe administration has not yet destroyed are being given away to \nforeign labor.\n  It is not even clear under what authority the administration is \nproposing to make these immigration changes. The Trade Promotion Act \nprovides no specific authority to the United States Trade \nRepresentative to negotiate new visa categories or other changes to our \nimmigration laws. The Congress has not granted the administration any \nsuch authority.\n  To the contrary, since the September 11 attacks, the Congress has \npassed legislation requiring the administration to tighten our border \nsecurity and visa entry system--to plug the holes that were exploited \nby the September 11 hijackers. And now the administration is trying to \nopen the system all over again.\n  I doubt that these immigration provisions could survive outside of \nthe expedited procedures of fast track, subjected to thorough debate \nand amendment by the House and Senate. But that may explain why they \nare in these trade agreements in the first place. After all, a free \ntrade agreement is not subject to amendment. It is not subject to a \nthorough debate. Any committee action is token, at best. The Congress \nmust approve or reject the trade agreement in 90 legislative days.\n  These trade agreements and their immigration provisions may only be a \nfirst step in setting a precedent where the administration can use \nfree-trade agreements not only to propose changes to immigration laws \nbut to isolate all kinds of controversial legislation from the \nCongress. Perhaps next time the trade agreement submitted will include \nchanges involving our military defenses or our international tax laws \nor our foreign aid budget.\n  The possibilities are frightening to imagine.\n  The late-Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was fond of saying that the \nU.S. Constitution does not assume virtue in its rulers. It assumes \nself-interest. And it carefully balances the power by which one \ninterest will offset another interest in order to protect against what \nJames Madison called ``the defect of better motives.''\n  I am sure that many Senators who supported granting fast track \nauthority to the President did so because of their support for this \nadministration's free trade policies. But in pursuit of free trade, the \nSenate has given away its power to regulate trade and international \ncommerce, and has flung itself into the abyss in which it now finds \nitself. If the Senate approves these treaties, the President, who is \nnot the repository of all human wisdom, and is as vulnerable to ``the \ndefect of better motives'' as any other mortal being, will have a free \nhand, without debate and without review, to dictate not only trade \npolicy, but immigration policy as well.\n  The Framers of our Constitution would, I am certain, be appalled at \nhow, time and time again, the modern-day Congress, under pressure from \nthe White House political machine, yields its plenary powers to the \nexecutive.\n  We did it with fast track. We did it with the creation of the \nHomeland Security Department. We did it with respect to the war in \nIraq.\n  The Senate has a duty to reject these trade agreements. Even those \nSenators who support the administration's trade policies must take a \nstand in support of something more important. The executive is, again, \noverreaching and the Senate must not, this time, acquiesce.\n  The Senate desperately needs to come to a better understanding and \nappreciation of our Constitution and the powers granted the Congress. \nIt needs a better understanding of what exactly is at stake when we \ncarelessly meddle with our system of checks and balances and the \nseparation of powers. If we disregard the lessons learned from the \ncolossal blunder of granting fast track authority to the President, we \nmight just as well strike a match and hold that invaluable document to \nthe flame.\n  We are entrusted with the safeguarding of the people's liberties. It \nis their Constitution. It is their Republic. It is their liberties that \nwe have sworn to secure. If we continue to be careless or callous or \ncomplacent, it is their cherished freedoms that will go up in smoke.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10024-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10024-S10027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   NOMINATION OF EARL LEROY YEAKEL III OF TEXAS TO BE UNITED STATES \n            DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 5:20 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session for \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 296, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Earl Leroy Yeakel III of\n\n[[Page S10025]]\n\nTexas to be United States District Judge for the Western District of \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 5 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchinson, and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn, and 5 minutes for \ndebate for the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, are we going to have back-to-back \nvotes for Judge Cardone as well as Judge Yeakel, or do we talk about \neach judge before their individual votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be back-to-back votes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on behalf of two Federal judge \nnominees for Texas. They are both for the Western District. Leroy \nYeakel will sit in Austin; Kathleen Cardone will sit in El Paso, TX.\n  The Western District has the highest caseload of any district on the \nlist of districts where judicial emergencies exist. It has been the No. \n1 district in that regard. I am very pleased that we have two nominees \nto fill two benches in Austin and El Paso because we do need to be able \nto move these cases expeditiously. People are entitled to have their \ncases disposed of one way or another.\n\n  I am proud to speak for Lee Yeakel who has been nominated for the \nAustin vacancy. He has served as a justice of the Texas Third Court of \nAppeals in Austin since 1998. Prior to that, he spent 29 years in \nprivate practice in Austin, most recently as a partner with the firm of \nClark, Thomas & Winters.\n  Lee earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Texas at \nAustin in 1966 and his law degree from the University of Texas in 1969. \nHe earned a master of law degree from the University of Virginia in \n2001.\n  He is also very active in the community. He serves on the boards of \nthe Austin Rotary Club, the West Austin Youth Association, the Austin \nChoral Union, and the Committee for Wild Basin Wilderness.\n  I am very proud to know Lee Yeakel. I have known him for years. I \nhave also known his wonderful wife Anne and their family. I am very \npleased that the President nominated Lee Yeakel after Senator Cornyn \nand I recommended him. I know he will be a hard worker, and I know he \nwill be an independent judge, one who looks at the law and decides \ncases based on the law and not based on his personal opinions. So I am \npleased to recommend him to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I also recommend Kathleen Cardone for the judgeship in \nthe Western District of Texas. She will be sitting in El Paso. Kathy is \na New York native who graduated from the State University of New York \nat Binghamton and St. Mary's School of Law in San Antonio.\n  After graduating from law school, Kathy clerked for a U.S. Magistrate \nfor the Southern District of Texas, and then went into private \npractice.\n  She has the distinction of serving as the first judge for the 388th \nJudicial District Court, a new State court created in El Paso in 1999. \nShe developed and founded the El Paso County Domestic Relations Office. \nThis office serves as an intermediary between courts and litigants in \nfamily law matters. She also presided over the 383rd Judicial District \nCourt in El Paso.\n  She has an excellent record of civic involvement. She is a member of \nthe board of directors of the Upper Rio Grande Workforce Development \nBoard and the El Paso Center for Family Violence. She is a past board \nmember of the YWCA and the El Paso Holocaust Museum and Study Center. \nShe has also been on the board of the El Paso Bar Foundation, the El \nPaso Mexican American Bar Association, and the Child Crisis Center of \nEl Paso.\n  I think you can see that both of these nominees meet the high \nstandards that we hold for Federal judges, both having been active in \ntheir communities and being well regarded by the bar.\n  I can say that both of these nominees were highly recommended by \nDemocrats and Republicans and by their bar association membership. \nPeople who have worked with them recommend them highly, and I am very \npleased with our nominations.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Justice Earl Leroy Yeakel to be a U.S. District Court Judge for the \nWestern District of Texas.\n  Justice Yeakel has been a justice on the Texas Court of Appeals since \n1998. For 29 years prior to his judicial service he was engaged in \nprivate practice, litigating both civil and criminal matters at the \ntrial and appellate levels in state and federal courts.\n  While attending the University of Texas School of Law, he worked for \nthe Austin law firm of Mitchell, Gilbert & McLean. Upon graduation in \n1969, he remained at the firm as an associate counsel, participating in \na broad range of litigation-related work. Five years later, Justice \nYeakel started his own firm, where he remained until his departure in \n1982. In the sixteen years that followed, he served as either an \nassociate or partner in three prominent Austin law firms, litigating \nboth civil and criminal matters at the trial and appellate level in \nstate and federal courts.\n  Justice Yeakel has proven himself to be a distinguished legal \nscholar, author, practitioner and judge. He enjoys bi-partisan support \nand I am confident he will make an excellent federal judge. I commend \nPresident Bush for nominating Justice Yeakel and urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I am also in support of the nomination of Kathleen \nCardone to be a U.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of \nTexas.\n  Since 1983, Judge Cardone has served as a state judge in El Paso \nCounty, TX, on numerous courts, including a municipal court, a family \nlaw court, and multiple state district courts. In addition to her \njudicial duties, she has worked as a trained mediator, as well as a \nteacher of an introductory law course at the El Paso Community College.\n  After graduating from St. Mary's School of Law in 1979, Judge Cardone \nworked for one year as a briefing attorney for Philip Schraub, a United \nStates Magistrate Judge for the Southern District of Texas. Following \nthis judicial clerkship, she entered private practice, handling an \narray of cases involving civil, criminal and family law matters.\n  Judge Cardone has proven herself to be a distinguished legal scholar, \nauthor, practitioner and judge. She enjoys bipartisan support and I am \nconfident he will make an excellent federal judge. I commend President \nBush for nominating Judge Cardone and urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator for Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm another two \njudicial nominees, bringing the total number of judicial nominees sent \nby President Bush to be confirmed to 140. With today's vote, the number \nof judicial nominees confirmed this year alone climbs to 40. That \nexceeds the number of judges during all of 2000, 1999, and 1997, and is \nmore than twice as many judges as were confirmed during the entire 1996 \nsession. It is more than the average annual confirmations for the 6\\1/\n2\\ years the Republican majority controlled the pace of confirmations \nfrom 1995 through the first half of 2001. Thus, in the first 7 months \nof this year, we have already exceeded the year totals for 4 of the 6 \nyears the Republican majority controlled the pace of President \nClinton's judicial nominees and the Republican majority's yearly \naverage.\n  Indeed with the confirmation of this 140th judge, the Senate has now \nconfirmed in 2 years, from July 20, 2001 to July 28, 2003, more judges \nfor President Bush than it was willing to consider during any 3-year \nperiod in which President Clinton's nominees were being considered by a \nSenate Republican majority.\n  A good way to see how much faster we are proceeding on judicial \nnominations for a Republican President than Republican Senators were \nwilling to proceed for a Democratic President is to compare where we \nare on this date over the last several years. Over the last 6\\1/2\\ \nyears of Republican control under President Clinton, the Republicans \nallowed only 20 judicial confirmations, on average, by July 28, and \nincluded only 4 circuit court nominees, on average, by this time. Today \nwe will\n\n[[Page S10026]]\n\nhave doubled those benchmarks with the confirmation of the 39th and \n40th judicial nominees, which have included 10 circuit court judges. \nThe double standard that Republicans have used in their treatment of \njudicial nominees is evident from this chart.\n  On this day, in 1995, only 32 judicial nominations had been \nconfirmed; in 1996, only 14; in 1997, only 9; in 1998 the confirmations \ntotaled 33; in 1999, only 9; and in 2000 the confirmation total by this \npoint of the year was 35. Today, we confirm the 40th judge so far this \nyear. Vacancies in the courts stand at less than half of what they were \nduring the Clinton years and we have more Federal judges serving than \never before.\n  We have already this year confirmed 10 judges to the Courts of \nAppeals. This is more than were confirmed in all of 4 of the past 6 \nyears when the Republicans were in the majority--in 1996, 1997, 1999, \nand 2000. And in the 2 other years, the Tenth Circuit nominee was not \nconfirmed until much later in the year.\n  Today, the Senate confirms Earl Lee Yeakel and Kathleen Cardone to \nthe U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Judge Yeakel \nhas been serving on the Texas Court of Appeals since 1998, appointed by \nthen-Governor Bush. Judge Cardone has served as a State court judge on \ndifferent courts throughout the El Paso area since 1990. Both were just \nnominated on May 1, their paperwork was not complete until June, and \nthey are being confirmed just a month later. This is another sign of \nhow fair the Democrats have been to this President's nominees.\n  The Judiciary Committee has already held hearings for 6 of President \nBush's nominees for the Western District of Texas alone and for 13 of \nPresident Bush's district court nominees from the State of Texas. Eight \nof those judges were given hearings and confirmed during the 17 months \nI served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. That was nearly one \njudge for Texas every other month, in addition to the four United \nStates Attorneys and three United States Marshals who were reviewed and \nconfirmed in that period of time.\n  As I have noted throughout the last 3 years, the Senate is able to \nmove expeditiously when we have consensus nominees. Unfortunately, far \ntoo many of this President's nominees have records that raise serious \nconcerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties on all \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  How much time do I have remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time is available to the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-five seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to the \nremarks of my democratic colleague on the state of the judicial \nnominations process.\n  We have heard a lot of statistics batted around about judicial \nconfirmations. Some of them are accurate, some of them are dubious, but \none of the more misleading ones I have heard is the claim that the \nscore on President Bush's judicial nominees is 140 to 2. This is hardly \nthe score.\n  First, there are more Federal appellate vacancies today, 18, during \nPresident Bush's third year in office, than there were at the end of \nformer President Clinton's second year in office, 15. Almost one-third \nof President Bush's Federal court nominees have not been confirmed. \nThere are 68 total vacancies on the Federal district and appellate \nbenches, 32 of which are classified as judicial emergencies. We have \nworked to do, and we will continue to fill those vacancies. No raw \nnumber of confirmations means anything, in and of itself, while there \nare not one, but two filibusters of exemplary nominees going on now, \npotentially more to come, and emergency vacancies continued to exist. \nAre we supposed to be grateful that only a few of President Bush's \nnominees are being filibustered? Is there an acceptable filibuster \npercentage that the Democratic leadership has in mind? The mere fact \nthat we have to ask these questions makes it crystal clear that we have \na broken process. Even one filibuster of a judicial nominee is one too \nmany.\n\n  As for the allegation that two nominees have been defeated, well, I \nfor one would not be as quick as some of my Democratic colleagues to \ndeclare that the nominations of Miguel Estrada and Priscilla Owen have \nbeen defeated. We will continue to fight for the confirmation of these \nnominees and continue to file for cloture on their nominations. They \nare exemplary nominees who deserve to be confirmed.\n  And as for the implication that it is somehow acceptable to \nfilibuster two judicial nominees in light of the others that have been \nconfirmed, I must ask my Democratic colleagues who are leading these \nfilibusters: Would you ever argue that it is permissible to break two \ncriminal laws just as long as all the rest are being followed? Of \ncourse not. Nobody would make that argument any more then they would \nargue that it is permissible to disregard two of the constitutional \namendments that comprise our Bill of Rights simply because there are \neight others. The confirmation of other Bush judicial nominees in no \nway excuses or justifies the shabby treatment inflicted on Miguel \nEstrada and Priscilla Owen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from Texas, Mrs. \nHutchison, in commending to the Members of the body the nominations of \nJudge Lee Yeakel and Judge Kathleen Cardone. Both of these nominees are \noutstanding examples of the highly qualified nominees that President \nBush has sent to this body for consideration and confirmation. They \ndeserve these appointments. I have every confidence they will serve \nwith distinction. I am proud of what they represent and the potential \nthey have as well.\n  In the couple seconds I have remaining, I would like to respond to \nthe ranking member's statements about how many judicial nominees this \nbody has confirmed of those who have been sent by President Bush. I \ncommend him and this entire body for confirming the number of judicial \nnominees that we have. But, frankly, two unconstitutional filibusters \nis two too many.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Earl Leroy Yeakel III, of Texas, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Western District of Texas?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Energy bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment pending on the Energy \nbill which addresses an issue I think should have been the first title \nof this Energy bill. This is an amazing bill and there is a lot of work \nthat has gone into it.\n  S. 14 is entitled, ``A Bill to Enhance the Energy Security of the \nUnited States,'' an ambitious undertaking. I think it is appropriate we \nare now spending this time debating this amendment and many aspects of \nit because we all know that energy is essential to America's future, to \nour economy, and to our environment.\n  If we do not do our best in the U.S. Congress to work with this \nGovernment and establish the right incentives for the production of \nenergy, as well as the appropriate regulation of the use of energy, \nthen the American economy and future generations will suffer.\n  The reason I offered an amendment to this bill, I was presumptuous \nenough to believe there is an element that has not been addressed. As I \nread this bill, I found there was a terrible omission. This bill does \nnot address one of the major uses of energy in America today. Most \npeople, most families, most businesses equate the use of energy with \nthe electricity they use in their home but certainly with \ntransportation. How did you get to work this morning? How are you going \nto pick up the kids? What are you going to use over the weekend to go \nshopping? How are you planning vacation? Almost without exception, each \nof those decisions involves the application of energy.\n  One would think an Energy bill that looks to America's future would \nnot overlook this important element: Transportation and the use of \nenergy for transportation.\n  Let me show a chart that indicates the amount of energy used for \ntransportation as opposed to other sectors in America. This chart \naddresses U.S. oil demand by sector. The blue portion of the chart, \nwhich is the largest portion, shows over 40 percent of oil usage by the \nyear 2000. Forty percent was for transportation, another small portion \nof about 15 percent was for industrial, another portion for \nresidential-commercial, and a much smaller amount for electric \ngeneration.\n  If concern is about the use of energy and the use of barrels of oil, \nnaturally one would focus on this chart and say this bill clearly must \naddress this. S. 14 must address how we are going to reduce our demand \nfor oil for transportation.\n\n  The honest answer is, the bill does not. How can you have a thorough \nanalysis and a good legislative program addressing energy and ignore \nthe fact that out of the 20 million barrels of oil we use each day, \nmany of them from overseas, over 40 percent of them are related to the \ntransportation sector? This bill virtually ignores it.\n  It is not that the words aren't in here but that the words have no \nteeth. The words are simply statements, little notes that we send out \ninto space, saying: Wouldn't the world be better if we had more fuel \nefficiency? Wouldn't it be better if we had more conservation?\n  If you believe in the tooth fairy and Santa Claus, you will believe \nthat these little notes tossed out into space are all we need to do \nhere--just to give a speech on the floor, put an idea in a bill and \nhope that America finds it and, if they do, that they become inspired \nand show leadership and show the initiative.\n  I don't think that is the way it works. It has not worked that way in \nthe time I have served on Capitol Hill, nor in our history.\n  Let's take a look from the beginning here at what we are dealing \nwith. The vast majority of oil reserves, of course, are in the Middle \nEast. This is an indication that 677 billion barrels of oil can be \nfound in the Middle East as compared to 77 billion in North America. As \na consequence, it is very clear that if we are going to have an oil-\ndriven economy, we are going to find ourselves spending more and more \ntime focusing on the Middle East.\n  People say, turn to Russia, turn to the former Soviet Union. Of \ncourse, that is not a bad idea. But the estimated reserves of oil in \nthe Soviet Union are 65 billion barrels. It is the Middle East which \nhas all the action, 677 billion barrels of oil.\n  Yet, in 1999, the United States and Canada consumed 3 gallons of oil \nper capita per day whereas other industrialized nations consumed 1.3 \ngallons per day and the world average was a half gallon a day. So when \nit comes to the consumption of oil, the United States, of course, leads \nthe world, with Canada, dramatically.\n  If you take a look at how that oil is then used, as I mentioned \nearlier, from this chart you will find that cars, SUVs, pickup trucks, \nand minivans account for 40 percent or more of U.S. oil consumption; \nthe transportation sector overall, about 60 percent.\n  When you talk about energy and America's security, how can you ignore \nthis? How can you put together a bill as lengthy as this bill--let's \nsee how many pages we have here. It is hard work by a lot of staff \npeople and Senators. There are 467 pages. How can you have a 467-page \nbill addressing America's energy security and fundamentally ignore \nneeds for fuel efficiency and fuel economy and conservation to reduce \nthe consumption of oil in the United States?\n  I asked that question last night at a press conference in Chicago, \nwhich I am honored to represent. I said: If we are talking about \ndealing with energy, how can we miss this? How can we ignore the \nefficiency of vehicles?\n  This morning, I attended a funeral for former State Representative \nJohn Houlihan, of Palos Heights, IL. Before that, I dropped in for a \ncup of coffee at a local Dominick's supermarket, and a woman I didn't \nknow came up to me and said: I listened to you yesterday. You are \nabsolutely right. We have to do something about the gas guzzlers and \nfuel economy in the United States of America. Otherwise, we are going \nto need foreign oil forever.\n\n  She understands. She is a case in point. I don't know exactly what is \nher background. She appeared to be a suburban mom. Suburban moms have \nreally been used a lot in this debate. Those who say we should do \nnothing, let the fuel economy continue to deteriorate in the United \nStates, use women like\n\n[[Page S10028]]\n\nher who are mothers with children going back and forth to school events \nand soccer events and basketball and baseball and all the things that \nconsume your time, and they say: You can't take away that mother's SUV; \nit makes her feel safe.\n  The fact is there is some safety attached to SUVs. But, sadly, there \nare just as many studies that suggest they are dangerous because of \nrollover and because of the impact they have on other vehicles. They \nturn out to be a danger on the highway. So safety is one of the \nelements that is contested about these SUVs. But what is not contested \nis they are terrible gas hogs. They guzzle gas and give you very \nlimited miles per gallon.\n  In talking to families around my State and other places, they said to \nus: We would like to have cars and trucks and light vehicles we can use \nthat are going to be of service to our family, and safe, but we also \nwant to see better fuel efficiency.\n  My amendment that I introduced would save a cumulative 123 billion \ngallons of gasoline over the next 12 years. If we allowed drilling in \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we would extract less than one-\ntenth of that in that same period of time.\n  The new rule handed down by NHTSA would save about 20 billion gallons \nof gasoline, or one-sixth of what my bill would save by 2015.\n  A lot of people were talking about fuel cell vehicles, hydrogen-\npowered cars, and the like. It is a wonderful concept. We should \ncertainly explore it. But the President's goal for these fuel cell \nvehicles would achieve a savings of less than 10 billion gallons of \ngasoline by 2015. That is less than a tenth of what my amendment would \nachieve.\n  The annual survey by J.D. Power and Associates found fuel consumption \nwas the second most common driver complaint industry-wide. Studies show \nthat consumers could save as much as $2,000 over the lifetime of the \ncar from higher fuel efficiency, even accounting for the cost of the \nnew vehicle technology. My amendment would save $4 billion in fuel \ncosts for consumers by 2015.\n  This is an indication of the fuel savings. Here are some of the \noptions that have been brought to us in the Senate in the course of \nthis legislation. There are those who argue if we went to 10 percent \nfuel cell vehicles, this could really help us have more efficient cars \non the road. Look at the limited savings in billions of gallons from \nthat.\n  Of course, there are those who argue if we could just drill for oil \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, go into an area that was set \naside and supposed to be protected, take away the rules, open it for \nexploration, oil exploration, that would solve America's energy needs. \nLook at the limited amount of value that has in terms of the production \nthat would come out of that area.\n  Then, of course, NHTSA, the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, has some new rules that would also amount to some \nsavings. But all of these are down here below 50 billion gallons of \ngasoline that would be saved.\n\n  Now take a look if we would go for the standard that I am asking for \nin this amendment. That standard would move us, by the year 2015, to \ncars and light trucks at 40 miles a gallon and to other vehicles at \n27.5 miles a gallon. The difference in savings is just dramatic. That \nis why my amendment has been supported, not only by groups who are \nlooking for energy conservation but also groups who are very concerned \nabout the environment.\n  The United States produces a third of the greenhouse gases emitted \nfrom automobiles worldwide. A third of the world's production of \ngreenhouse gases comes right out of the U.S.A.\n  These gases affect every aspect of our lives: Agriculture, public \nhealth, the economy, our sea levels, and our shorelines.\n  Do you know the No. 1 diagnosis of kids going into emergency rooms \nand hospitals across America today? It is asthma--asthma. Go to any \nclassroom, you pick it, and ask the kids, as I do every time I step in \nthe door--you pick the grade--how many of you have someone in your \nfamily with asthma? I guarantee you at least a fourth, maybe half of \nthat class will raise their hands.\n  Why is this? There are a lot of reasons; it is not just one. But one \nof them has to do with air pollution, and air pollution has to do with \nthe ignition and burning of fuel sources such as oil.\n  So if you have inefficient vehicles that burn more gasoline per 100 \nmiles, and that is going to create more emissions, it is going to \ncreate more public health problems. That is very linear and very \ndirect.\n  The greatest environmental impact is felt at the poles. And I am not \ntalking about the election day polls; I am talking about the North Pole \nand the South Pole.\n  Scientists predict that polar bears could be extinct within 100 years \nif we don't address global warming. In fact, scientists say it could be \n50 years. If they are right that this species of animal faces \nextinction within 50 years, this is what you can tell your children and \ngrandchildren. Take a good look at a polar bear at the zoo because it \nmay be the last one you will see on Earth.\n  Is this scare tactics? Is this the sort of thing we say? Why does the \nSenator raise that during the course of the debate?\n  What I am trying to suggest to you is that this isn't just about a \npiece of legislation. It isn't about an energy security bill. It is \nabout rational thinking.\n  Rational thinking would suggest to us in the course of this debate \nthat if America is going to be more energy secure, we should depend \nless on foreign oil. The biggest consumer of oil in America is \ntransportation. If we are going to reduce the consumption and use \nconservation, we have to do something about the fuel efficiency of the \ncars and trucks that we drive. If we fail to do something about that \nfuel efficiency, we will need more foreign oil. We will consume more \noil, and in burning it, we will create more emissions in the air \npolluting the environment.\n  I don't think there is a single thing that I just described that is a \nbig leap of faith. I think this is linear reasoning from point A to \nanother point B. But this bill we are considering doesn't even take \nthis into consideration but for a very symbolic gesture exhorting \nfuture generations to really get serious about this.\n  Forgive me. Future generations will have their responsibilities but \nwe have a responsibility today. We have a responsibility to make this a \nmore secure nation from the energy viewpoint. We have a responsibility \nto require reasonable standards for the creation of better technology \nand for more fuel-efficient vehicles. Unfortunately, this bill doesn't \ndo that.\n  The amendment I am offering would cut a cumulative 250 metric tons of \ngreenhouse gas emissions by the year 2015. Otherwise, right out of the \ntailpipe of our cars and trucks will come these emissions leading to \nmore greenhouse gases and leading to public health problems which we \nknow exist.\n  Earlier today, one of my colleagues from Oklahoma came to the floor--\nand it is his right to make this argument--and argued that this isn't a \nproblem. He argued that climate change never exists, and, if it does, \nit is really not that harmful. I don't know how you can reach that \nconclusion.\n  Basically, we have been talking to scientists who are studying this \nissue with objective attitudes. They tell us things that are true--the \nextinction of species, the loss of polar bears, and receding ice caps. \nAs a result of the receding ice caps, polar bears are having fewer \nyoung. As a result, we can just plot it out. Over a period of time they \nwill become extinct. We also know that glaciers are disappearing. In a \nmatter of 25 or 50 years, all glaciers on Earth are threatened and \ncould be gone. Why? Because the Earth is heating up ever so slowly but \nin a way that is tipping the balance of Mother Nature against us. Why? \nBecause we can't accept our responsibility on the floor of the Senate \nto say to the automobile and truck manufacturers around the world that \nif you want to sell in the biggest market in America, you have to do \nbetter.\n  I listened to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and they \nbasically say you can't come up with these technologies.\n\n  Durbin, you are dreaming. There is just no way you could reach 40 \nmiles a gallon in our cars. Today we are barely getting a fleet average \nof 23 or 24 miles a gallon. There is no way that in 12 years you could \nreach 40 miles a gallon.\n  Let me tell you what we do know. In 2002, the National Academy of \nSciences found that existing technology could improve the fuel \nefficiency of light\n\n[[Page S10029]]\n\ntrucks by 50 or 65 percent and the fuel efficiency of cars by 40 to 60 \npercent.\n  I am not an engineer. I used to think I could fix them. I gave up.\n  This chart shows some of the technologies that could be used that \ncould literally lead to dramatic fuel savings. We are not talking about \nmopeds and people going around the United States on tiny little \nscooters. We believe that with some changes available today in \ntechnology we could have much more fuel-efficient vehicles with four-\nvalve cylinders and variable valve timing.\n  Isn't it sad that when it came to these hybrid cars using gasoline \nand electricity, the first ones on the market were from Japan? I beg \nyour pardon. As good as this Nation is, as smart as our people are, as \nmany engineers as we have, why are we always running a distant second \nin developing technology?\n  There is promise that in a few years we will start seeing vehicles in \nAmerica that have these type of engines. Thank goodness the Japanese \ndid show the initiative. But we can do better.\n  What I hear from the other side is that it is impossible. The Durbin \namendment is impossible. America is not smart enough to develop a fuel-\nefficient car, and don't put us to the test because if you do, we will \nlose; we will always lose to the foreign manufacturers.\n  When I hear this, it makes me angry. I do not see it that way. I look \nat how many foreign students want to come to the United States and \nlearn. I know we have institutions of higher learning--some of the best \nin the world. Why is it that graduates of those institutions aren't \ngoing to work for the Big Three and other auto manufacturers to come up \nwith the technologies to solve this problem?\n  I will tell you this. If my amendment is defeated, they won't have \nto. There will be no push to make these changes.\n  Let me show you one of the things that has happened. I think it is a \npositive thing. Let me give credit where it is due, having said the Big \nThree is a little slow to respond. Thanks to technology, many vehicles \nalready exceed current standards.\n  Here is the Ford Focus station wagon--city, 27 miles per gallon; \nhighway, 36 miles per gallon.\n  When I drive in Washington, DC, I drive a 1993 Saturn, a little car \nwe bought used. It sure does run well. Two weeks ago, I took my wife \ndown to North Carolina. It is about 350 miles in each direction. I put \non the air-conditioner. It still works. I got 35 miles a gallon. It is \npossible. We don't feel like we are compromising for comfort. We drove \nthat 10-year-old car and got 35 miles a gallon.\n  The Ford Focus has a station wagon. It is a little larger than what I \ndrive: highway, 36 miles a gallon.\n  It can be done.\n  Hybrid technologies are already utilized in vehicles available today \nand point to the future. I talked about those earlier. Unfortunately, \ntoo many of those are made in Japan. The ones on the road today are the \nToyota Prius, the Honda Insight, and the Honda Civic, cars that have 50 \npercent or greater improvement in fuel economy.\n\n  I want to give credit where it is due. A Republican colleague, \nSenator Bob Bennett, drives a Toyota Prius. I have seen him in that \ncar. If you have seen Bob Bennett of Utah who is about 6 foot 4 or 6 \nfoot 5, you ought to see him fold himself into that car and out again. \nBut he does it. He said it is a great car. It is really fuel efficient. \nIt even squeezes a little bit of his stature. Giving credit where it is \ndue, he has one of those cars.\n  I believe Senator Boxer of California also has one as well.\n  Again, Ford, GM, Saturn, Chrysler, and others are talking about more \ncars like this.\n  It isn't as if what we are discussing is the impossible. It is \nattainable. Certainly over a 12-year period of time it could easily be \nattainable.\n  My amendment recognizes these technologies are real and can be put to \nuse and can be expanded in American innovation.\n  I am not going to stand here and quietly let my colleagues wave the \nwhite flag of surrender saying that we could never develop the \ntechnology in America to be more fuel efficient. I don't buy it. I \ndon't think this Senate should buy it either.\n  In 1975, those same voices of doom and despair came to the floor of \nthe Senate and the House and said 14 miles a gallon is as good as it \ngets, and if Congress imposes a requirement to raise those to somewhere \nnear 28 miles a gallon, it will never happen; that America can't come \nup with the technology; that the Japanese will beat us to the punch; \nthat the cars won't be safe; that we will lose American jobs. The \nlitany went on and on. Thank goodness, Congress ignored it. Congress \nhad the courage to vote against it. Congress imposed standards to \nincrease fuel efficiency, and they worked.\n  We increased over a 10-year period of time almost double the fuel \nefficiency of the fleet across America. And we can do it again.\n\n  My amendment would require cars, SUVs, minivans, and crossover \nutility vehicles to achieve a corporate average fuel economy of 40 \nmiles per gallon by 2015 and would require pickup trucks and vans to \nachieve a CAFE standard of 27.5 miles per gallon by the same year.\n  In addition, this amendment starts to close some loopholes. It would \nfix the definition of passenger vehicles, so those large SUVs, such as \nHummers, are no longer exempt from the CAFE law. Did you know that? \nHummers are exempt from the CAFE law. They can get 2 miles a gallon and \nthere is absolutely no requirement of the law they do better. And I \nthink they are getting around 2 miles a gallon. It would also fix the \ndefinition of passenger vehicles so that SUVs, minivans, and CUVs are \nconsidered cars, not trucks.\n  I also offered a companion amendment we will debate when we get to \nthe tax section of the bill which relates to tax incentives. My \ncompanion amendment would stimulate the market for more fuel-efficient \nvehicles by establishing a tax credit for the purchasers of vehicles \nthat exceed the applicable CAFE standard by at least 5 miles per \ngallon.\n  This companion amendment also would modify the gas-guzzler tax levied \non manufacturers by applying it to vehicles that are more than 5 miles \nper gallon below the applicable CAFE standard, including SUVs. So if \nyou put a car on the road that is better than the standard, you get the \ntax benefit. If you don't, you pay a tax cost.\n  Now, I understand there is a controversy associated with this \namendment. I have listened to some of the arguments made by critics of \nthis amendment during the course of the day. They are certainly \nentitled to their point of view. I would like to address a few of the \narguments.\n  Several of my colleagues came to the floor and said the Durbin \namendment will cost consumers. The technology he wants to put in these \ncars will cost $1,200 or more per car on average. While this is true--I \nwill concede the point--the Union of Concerned Scientists finds that \nconsumers will realize a net savings of $2,000 over the lifetime of the \ncar due to lower gasoline consumption.\n  So what do we get out of the deal? The consumers are ahead. It will \ncost $1,200 more for the vehicle, but there is $2,000 in savings. So \nthere is a net gain of $800 per vehicle, on average, according to the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists. There will be lesser dependence on \nforeign oil and fewer emissions coming out of the tailpipes as fewer \ngallons of gas will be consumed. So there are pluses they ignore.\n  They also argue the Durbin amendment will cause Americans to lose \ntheir jobs. The Union of Concerned Scientists finds that increasing \nfuel economy to 40 miles per gallon will actually create 180,000 new \njobs. You may say, How can this amendment do that? Won't we just give \nup automobiles to the Japanese and others to produce them?\n  I certainly do not think so, nor do I believe that should be our \nstandard of action around here.\n  We are going to consider a trade bill the first thing tomorrow, and \none of the premises of this trade bill is that America can compete. If \nyou don't believe America can compete, you certainly don't want to \nallow other countries to export to the United States.\n  Well, I believe we can compete, and we have proven it. So why do \ncritics of this amendment want to throw in the towel right off the bat \nand say we are just going to lose all the way around? What they are \nignoring is that the creation of new technologies will result in\n\n[[Page S10030]]\n\nnew jobs. These new technologies and new parts are going to have men \nand women working in good-paying jobs to create them. And the fuel \nefficiency that is involved is a savings to business. One of the costs \nof business, obviously, is fuel, as we have found when gasoline prices \nhave spiked. If you bring down the cost of fuel by reducing consumption \nwith more fuel-efficient vehicles, businesses can be more productive, \nand with that productivity have more competitive advantage and really \nemploy more people.\n\n  The naysayers and people who want to hang the crepe in this debate \njust think it is all a loss--a very negative attitude.\n  Others argue this amendment is not necessary. There was an amendment \nearlier by Senator Landrieu of Louisiana. I voted for it. But that \namendment, as I mentioned earlier--as good as it is, as well \nintentioned as it is--includes no new authorities to help reach the oil \nsavings goal and no enforcement mechanisms to ensure the requirement \nwill be fulfilled.\n  There is also an argument that the alternative amendment by my good \nfriend Carl Levin of Michigan and Christopher Bond of Missouri is based \non sound science. Well, let me tell you, the National Academy of \nSciences found that existing and emerging technologies are there to \nimprove fuel efficiency. As I mentioned earlier, this report was \nwritten even before the hybrid technologies came to the market. So we \nknow we can reach these goals if we just apply ourselves and set the \nstandards.\n  The alternative amendment, which they are arguing for, does not \nrequire any increase in fuel efficiency. It delays it. It passes the \nbuck to NHTSA and adds new roadblocks to the NHTSA's decisionmaking \nprocess. NHTSA has failed to make any meaningful increase in fuel \neconomy for over 10 years. Its latest increase of 1.5 miles per gallon \nfor light trucks is just a drop in the bucket, considering the \nstandards were last changed for light trucks in 1985. And cars remain \nunchanged since then as well.\n  Another argument is that we are addressing fuel efficiency through \nthe President's hydrogen fuel cell car. As I mentioned, this is several \nyears to come and will not be as dramatic as those who argue against my \namendment would have us believe.\n  So I say to my colleagues, when this amendment comes up for a vote \ntomorrow, there is a very real choice: either we are serious about \nenergy or we are not; either we are prepared to say the three big \nautomobile manufacturers in Detroit are going to continue to lose in \ncompetition or we are going to reach a different conclusion.\n  I think the men and women working for these companies are ready to \nrise to the challenge. I have seen them do it. I think the leaders of \nthese companies need to be nudged because, frankly, they have a market \ntoday, a market where very few cars and vehicles are that profitable, \nbut SUVs and light trucks are profitable. They don't want to rock the \nboat. They want to continue to build and put on the highways these \nmonster cars of dubious safety that are continuing, frankly, to consume \noil at rates that are not good for this country and certainly not good \nfor our environment.\n  There are two ways to get more fuel-efficient vehicles--guess three. \nOne of the ways is to rely on the hope, as some of the authors do in \nthis bill, that someday Detroit will wake up to this need. And when \nthey wake up to it, they will lead the American consumers into wanting \nmore fuel-efficient vehicles. I don't think so. We have 18 years of \nexperience to argue against that. We have seen CAFE standards and fuel \neconomy declining over the last 18 years. Detroit showed little \nleadership. Cars that are innovative in this area, unfortunately, are \nnot built in the United States.\n\n  There is a second way to do it. If you raised the price of gasoline \ntomorrow--doubled it tomorrow--I can guarantee you most families and \nbusinesses, by the end of the week, would be asking a question they \nhave not asked in a long time: How many miles a gallon do we get in \nthis car, anyway? If you started asking that question, and realized you \nhave a gas guzzler, you might make a consumer choice next time. But \nraising gasoline taxes or gasoline prices comes at an additional cost \nto the economy.\n  For individuals, workers, and families, it means an added cost of \ngetting up and going to work. I don't want to impose that cost, \nparticularly in the midst of this recession, with so many jobs we have \nlost. And for small businesses, it is an additional cost of doing \nbusiness to have new fuel costs. It will force them, perhaps, to lay \noff people. I don't want to see that happen.\n  But there is a third option, and that is this amendment. It has been \nproven. We did it in 1975. We established CAFE. That was not even a \nword in the law until 1975. We said we can do better. And we did \nbetter. That is what this amendment does.\n  I am honored this amendment has been supported by many groups, \nincluding the League of Conservation Voters, which has made it one of \ntheir key votes for this session of Congress. They understand, as well \nas the Sierra Club, Citizen Action, and a number of other groups across \nthe United States that any meaningful and serious discussion of energy \nsecurity for America must include the issue of fuel economy and fuel \nefficiency.\n  If we pass this bill without real language and real law that has \nteeth in it to improve fuel efficiency and fuel economy, we will have \ndone a great disservice not just to the people we currently represent \nbut to future generations and to the environment, which will be damaged \nbecause of our neglectful attitude.\n  I hope my colleagues will, at this point, look beyond the big, \nspecial interest groups that have come in and said: Please, stop the \nDurbin amendment; don't let him improve the fuel efficiency of \nvehicles. I hope they will listen, instead, to their own consciences \nand their own minds and hearts about what is at stake. We can make the \nright move for future generations. The adoption of this amendment will \nachieve it.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that my amendment to the \nEnergy bill to create a demonstration program on production of hydrogen \nfrom renewable resources was adopted at the end of last week. The \nhydrogen title in the Energy bill contains a number of important \nprovisions, many of which closely overlap with the Hydrogen and Fuel \nCell Energy Act of 2003, which I introduced in April. Perhaps most \nimportant, it authorizes several significant demonstration programs for \nvarious applications of fuel cells. These programs are the critical \nnext step in bringing hydrogen and fuel cells from the laboratory bench \ninto widespread commercialization. They provide a realistic test of how \nthe laboratory technologies work in the real world, and they provide \nfunding for pre-commercial prototypes of the technologies, including \nstarting to build a hydrogen fueling infrastructure.\n  However, there were no demonstration projects in the title on how we \nwill obtain the hydrogen to run the fuel cells. The bill reauthorizes \nthe Matsunaga Act to continue and improve research on a variety of \nhydrogen technologies, which we have been trying to enact for more than \n2 years now. Elsewhere, the bill contains a massive and dubious subsidy \nfor a nuclear plant in part to produce hydrogen, as well as support for \nproduction of hydrogen from coal, but there is nothing to demonstrate \nproduction of hydrogen from renewable resources.\n  Currently, most hydrogen is made by reforming natural gas. This is a \nrelatively clean and efficient way to use natural gas. But there are \nstill emissions of greenhouse gases and some pollutants. Equally \nimportant, use of natural gas for hydrogen continues our dependence on \nnatural gas supplies. As the recent price runup on natural gas has \nshown us again, supplies of natural gas may not always meet demand, and \nprices can be volatile. I support use of natural gas to make hydrogen \nin the near future, but in the long run, hydrogen and fuel cells must \nhelp us reach an economy based on clean, domestic, renewable sources of \nenergy.\n  This amendment will help us get there. It authorizes $110 million \nover 5 years to conduct demonstration programs on production of \nhydrogen from renewable resources. The resources might include biomass, \nsuch as switchgrass and ethanol, wind energy, solar power, and other \nsources. The program would help prepare a variety of emerging \ntechnologies for renewable\n\n[[Page S10031]]\n\nhydrogen production for widespread use. These demonstration programs \nwould be conducted using competitive merit review of funding proposals \nfrom a wide variety of companies and organizations, and they would \nrequire cost sharing from awardees.\n  Technologies that combine production of hydrogen with other \nactivities show particular promise for clean, efficient production of \nhydrogen at this time. Two approaches are specifically included in the \nscope of the program. Biorefineries can make hydrogen, along with other \nproducts, from biomass. And in ``electrofarming'' the hydrogen is \nproduced and used on the same farm or in nearby facilities. The \nhydrogen might be made by growing and reforming biomass, from wind \nenergy, or from farm waste; it could be used in farm vehicles and \nequipment and for heat and electricity in farm buildings. By placing \nproduction and use together, this approach saves on transportation of \nthe fuel or the hydrogen. It also avoids any large-scale energy \nfacilities that might present security risks.\n  I am pleased this program will be in the portfolio of measures in the \nhydrogen title of the Energy bill that will help develop and \ncommercialize hydrogen and fuel cell technologies, and turn into \nreality a vision of cars that don't pollute, of power that won't go \nout, and of feeling less dependent on an area of the world where we \nrecently fought the second war in recent years.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my colleague, \nSenator Baucus, I will offer an amendment to the pending Energy bill \nthat will make it economically feasible to make improvements to and \noperate the Flint Creek Hydroelectric Project at Georgetown Lake in \nGranite County, MT. Specifically, this amendment limits the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission's, FERC, annual land use fee at the \nproject to $25,000 for so long as Granite County, or the neighboring \ncounty, Deer Lodge County, holds the license to the project. This \namendment is very similar to legislation which Senator Baucus and I \nintroduced in the 104th Congress and which was reported unanimously \nfrom the Senate Energy Committee.\n  The Flint Creek Project does not currently generate electricity, nor \nwill it without a limitation placed on the FERC annual land use fee. \nUnder the status quo, FERC's annual fee for the project would be more \nthan $83,000, an amount that simply makes the project uneconomic. The \nGAO recently released a report that concluded that the FERC generally \nsets land use fees too low for non-Federal hydroelectric projects \nlocated on Federal lands. In the case of the Flint Creek Project, the \nopposite is true.\n  The Flint Creek Project is more than 100 years old. It was operated \nby the Montana Power Company for many years. Since 1992, when it was \ntransferred to Granite County, it has remained idle. In order to become \noperational again, it will require more than $2.3 million in \ninvestment. This includes building a new powerhouse that replicates the \narchitectural style of the historic structure, installing new intake \nfacilities, replacing the old woodstave line with a new low-pressure \npipeline, new generation turbines, swiftgear equipment, stream flow \ncontrol, data logging systems and a new substation and metering \nequipment to connect the project to the Northwest energy transmission \ngrid.\n  All of this investment is necessary to get the Flint Creek Project up \nand running in an operationally efficient and environmentally \nresponsible and safe manner. When these investments are made, the \nproject will have an installed generation capacity of 2 megawatts. That \ntranslates into anticipated annual power sale revenues of between \n$300,000 and $350,000. Under the current FERC fee regime, however, the \nannual fee of $83,000 would amount to nearly 25 percent of the gross \nrevenues of the project. With this kind of bureaucratic overhead, no \none with an ounce of business sense would make the $2.3 million \ninvestment required to restart the project. My amendment reduces this \nannual fee to a level that fairly compensates the Federal Government \nfor the use of its property, while at the same time encouraging \ninvestment in this project by assuming a modest rate of return.\n  As we sit here debating new mandates to diversify this Nation's \nenergy portfolio and increase the amount of renewable electricity \navailable for the marketplace, it strikes me that this is one small, \nsite-specific yet beneficial way in which we can appropriately \nencourage new investment in clean, renewable electricity.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10031-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10031-S10032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to touch on a couple of matters \nprior to the time we adjourn for the day. I have come to the floor now \non several occasions to talk about the concern I have with regard to \nthe schedule for the consideration of energy. We have a mere 3 or 4 \ndays left before the August recess is supposed to begin.\n  As we debated the Energy bill last year, I can recall so vividly how \nfrustrated many of us were with the length of time it took to work \nthrough the many very controversial issues.\n  Energy is controversial. At the end of the day, we, in spite of our \nfrustration, passed a bill that ultimately acquired 88 votes. The vote \nwas 88 to 11. Because we were persistent and because we stayed on the \nlegislation, we were able to complete our work and ultimately get a \nstrong bipartisan vote--88 votes.\n  That vote came after 24 days of debate, over the course of 8 weeks. \nWe considered 144 amendments. At the end of that period of time, people \nfelt as if they had their say. They had been able to offer their \namendments. They expressed themselves and ultimately voted for the bill \nby an overwhelming margin.\n  Unfortunately, so far, we have not been able to allow the Senate to \nwork its will in that way with the pending energy legislation. We have \nbeen on it 12 days. We have only had 12 rollcall votes. So we have \naveraged one rollcall vote per day. We have considered 35 amendments, \nbut, as I say, only 12 of those actually required rollcall votes.\n  So we find ourselves now, at the end of the first day of the final \nweek before the August recess, where we only saw the new electricity \ntitle on Friday--Friday night. I must say, that amendment alone--the \nelectricity title--with all of its extraordinary geographical \nrepercussions, poses very serious challenges to the Senate as we try to \nresolve the differences. So we have an electricity title that, I \nassume, could be laid down tomorrow. There will be amendments offered \nto the new electricity title because we know that, on a bipartisan \nbasis, there is still a great deal of concern about it.\n  We have not dealt with global warming. That, too, is going to \ngenerate controversy and amendments. There are also the issues of the \nRenewable Portfolio Standard, CAFE standards, hydroelectric dam \nrelicensing, Indian energy, nuclear subsidies, and natural gas. In my \npart of the country, in South Dakota, natural gas alone warrants all \nthe attention of the Senate to absolutely assure that we somehow can \nacquire available supply and stabilize price. There are also energy \nefficiency incentives, wind energy, carbon sequestration, exploration \nin the Outer Continental Shelf and, of course, the energy tax package.\n  All of those issues have yet to be resolved. That was why on the last \nday prior to the July 4 recess I came to the floor to say if we are \ngoing to finish this bill, we better return to the legislation almost \nas soon as we come back because it will take that amount of time to \naccommodate the legitimate debates that must be a part of consideration \nof this comprehensive bill. Well, that has not happened.\n  Now we find ourselves in the last week before the August recess with, \nI am told, over 380 amendments pending. Somehow there is an expectation \nthat we can finish. I can hear, perhaps, the charge at the end of the \nweek that, well, the Democrats just didn't want to finish the bill. \nOpponents just didn't want to deal with it. So they were dragging it \nout.\n\n[[Page S10032]]\n\n  I must again insist that there is no desire to drag this out. There \nare many very deeply held feelings about many of these issues because \nthey affect the pocketbook and ultimately the very security of a vast \nnumber of people in this country whose reliance upon energy is perhaps \nas consequential as their reliance on food or anything else. It is a \ncommodity that we must have. So, clearly, we want to resolve these \nissues. But we are not going to be jammed. We are certainly not going \nto treat lightly or minimize the consequences and the extraordinary \nimportance of these issues as we continue this debate.\n\n  I told the distinguished majority leader a few hours ago that I was \nin favor of grinding this out, trying to find as many ways to take up \nthese issues and deal with them as we can. But nobody should be \nsurprised if, at the end of the week, given the complexity and \nimportance of these issues, that we have not completed our work. One of \nthe reasons we have not completed our work, so far, is because we have \nhad some other issues that have been the focus of attention in the \nSenate. One of those was the supplemental that passed. I want to \ncomment on that briefly as well.\n  On July 8, President Bush proposed a supplemental for $1.9 billion \nthat consisted of three very critical parts: $1.55 billion for FEMA \ndisaster assistance; $289 million for Forest Service and Bureau of Land \nManagement to cover the costs of fighting wildfires all over this \ncountry; and $50 million for NASA's investigation of the Challenger \ndisaster. The Appropriations Committee supported the President's \nrequest, but they added one more thing. On a bipartisan basis, and with \nthe approval and support of the White House, they added an additional \n$100 million to head off a looming funding crisis that would force \nAmeriCorps to cut from its rolls 15,000 volunteers. The committee's \ndecision to add AmeriCorps' funding to the package was affirmed on the \nfloor by a vote of 77 to 21 to defeat an amendment to strip out \nAmeriCorps' funding, and then by a vote of 85 to 7 to support final \npassage of the underlying legislation.\n  So we went into conference with our colleagues in the House with \nevery expectation--given the President's support, given the \noverwhelming bipartisan vote on AmeriCorps and these other key issues, \nbut most importantly, given the urgency that is evident to anybody who \nknows the circumstances--that before the House adjourned, we would have \nvoted on all four of those components. Instead, for reasons I can only \nbegin to imagine, the House Republican leadership cut nearly $600 \nmillion from the President's request for FEMA disaster assistance. The \nresult is that with that cut, we are told today that disaster \nassistance funds could run out before we come back in September. You \nare going to have States all over this country needing disaster aid, \nand it will not be available because those funds were eliminated.\n  They also eliminated all the money that we need to fight wildfires. \nWe have a fire that has now consumed over 2,500 acres just on the \nWyoming side of the South Dakota border. To my knowledge, it still \nburns out of control. As a result of the funding cut, we may not have \nadequate funding to fight the fires that we know will occur in August, \nand perhaps in September, as a result of the elimination of this $289 \nmillion. The money will not be there.\n  And then, of course, the money for AmeriCorps was eliminated as well. \nHundreds of worthy programs, serving tens of thousands of Americans, \nare going to be terminated because the AmeriCorps volunteers will be \nwithout funding.\n  Mr. President, the state of affairs, and the reasons for the actions \ntaken in the House, are simply unacceptable. We have to find a way this \nweek to resolve these outstanding questions.\n  I do not know what could be more important than ensuring that as \nthese fires burn out of control, we are going to get the necessary \nresources to the Federal agencies so they can get needed resources to \nthe sites of the disaster. That is true of FEMA. It is true of \nAmeriCorps. And, I must say, I am troubled with the message it sends \nabout Challenger. It ought to be true of our commitment to find \nultimately a successful conclusion to the NASA investigation of \nChallenger as well.\n  Mr. President, I did not hear his remarks on the Senate floor, but \nthe distinguished Chair of the Appropriations Committee expressed \nhimself very clearly this afternoon, and it is my desire to work with \nhim and others to see that we find a way to resolve this issue \nsuccessfully. We cannot leave this week with the extraordinary message \nwe would be sending to the entire country about FEMA, about forest \nfires, about the Challenger disaster, and about AmeriCorps.\n  We have to find a bipartisan solution, just as we did earlier this \nmonth, to address those matters prior to the time we leave. The \nmajority leader has noted that he feels so strongly about the Energy \nbill that we should not leave before we finish the Energy bill. I will \nsay, we should not leave before we have resolved this crisis in funding \nfor these four agencies. I hope on a bipartisan basis we can say that, \nwe could reassert ourselves, or we could assure that somehow this \nmatter can be resolved.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about \nlegislation that just cleared the House. It is something I think is \nhealthy and good. It is the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003. I \nworked with Senator Kennedy to hammer out legislation that I think is \nimportant. We have different political philosophies, but we have come \ntogether on this issue. Also, in the House, Congressmen Frank Wolf and \nBobby Scott worked together to move the legislation through their body. \nAs a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and as an attorney general for \nAlabama, I sent many guilty criminals to prison where they belong. I \nbelieve they should be treated fairly in court, and I treated them \nfairly. I also believe they should be treated fairly in prison.\n  Most prison wardens and sheriffs are outstanding public servants. \nThey do a fine job of supervising inmates, and I respect them and \ncommend them for the work they do. However, knowingly subjecting a \nprisoner to a circumstance where they could be sexually assaulted, and \nraped, is cruel and unusual punishment, clearly, under the eighth \namendment to the Constitution.\n  Some States have estimated as many as 10 percent or more convicted \noffenders have been subject to sexual assault in prison. One study said \n13 percent and another study said 14 percent. I hope these statistics \nare an exaggeration and frankly, I think they may be an exaggeration. \nNonetheless, it is the duty of government officials to ensure that \ncriminals who are convicted and sentenced to prison, serve the sentence \nimposed by the judge, but not additional sentence of sexual assault. \nRape is not a part of any lawful sentence.\n  I am also concerned when I see television programs, movies, and read \nbooks that constantly suggest that any young person sent to prison is \ngoing to be sexually assaulted. I have never believed that to be true, \nbut I have not doubted some of it occurs. None of it should occur.\n  As a prosecutor, I had a policy that I would talk to any mother or \nclose family member of any person who was convicted in my court. Many \nof them told me of their concerns about sexual assault in prison based \non what they had seen on television and what they had read in books.\n  This bill will deal with the issue in three ways. It establishes a \nnational commission to study prison rape at the Federal, State, and \nlocal levels and, after 2 years, to publish the results of the study \nand make recommendations on how to reduce prison rape.\n  Second, the bill directs the Attorney General to issue a rule for the \nreduction of prison rape in Federal prisons. That is what we have \ndirect responsibility for in this body, Federal prisons. To avoid a \nreduction in certain Federal funds, each State should certify it has \nadopted or is in compliance with the standards set forth in the \nAttorney\n\n[[Page S10033]]\n\nGeneral's rules for improvement in this area. If a State is not in \ncompliance, it can use the 5-percent money that they would otherwise \nlose to work on this problem. If they do that, they will not end up \nlosing any money, but it will be a way of us saying: If you are going \nto continue to draw Federal money, take this issue seriously.\n  Third, the bill will require the Department of Justice to conduct \nstatistical surveys on prison rape for Federal, State, and local \nprisons and jails. Further, the Federal Government will select \nofficials in prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape and with \nthe lowest incidence of sexual assaults and have them come to \nWashington to discuss the problem and testify.\n\n  The bill provides grants of up to $40 million to States for the \nprevention, investigation, and prosecution of prison rape. We find very \nlittle prosecution of these cases for prison rape. It will help the \nStates reduce repeat offenses.\n  A broad and bipartisan array of organizations and institutions have \nadded their support to this bill; for example: The American \nPsychological Association; Camp Fire USA; Center for Religious Freedom, \nFreedom House; Christian Rescue Committee; Citizens United for \nRehabilitation; Focus on the Family; Good News, United Methodist \nChurch; Human Rights Watch; Justice Policy Institute; Lutheran Office \nfor Governmental Affairs; National Association of School Psychologists; \nNational Association of Evangelicals; National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People; National Council for La Raza; National \nNetwork for Youth; National Mental Health Association; Marvin Olasky, \nthe author and editor; Partnership for Responsible Drug Information, \nPresbyterian Church USA; Religious Action Center; Prison Fellowship--\nthat is Chuck Colson's group that has been active in working on this \nissue--the Salvation Army; the Southern Baptist Convention; Unitarian \nUniversalists for Juvenile Justice; Volunteers of America; and Youth \nLaw Center.\n  I also thank Linda Chavez and Mike Horowitz for the ideas that \nstarted this legislative initiative. Well-conceived and carefully \ncrafted ideas drive many legislative and political initiatives that \nbecome law after people work together to form a bipartisan, moral \nposition.\n  I commend the hard work of Bill Pryor, the attorney general of \nAlabama, who worked with us on this issue and testified in favor of it. \nHe cares about the individuals who are in prison, having put a lot of \nthem there himself, and he demands fairness in how the prisoners are \ntreated.\n  I also compliment my Senate staff person, Andrea Sander, for her \nexcellent work in this matter.\n  This bill will address prison rape, not through unfunded mandates but \nby studying the problem and figuring out how to address these needs. It \nis time for us to confront this issue, to deal with it, and put it \nbehind us. Mothers should not have to worry that their children are \ngoing to be sexually assaulted in prison. That should not occur. I \nbelieve we can do better. This bill will be a major step in that \ndirection, and I salute Senator Kennedy for his leadership in helping \nus make this happen.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10033-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr. President, we are on the Energy bill, but I wish to \ntake a moment, inasmuch as my colleague from Wyoming has finished his \nstatement, to speak on another subject. This morning my colleague, \nSenator Wyden from Oregon, and I had a press conference disclosing \nsomething that is going on in a small corner of the Department of \nDefense. It is pretty disconcerting.\n  I should say at the outset that over recent months, Senator Wyden and \nI have tried to put together a little project dealing with Government \nwaste. Both of us believe very strongly Government does a lot of things \nto improve people's lives. It funds education and highways and provides \nfor this country's protection and defense. There are a lot of things \nthe Government does that are important to our daily lives, but when \nthere is waste of money in Government, it is appalling.\n  We have discovered in a small corner of the Pentagon something that \nis going on that ought to be stopped immediately: In three days, a \nprogram sponsored by an agency in the Pentagon called DARPA will begin \nto allow sign-ups for the creation of a futures program for people to \nbuy and sell futures contracts. It is an approach to try to use the \nmarket system to predict future events in the Middle East, they say.\n  I encourage people to go to their Web page and take a look at it. \nThey say, for example, they will create a futures market in which \nbuyers and sellers will make judgments and price futures contracts on \npredictive events such as: Will Mr. Arafat be assassinated? Will the \nKing of Jordan be overthrown? Will there be a bioterrorist attack \nagainst the country of Israel?\n  I told someone about discovering that this was going on at the \nPentagon. They said I am clearly wrong about that; there is not any way \nthe Pentagon can be setting up a futures contract system in which \npeople will make bets on the Internet about whether some leader will be \nassassinated or whether there will be a bioterrorist attack.\n  The answer is, they are wrong. That is exactly what is happening. I \nsay to anybody who wonders about it, go to the Internet. It is \nunbelievably stupid as a public policy, in my judgment, to think that \nreal intelligence can be replaced by a betting system involving people \nconnected to the Internet around the world; that you can replace real \nintelligence with a so-called market-based system in which presumably \ninformed buyers and sellers would make bets, wagers--they call it \nfutures contracts, but in fact it would be wagers--on whether a foreign \nleader would be assassinated, on whether there would be a bioterrorist \nattack, on whether North Korea would launch missiles.\n  I am using all of these examples because they are on the Internet \nsite sponsored by the Department of Defense. This is real. I thought \nimmediately, this clearly must be someone who went to The Onion and it \nis a spoof.\n  No, it is not. One does not find this on The Onion. They find it on \nan Internet site sponsored by DARPA at the Department of Defense, \nsaying they are going to create this system and the sign-up starts \nAugust 1. The trading on futures contracts on these kinds of questions \ntrying to be predictive about future events in the Middle East will \nbegin on October 1, and they hope to ultimately have 10,000 traders. It \nis the most Byzantine, harebrained scheme I think I have ever heard \ncoming from Government.\n  I say to DARPA, and to Admiral Poindexter, who I understand is \nrunning this program: Stop it. End it.\n  If not, we will try to end it in the appropriations process.\n  The Department of Defense does a lot of wonderful things. I have \ngreat admiration for them, and I serve on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. But putting together a program for trading of futures \ncontracts on the kinds of propositions I have just mentioned--\nassassinating leaders, bioterrorist attacks--is not a project that \nwarrants any credibility at all. It is a tragic waste of the taxpayers' \nmoney. It is offensive and, in my judgment, it will have no value to \nanyone.\n  My hope is that Senator Wyden and I will have convinced the Pentagon \ntoday that enough is enough. Stop this kind of nonsense.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10034-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10034]]\n          REPATRIATION OF CUBANS INTERDICTED ON THE HIGH SEAS\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I call to the attention of the \nSenate, and specifically to the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nquestion of whether or not longstanding policy has been changed by the \nadministration with regard to the repatriation of Cubans interdicted on \nthe high seas.\n  As we know, since 1995 we have had an understanding with the Castro \nCuban Government that when Cubans are interdicted on the high seas, \nthey will be returned to Cuba and they will not be imprisoned.\n  Clearly, we saw a change with the hijacking of a ferry boat a couple \nmonths ago. They were returned to Cuba, and without a trial they were \nsummarily executed.\n  Naturally, this has made us much more sensitive to the question about \nthese very brave citizens of Cuba who are trying to flee the Castro \nregime. So it brings up the instance of 2 weeks ago.\n  Three dock security guards were overpowered. A boat was stolen by \nsome dozen Cuban citizens. On their way across the Straits of Florida, \nthey were interdicted by the U.S. Coast Guard. In returning them, it \nappears there was a negotiation by our Government with the Castro \ngovernment that they would receive prison sentences of up to 10 years \nat the discretion of the Cuban Government.\n  This appears to be a subtle change in policy. Was it a hijacking? It \nwas the stealing of a boat. But the long and the short of it is, the \nU.S. Government was negotiating directly to send these Cubans going \nback to Cuba into a prison sentence that could be as much as 10 years. \nI do not think this is right.\n  Under these circumstances, it seems to me that at least the U.S. \nGovernment, this administration, should have considered the alternative \nof a third country for these people. Having been sent back, to go back \ninto Castro's prisons, you know their fate.\n  I am asking Senator Lugar and Senator Biden of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee to investigate this matter. Let us determine if this is \nreally in the best interest of what we are trying to achieve when \npeople are leaving a repressive dictatorship, seeking freedom, and then \nit appears that the U.S. Government is negotiating their own prison \nsentence. I do not think that should be the policy of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10034-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10034-S10038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE BILL SCHERLE POST OFFICE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives have passed S. 1399, legislation that names \nthe Glenwood, IA Post Office for former Iowa Congressman William J. \nScherle. I understand that the President will soon sign that measure--I \nhope this week.\n  Congressman Bill Scherle--or Bill, as his friends call him--and his \nwife Jane live on their family farm just outside of Henderson, IA, in \nMills County. Glenwood is the county seat of Mills County. Bill served \n4 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, beginning with 3 terms in \n1967 in what was then Iowa's 7th Congressional District, and a term in \nthe redistricted 5th Congressional District. I think it is appropriate \nthat Glenwood's Post Office will soon permanently bear Congressman \nScherle's name.\n  Bill long served this Nation. He started with military service in the \nnavy and Coast Guard during World War II, then afterward served in the \nNaval Reserve. He chaired the Mills County Republican Party for almost \na decade starting in 1956. He served in the Iowa legislature from 1960 \nthrough 1966. He then was elected to the U.S. Congress and served \nthrough 1974, including service on the Education and Labor Committee as \nwell as on the Appropriations Committee. His public service continued \nin 1975 and 1976, when he was appointed to a senior position at the \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  In January 1968, North Korea seized the USS Pueblo, imprisoning and \ntorturing the crew. Congressman Scherle led the effort in Congress to \nfree the crew of the Pueblo. I have always admired Bill's tenacity in \nnever letting the Pueblo crew be forgotten. Bill was the only member of \nCongress invited to attend Pueblo reunions, and, as their health has \nallowed, Bill and Jane always have attended.\n  Bill and I are at different places on the political spectrum, and I \nran against him for Congress twice. He won the first time, and I won \nthe rematch. We disagreed on many issues, but I always understood that \nhe acted on the basis of strongly held views about what he considered \nwere the best interests of those he represented and of the Nation.\n  Long after we ran as opponents, I got to know Bill and visited on his \nfarm. He is a good person who cares deeply about his community and \nrural America. Politics has always had a certain amount of rough and \ntumble.\n  But while Bill was certainly a good Republican who wanted to see \nconsistent victories for the GOP, he also could see the good in all \npeople.\n  One area of our mutual interest was the Iowa School for the Deaf in \nCouncil Bluffs. Bill always did what he could for the school my brother \nattended years ago, and for deaf people in general.\n  Congressman Scherle always cared about children and their welfare. He \nwrote a children's book, ``The Happy Barn.'' He gave away thousands of \ncopies to schools, hospitals and individual families in Southwest Iowa \nand the Omaha area, reading to young children time after time. He had \nlots of fun reading to children, and I believe that there are few more \nvaluable things we can do as adults than to read to children and get \nthem started on that most important activity.\n  Bill was a businessman and farmer, proud of both professions. He \nreceived the Alegent Health Mercy Hospital Heritage Award for his \ncontributions to business in Southwest Iowa.\n  Bill Scherle remains a good father to his two sons, and a good \nhusband to his wife of 55 years, Jane. He is blessed with six \ngrandchildren--five girls and a boy. Bill has lived a dedicated life, \nfull of patriotism, family and public service. I am please that my \ncolleague, Senator Grassley, joins me in sponsoring this legislation. \nCongressman King introduced the companion legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives, which was cosponsored by the entire Iowa delegation.\n  I thank my colleagues for helping us all to honor Congressman Bill \nScherle, and I look forward to hearing that the President has signed \nthis bill--hopefully this week.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senate will be asked to approve two \nfree-trade agreements with respect to Singapore and Chile. I expect the \nSenate will approve both trade agreements by very wide margins. I \nintend to oppose both and wanted to explain why. It is not the case \nthat I believe a free-trade agreement with Singapore is inappropriate. \nIt is not the case that I believe a free-trade agreement with Chile is \ninappropriate. It is the case, however, that this country has a trade \nregime that is in total chaos and it is a significant mess.\n  For 20 years, under Republican and Democratic administrations, we \nhave seen our trade deficit ratchet way up. We now have the largest \ntrade deficit in human history that has occurred anywhere on the globe. \nIt has been rising very rapidly. Instead of fixing the problems that \nexist in international trade and demanding fair trade and demanding \nfrom our allies fair trade treatment and doing something to prevent the \nerosion of American jobs which, incidentally, are now moving overseas \nat a rapid pace, we have trade negotiators rushing across the world \ntrying to do new agreements.\n  I say fix the old agreements before we start running around doing new \nagreements. The reason we are going to consider new agreements today \nunder something called fast track is that Congress decided to handcuff \nitself and agree to a procedure by which no amendments will be able to \nbe offered to either free-trade agreement.\n  Singapore is a tiny nation of 3 million people a half a world away. \nWe already have a very favorable trade relationship with Singapore. It \nhas little manufacturing and little agriculture. It is wide open to \nimported goods. Singapore is not an example of a trade problem for us. \nSo it does not matter much to me whether we have a free-trade agreement \nwith Singapore.\n  The trade ambassador has brought us an 800-page free-trade agreement \nwith Singapore. But demonstrative of the problem we have created for \nourselves is a small provision in the free-trade agreement with \nSingapore that provides an authorization for the opportunity for \nSingapore to send to our\n\n[[Page S10035]]\n\ncountry 5,400 people under a visa program to take jobs in this country.\n  Normally that would be a circumstance that would be dealt with by \nother committees in Congress, in which we evaluate how many people do \nwe want to come in under a visa to work in this country, but instead \nthis has been negotiated in a foreign-trade agreement negotiation \nsomewhere, perhaps most of it overseas, certainly behind closed doors, \ninevitably in secret, and they put an immigration provision in this \nproposal. The immigration provision would allow 5,400 immigrants to \ncome from Singapore to the United States to take jobs in the United \nStates.\n  Think of this for a second. We have 8 to 10 million people out of \nwork, desperate for jobs, needing to go to work, who cannot find a job \nin this country. We read a story every day in the major newspapers \nabout someone who has hundreds of resumes out, they spend all day \ndesperately trying to find a job because we have lost 2\\1/2\\ million \njobs in the last couple of years.\n  It is not as if our economy is growing by creating new jobs. To the \nextent there is any growth at all, it is jobless growth in this \ncountry. Some have made the point that, no, there are jobs attached to \nthis growth, it is just that jobs do not exist in the United States. \nThe growth occurs here in terms of profits and economic expansion of \nsales and profits, but the jobs attached to that growth are in \nBangladesh, Indonesia, China, and elsewhere.\n  So if we have a jobless expansion, which we have, having lost 2\\1/2\\ \nmillion jobs in the last couple of years, and we have people \ndesperately searching for jobs, and then we get a free-trade agreement \nbrought to the Senate floor our trade ambassador negotiated with \nSingapore, and deep in the bowels of that agreement is a provision that \nsays 5,400 people from Singapore will come to this country to take jobs \nin this country and we ask the question: Why? Why would we do that?\n  So then the immediate instinct is, if there is a provision in this \nfree-trade agreement with Singapore that is that odious, then let's get \nrid of it by offering an amendment. Dump it. The problem is, fast track \nmeans trade agreements brought to the Senate floor prevent any Member \nof the Senate from offering any amendment under any circumstance.\n  This Congress foolishly decided that it would straitjacket itself and \nwhatever is negotiated anywhere by our trade ambassador and brought \nback in the form of a trade agreement, we will agree that we will be \nprevented from offering an amendment.\n  So we will vote on this. The majority of the Senate will vote yes to \nfree trade with Singapore, and yes to 5,400 immigrants from Singapore \nto come to this country to take American jobs. I am not going to vote \nfor that. Once again, the lesson is, those who believe fast-track trade \nprocedures make sense ought to think again.\n  Also, this trade agreement with Singapore provides for transshipment. \nIt provides for transshipment of high-tech products from anywhere, \nChina, Burma, Indonesia, if they are transshipped through Singapore to \nthe United States to get the full benefit of the Singapore free-trade \nagreement.\n  Singapore is already one of the largest transshipping points in the \nworld. Should we be negotiating trade agreements that encourage \ntransshipment so we do not know the origin of shipments to this country \nof high-tech products or others? I do not think so.\n  I understand, interestingly enough, that a bipartisan group of my \ncolleagues will offer a resolution on the immigration piece that is in \nthe free-trade agreement. The resolution is going to be a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. I think I was asked if I put my name on it. I am \nhappy to put my name on it, but it does not mean anything. It is \nbeating someone over the head with a feather.\n\n  It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says: You better watch \nit; you should not have done this. But it cannot be more than a sense \nof the Senate because we cannot take out this provision. This provision \nis stuck in the trade bill and we cannot get it out. This Senate has \nalready agreed we will not allow amendments.\n  I didn't vote for that; I voted against it. But the majority of this \nSenate says: Let us line up so we can be subservient to the trade \nambassador--whoever it is, Republican or Democrat--and agree whatever \nthey negotiate in secret overseas that affects American jobs, count us \nout. We will not be able to offer amendments. That is just fine with \nus.\n  Apparently, these are colleagues who have forgotten what is written \nin the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution clearly says \nthat trade is the Senate's responsibility, not anyone else's; not the \nPresident but the Senate.\n  Fast track trade agreements have been disastrous for this country. \nThis chart shows the runaway deficits we have experienced.\n  It does not matter which administration is in office. A person could \nbe blindfolded and listen and cannot tell if it is a Republican or \nDemocratic administration. They all say the same thing: all we care \nabout is getting another trade agreement. Meanwhile, we had $470 \nbillion in the year 2002 in merchandise trade deficits. Is that \nalarming to some? One cannot detect it in the Senate. No one seems to \ncare much about it. There are only two or three Members who talk about \nthis, and we are considered the xenophobic isolationist stooges that do \nnot get it.\n  What I get is this country fought for a century for a series of \nthings that make life better in our country. There are people who died \nin the streets of America for the right to organize in labor unions. We \nfought about child labor laws, saying you should not work 12-year-old \nkids 12 hours a day in a coal mine or manufacturing plant. We fought \nabout prohibiting companies from dumping chemicals into the air and the \nwater. We fought about safe workplaces, believing the American workers \nhave a right to work in safe workplaces. We fought about all those \nissues for a century.\n  Now some have decided you can pole-vault over all of that by \nproducing what you want to produce elsewhere, where you do not have to \nworry about hiring children, where you do not have to worry about clean \nair and clean water. You do not have to worry about safe workplaces. \nYou could prohibit all workers from organizing any bargaining unit. We \nhave decided that is OK, let companies do that. They pole-vault to \nChina or Indonesia or Bangladesh, produce there but sell here.\n  The problem is, in the long term, it does not work because the very \npeople who earned the income in the manufacturing plants in this \ncountry are the people who were able to purchase the products off the \nstore shelves. Without the incomes from those jobs--and our \nmanufacturing sector is shrinking badly--from that manufacturing \nsector, who will buy these products?\n  This morning in the Wall Street Journal an article reads, ``U.S.-\nChinese Trade Becomes a Delicate Issue of Turf.'' It is talking about \nthe debate within the National Association of Manufacturers between the \nbig manufacturers that are international in scope that want to move \ntheir manufacturing to other countries where they can pay pennies on \nthe dollar for labor, and the other businesses, medium and small \nbusinesses, that rely on the business from the larger companies to \nspill over to them. It is a fascinating article. I commend the reading \nto people who are interested in the subject.\n\n  Jim Schollaert, a lobbyist with the American Manufacturing Trade \nAction Coalition, says simply: The big companies are following a new \nbusiness model--pay Chinese wages but charge U.S. prices.\n  That is the question these days for us. Is there a price of admission \nto the American marketplace? We understand we have a globalization of \nthe international economy, and it will not stop. But have the rules for \nthis new global economy kept pace with globalization itself? The \nanswer, clearly, is no. If a large international company has a choice \nto decide where it wants to produce, and it flies its jet around the \nworld and looks down at the landscape and sees different kinds of \ngovernance, different philosophies, different local politics, and \ndifferent labor forces and decides to choose where to produce, does it \nnot all too often these days decide to produce where it can hire a 12-\nyear-old, work them 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour?\n  You think it does not happen? Of course it does. We can describe it \nand use names in the Senate, names of workers and names of companies. \nNot\n\n[[Page S10036]]\n\nonly can they settle on a site in the world where they can put a \nmanufacturing plant, hire kids and adults and pay them pennies on the \ndollar and pollute the air and water and decide they shall not be \nallowed to organize as a bargaining unit and they do not have to have \nsafe workplaces in which the workers conduct their daily activities, \nand then produce there, but they also ship it back to Toledo, \nAnchorage, Fargo, or Los Angeles and sell it on the store shelves in \nthis country. That is the global marketplace.\n  Let me talk about a series of specific countries. First, I will talk \nabout China. China has the largest trade deficit with us. It is $103 \nbillion a year. They ship us their trinkets, trousers, shirts, shoes. \nWe are a huge sponge for Chinese production.\n  One reason we have a very large trade deficit with China, which hurts \nus and strengthens them, is because the Chinese do not want certain \nthings from us. They are not buying our grain in any significant way. \nThey do not want our wheat. They do not want to buy airplanes. They \nneed airplanes, but do not want to buy our airplanes off the shelf \nwhere we manufacture them and send our airplanes to China. They say \nthey want some of our technology, but they want us to build our \nairplane plant in China and hire Chinese workers. That is the way they \nwould like to buy American airplanes.\n  The problem is, it does not work that way. That is not what \ninternational trade is about. We buy that which we can best use from \nChina, they ought to buy what they can best use from us. That is the \ndoctrine of comparative advantage. It is as old as the study of \neconomics itself.\n  Our negotiators, our U.S. official negotiators negotiate with other \ncountries and typically underserve American interests.\n  About 2\\1/2\\ years ago we had a bilateral trade agreement done with \nChina. It was a prelude to China joining the WTO. At the end of the \nagreement, there was once again celebration by negotiators because \nnegotiators judge their success by whether or not they got a negotiated \nagreement. It is a terrible agreement, I might say. They decided, for \nexample, that if there is automobile trade between the United States \nand China in the future, after a long phase-in, the following will \nexist: China will be allowed a 25-percent tariff on United States \nautomobiles sold in China, and we would have a 2.5-percent tariff on \nany Chinese automobiles sold in the United States.\n  Our negotiators went to China and said: All right, we agree if there \nis automobile trade, vehicle trade between the United States and China. \nWe will agree that you shall have a tariff that is 10 times higher than \nwhat we will impose on your products. Who negotiated this on our \nbehalf? Did they forget who they were working for?\n\n  Do you know how many movies we get into China? Before the trade \nagreement, only 10 imported movies could be shipped to China in a year. \nJust 10. So after the agreement, we get to ship 20 movies. People say, \nLook at that; what a great thing that is, to double it to 20. Our \nexpectations on fair trade are pathetic.\n  The Chinese, by and large, keep their market reasonably closed to us, \nprevent us from accessing opportunities in their marketplace but expect \nour marketplace to be wide open to Chinese goods.\n  We have become a cash cow for the hard currency needs for China, and \nit is hurting our country. The imbalance in the trade relationship that \nexists between the United States and China is almost unforgivable. Is \nanybody doing anything about it? Not a thing. Nothing. Just nothing. \nAll you get, when you talk to the trade ambassador's office, again \nunder Democratic and Republican administrations--all you get from them \nare a few grunts and groans about we would like to do better and then \nthey rush off and do a new agreement with some other country.\n  This is what we have with Korea. I mentioned the absurd situation \nwith automobile trade with China. Well, in 2001, 618,000 cars were \nshipped from Korea to the United States. I believe last year it was \n680,000 but use this as a working number; 618,000 cars were shipped \nfrom Korea to the United States to U.S. consumers--Hyundais, Daewoos. \nProbably they are wonderful automobiles. I have not driven one but I am \nsure they are fine automobiles.\n  They sent us 618,000 into our marketplace. Can anyone guess how many \nU.S. automobiles were sold in Korea? It was 2,800; 618,000 coming into \nour marketplace; we got 2,800 into the Korean market. Korea ships us as \nmany cars as they can get into our marketplace and the Korean \nGovernment will keep out as many U.S. cars as they can.\n  A recent example of that is the Dodge Dakota pickup, which showed \ngreat promise in the Korean marketplace. The Dodge Dakota pickup, after \n2 months, started penetrating the Korean marketplace. The Korean \nGovernment cracked down on it, big headlines in the newspapers, and \nimmediately most of the orders were canceled.\n  My State produces potatoes in the Red River Valley, great potato \ncountry. We produce potatoes and we ship potato flakes to Korea for use \nin confection food--potato flakes. Do you know what the tariff on \npotato flakes is to Korea? It is 300 percent. Why do we allow that? I \ndon't know. Our country doesn't seem to be interested in standing up \nfor its economic interests.\n  Perhaps we should say to the Koreans, these great cars you are \nshipping into the marketplace, if you don't allow our cars into your \nmarketplace and fair access to your consumers, then you ought to take \nyour cars and sell them in Zaire. Try to sell them in Zaire. If you \ndon't like it, then open your marketplace. Until your marketplace is \nopen, we are not going to absorb more than a half a million of your \nvehicles. That is simple enough.\n  But we will not do that because our country is unwilling to stand up \nfor its economic interests. In fact, that which I am presenting today \non the floor of the Senate, I can't even present in an op-ed piece in \nthe Washington Post. The Washington Post wouldn't run an op-ed piece in \na million years talking about this because they are for one thing: free \ntrade, free trade, free trade. It is as if they were wearing a robe, \nstanding on a street corner chanting, and they only want one view \nexpressed in their op-ed pages. Those of us who raise questions about \nthe requirement for fair trade to stand up for the interests of \nAmerican jobs are called protectionists.\n\n  My goal is not to put a wall around this country. I want to expand \ntrade. I think expanded trade will be good for everyone, provided the \nrules are fair. When the rules are not fair, it is time for this \ncountry to stand up for itself and stand up for its jobs and stand up \nfor its businesses.\n  I will give some other examples. I have mentioned Korea and I \nmentioned China. Now let me discuss Europe. I am using some \nagricultural examples simply because I come from a farm State. There \nare so many other examples.\n  If you take a look at what is happening in beef with Europe, the \nEuropeans do not want U.S. beef in their marketplace because they say \nit is produced with growth hormones and is therefore harmful to their \nhealth. There is no scientific evidence of that. In fact, all the \nevidence is on the other side. But Europe says, We are not going to \nallow American beef into the European marketplace. In fact, they \nportray our beef as two-headed cows, some sort of obscene animal that \nwould be terribly harmful to the marketplace, so they say, Keep it out.\n  So we go to the World Trade Organization and file a complaint against \nEurope and we win. It doesn't matter to Europe that we win. They are \nstill not going to allow American beef into Europe. So what do we do? \nWe are going to get tough. This is symbolic of the lack of backbone we \nhave in this country when it comes to trade. How do we get tough? We \ndecide to slap some retaliation on Europe. We hit them with some \ntariffs on truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort cheese.\n  God bless us, we are really getting tough with Europe. We are going \nto sock them around with truffles, goose liver, and Roquefort cheese. \nSo what is Europe's idea to retaliate against us? Tariffs on U.S. steel \nand textiles.\n  Can you just see the difference? We simply do not have the backbone, \nthe nerve, or the will to stand up for this country's economic \ninterests.\n  I am mentioning Europe. There are plenty of problems with Europe in \nterms of our trade agreements. We continue to see country after \ncountry--with respect to Europe, we see the entire continent--with \nlarge, abiding,\n\n[[Page S10037]]\n\nyearly trade deficits that relate to jobs lost in this country.\n  If we were losing those jobs just because we couldn't compete, that \nis one thing. That is fine. I wouldn't like it but I would understand \nit and I would say we better figure out how to compete in the \ninternational marketplace. But if we are losing those jobs because the \nbasis of competition is fundamentally unfair to America, then I say \nthere is something wrong with the trade agreements.\n  We connect to other countries in a way that says to other countries: \nAll right. We will trade and this is the circumstance. We will just tie \none or two hands behind our back and then we will start. You can hire \nkids, you can put them in plants that are unsafe, dump your chemicals \ninto the streams and the air, and you can prohibit them from organizing \nby law. You can do all those things and it is fine. Make your product \nas cheap as you can make it and ship it to the marketplace in Bismarck, \nND, or Boise, ID, or Fairbanks, AK, or Los Angeles, and we would love \nto purchase that.\n\n  How absurd is that? Is there not any basic standard at all? Are the \nstandards we fought for in this country for so long so old-fashioned? \nIs it not a timeless truth that workers ought to be able to organize, \nthey ought to be able to expect a fair wage, and that you ought not be \nable to work 12-year-olds 12 hours a day 7 days a week?\n  If you wonder about that, let me give an example of a story. This \nstory is entitled ``Worked Till They Drop.'' This happens to be about a \n19-year-old girl but it is happening way too often in parts of the \nworld where they do not care about the conditions of production that we \nhave cared about for a long while and that we fought over for many \ndecades. This is a story about Li Chunmei, May 13 of last year. She had \nbeen on her feet for 16 hours, her coworkers said:\n\n       . . . running back and forth inside the Bainan Toy Factory, \n     [in China] carrying toy parts from machine to machine.\n\n  Let me read a bit from the piece.\n\n       This was the busy season, before Christmas, when orders \n     peaked from Japan and the United States for the factory's \n     stuffed animals. Long hours were mandatory, and at least 2 \n     months had passed since Li and the other workers had enjoyed \n     even a Sunday off.\n\n  Sixteen hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n       Lying on her bed in the night, staring at the bunk above \n     her, the slight 19-year-old complained she felt worn out.\n\n  She was massaging her aching legs, coughing, and she told them she \nwas hungry.\n\n       The factory food was so bad, she said, she felt as if she \n     had not eaten at all. . . .\n       ``I want to quit,'' one of her roommates . . . remembered \n     her saying. ``I want to go home.'' Her roommates had already \n     fallen asleep when Li started coughing up blood. They found \n     her in the bathroom a few hours later, curled up on the \n     floor. . . .\n\n  She was dead.\n  The exact cause of Li's death remains unknown. But what happened to \nher last November in this industrial town in southeastern Guangdong \nprovince is described by family friends and coworkers as an example of \nwhat China's more daring newspapers call guolaosi.\n  The phrase means ``over-work death,'' and usually applies to young \nworkers who suddenly collapse and die after working exceedingly long \nhours, day after day.\n\n  This is the sort of thing that is happening in some factories around \nthe world, producing, in this case, stuffed toys. They could have been \nproducing baseball caps. A prominent Ivy League college buys baseball \ncaps from similar factories. They pay \\1/5\\ cent labor for each cap \nproduced and each cap is sold at $17 on the campus of the Ivy League \nuniversity. Fair trade?\n  The question is, What did we fight about all these years? It seems to \nme we fought about having an economy that gave American businesses a \nchance to compete fairly and provide good-paying jobs to American \nworkers. On issue after issue in international trade, we have trade \nagreements being brought to the floor of the Senate that have been \nnegotiated with other countries in a way that is fundamentally \nincompetent.\n  One other example I have spent 10 years working on is the aftermatch \nof a free-trade agreement with Canada. The free-trade agreement with \nCanada is one I voted against. Incidentally, it was a vote when I was \nserving in the United States House Ways and Means Committee. It was 34-\n1. I was the one who voted against it. I was told by my colleagues we \nreally need to make this a unanimous consent vote, that Canada was our \ngood neighbor to the north and we share a common border. I said no. \nWhat you are proposing here is wrong. It is going to dramatically \ninjure family farmers in this country.\n  But the deal was passed under fast track and no one could offer \namendments. Oh, we had an assurance in writing from Trade Ambassador \nYeutter that it would not represent a change or a significant change in \nthe quantity of grain going back and forth across the border. The \nminute it was passed, we began to see a flood--a virtual avalanche--of \nCanadian wheat coming into this country sold by the Canadian Wheat \nBoard, a state-sanctioned monopoly that would be illegal in this \ncountry. Our farmers were badly undercut by this unfair competition. We \nhaven't been able to do a thing about it--nothing.\n  I had the GAO go to the Canadian Wheat Board because we think they \nare dumping in our marketplace. The Canadian Wheat Board simply thumbed \nits nose at the General Accounting Office, saying we don't intend to \nopen our records to you at all. We intend to show you no information.\n  Year after year, we face this unfair grain trade from Canada. In \nfact, one day I went to the Canadian border--I have mentioned this many \ntimes--with a man named Earl Jensen in a 12-year-old orange truck with \na couple hundred bushels of durum wheat. We drove to the Canadian \nborder. All the way to the Canadian border we saw 18-wheelers coming \nsouth full of Canadian grain being dumped on our marketplace injuring \nour farmers. We saw semi load after semi load. I bet we met 20 semi \nloads of Canadian grain. When we got to the border in the 12-year-old \nlittle orange truck, guess what. We were stopped dead in place and we \ncould not get that truck across the border because you couldn't take \n200 bushels of durum wheat into Canada. The Canadian market was closed \nto us, but our market was wide open to unfair Canadian trade in this \ncountry. This has gone on for 10 years and we have not been able to do \na thing about it.\n\n  Today we have a trade ambassador who has been scurrying around the \nworld doing new trade agreements. So we have two new agreements to vote \non, one of which has a 5,400 immigrant quota of people coming into our \ncountry from Singapore to take American jobs. Everyone knows that is \nwrong. Everybody in this Chamber knows that is foolish. That is not the \nway you do immigration policy--behind closed doors in secret on a trade \nbill. And yet no one in this Chamber will be able to get rid of that \nprovision. That provision will be ratified by this Congress either this \nafternoon or tomorrow. Not with my vote.\n  At some point, somehow, somebody will have to wake up on trade. It is \nnot the case that I believe we ought to shut down trade or that we \nought to build walls and prevent trade. It is the case that this \ncountry needs to have a backbone and some nerve and some will--yes, \ndealing with China, Japan, Europe, Korea, Canada, and Mexico. And until \nwe get that will and are willing to protect American jobs with the \nrequirement for fair trade, this country is going to continue to lose \neconomic strength.\n  After the Second World War, for a quarter of a century our trade \npolicy was almost exclusively foreign policy. It wasn't trade. It \nwasn't economics. It was all foreign policy coming out of the State \nDepartment. It didn't matter because we were the biggest, the best, and \nthe strongest country in the world by far and we could tie one hand \nbehind our backs and out-compete anybody under any circumstance. So it \nwas just fine. We could have mushy-headed foreign policy masquerading \nas trade policy. It didn't matter. We just would win.\n  But in the second 25 years after the Second World War, we saw the \ndevelopment of some pretty tough and canny competitors--Japan, Europe, \nnow China, and others. Still much of our trade policy is fuzzy-headed \nforeign policy. Now you tie one hand behind your back with moves that \nare fairer and this country loses. Again, what do we lose? We lose \njobs, economic expansion, opportunity for businesses, opportunity for \nworkers, and some say it doesn't matter; it is just irrelevant.\n\n[[Page S10038]]\n\n  I do not for the life of me understand that. It makes no sense that \nthis country does not any longer understand that international trade is \na significant foundation for this country's economic future. That \nfoundation is either a foundation of cement with strength or quicksand \nthat washes away quickly.\n  I have a chart which I believe shows a graph of where we have been \nwith all these trade agreements. One after another of these trade \nagreements has traded away this country's economic interests. You can \nsee the line. It describes when the Tokyo round of GATT was approved. \nIt describes the Uruguay round of GATT. It describes where we are with \nWTO, and with NAFTA.\n  It seems to me when something isn't working, you ought to change it. \nYet we see no proposal here for change at all. It is just let's have a \ncouple more helpings from the same menu, and the menu isn't working for \nour country.\n  There are so many issues related to this. I talked about jobs \nbecause, in my judgment, that is central to this. First, you have \ncurrency issues and the fact that China, for example, dramatically \nundervalues its currency against the U.S. dollar. They have a terrific \nadvantage in our marketplace in trade.\n  There are so many different facets of trade that it is almost hard to \ndescribe. You have the political issues. Some countries as a matter of \ngovernance decide here is the way we will compete. For example, I have \nmentioned on a couple of occasions today that some countries will \nprohibit workers from organizing. We are proud that our country \nprotects those rights. We understand it has strengthened this country \nand it is good for our country. In fact, the way we have developed a \nstrong middle class in our country is with the development of a \nmanufacturing sector in which workers are organized and have been able \nthrough their strength to collect a reasonable share of the national \nincome from manufacturing. But some countries say we will prohibit as a \nmatter of political choice workers from organizing.\n  Then there are some others who say it doesn't matter that our \nmanufacturing base is eroding; if that is what happens as a result of \nsome natural function of trade, that is all right for our country. \nWell, it is not all right. There is no country that will long remain a \nworld power--none--without a strong manufacturing base. You cannot be a \nworld economic power without a strong manufacturing base. Those who \nthink this country will remain a strong, vibrant, growing, economic \nsuperpower are dead wrong if they allow this manufacturing base to be \ndissipated. Too many of my colleagues seem to think it is just fine; \nwhatever happens, happens.\n  It is not fine with me. All you have to do is look at where this \ncountry is headed in international trade. Look at what has happened to \nour manufacturing base. Look at how good jobs have shrunk in this \ncountry. I am talking about those people who worked in the coal mines, \nthose who worked in the steel mills, those who worked in our \nmanufacturing plants who used to earn a good wage with good benefits \nand good job security, and who now discover we are racing toward the \nbottom to figure out how we can compete with other countries that pay a \ndime an hour or 20 cents an hour.\n  How can we compete with other countries that have no laws that \nprevent them from abusing the environment with chemicals going into the \nairshed and into the water? If you wonder about that, just travel a \nbit. Go to those countries--I have--and take a look at what happens. \nThen ask yourself, Is that the level of competition? Is there an \nadmission price to the American marketplace that says it is almost \nfree? That you don't have to reach any threshold? And any trade--using \ncircumstances I have previously described--is fair trade to which we \nought to subject our workers and our employers?\n  I have explained at great length why I intend to vote no on these two \ntrades agreements. It is not about Chile. It is not about Singapore. It \nis about a process that is fundamentally bankrupt. It is about trade \nnegotiators who ought to be ashamed of themselves. It is about past \ntrade agreements that are incompetent, whose repercussions we are \ndealing with today.\n  I have, from time to time, threatened to offer legislation that would \nrequire all U.S. trade negotiators to wear a jersey. When you are \nrepresenting the United States of America in the Olympics, you wear a \njersey that says ``USA.'' It seems to me that perhaps our trade \nnegotiators--more than almost anyone--need to have a jersey to be able \nto look down at and understand who they represent.\n  Will Rogers used to say: The United States of America has never lost \na war and never won a conference. He surely must have been thinking \nabout trade negotiators. This country had better develop a backbone and \nsome will and some nerve to stand up for its economy and stand up for \nits workers and stand up for its employers--no, not in a way that is \nunfair to any other country but in a way that says to any other \ncountry: We are open for business, we are ready for competition, and we \nwill compete anywhere and with anyone in the world, but we, by God, \ndemand that the rules be fair. And if the rules are not fair, then we \nintend to change them to create rules that are fair to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10038-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10038-S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN APPRECIATION OF OUR KOREAN WAR VETERANS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on July 27, 1953, our country signed an \narmistice agreement that ended the Korean War after 3 years of \ndevastating combat. Yesterday marked the 50th anniversary of the war's \nend. Today I rise to honor the courage and sacrifice of the military \nveterans who fought this war and to proclaim that our country has not \nforgotten their service.\n  More than 1.8 million Americans fought on the front lines of our \nbattle to defend freedom and democracy on the Korean Peninsula. They \njoined with allies from 21 different nations to ensure that the people \nof South Korea would not be ruled by the tyranny and oppression of \ncommunism. More than 36,500 soldiers committed the ultimate sacrifice \nin this effort, and another 103,000 Americans were wounded in some of \nthe bloodiest and most traumatic fighting the world has ever seen.\n  Currently, around 12,000 veterans of the conflict live in South \nDakota. They are now among the elder statesmen of our country's long \nlineage of heroism, true role models to our youth and an inspiration to \nthose service members now fighting around the world against terrorism \nand brutal dictatorship.\n  On June 25, 1950, North Korean dictator Kim Il-Song sent 135,000 \ntroops to invade South Korea. The international response was immediate, \nand President Truman sent troops to defend the South Koreans 2 days \nlater. For more than 3 years, these troops fought to preserve the \nintegrity of South Korea. But this conflict was not simply about \nprotecting the sovereignty of one nation against the designs of its \ninvader. Rather, the Korean War represented an epic struggle of two \npolitical ideologies: the democratic values of peace, freedom, and \nself-determination against a communist system based on tyranny and \nviolence.\n  No less than the fate of the world was at stake on the hills and \nplains of the Korean peninsula. With some of the century's most \ninfamous tyrants Mao and Stalin backing the North Koreans and the \nworld's beacon of democracy fighting alongside the South Koreans, this \nconflict could not have had higher stakes. Consequently, we future \ngenerations of Americans are deeply indebted to the veterans of the \nKorean War; it is to them we owe the preservation of our very way of \nlife.\n  And yet, despite the significance of their achievement, these \nsoldiers were never greeted with the type of homecoming befitting their \nheroism. A nation that, after World War II, was weary of war never \nfully grasped the enormity of the military's mission in Korea. Few \nreturning troops were greeted with the ticker-tape parades and \ncommunity celebrations that were common after World War II. The Korean \nWar became the Forgotten War.\n  As our country honors the 50th anniversary of the Korean War, I say \nto America's veterans of this war, you are forgotten no more. Your \nlegacy is our nation's prosperity, our continuing commitment to liberty \nand democracy. Your legacy is a thriving, democratic nation of 40 \nmillion souls on the southern half of the Korean Peninsula. With\n\n[[Page S10039]]\n\ngreat personal sacrifice and tremendous dedication, you secured our \nfuture. And while we sometimes take our way of life for granted, the \nveterans of the Korean War remind us that, as their Korean War \nCommemoration Flag proclaims, ``Freedom is not free.'' Without the \ndedicated service and sacrifice of the soldiers we celebrate in this, \nthe Year of the Korean Veteran, our nation would not be able to enjoy \nthe freedom and prosperity that we too often take for granted. So, on \nbehalf of later generations of veterans, like myself, and on behalf of \nall the citizens of South Dakota and all Americans, thank you for your \nlasting contribution to our nation's greatness. You, the veterans of \nthe Korean War, are true American heroes, and we salute you.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President I have a poem written by my constituent \nDee M. Tramontina of Buck Hill Falls, PA.\n  I rise today so that I might call special attention to the thoughts \nand observations of my constituents who would like to accord proper \nrecognition to those brave Americans who sacrificed, fought and died in \nthe Korean conflict.\n  I would like to recognize both Dee M. Tramontina and Albert \nTramontina, Jr., who, on behalf of the Monroe Chapter of the Korean War \nVeterans Association, have shared a poem with me concerning the \nconflict which ended 50 years ago.\n  I would like to call attention to this historic anniversary by asking \nthat Dee's poem be printed in the Record.\n\n                     The ``Forgotten War'' No More\n\n                          (By Dee Tramontina)\n\n     Some have made the grave mistake\n     Of calling Korea the forgotten war\n     But you can bet that none of them\n     Had to storm the Inchon shore\n\n     I am also very positive it's memory\n     Sadly stays with all of those\n     That at the Chosin Reservoir\n     They shivered, fought and froze\n\n     Perhaps you know of someone\n     Who fought among the ranks\n     And saw the awful, bloody terror\n     Of ``Old Baldy'' or the Yalu River banks\n\n     Be assured that a foggy memory\n     Would be a relief to maintain\n     For those that charged up the hill:\n     ``Heartbreak Ridge'' it seems, in vain\n\n     We can be sure that there are some\n     To this very day can still\n     Hear the horrors of the battle\n     We know as ``Pork Chop Hill''\n\n     Definitely an everlasting imprint\n     Of the 38th parallel has been burned\n     Into the hearts and minds of families\n     Of the many heroes that never returned\n\n     We are coming up on fifty years\n     Since Panmunjom brought peace\n     In honor of those that fought there\n     May the memory never cease\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10039-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               VA POLICY\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe attached article from the Gainesville Sun be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Gainesville Sun, July 19, 2003]\n\n                           Perverse VA Policy\n\n       There is something perverse about the Bush administration's \n     push to cut medical services for veterans at a time when \n     America is fighting a war in Iraq with the help of tens of \n     thousands of reservists and guard members.\n       Most of those citizen soldiers will come home to once again \n     take up their non-military lives and careers. And those who \n     do develop service-related illnesses and injuries (anybody \n     remember Gulf War Syndrome?) will invariably turn to a \n     Veterans Administration medical facility for care.\n       In the North Florida-South Georgia region alone, about \n     5,600 reservists have been called to service for the current \n     conflict. When they come home, some may require the care \n     available at the Lake City VA Medical Center. But even if \n     none do, that medical center already treats about 36,000 area \n     veterans.\n       And yet, a VA reassessment group--perversely called the \n     Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services, or CARES--\n     has called for services to be eliminated or scaled back at \n     the Lake City VA and 19 other veterans facilities around the \n     nation.\n       In response to a directive from Washington, local VA \n     officials have, albeit reluctantly, submitted recommendations \n     that would involve turning the Lake City medical center into \n     an outpatient clinic, transferring 230 nursing home patients \n     to private facilities--assuming adequate facilities can even \n     be found in the largely rural region--and/or transferring \n     patients to Gainesville's VA.\n       The objective would be to save perhaps $6 million a year by \n     eliminating jobs and operational costs at the Lake City VA \n     center. That seems like a false economy in light of the \n     thousands of veterans who depend on the center for care.\n       Fred Malphurs, director of the North Florida-South Georgia \n     Veterans Health System, was clearly not enthusiastic about \n     complying with the directive to identify cuts. ``The benefits \n     would be, in my opinion, marginal at best,'' he told The Sun \n     last week.\n       Whatever the perceived ``benefits'' of closing down or \n     drastically cutting back on Lake City's services, the impact \n     on area veterans would be negative to the extreme. It also \n     seems a bitter pill for veterans to have to swallow at a time \n     when thousands of area reservists and regular military \n     personnel (read future veterans) are still risking their \n     lives and their health fighting a war half a world away.\n       Nationally, the VA does have a problem with underutilized \n     facilities. We just have a difficult time believing that Lake \n     City's VA center is one of them.\n       Florida is a magnet for retirees, many of them veterans of \n     past conflicts. We would think that if anything, the demand \n     for veterans medical services is rising, not falling, in the \n     Sunshine State.\n       As North Florida becomes a more desirable destination for \n     retiree vets, demand for care at the Lake City VA center is \n     only going to grow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10039-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10039-S10040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SALUTE TO THE 109TH ENGINEERING BATTALION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today South Dakotans will welcome home \nthe 109th Engineering Battalion of the South Dakota National Guard. \nThis unit, headquartered in Sturgis, was among more than 20 Guard and \nReserve units from my State called to active duty in support of \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. On March 23, it became the first South Dakota \nunit to enter Iraq, and was the only South Dakota unit to operate in \nIraq during the early days of combat.\n  Today, these soldiers and their achievements become a part of South \nDakota's military heritage. Like those who served in the two world \nwars, in Korea, in Vietnam, and in numerous other places, this new \ngeneration has answered the call. They have offered to make every \nsacrifice, including life itself, to protect our freedom and security. \nWe must never forget them or the honor with which they served.\n  The 109th Engineering Battalion is a headquarters battalion of 39 \nmembers, responsible for the management of several other units in \ncarrying out engineering missions. The 109th was a critical part of our \nNation's efforts in Iraq, completing a wide variety of missions, from \nforce protection, to mine clearing, to construction of the Cedar II \nLogistical Support Area. The unit managed the activities of the 68th \nEngineering Company, the 95th Firefighters, the 520th Firefighters, and \nthe 562nd Firefighters.\n  After being stationed in Kuwait during the month leading up to the \nconflict, the 109th moved to Tallil Air Base in southeastern Iraq, just \noutside of al Nasiriyah, where some of the war's most fierce fighting \noccurred. When the members of the 109th arrived at their destination, \nLogistical Support Area Adder on Tallil Air Base, they found an \nencampment that was quickly filling up with soldiers from the Army, Air \nForce, Marines, and from the British military. Force protection would \nbe essential to guaranteeing these troops a swift victory over the \nstiffening opposition in the region.\n  At LSA Adder, the 109th oversaw the preparation of the battlefield \nfor combat, preparing fighting positions, constructing guard towers, \nbuilding a 3-mile protection berm around the perimeter, establishing \nsupply routes, and building two Patriot Missile launch sites. In \naddition, the 109th managed the establishment of critical life support \nstructures for the camp, including a water well, nuclear-biological-\nchemical (NBC) decontamination sites, a major Convoy Support Center, \nlatrines, showers, and roadways.\n  I am proud to welcome home the members of the 109th Battalion and to \ncommend them on a job well done. All of us know about the tremendous \ncourage and commitment of the infantry soldiers and others who engage \nthe enemy directly. But often we don't recognize the vital efforts of \nthose units behind the scenes--units like the 109th that prepare the \nbattlefield, provide medical care, establish life support services, and \ntransport supplies. Their work ensures the success of our front-line \ntroops and helps to hold casualties to a minimum. In 3 short weeks of \nfighting, the United States military\n\n[[Page S10040]]\n\nwas able to overthrow a tyrannical regime that had reigned in Iraq for \n45 years and utterly vanquish its military, with very few casualties. \nSupport units like the 109th were the backbone of this effort.\n  The 109th Engineering Battalion participated in a mobilization with \nfew precedents in South Dakota history. Nearly 2,000 Guard and Reserve \ntroops were called to active duty in our State, by far the largest \nmobilization since World War II. At the time the fighting began, units \nfrom more than 20 communities had been called up, from Elk Point in the \nsouth to Lemmon in the north, from Watertown in the east to Spearfish \nin the west. Indeed, our State's mobilization rate ranked among the \nhighest of all the States on a per capita basis.\n  In addition to the service of the 109th, I want to acknowledge the \nsacrifices and dedication of the families who stayed home. They are the \nunsung heroes of any mobilization. They motivate and inspire those who \nare far from home, and they, too, deserve our gratitude.\n  Today, I join these families and the State of South Dakota in \ncelebrating the courage, dedication, and success of the members of the \n109th Engineering Battalion, and I honor their participation in this \nhistoric event in our Nation's history. Welcome home. Thanks to all of \nyou for your hard work, your sacrifice, and your noble commitment to \nthis country and its ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10040-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in Los \nAngeles, CA. On September 12, 2001, two Spanish-speaking women were \nharassed and beaten by another patient in a doctor's office. Believing \nthe women to be of Middle Eastern descent, the attacker verbally and \nphysically assaulted the women in retaliation for the September 11, \n2001, terrorist attack on the United States. As the attacker struck the \nwomen, she yelled ``You foreigners caused all this trouble.''\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10040-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN SUPPORT OF U.S.-CHILE AND U.S.-SINGAPORE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to support the U.S.-Chile and \nU.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreements, which are now before the Senate. \nThese agreements are the first to be considered under the expedited \nTrade Promotion Authority, TPA, procedure that Congress passed last \nyear. Ratification of these agreements will provide significant \nbenefits to agricultural producers and the U.S. economy. Strong \nbipartisan votes will send an important message that the U.S. Congress \nis strongly committed to growing the U.S. economy and helping American \nfarmers and workers succeed in an ever-growing competitive global \nmarketplace.\n  Both the U.S.-Singapore and U.S.-Chile free trade agreements will \nlevel the playing field for U.S. products and farm goods. Specifically, \nboth agreements will eliminate the use of subsidies on agricultural \nexports, a major step forward for U.S. agriculture in WTO negotiations. \nThere is a clear link between a healthy agricultural sector and trade. \nMore than 43,000 Nebraskans hold jobs related to agriculture exports. \nNebraska ranks fourth nationally in exports of agricultural products--\nan estimated $3.14 billion in 2002. In 2002, Nebraska farmers and \nranchers saw increased international sales of corn, soybeans, and \nwheat, and depend on the ability to export their products to the rest \nof the world for continued growth.\n  The U.S.-Singapore free trade agreement will strengthen an important \nrelationship and serve as our first free trade agreement with an Asian \nnation. Singapore is a critical ally in Southeast Asia in the global \nwar on terrorism. Singapore is also an important economic ally. It is \nour 12th largest trading partner. This free trade agreement will \nprovide expanded opportunities for trade and investment and will \nincrease job opportunities here at home. It will benefit American firms \nin many sectors, including those in the banking/financial industry and \nin professional services. Under the agreement, 100 percent of U.S. \ngoods and 92 percent of Singaporean goods will have duty-free status \nimmediately. The free trade agreement further ensures that Singapore \ncannot increase its duties on any U.S. product.\n\n  The U.S.-Chile Free Trade agreement will be the first between the \nU.S. and a South American nation. Under this agreement, American \nfarmers, workers, and businesses will benefit from improved and \nexpanded access to the Chilean market. More than 75 percent of U.S. \nfarm goods will enter Chile tariff-free within 4 years, with all \ntariffs being phased out within 12 years. This agreement will eliminate \ntariffs on corn and most distilled spirits in 2 years. It will \nimmediately eliminate tariffs on pork and pork products, soybeans, and \nmany other agricultural products. Access for beef on both sides will be \ncompletely liberalized over 4 years. Overall, this agreement will \nimmediately remove tariffs on more than 85 percent of U.S. exports. The \nU.S.-Chile agreement will provide momentum to the ongoing negotiations \nin the Free Trade of the Americas and global trade talks. Bilateral \nagreements, such as this agreement with Chile, are essential because \nthey provide benefits immediately and help the U.S. keep pace with the \n16 global competitors, including the EU and Canada, who already have \npreferential trade agreements with Chile.\n  Free trade provides the basis for economic growth and democratic \ngovernance in developing countries. Free trade promotes American values \naround the world. It underpins a global economic order that is \nessential to our own economic security. Agreements like those before us \ntoday will help the U.S. to reap the benefits of free trade and gain \naccess to emerging markets, creating new jobs and higher incomes for \nAmericans. Ninety-six percents of the world's consumers are outside of \nU.S. borders. Foreign market access is essential for the continued \ngrowth and viability of the U.S. economy. International trade is an \nessential component of growth and opportunity in our global economy. \nThe U.S. must be a leader, not a follower, in the global marketplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Chile and Singapore Free \nTrade Agreements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10040-3", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10040-S10041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE BEGINNING FARMERS AND RANCHERS TAX INCENTIVE ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I recently joined Senator Hagel of \nNebraska in introducing legislation that is important to the survival \nof farm families and rural America. Our bipartisan legislation, called \nthe Beginning Farmers and Ranchers Tax Incentive Act, provides \nsignificant capital gains tax breaks to encourage retiring farmers and \nranchers to sell their farm property to others who will continue to use \nthe property in the farming business. Identical legislation has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives.\n  As many of our colleagues know, the economic well-being of many rural \ncommunities across the country is at a crossroad. Over the past several \ndecades, jobs on family farms and in Main Street businesses in small \ntowns have been disappearing from the Nation's Heartland. Rural \ncommunities are facing an out-migration crisis of epic proportions. \nSenator Hagel and I have been working at the Federal level to adopt \nfiscal policies that will give rural America the tools and funding it \nneeds to reverse the out-migration problem. One of the challenges for \nstabilizing and revitalizing our rural communities is to ensure that \nthe Federal Government backs strong farm policies\n\n[[Page S10041]]\n\nthat support this generation and the next generation of family farmers.\n  A strong farm economy is critical to the survival of many rural \ncommunities over the long term. But the number of family farmers, who \nare the backbone of the agricultural sector, has been steadily \ndeclining over the course of the past century. In the 1930s, North \nDakota had over 85,000 farms. That number has dwindled to just 30,000 \nin 2002, the lowest number of farms in North Dakota's history.\n  More and more of our young people are leaving rural communities in \npursuit of jobs elsewhere and the remaining farmers are growing older. \nA recent report prepared by the Center for Rural Affairs found that \nalmost half of the Nation's farmers are age 55 or older. The already \nsmall number of farmers and ranchers under age 25 (about 1 percent of \nfarmers and ranchers) has dropped significantly in recent years. If we \ndon't act quickly to address the aging of the farm sector, the \nprospects for many farm communities appear bleak.\n  The Center's report found that one of the major impediments to \nindividuals who want to start a farm or ranch is the cost of land and \nother farm property. The legislation that Senator Hagel and I have \nintroduced speaks to this issue by providing substantial capital gains \ntax incentives for farmers and ranchers who are retiring or forced to \nget out of farming to sell their farm operations to beginning farmers \nand ranchers or others who will continue to use the property in \nfarming. Because of the extra benefit the retiring farmer would receive \nfor selling to a first-time farmer, for example, he or she could accept \na lower price from such a buyer and still come out ahead economically \nas compared to a sale that would otherwise take the land out of \nagricultural use.\n  Specifically, our legislation allows farmers and ranchers to exclude \nup to $500,000 in capital gains that are derived from the sale of \nqualifying farm or ranch property over their lifetime. The benefit of \nthe capital gains tax exclusion provided by this legislation is greater \nfor the sale of such property to first-time farmers and ranchers or to \nothers who continue to use such property for farming purposes. To \nencourage farm sales to beginning farmers, this legislation provides a \n100-percent exclusion from gross income of the long-term capital gain \nfrom the sale of qualifying farm property to a first-time farmer who \ncertifies that he or she will use the property for farm purposes for at \nleast 10 years. Our bill also provides a 50-percent exclusion from \ngross income of the long-term capital gain from the sale of farm \nproperty to any other person who certifies that the property will be \nused for farm purposes for at least 10 years. Finally, this legislation \nprovides a 25-percent exclusion from gross income of long-term capital \ngain from the sale of such property to any other person for any other \nuse.\n  If anytime within 10 years after the sale, the property benefiting \nfrom the 100-percent or 50-percent capital gains exclusion is disposed \nof or ceases to be used as a farm for farming purposes, then a penalty \nshall be imposed as a proxy for recapturing the capital gains tax \nbenefit. However, the penalty for disposition or cessation of the use \nof qualifying property as a farm for farming purposes may be waived by \nthe Secretary of the Treasury in the case of hardship.\n  Senator Hagel and I believe that if we are going to deal with the \neconomic problems facing much of rural America that we must ensure that \ntax and other Federal policies are in place to encourage a new \ngeneration of young people to enter into farming and ranching. This \nlegislation should help in this endeavor and we urge our colleagues to \nsupport our effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10041-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BUNNING.

His selfless \ncommitment to entertaining the men and women of our Armed Forces was \nunmatched. In 1997, Congress voted to recognize Bob Hope as an honorary \nveteran.

Mr. President, I want to share with my fellow \ncolleagues an article written by the best selling author and investor \nJim Rogers. Mr. Rogers has been dubbed the ``Indiana Jones of \ninvesting'' and has earned himself a reputation for being one of the \nworld's leading economic minds.\n  In this article, Mr. Rogers does something that I have found rare \nwhen it comes to examining Chairman Greenspan's record. He actually \nlooks at the Chairman's monetary stances throughout his tenure at the \nFederal Reserve and examines what kind of effect they had on the \neconomy. In most cases, Mr. Rogers finds that Mr. Greenspan's policies \nwere ill-timed or simply economically absurd. I urge my colleagues to \nread this article so that we may better understand the role the Federal \nReserve and Chairman Greenspan specifically have played in our economic \nwell-being.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    For Whom the Closing Bell Tolls\n\n       At a recent symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank \n     of Kansas City in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Alan Greenspan \n     reflected on causes of the stock market bubble that grew at \n     the end of the 20th century. He discussed how difficult it \n     was to recognize when a bubble began and how anything he \n     could have done as Federal Reserve chairman would have only \n     made matters worse for the economy at the time.\n       ``Bubbles,'' Greenspan said toward the end of his speech, \n     ``thus appear to primarily reflect exuberance on the part of \n     investors in pricing financial assets . . . Bubbles appear to \n     emerge when investors either overestimate the sustainable \n     rise in profits or unrealistically lower the rate of discount \n     they apply to expected profits and dividends.'' He said he \n     did not know there was a bubble and could have done nothing \n     even if he had figured out there was a mania. I wonder if he \n     really believes that. Even my mother knows there was a \n     bubble. Is he a charlatan or a foot? Perhaps both as we will \n     see from his own earlier words and deeds.\n       I've got news for you, Alan: This stock market bubble was \n     yours and could have been prevented. It didn't have to \n     happen. Don't go blaming investors for so-called exuberance. \n     Irrational or rational. The only one who has acted \n     irrationally, it seems to me, is you. You could have \n     prevented it in the first place and certainly could have \n     stopped the bleeding a long time ago.\n       I know, I know. This is not the way people want to think \n     about Alan Greenspan. The way people often talk about him, \n     you'd think he was up for sainthood. Back in 1999, Time \n     magazine nominated him to the ``committee to save the \n     world.'' Legendary journalist Bob Woodward wrote a flattering \n     book about Greenspan called ``Maestro.'' Senator Phil Gramm \n     of Texas called him the greatest central banker of all time. \n     Even the Queen of England recently added her voice, knighting \n     Greenspan and saying that Sir Alan has brought ``economic \n     stability to the world.'' I guess she didn't notice that \n     there have been at least five major financial crises in the \n     past eight years with perhaps more on the horizon.\n       Could someone please give me the phone number of Alan \n     Greenspan's public relations firm? Actually it was down in \n     the board rooms of investment firms who used him to coin \n     money, but even they have caught on by now.\n\n[[Page S10042]]\n\n       Our current master of monetary policy has been at the helm \n     since 1987, one of the longest-running tenures of any Fed \n     chairman. Four different presidents--a Democrat and three \n     Republicans--have held court at the White House, but Alan \n     himself remained safely ensconced about a mile away at the \n     Fed. I'm the first to agree that Alan Greenspan has had a \n     tremendous impact on our economy. It's just the facts and \n     reality of his tenure that will look horrible to historians. \n     Looking back over his career in the past decade and a half, \n     it's pretty clear he made major mistakes that have gotten \n     this country into a huge economic bind today.\n       Hindsight, as the saying goes, gives us 20-20 vision, but \n     it does something else: it usually tells us the truth, even \n     if it's a little late to correct the mistakes.\n       In the long run, history's going to remember Greenspan as \n     the man who caused the stock market bubble and worse. If he \n     doesn't change his monetary policy, he'll also be remembered \n     as the man who created other bubbles to follow in its wake.\n       Let's take a step back in time and take a little history \n     lesson. Think back to the gravy days of the 1990s. From 1992 \n     to 1997, the S 500 soared 130 percent, or roughly 27 \n     percent annually. It was the biggest bull market that many of \n     us who'd been in the business for years had ever seen. All \n     the economic indicators were pointing the right direction: \n     Unemployment was down, manufacturing hours were up. Corporate \n     profits rose about 120 percent over that period. The trade \n     deficit wasn't ballooning at its typical breakneck pace. The \n     Japanese Central Bank was flooding the world with money so we \n     had an unusually good period so far, but nothing too \n     dangerous here. These were good days for the country and the \n     Maestro began taking the credit.\n       But here's the funny thing about the stock market, \n     something even the most educated investors seem to forget \n     when the going gets good: the stock market and economies move \n     in cycles. It's just the way it goes. Don't take it \n     personally. Markets have always done it; they always will. \n     (Alan, are you listening?) A lot of people hoped the stock \n     market had gone to a new, special place, that cosmic zone \n     where stocks never go down. They continue to rise and we all \n     get rich. The New Economy, I believe it was called--somewhat \n     reminiscent of the New Era of the 1920s.\n       Well, we all know what happened to that myth. Corporate \n     profits, we now know, peaked in 1997 and started to decline. \n     Manufacturing hours were down. In the fall of 1997, the stock \n     market, in turn, started to dip. Remember the other key thing \n     about the stock market: It anticipates the future. It looks \n     ahead. In other words, the stock market was recognizing that \n     1998 might not be a banner year for profits. When companies \n     don't earn as much, their stock loses value. It's reality. \n     Forget the Amazons: you need earnings to keep your \n     stock price up.\n       But in the fall of 1997, something happened. We caught the \n     flu, the Asian flu. Several key Asian economies, including \n     Thailand and Malaysia, were the first to suffer when \n     economies started heading down. Again, this was nothing \n     unusual in economic cycles; marginal countries and companies \n     always get caught first when declines begin. There is often \n     an ``event'' which signals the normal end to bull markets, \n     but the simple reality always is that it is time for that \n     bull run to end for whatever reason. Schumpeter showed that \n     instability is one of the strengths of capitalism. There is \n     always destruction upon which the dynamic thrive and create \n     for future growth. But it was bad news for major investment \n     firms like Goldman Sachs and Fidelity who'd invested tons of \n     money, through loans, bonds, and other financial instruments, \n     in these countries. The phones started ringing in Washington. \n     Who came to the rescue? Sir Alan. Greenspan started printing \n     money and extending credit, pumping liquidity into the U.S. \n     economy to make sure that the problems in the East wouldn't \n     rock his friends in the West.\n       To me, this was a pivotal moment in Greenspan's career and \n     a problematic decision. He should have let the markets \n     correct themselves as they were already trying to do. Stocks \n     would have fallen. Companies would have been hurt or possibly \n     destroyed by the normal, economic decline. There would have \n     been a bear market, panic and a selling climax. Many \n     investors would have lost money. But that's what bear markets \n     often do: they chasten those who get a little too greedy. As \n     the late Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin once put it, \n     the central bankers' job has always been to take away the \n     punch bowl just when the party gets going. They have to step \n     on the brakes before things get out of control. It's no \n     wonder Martin held the position of Fed chairman from 1951-\n     1970, longer than any one else in history.\n       The problem is that Greenspan didn't take away the punch \n     bowl or even let it empty naturally. He just kept pouring \n     more into it. He overrode what would have been normal stock-\n     market behavior. The same process repeated itself over the \n     next three years. In the fall of 1998, it was the Russian \n     collapse and the fall of the legendary hedge fund Long-Term \n     Capital Investment. The stock market was already in trouble: \n     roughly 60 percent of all stocks were down in 1998 and \n     decliners also outnumbered advancers in 1999, even with \n     Greenspan's pumping. Remember profits had already peaked in \n     1997 and were in decline. The LTCM crisis probably would have \n     been the normal selling climax for the bear market which had \n     begun the year before, but the Maestro kept the presses \n     running. After all, he was getting panic calls from his Wall-\n     Street friends who feared some would fail. Again, it was just \n     the normal workings--more creative destruction--of financial \n     markets, but Greenspan has never really understood markets. \n     In 1999, it was Y2K.\n       All along, Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve was pumping out \n     cash and extending credit, helping to float the U.S. economy. \n     From 1997 to 2001, M3, a broad measure of the money supply \n     that includes all currency in circulation, and liquid assets \n     like bank deposits, money-market mutual funds and time \n     deposits, grew 48 percent, the fastest it's ever grown. \n     Greenspan pumped roughly $2.6 trillion into the economy, \n     adding fuel to the fire Off-balance-sheet debt and \n     derivatives rose 185 percent to $59 trillion while non-\n     government debt rose 52 percent. In 1997, syndicated loans \n     totaled $423 billion. By June 2002, they were up 64 percent \n     to $692 billion. Our foreign debts skyrocketed. Remember this \n     was in a period when profits were declining steadily after a \n     long climb from 1992 to 1997. Greenspan was trying to \n     override normal economic history and laws for some reason.\n       Why did he do it? Why didn't he let the markets simply \n     correct themselves? I'm not sure. From what he said in \n     Wyoming, it appears he thought he was doing the right thing. \n     My guess is he was also doing it to appease his friends on \n     Wall Street who went into a panic when the markets began \n     normal declines. After all, these are the people who are \n     always singing his praise. Heck, I'd praise him too if he \n     kept bailing me out of the poorhouse.\n       It may well be that he too was eventually swept up in the \n     fantasies he was creating. After all, on Feb. 17, 2000, he \n     said, ``Security analysts' projections of long-term earnings, \n     an indicator of expectations of company productivity, \n     continued to be revised upward in January, extending a string \n     of upward revisions that began in early 1995. One result of \n     this remarkable economic performance has been a pronounced \n     increased in living standards for the majority of Americans. \n     Another has been a labor market that has provided job \n     opportunities for large numbers of people previously \n     struggling to get on the first rung of a ladder leading to \n     training, skills, and permanent employment.''\n       He seems to have actually believed all the New Economy \n     stuff we now know was garbage. Our Maestro was relying on \n     Jack Grubman, Mary Meeker, Abby Cohen, and Henry Blodget to \n     justify his credit pumps.\n       Remember how he began marveling at the ``remarkable wave of \n     new technologies'' and a ``once-in-a-century acceleration of \n     innovation'' and ``a pivotal period of economic history'' \n     where ``I see nothing to suggest these opportunities [of high \n     rate of return productivity enhancing investments] will peter \n     out any time soon'' in 2000? He went on to tell Congress on \n     Feb. 13, 2001: ``From all indications, however, technological \n     advance still is going forward at a rapid pace, and \n     investment will likely pick up again if, as expected, the \n     expansion of the economy gets back on more solid footing. \n     Private analysts are still suggesting the current \n     sluggishness of the economy has not undermined perceptions of \n     favorable long-term fundamental.'' Now we know this \n     ``Maestro'' was relying on Wall Street ``analysts'' and \n     bubblevision for his ``genius.'' It is bad enough he \n     listened, but he actually believed all this hype.\n       On Jan. 25, 2001, he explained to Congress on that budget \n     surpluses would continue for years because of the ``the \n     extraordinary pickup in the growth of labor productivity \n     experienced in this country since the mid-1990s.'' He went on \n     to marvel at the ``structural productivity growth.'' You \n     would think someone with the brains and ability to ``save the \n     world'' would remember what happened ``once in a century'' in \n     1917-1927 when electricity, automobiles, airplanes, \n     telephones, radio, wireless, refrigeration and several other \n     things came together to generate productivity growth over \n     twice as high as under Dr. Greenspan. Even in the 1950s and \n     1960s, U.S. productivity grew more than 60 percent faster \n     than during the mania he was creating and justifying as \n     ``once in a century.''\n       Now we all make mistakes, but most do not have PR machines \n     calling us maestros when we are actually just selling snake \n     oil. He began by trying to bail out his old cronies and then \n     by trying to override a normal bear market. The more money he \n     printed and the more credit he created, the deeper we all \n     got. Then he started believing Time [who also named the CEO \n     of Amazon as Man of the Year a few months later] and the \n     Washington Post. Everyone loves a bubble, so few wanted to \n     know the Emperor actually had no clothes, especially when the \n     party seemed to be getting better and better. The few \n     Cassandras were ignored again.\n       As we know, even Alan Greenspan couldn't stop the stock \n     market from correcting itself in the end. Bubbles all work \n     the same way. They eventually pop. In his speech in Wyoming, \n     Greespan said the Fed was ``confronted with forces that none \n     of us had personnally experienced.'' That's just not true. \n     There have been plenty of bubbles in his experience, from the \n     stock-market bubble of the 1960s to the Kuwait Stock Exchange \n     bubble in the 1970s to gold and silver two decades ago to the \n     Texas real-estate bubble of 1980s to the Japanese bubble to \n     the S/junk-bond bubble. Evidently history does not mean \n     much to our wise Maestro since there are also numerous \n     descriptions of past bubbles\n\n[[Page S10043]]\n\n     and how they have always worked. You'd think someone with \n     the ability ``to save the world'' would have read a few \n     books about markets.\n       The problem is the glut of money and credit that has been \n     poured into the U.S. economy has created a host of new \n     problems. The U.S. Government's fiscal budget is now in huge \n     deficit because so many projections were based on revenues \n     from capital-gains taxes that won't be realized. Employee \n     401(k) plans are in the dumps, insurance companies, pension \n     plans, whether they are corporate or government, are in \n     trouble, some in danger of disappearing. Social Security and \n     Medicare are certain to suffer in the long run.\n       It's caused problems on a corporate level as well. All the \n     easy credit that's available is propping up companies that \n     are basically zombies, companies that should have long gone \n     out of business (read: Lucent?) to cleanse the system for the \n     survivors. My guess is many of the corporate accounting \n     problems now surfacing might not have happened if Greenspan \n     had allowed the stock market to correct itself as profits \n     declined. After all, he kept creating credit to prolong the \n     bubble so companies played the stock-market game to keep \n     their stocks and options participating.\n       Greenspan could have raised margin requirements--the \n     ability to buy equities on credit--during all this to control \n     the animal spirits loosened by his credit machine. He is even \n     on record in 1996 stating: ``I recognize there is a stock-\n     market bubble problem at this point.'' He went on to say: \n     ``We do have the possibility of raising major concerns by \n     increasing margin requirements. I guarantee that if you want \n     to get rid of the bubble, whatever it is, that will do it.'' \n     He was dead right. If he had followed through, many of these \n     companies wouldn't have been jiggering the books when times \n     got tough.\n       More important, Greenspan's reaction with regard to the \n     stock-market bubble has caused two more bubbles to grow: a \n     real-estate bubble and a consumer-debt bubble. Faithful \n     readers know I believe the real-estate market will pop within \n     a year or so. Many investors have simply transferred their \n     assets from the stock market to the real estate market, \n     thinking they can get rich quickly. Greenspan himself is \n     certainly helping the effort, lowering interest rates 11 \n     times in the last two years along, allowing homeowners to \n     refinance their mortgages, often borrowing even more money, \n     without raising their monthly payments. This might be fine if \n     people were using the money to pay off their credit cards and \n     car loans and other debts, but that doesn't appear to be \n     true. Consumer-debt levels continue to soar as people take \n     money from their homes and spend rather than lower debt or \n     save. The U.S. savings rate, after all, is roughly 1 percent, \n     one of the lowest in the world. A consumer-debt bubble is \n     building and it will devastate many people when it bursts. \n     Our Maestro is on record as saying this use of more \n     unsustainable, non-productive credit is a sound basis for \n     keeping the economy humming. I fail to see how pouring more \n     debt into our houses which only produce more negative cash \n     flow will save us down the road.\n       What would I do? I'm not the Federal Reserve chairman and \n     it's not a job I'd want. That said, I wouldn't keep forcing \n     lower interest rates. Way back when, before the central bank \n     got involved, interest rates used to set themselves. If \n     people borrowed a lot of money, rates were higher. If people \n     didn't borrow money, rates fell. Why shouldn't it be any \n     different now? The rest of the world is following these \n     eternal verities these days. Plus, I'd aggressively encourage \n     people to pay down their debt and start saving. Our system \n     discourages saving and investing, but encourages consumption. \n     The only way to make it through the hard times is if you've \n     prepared for them. The U.S. desperately needs more saving and \n     investment, not more SUVs and vacations in the casinos. We \n     need to let inefficient companies fail to clean out \n     the system. Japan over the past decade has proved that for \n     all of us. Greenspan has even talked of Japan's ``ensuring \n     failures of policy.'' We need to build future \n     productivity, not more bubbles. Hopefully, it's not too \n     late.\n       Greenspan is up for reappointment in 2004. He's already \n     lobbying to be reelected, hoping to surpass the last William \n     McChesny Martin as the longest-running Federal Reserve \n     chairman in history. He shouldn't be reappointed. By then, \n     things may be so bad that even he won't be able to hide what \n     he's done. In his recent speech in Wyoming, Greenspan said, \n     ``As history attests, investors too often exaggerate the \n     extent of the improvement in economic fundamentals.'' Boy, \n     did he speak from the heart and get that right, although he \n     was trying to blame others for his mistakes. But who can \n     blame investors for their rose-colored glasses when the \n     Federal Reserve chairman--the man who allegedly makes the \n     most important financial decisions for the entire nation--\n     ignores history in order to protect his friends and his \n     legacy?\n       On Sept. 25, 2002, Greenspan told a group of economists \n     again not to worry about his approach of sustaining the \n     economy with a new housing ad consumption base with more \n     credit piled on top of the huge debt increase of 1997-2001. \n     He is getting in deeper while still trying to override normal \n     economic history and rules. He said, ``These episodes suggest \n     a market increase over the past two or three decades in the \n     ability of modern economics to absorb shocks.'' We do not \n     need to worry he said because the world economy ``has become \n     more flexible.'' He is now a believer once again--in a New \n     Flexibility.\n       Among the most dangerous words in the world are: ``It is \n     different this time.'' The Maestro still believes once again \n     that things are now different. History will judge him one of \n     the worst Central Bankers ever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10043-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  EARTH RESOURCES OBSERVATION SYSTEMS DATA CENTER CELEBRATES 30 YEARS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise \ntoday to congratulate the Earth Resources Observation Systems, EROS, \nData Center in Sioux Falls, SD, which will hold its 30th anniversary \ncelebration on Tuesday, September 30, 2003.\n  Opened in the early seventies, the EROS Data Center was staffed by \nonly a handful of people and the largest mainframe computer in the \nState of South Dakota. Thirty years later, the EROS Data Center has \ngrown to an organization with over 600 employees and they are \nresponsible for supplying data to a worldwide community of users. \nScholars, engineers, and land managers use their data to study a \ngrowing list of environmental issues such as resource development, \nglobal change, and land use planning. In addition to maintaining Earth \nscience data, EROS scientists are working constantly to discover new \nways to utilize this information.\n  Within the EROS Data Center lies a computer room that was associated \nwith NASA's Earth Science Enterprise initiative. The robotic mass \nstorage systems within this room hold approximately 920,000 separate \nimages and make much of the EROS Data Center's NASA satellite \ninformation immediately available to scientists working at desktop \nworkstations in both South Dakota and around the world. A major part of \nNASA's Earth Science Enterprise initiative is the Earth observing \nsystem which will collect data required to measure changes in the Earth \nsystem. Beginning in 1999, and running for at least the next 15 years, \nThe EOS will collect data through a series of satellites and field \nexperiments to observe the Earth. In addition, since 1991, the EROS \nData Center has supported the United Nations environment programme/\nglobal resources information database making environmental data \navailable to developing countries.\n  While the EROS Data Center's mission has changed and grown over the \nyears, its original mission, which was to receive, process, and \ndistribute data collected and transmitted, still holds true. It is my \nbelief that the center will keep on growing and continue to make a \nlarge impact within the Department of the Interior. As a small state, \nSouth Dakota can be extremely proud of the impact such a center has not \nonly on the State but on the United States and other nations.\n  I am proud to have this opportunity to honor the EROS Data Center for \nits 30 years of outstanding service. It is an honor for me to share \nwith my colleagues the exemplary leadership and strong commitment to \ndata management and research the EROS Data Center has provided. I \nstrongly commend their years of hard work and dedication, and I am very \npleased that their substantial efforts are being publicly honored and \ncelebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10043-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10043-S10044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEVIN A.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Kevin A. \nPope, of Waterford, Connecticut, who passed away on July 14, 2003 at \nthe age of 53.\n  I join all those who knew Kevin Pope in expressing my sadness at his \nuntimely passing, and extending my deepest sympathies to his wife \nDonna, their two sons Jeffrey and Jason, their grandchildren, and \nKevin's entire family.\n  In an age when so many of us move around from place to place, Kevin \nwas a true Connecticut son--he was born in our state, grew up there, \ngot married and raised children there, and lived there until his \nunexpected passing last week.\n  Kevin was a devoted husband and father to his two sons and was a \nvital member of the Waterford community. He was especially active in \nyouth sports in Waterford, coaching Little League and Babe Ruth \nbaseball and Preteen Basketball, umpiring baseball,\n\n[[Page S10044]]\n\nsoftball, and basketball games, and working with the ``Chain Gang'' at \nWaterford High School football games. He was also a member of the \nWaterford Democratic Town Committee and the New London Lodge of Elks, \nand was the president of the New London Central Labor Union.\n  I met Kevin through his association with the International \nAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, where, since 1990, he \nwas a Grand Lodge Representative serving not only Connecticut, but New \nYork, New Jersey, and all of New England. I am grateful for all of the \noccasions that we had to work together, and I especially appreciate the \nsupport he gave me over the years.\n  Kevin was a loyal union man since joining the IAM while working for \nGeneral Dynamics in 1969. He earned respect throughout Connecticut and \nthe Northeast for standing up for the rights and interests of workers. \nHe was known as a good leader, and a skilled and effective negotiator \nas well. There are so many people in factories across the Northeast, \nand nationwide, who have never met Kevin Pope, but their lives are \nbetter off today because of his efforts.\n  Kevin represented the best of the State of Connecticut. I know I \nspeak for a great many people in Connecticut when I say that he was \ntaken from us much too soon.\n  Once again, my thoughts and prayers go out to Kevin's family, his \nfriends, and his colleagues. We will all miss him very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10044-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MARKING THE SERVICE OF JOHN ALEXANDER ANDERSON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to express my appreciation to \nJohn Alexander Anderson, my senior policy advisor. John has been an \nimportant member of my staff. His counsel and efforts will be missed.\n  As my senior advisor on banking, finance, trade, and transportation \nissues, John managed policy initiatives and assisted me on numerous \nlegislative accomplishments. He was also my liaison to the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  John has been a tireless advocate for policies that promote economic \ngrowth, sound government, and financial deregulation. He has a keen \ncomprehension of banking law and understands its impact on markets, \ninvestments, and business decisions. He has helped me fight numerous \nunsound financial initiatives, such as our recent success in protecting \nderivatives products from unnecessary Federal regulation. He has always \nbeen a critical advocate of good policy, including lowering Federal \ntaxes and implementing market-opening trade agreements.\n  Prior to joining my staff, John served as a legislative assistant to \nRepresentative Jack Metcalf of Washington. Before his tenure with \nCongressman Metcalf, John worked for the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Beyond his professional qualifications, John has an astute political \nsense and outstanding personal qualities. His loyalty, intellectual \nindependence, talent for reaching consensus and his tactical ability to \nrealize desired outcomes are all characteristics recognized and admired \nby his peers. He shares my political philosophy and commitment to the \nprinciples of limited government and open markets.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about some \nOregonians who are real leaders in environmental stewardship, the \nBailey family of The Dalles, OR. Their family-owned and operated cherry \noperation, Orchard View Farms, is renowned for its high standards, both \nin product quality and in environmental management. Orchard View Farms \nwas established in 1923 in the heart of Oregon's cherry growing region, \nthe mid-Columbia Gorge area nestled in the foothills of Mt. Hood.\n  The Baileys have worked hard to ensure their operation is a good \nneighbor the environment and the surrounding community. They have \nchampioned the Mid-Columbia cherry Integrated Fruit Program, a total \nfarm conservation plan that is modeled on a similar program in northern \nItaly. The Integrated Fruit Program, or IFP, encompasses all aspects of \nfruit production, from growing to packing and marketing. IFP emphasizes \nhigh quality fruit production that is economical for the grower and has \na minimal impact to the environment. This requires careful placement of \norchard plants, close monitoring of soil moisture levels and nutrients \nto avoid unnecessary irrigation or excess fertilizers. There is also an \nemphasis on non-chemical means of controlling plant pests and disease. \nThe end result is more than 3000 tons of Ranier and Bing cherries that \nthe Baileys ship to markets across the country and to Europe and Asia \nevery year. Their accomplishments have not gone unnoticed by the farm \nconservation community--the American Farmland Trust recognized the \nBailey family last year with its prestigious Steward of the Land Award.\n  In addition to their important work in the area of farm conservation, \nthe Baileys have also worked closely with my office in the past on the \nchallenging problem of reforming the agricultural guest worker program.\n  I am speaking about Orchard View Farms today to remind my colleagues \nthat every day farm families like the Baileys are working hard to make \na living in farming, ranching, or forestry in a way that is good for \ntheir community and good for the environment. They take their \nstewardship responsibilities seriously and deserve our commendation for \nadhering to these principles, especially in a time of unprecedented \neconomic challenges for farmers in the form of increasing food imports \nand numerous regulatory mandates.

Their \nefforts have not gone unnoticed.\n  Through the leadership of Scott County Fire Chief Billy Willhoite, \nthe amount of full-time firefighters over the past 10 years has \ndoubled. The efforts of full-time and volunteer firefighters alike \nalong with increased investment in manpower, equipment, training, and \nfacilities, have enabled the department to make great strides in \nserving their fellow Kentuckians. Billy Willhoite's 29 years of \nexperience as a firefighter, 25 of which were as chief, have enabled \nhim to shape the personnel of the Scott County Fire Department to make \ngreat strides in their firefighting capabilities.\n  While funding is a significant component to fire protection, no \ndollar sign can be placed on the bravery, courage, and commitment \ninherent of those who put themselves into harm's way to protect those \nin danger. The firefighters of the Scott County Fire Department are \nheroes to so many and deserve our gratitude. At a moment's notice, they \ncan be relied upon to respond to any emergency regardless of the \ncircumstances to assure the safety of those in need.\n  As our Nation takes measures to strengthen our homeland security, it \nwill be imperative that fire departments throughout Kentucky and across \nAmerica follow the example of the Scott County Fire Department and \nadapt to improve fire protection services. I am proud of their efforts \nand am grateful for how well they have represented the Commonwealth. I \nthank the Senate for allowing me to recognize the Scott County Fire \nDepartment and its personnel for their service to their community and \nto our Nation. They are Kentucky at its finest.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10045-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10045]]\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:03 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of the reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment.\n\n       S. 1015.

A bill to facilitate the transfer of land in the State of \nAlaska, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague, Senator Ted Stevens, in introducing this very important \nlegislation.\n  The Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act of 2003 will transfer \nmillions of acres of land to Alaska Natives, the State of Alaska and to \nNative Corporations by 2009. The Federal agencies in Alaska have \nmanagement jurisdiction of over 63 percent of the State. It is time to \ntransfer these public lands from Federal Government control to private \nownership. This legislation creates a strategic plan for the Bureau of \nLand Management to finally resolve long-standing land survey, land \nentitlement issues and land claim issues, some of which date back to \n1906. Since 1906 Congress has enacted other legislation that requires \nthe BLM to transfer public lands to Alaska Natives, the State of Alaska \nand to the Alaska Native Corporations.\n  The land conveyance program is the largest and most complex of any in \nUnited States history. For many years, BLM's primary goal was to convey \ntitle to unsurveyed lands to the State\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\nand Native Corporations by tentative approval and interim conveyance \nrespectively. This management practice allowed the State and Native \nCorporations to manage their lands subject only to the survey of the \nfinal boundaries.\n  This legislation will accelerate release of lands for conveyance to \nNative corporations and the State of Alaska. It will complete land \npatterns to allow land owners to more efficiently manager their land. \nIt will clarify that certain minerals can be transferred to Native \nlandowners. And frankly, split estates can be minimized. The University \nwill be given the opportunity to select the remaining Federal interests \nin lands the University already owns, that will likely produce economic \nopportunities not presently available under this land lock.\n  The complexity of land patterns and uses in Alaska is evident in the \npresence of Federal mining claims that are within lands owned or \nselected by the State of Alaska. Our legislation would clarify miners' \nright to convert from Federal to State claims without jeopardizing \nongoing mining operations. At the same time, BLM would be allowed to \nexpedite conveyances to the State. Properly maintained Federal claims \nwill continue to be excluded from conveyance. Entitlements to the State \nwill remain secure. The miner will decide when or whether to convert \nhis claims to State claims.\n  For too many years, individuals, Native corporations and the State \nhave been patiently waiting to receive title to their land. In 1958 the \nState of Alaska was promised 104 million acres of land, and has to date \nreceived final title to only 42 million acres; less than half of what \nis due. Of the 44 million acres of land that the Native Corporations \nare entitled to, only about a third has been conveyed or about 15 \nmillion acres. Worse yet, are the 2500 parcels pending title to Native \nindividuals out of 16000 parcels. Almost 14000 parcels are still \nawaiting basic adjudication to even make a determination of land \ntransfer. Too much land is hanging in the balance that must be surveyed \nand patented to rightful owners. Between now and the sunset of this \nbill in 2009, more than 89 million acres must be surveyed on State and \nNative Corporation lands. The lands that are awaiting survey do not \ninclude lands that will eventually be titled to Native individuals; \nthese lands too must first be surveyed.\n  While some Native allotments have been conveyed, issues have arisen \nto challenge final conveyance to the land. Such challenges have \nincluded whether actual use of the land occurred; the location of the \nparcel; or even who should receive title to the land. Sadly, some of \nthe original Native allotment applicants have died waiting to receive \ntitle or have disputes resolved. Oftentimes, the death of an applicant \ncan present the agency with chain of title questions to determine who \nthe rightful heir is, causing further delays to getting the lands \ntransferred.\n\n  Some disputes have been easier to handle than others, resulting in \nsettlement through an administrative appeals process. The Federal \nagencies have been hampered by many administrative and legal obstacles. \nThere have been court decisions and lawsuit settlements, new \nlegislation creating new rights or changing rules midstream. Old cases \nhave been reopened that have created new land patterns for adjudication \nand survey. The administrative appeals process was designed to be \nefficient, and immediately accessible to individuals who believe they \nhave been adversely impacted by actions taken by the BLM. In too many \ninstances this process has resulted in long delays that hinder the BLM \nfrom finalizing its work. In the meantime, the applicant suffers at the \nhands of a process that generally takes years just for a case to be \nreviewed for resolution.\n  This legislation will provide the BLM with broader authority to \nsolving many of the problems associated with land claims affecting all \ndisputes that occur in Alaska. When disputes arise over the \nadjudication of land claims, BLM needs to have full authority to work \nin a more collaborative environment with its clientele.\n  This legislation will provide the BLM the opportunity to caucus with \nits clients. It will allow for a process of negotiation to gain \nconsensus on final resolution of land applications. What has been \nmissing all these years is the flexibility for the Federal agencies to \nwork in such a cooperative fashion. This new process is intended to be \nfree of complicated rules that have plagued the agency to finding \nsolutions. Resolution and closure must come quicker.\n  I give great credit to the management and the employees of the BLM \nAlaska for their efforts over the years to transfer the land. They have \nproven to be dedicated and committed public servants. I believe they \nhave tried to do the right thing; they just need the tools and the \nresources. They want to close the books on the Alaska conveyance \nprogram once and for all, and this bill will help them achieve that \ngoal by 2009.\n  In 1973 the Alaska Native Claims Appeal Board was established. The \nBoard had jurisdiction over decisions made under the Alaska Native \nClaim Settlement Act. The Board consisted of four judges, and was able \nto decide a case within three to six months of the close of briefing. \nIt usually had a small backlog. While the Board was able to act in a \nfairly responsive manner, there was criticism the Board did not \ncorrectly apply general Federal land law precedent and that some of \ntheir rulings were inconsistent with policy of the Department of the \nInterior. The Board was dissolved in 1981. The backlog of cases was not \nnecessarily attributed to Native Corporation cases; most of the backlog \nrelated to all other matters. This legislation will create a hearings \nand appeals process located in Alaska. Presently, there are almost 100 \nappeals of Alaska decisions pending before the Interior Board of Land \nAppeals. It usually takes this Board several years to rule on a case, \nsometimes as long as three to five years. The present process is \nbroken. There should never be a process that controls the fate of \nsomeone's livelihood. Matters requiring resolution must not sit and \nlanguish for years without resolution. This practice is unacceptable \nand unreasonable.\n  Additionally, more than twenty cases are pending before \nAdministrative Law judges at various Office of Hearings Appeals \noffices--Virginia, Minnesota and Utah. The cases currently in their \nhands are Native allotments and mining claims. Substantial delays have \nresulted from the slow pace of scheduling hearings in Alaska. \nEstablishing an Alaska hearings unit to handle all Alaska appeals would \nsignificantly speed up the current process. Such a new process would be \nable to routinely issue decisions within three to six months of the \nclose of briefing.\n  Challenges likely to emerge on land actions requiring judicial review \nwill be handled by judges located in Alaska. Moreover, having judges \nlocated in Alaska, conducting Alaska business, would ensure an \nunderstanding of the special laws that are applicable to Alaska. In \naddition, this process would include all land transfer matters, not \njust claims under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.\n  To achieve the acceleration of land conveyances, we must be able to \ncount on a consistent level of funding. We do not want any aspect of \nthe acceleration plan to be hampered. As I pointed out earlier, almost \n90 million acres must be surveyed between now and 2009. The BLM is the \nsingle agency of the Federal Government that is charged with the \nauthority and responsibility for surveys and land title record keeping. \nOfficial survey plats are the government's record of the boundaries of \nan area and the description of such surveyed land is known as the legal \nland description. Land title or patents are based on such plats of \nsurvey. And, until the land is surveyed, the Alaska Natives, the State \nof Alaska and the Native Corporations will still be waiting way off \ninto the future for this work to be finalized.\n  The Alaska Land Transfer Acceleration Act of 2003 imposes very strict \nprovisions on the agency to complete land conveyances by 2009 to Alaska \nNatives, the State of Alaska and to the Native Corporations. Some might \nview this plan as ambitious. I view it as being long overdue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Rio Grande Outstanding Natural Area \nin the State of Colorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ndesignate a stretch of the Rio Grande River as an Outstanding Natural \nArea. This Outstanding Natural Area designation is the hallmark of \nsuccessful partnerships between local landowners, farmers, governments \nand interested advocacy groups to develop a plan to preserve an \nimportant stretch of river and the southwest Willow Flycatcher, a \nfederally recognized endangered species.\n  The Rio Grande River and its tributaries rise in the San Juan \nMountains and flow into the San Luis Valley. The Valley, like so much \nof Colorado is dependent on snowmelt for water. In fact, the 600,000 \nacres of irrigated farm land within the Valley only get an average of \nseven inches of precipitation each year. It goes without saying that \nthe Rio Grande River is the lifeblood of the Valley for flora and fauna \nas well as thousands of farmers and landowners.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today is the product of careful \ncollaboration between interested stakeholder, including environmental \ngroups, landowners, farmers, and local governments. All of these \nparties recognized that in order to protect this important thirty-three \nmiles of watershed something had to be done. After much deliberation, \nall agreed that designating the stretch of River from the southern edge \nof the Alamosa National Wildlife Refuge to the New Mexico State line as \nan Outstanding Natural Area would be the best way to maintain this \ncritical reach.\n  This bill establishes a Commission made up of Federal, State, and \nlocal stakeholders who are charged with developing a management plan to \nrestore and protect the area. The Secretary of Interior must review and \napprove the plan. Upon approval, the Secretary of Interior would \nimplement the management plan, coordinating with State and local \ngovernments, and cooperating with land owners. Private landowners are \nencouraged to participate in the Commission.\n  As in much of the West, Rio Grande River's water is apportioned to \ndownstream states through interstate compact. Therefore, make no \nmistake; this bill does not include an implied or reserved water right.\n  The Outstanding Natural Area legislation that I am introducing today \nis supported by the local Boards of county Commissioners, the local \nwater user organizations, the local Cattlemen's Association, the \nenvironmental community, and affected private landowners along the \nRiver.\n  We often talk about bringing interested folks to the table to work \nout a cooperative solution to an issue. All too often, either people \ndon't come to the table or the discussions fail to bear fruit. This \nbill is a positive example of what can be accomplished when interested \nstakeholders come together in good faith and work toward a common goal. \nI am proud to introduce this legislation and continue that effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1467\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rio Grande Outstanding \n     Natural Area Act''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Preservation and restoration of the land in the Area \n     are required to preserve the Area's unique scientific, scenic \n     beauty, educational, and environmental values, including \n     unique land forms, scenic beauty, cultural sites, and \n     habitats used by various species of raptors and other birds, \n     mammals, reptiles, and amphibians.\n       (2) There are archaeological and historic sites in the Area \n     resulting from at least 10,000 years of use for subsistence \n     and commerce.\n       (3) The archaeological sites represent regional ancestry, \n     including Paleo-Indian and nomadic bands of Ute and Apache.\n       (4) The Area contains exceptional scenic values and \n     opportunities for wildlife viewing.\n       (5) Approximately 2,771 acres of land within the Area are \n     owned by the United States and administered by the Secretary, \n     acting through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management, \n     and approximately 7,885 acres of land within the Area are \n     owned by private landowners.\n       (6) The Area is located downstream from areas in Colorado \n     of significant and longstanding water development and use.\n       (7) The availability of water for use in Colorado is \n     governed, in significant part, by the Compact, which \n     obligates the State of Colorado to deliver certain quantities \n     of water to the Colorado-New Mexico State line for the \n     benefit of the States of New Mexico and Texas in accordance \n     with the terms of the Compact.\n       (8) Because of the allocations of water made by the Compact \n     to downstream States, the levels of use and development of \n     water in Colorado, and the unpredictable and seasonal nature \n     of the water supply, the Secretary shall manage the land \n     within the Area to accomplish the purposes of this Act \n     without asserting reserved water rights for instream flows or \n     appropriating or acquiring water rights for that purpose.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to conserve, \n     restore, and protect for future generations the natural, \n     ecological, historic, scenic, recreational, wildlife, and \n     environmental resources of the Area.\n\n      SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Head Start Act to provide grants to \nTribal Colleges and Universities to increase the number of post-\nsecondary degrees in early childhood education and related fields \nearned by Indian Head Start agency staff members, parents of children \nserved by such an agency, and members of the community involved; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tribal \nColleges and Universities/Head Start Partnership Act, on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Enzi, Daschle, Johnson, and Inouye.\n  As I am sure you all know, Head Start is the flagship Federal program \nthat insures that disadvantaged children have access to the \neducational, social, health, and behavioral services that they need in \norder to be ready to enter and excel in school. Studies clearly show \nthat Head Start is a strong and effective program and that children who \nenroll in it benefit from improved cognitive and social skills. \nAlthough Head Start is a model program, it can be even better. One \nfactor that we know is strongly related to student outcomes is teacher \nquality and education. Simply put, the more advanced the credentials of \nthe teacher, the better the outcomes for students.\n  In recognition of this fact, the 1998 Head Start reauthorization \nrequired that 50 percent of all Head Start teachers have at least an \nAssociate's Degree, AA, in early childhood or a related field by 2003. \nIn the impending reauthorization of Head Start, is it likely that \nteacher credential requirements will be increased even further.\n  Although across the Nation as a whole, the 50 percent AA degree \nrequirement for Head Start teachers has been met, there are some \nregions and sub-groups in the U.S. for which this is not the case. It \nis particularly difficult for Head Start teachers on Indian \nreservations, in rural areas, and those who teach migrants to access \nthe necessary educational opportunities. Often, the distance these \nindividuals would have to travel to take classes at the nearest college \nthat offers an early childhood education degree is simply prohibitive.\n  The purpose of the Tribal College and University/Head Start \nPartnership Act is to facilitate the continuing education of Native \nAmerican Head Start teachers so that they can obtain the credentials \nthey need to provide the best outcomes for the children under their \ncare. Nationally, only 14 percent of Native American Head Start \nteachers have an AA degree and a scant 7 percent have a BA degree or \nhigher.\n  The current Act is based on the ``Head Start Partnerships with \nTribally Controlled Land-Grant Colleges and Universities'' \ndiscretionary grants program at HHS. This program provided grants to 16 \ntribal universities and colleges during the period 1999-2001. The \npurpose of the program was to utilize the capabilities of these \ninstitutions of higher education to improve the quality of Head Start \nand Early Head Start programs funded through the American Indian \nPrograms Branch, primarily by providing education and training \nopportunities for Head Start staff. Partnership agreements provided \nacademic credits primarily toward Associate's or Bachelor's Degrees. \nSince the program began in 1999, 322 students have graduated from these \nprograms and an additional 59 are expected to graduate by the end of \n2003.\n  In my home State of New Mexico, Southwestern Indian Polytechnic \nInstitute, SIPI, received a 3-year grant of $150,000 per year. This \ngrant has supported the teaching of courses leading directly to an AA \ndegree in early childhood. There are roughly 125 declared majors, 90 \npercent of whom are Head Start teachers, enrolled in these classes each \nsemester, distributed across eleven reservations and pueblos in New \nMexico, the closest of which is 30 miles from the SIPI campus. Without \naccess to this type of distance education, these dedicated Head Start \nteachers would not be able to receive the education that is crucial to \nboth their own futures and to the lives of the many children they \nteach.\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n  Although the Head Start Partnerships discretionary grants program at \nHHS has been very successful, funding has been sporadic. No grants were \nawarded in 2001 and 2002. Although HHS just recently announced a new \ncompetition for these grants, it is unclear if new grants will also be \nawarded in future years. I believe that an authorized grants program \nwould be the best way to insure a steady and dependable source of \nfunding so that tribal Head Start teachers can obtain the education \nthat is so crucial to their success.\n  The TCU /Head Start Partnership Act would authorize 5-year grants to \nTCUs so that these institutions can develop programs resulting in \nincreased numbers of advanced degrees for tribal Head Start teachers, \nparticularly in technology mediated formats. The act authorizes \n$10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and such sums as may be necessary for \nfiscal years 2005-2008, in order to achieve these goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this extremely \nimportant program. At a time when we are rightfully demanding that Head \nStart teachers be highly credentialed, we must provide the supports \nthat are necessary to help teachers gain these credentials.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tribal Colleges and \n     Universities Head Start Partnership Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Head Start Act requires that 50 percent or more of \n     teachers nationwide in center-based Head Start programs must \n     have at least an associate degree in early childhood \n     education, or a field related to early childhood education, \n     by 2003.\n       (2) A goal of the Head Start Act is to ensure that all Head \n     Start programs nationwide will provide accredited continuing \n     education for Head Start staff that provides college or \n     university credit for such staff. However, Indian Head Start \n     programs are generally located in areas isolated from \n     mainstream colleges or universities where such credit can be \n     earned.\n       (3) The vast majority of the Nation's 34 Tribal Colleges \n     and Universities have early childhood education programs and, \n     of these, 32 are accredited, or designated candidates for \n     accreditation, by national accrediting associations.\n       (4) Tribal Colleges and Universities were created by \n     Indians for Indians primarily on rural and remote Indian \n     reservations, which were virtually excluded from the Nation's \n     system of higher education.\n       (5) Tribal Colleges and Universities are engaged community \n     institutions, offering higher education and continuing \n     education opportunities to individuals who otherwise might \n     find attaining such education impossible due to family \n     responsibilities, and financial and geographic barriers.\n       (6) Tribal Colleges and Universities have been more \n     successful than any other institutions of higher education in \n     educating Indians and helping to retain Indians in high-need \n     fields such as nursing and teaching. According to a 2000 \n     survey, over 80 percent of Tribal College and University \n     graduates go on to further higher education or become \n     employed in the local community.\n       (7) Through partnerships developed between Tribal Colleges \n     and Universities and Head Start programs nationwide--\n       (A) Indian Head Start agency personnel can gain greater \n     access to accredited college and university programs in their \n     career field;\n       (B) the knowledge, skills, and aptitude of those working at \n     Indian Head Start agencies will be increased, thus enabling \n     them to provide high quality and comprehensive services to \n     Indian children and their families; and\n       (C) the health, early childhood development, and school \n     readiness of Indian children will be improved as a result of \n     increased staff knowledge, skills, and aptitude.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) promote social competencies and school readiness in \n     Indian children; and\n       (2) provide high quality, accredited educational \n     opportunities to Indian Head Start agency staff so that they \n     can better deliver services that enhance the social and \n     cognitive development of low-income children through the \n     provision of health, educational, nutritional, social, and \n     other services to low-income children and their families.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Financial Literacy and education \nCoordinating Committee within the Department of the Treasury to improve \nthe state of financial literacy and education among American consumers; \nto the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Financial \nLiteracy and Education Coordinating Act of 2003. This legislation \ncreates an intergovernmental coordinating Committee whose goal is to \nimprove the financial decision making of all Americans by strengthening \neducation to raise financial literacy levels.\n  The phrase ``financial literacy'' is one we often hear but often do \nnot really understand. It is analogous in financial matters to basic \nliteracy--the ability to read and understand what is read--in our \neveryday lives. We are keenly aware from our efforts to improve our \nschools and raise our students' ability to read that there are higher \nand lower levels of literacy. Numerous statistical studies indicate \nthat in the field of personal finances, substantial numbers of people \nare financially illiterate. Among those who have some degree of \nliteracy, the vast majority are performing below what their `grade \nlevel' ought to be.\n  This bill addresses that problem. It reflects my long-standing \nconcern that inadequate knowledge of financial issues leaves our \nconsumers seriously vulnerable to exploitation, with devastating \nconsequences for them and their families. As Chairman of the Committee \non Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, during the last Congress, I \nchaired a series of hearings to examine the state of financial literacy \nand education throughout the Nation. The Committee received testimony \nfrom a wide range of witnesses on the state of financial literacy and \neducation among Americans of all ages and from all walks of life--from \nschool age children to retirees, small investors to those without bank \naccounts, and first time workers to those saving for retirement. The \nwitnesses were unanimous in the view that we needed to increase \nfinancial education in this country.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated before the Committee\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\nthat: ``In considering means to improve the financial status of \nfamilies, education can play a critical role by equipping consumers \nwith the knowledge required to make wise decisions. . . . This is \nespecially the case for populations that have traditionally been \nunderserved by our financial system.'' Chairman Greenspan made the \npoint that increased financial education has the potential to improve \nsignificantly the economic situation of the vast majority of Americans.\n  The goal of this legislation is to promote better financial decision-\nmaking among consumers. While at present substantial work is in \nprogress both within the government and outside of it, it suffers from \nthe lack of a single comprehensive strategy--there is too little \ncoordination, and too much duplication. As Tess Canja, President of \nAARP testified before the Committee: ``We see a need for a coherent and \ncoordinated national strategy for making available a well-researched \nand well-evaluated progression of financial literacy programs and \nservices.'' By creating an underlying strategy to address these \nproblems, the legislation will help enable Americans to make the \nfinancial decisions that best serve their needs and aspirations. This \nlegislation seeks to address these problems and create a strategy to \nimprove the financial choices and outcomes for all Americans.\n  The bill creates a Coordinating Committee chaired by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, based in the Treasury Department's Office of Financial \nEducation. The Committee will be responsible for coordinating and \ncentralizing the various existing financial education activities in our \ngovernment agencies as well as any future initiatives. Currently there \nare at least sixteen active financial-education programs. They operate \nin each of the Federal banking agencies--the Federal Reserve, FDIC, \nOCC, and OTS; the NCUA; the SEC; in six executive departments--\nEducation, Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor, and \nVeterans Affairs; and in such agencies as the Social Security \nAdministration, Federal Trade Commission, the Commodities Futures \nTrading Commission, and the Office of Personnel Management.\n  The Committee will coordinate these and other efforts. Additional \nmembers can be added at the discretion of the Chairperson of the \nCommittee. All will benefit from the better coordination and the \nelimination of unnecessary duplication that the Committee will provide.\n  In addition, many State and local governments, non-profit entities, \nand private enterprises have developed and implemented excellent \nfinancial education programs. A successful national strategy to \nincrease financial literacy and education must involve a partnership \nthat engages all levels of government, including at the State and local \nlevel, along with leaders of the non-profit and private sectors. As Don \nBlandin, President of the American Savings Education Council noted in \nhis testimony before the Committee: ``Organizations in both the private \nand public sectors must collaborate on all levels to help educate \nAmericans about the importance of taking control of their financial \nfuture. By combining and leveraging our comprehensive networks and \nresources, we have a better chance of reaching people that none of us \nwould be able to reach alone.'' The Coordinating Committee established \nby this legislation will undertake just such a collaboration. It will \ndevelop a national strategy in conjunction with State and local \ngovernments and with the private and non-profit sectors, and will \nreport its findings back to the Congress.\n  It is disturbing to hear the statistics about the current situation \nand how financially under-educated the American people are. The \nConsumer Federation of America found that the typical American failed a \n14-question test of basic knowledge of personal finances. Fewer than \none in ten, 8, answered three-quarters of the questions correctly. \nEighty-two percent of high school seniors failed a 13-question personal \nfinancial quiz on such basic questions as interest rates, savings, \nloans, credit cards, and calculating net worth.\n  The lack of financial education affects Americans of every age and \nbackground. There may be differing opinions on issues of financial \nsecurity for retirees, but I suspect there is little disagreement on \nthe importance to every family of budgeting and savings for retirement. \nWe have data showing that households with a savings plan save twice as \nmuch as those without a plan, and yet surveys indicate that half of all \nAmericans have not taken the basic step of calculating how much they \nwill need to save for retirement. Teaching families how to budget and \ndevelop a savings plan as well as the importance of doing so would \nenhance many Americans' financial security.\n  There are far too many people today who lack a bank account, which is \nthe passport for access to mainstream financial services. The Wall \nStreet Journal, in an article appearing June 28, 2001, estimated that \n10 million adult Americans have no relationship with a mainstream \nfinancial services provider. Of the millions of households that have no \nrelationship with a bank, one-third are African American and 29 percent \nare Hispanic. The large costs of failing to bring people into the \nmainstream financial system makes it imperative to pursue all avenues \nto bring them in. A lack of basic consumer financial education on how a \nchecking and a savings account work and why it's important to have such \nan account is one explanation for these disturbing figures. Once people \nenter into the financial mainstream a lot of the protections and \nsafeguards which have been developed for the board mass of the public \nare enjoyed by these newly banked people.\n  The Banking Committee heard from witnesses that many college students \nhave access to significant credit through credit cards, but have little \nexperience and often little to no education on how to use them \nresponsibly. Kentucky State Treasurer Jonathan Miller, who has held a \nseries of hearings on financial literacy throughout his state, \ntestified before the Banking Committee that: ``for a significant and \ngrowing minority of college students, credit card use and misuse can be \ndevastating.'' The Department of Education estimates that the average \ncredit card debt among college students was over $3,000 in the year \n2000. College students are not the only ones susceptible to credit card \ndebt: the average credit card debt per American family is over $8,000. \nFurthermore, too many people are unaware of their own credit score, how \nto access that score, and the impact that their credit score has on \nboth their access to credit and the terms on which that credit is \noffered.\n  Students are entering college with insufficient knowledge of the \nfinancial system and as a result, they are getting into serious \nfinancial problems. One of the Committee's witnesses, Ms. Ellen \nFrishberg, Director of Student Financial Services at John Hopkins \nUniversity, testified that, ``Because of the case of getting credit, \nthe lack of financial savy on the part of these otherwise very bright \nstudents, and the unchecked solicitation and giveaways that were going \non during orientation, in 1994 the Dean of Students decided it was best \nto prohibit credit card vendors from the Homewood campus.'' We can all \nagree that college students who are better educated in the basics of \nthe financial system will be less susceptible to falling into serious \ncredit card debt.\n  Special attention should also be paid to immigrants, often of modest \nmeans who send, or remit, a significant portion of their income to \nfamily in their country of origin. According to a recent study by the \nInter-American Development Bank, in the aggregate $32 billion was \nremitted out of America last year, with over $10 billion going to \nMexico alone. It is estimated that nearly 70 percent of all Hispanic \nimmigrants send money home. The financial transaction of sending money \ninternationally is complex: there are transaction fees, currency \nconversion fees and exchange rate spreads. The full costs can range up \nto $50 even when the amount being sent home is $300. A survey by \nBendixen and Associates estimated that \\2/3\\ of Hispanic immigrants who \nsend money home are unaware of the full costs. Before the Banking \nCommittee, Mr. Bendixen testified that, ``When these immigrants were \ninformed that besides a fee paid in the U.S., international money \ntransfer companies often provide unfavorable exchange rates or discount \nadditional commissions or charges in Latin America, a large majority of \nthem felt that the fees paid for the service are excessive and unfair. \nCustomers should have\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\naccess to information about the full costs of their transactions, and \nthey need a level of financial literacy that enables them to interpret \nthe information. Only then will they be able to shop effectively, \ncompare costs, and make wise financial choices.\n  Increased financial education is a first step in the consumer \neducation process but as Federal Reserve vice-Chairman Roger Ferguson \ntestified before the Committee, ``legislation, careful regulation and \neducation are all components of the response to these emerging consumer \nconcerns.'' The legislation I introduce today will make a significant \ncontribution to improving the quality of financial education in this \ncountry. It is modeled closely on the Trade Promotion Coordinating \nCommittee established by the Export Enhancement Act of 1992.\n  A number of Senators have taken a strong interest in this issue. \nSenator Corzine is a co-sponsor of this legislation and has been \nactively involved on the issue. I particularly want to acknowledge the \noutstanding leadership of Senators Stabenow and Enzi as well as Senator \nAkaka. I know that Senators Stabenow and Enzi are working on a bill and \nI look forward to working closely with them.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to Senate Banking Committee \nChairman Shelby for the time and attention is devoting to this subject. \nTomorrow Chairman Shelby is holding a hearing in the Committee on \n``Consumer Awareness and Understanding of the Credit Granting \nProcess.'' These issues are directly related.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Financial Literacy and \nEducation Coordinating Act and the bill be printed in the Record \ntogether with letters in support of the bill. I urge my colleagues to \nwork toward speedy enactment of meaningful legislation to improve the \nfinancial literacy and education of all Americans.\n  There being no objection, the summary and letters of support were \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n       Financial Literacy and Education Coordinating Act of 2003\n\n       This legislation establishes an interagency Committee, \n     based in the Department of the Treasury, with assistance \n     provided by Treasury's Office of Financial Education. The \n     Committee shall be chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury \n     and charged with coordinating governmental financial literacy \n     initiatives and developing a national strategy, in \n     cooperation with state and local governments, and non-profit \n     and private enterprises, to improve financial education and \n     literacy of all Americans.\n       The Committee initially includes representatives from the \n     Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of \n     Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration, \n     the Departments of Treasury, Agriculture, Defense, Education, \n     Health and Human Services, Labor, Veterans Affairs, the \n     Social Security Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, \n     the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and the Office of \n     Personnel Management. The chairperson has the authority to \n     include other agencies and departments that are engaged in a \n     serious effort to improve the state of financial literacy and \n     education among any group of Americans. The Committee shall \n     meet no less than quarterly.\n       There is substantial evidence that many Americans do not \n     have an adequate basis for making sound decisions about their \n     personal and household finances, especially given the myriad \n     choices of financial products and services available to them. \n     A more comprehensive financial education would help provide \n     individuals with the necessary tools to create household \n     budgets, initiative savings plans, manage debt, and make \n     strategic investment decisions for education, retirement, \n     home ownership or other savings goals. While increased levels \n     of financial literacy and education are critically important, \n     improved financial decision making by consumers, not simply \n     improved knowledge, should be the most important financial \n     education goal.\n       The Committee is required to: review financial literacy and \n     education efforts throughout the federal government; identify \n     and remove duplicative financial literacy efforts within the \n     federal government; coordinate and promote financial literacy \n     efforts including partnerships between federal, state and \n     local governments, non-profit organizations and private \n     enterprises; develop within one year a national strategy to \n     promote financial literacy and education among all Americans; \n     develop and implement the strategy with the participation of \n     non-profit and private sector institutions; coordinate \n     efforts towards the implementation of the strategy; and \n     submit an annual report, providing testimony if requested, to \n     Congress detailing the state of financial literacy and \n     education as it relates to the strategy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                                    July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes, the Consumer Federation of America \n     commends you for introducing legislation to boost financial \n     awareness and improve financial decision-making by Americans. \n     There has never been a greater need to advance financial \n     education. CFA strongly supports the creation of the \n     Financial Literacy and Education and Coordinating Committee \n     within the Department of the Treasury, as called for in this \n     bill, and looks forward to working with you to enact this \n     timely legislation.\n       The financial education needs of the least affluent and \n     well-educated Americans are especially pressing, in part \n     because recent changes in the financial services marketplace \n     have increased the vulnerability of these households. In \n     particular, the dramatic expansion of high-cost and sometimes \n     predatory lending to moderate and lower income Americans in \n     the last decade has put many of these people at great \n     financial risk. Because these individuals lack financial \n     resources and often are charged high prices, they cannot \n     afford to make poor financial choices. But because of low \n     general and financial literacy levels, they often have \n     difficulty making smart financial decisions, in part because \n     they are especially vulnerable to abusive seller practices.\n\n\n   This Legislation Would Establish Effective Federal Leadership on \n                          Financial Education\n\n       While many worthwhile financial education programs exist, \n     they are not well-coordinated, effectively reach only a small \n     minority of the population, and do not reflect any broad, \n     compelling vision. Many focus only on increasing consumer \n     knowledge of how to best operate in the financial services \n     marketplace, and not on actually changing consumer behavior \n     to improve decisions about spending, saving, and the use of \n     credit. Moreover, there is no clear consensus about how to \n     effectively provide financial education, especially to those \n     who have completed their secondary education and to those \n     with low literacy levels. What is most needed is a \n     comprehensive needs assessment and plan to guide and inspire \n     financial educators and their supporters. Such a plan could \n     also convince a broad array of government, business and \n     nonprofit groups to work together to persuade the nation to \n     implement that plan.\n       This legislation recognizes that, for any comprehensive \n     plan to win broad public and private support and \n     participation, the federal government must provide \n     leadership. The bill would give the Department of Treasury \n     the authority to establish a federal governmental network to \n     coordinate financial literacy efforts and requires every \n     relevant agency to participate at a high level, including the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of \n     Education, the Federal Reserve, and the Department of \n     Defense. It emphasizes the importance of assessing the \n     federal government's capacity for promoting financial \n     literacy. It requires the Coordinating Committee to evaluate \n     different financial programs and strategies and identify \n     those that are most effective in improving consumer decision \n     making--not just awareness. It makes the Coordinating \n     Committee directly accountable to Congress for its activities \n     and accomplishments. Most importantly, it requires the \n     Coordinating Committee to develop and implement a national \n     strategy to promote basic financial literacy, with broad \n     input from business, educational and nonprofit leaders.\n\n\n     lower income consumers need better financial literacy efforts\n\n       There is no large population that would benefit more from \n     improved financial education than the tens of millions of the \n     least affluent and well-educated Americans. In 1998, 37 \n     percent of all households had incomes under $25,000. With the \n     exception of older persons who had paid off home mortgages, \n     these households had accumulated few assets. In 1998, \n     according to the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer \n     Finances, most of these least affluent households had net \n     financial assets (excluding home equity) of less than $1,000. \n     Moreover, between 1995 and 1998, a time of rising household \n     incomes, the net worth of lower-income households actually \n     declined.\n       For lower income households with few discretionary \n     financial resources, failing to adequately budget \n     expenditures may pressure these consumers into taking out \n     expensive credit card or payday loans. Mistakenly purchasing \n     a predatory mortgage loan could cost them most of their \n     economic assets.\n       These households also need to make smart buying decisions \n     because they tend to be charged higher prices than more \n     affluent families: higher homeowner and auto insurance rates \n     because they live in riskier neighborhoods; higher loan rates \n     because of their low and often unstable incomes; higher \n     furniture and appliance prices from neighborhood merchants \n     that lack economies of scale and face relatively high costs \n     of doing business; and higher food prices in their many \n     neighborhoods without stores from major supermarket chains. \n     Lower-income families are also faced with higher prices for \n     basic banking services and they lack access to essential \n     savings options.\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\n       Lower-income households with low literacy levels are \n     especially vulnerable to seller abuse. Consumers who do not \n     understand percentages may well find it impossible to \n     understand the costs of mortgages, home equity, installment, \n     and credit card, payday, and other high-cost loans. \n     Individuals who do not read well may find it difficult to \n     check whether the oral promises of salespersons were written \n     into contracts. And, those who do not write fluently are \n     limited in their ability to resolve problems by writing to \n     merchants or complaint agencies. Consumers who do not speak, \n     read, or write English well face special challenges \n     obtaining good value in their purchases.\n\n\n     More Available Credit Has Increased Financial Education Needs\n\n       Over the past decade, the financial vulnerability of low- \n     and moderate-income households has increased simply because \n     of the dramatic expansion of the availability of credit. The \n     loans that subjected the greatest number of Americans to \n     financial risk were made with credit cards. From 1990 to \n     2000, fueled by billions of mail solicitations annually and \n     low minimum monthly payments of 2-3 percent, credit card debt \n     outstanding more than tripled from about $200 billion to more \n     than $600 billion. Just as significantly, the credit lines \n     made available just to bankcard holders rose to well over $2 \n     trillion. By the middle of the decade, having saturated \n     upper- and middle-class markets, issuers began marketing to \n     lower-income households. By the end of the decade, an \n     estimated 80 percent of all households carried at least one \n     credit card. Independent experts agree that expanding credit \n     card debt has been the principal reason for rising consumer \n     bankruptcies.\n       Also worrisome has been the expansion of high-priced \n     mortgage loans and stratospherically-priced smaller consumer \n     loans. In the 1990s, creditors began to aggressively market \n     subprime mortgage loans carrying interest rates greater than \n     10 percent and higher fees than those charged on conventional \n     mortgage loans. By 1999, the volume of subprime mortgage \n     loans peaked at $160 billion. Mortgage borrowers in low-\n     income neighborhoods were three times more likely to have \n     subprime loans than mortgage borrowers in high-income \n     neighborhoods. A significant minority of these subprime \n     borrowers would have qualified for much less expensive \n     conventional mortgage loans. Some of these borrowers were \n     victimized by exorbitantly priced and frequently refinanced \n     predatory loans that ``stripped equity'' from the homes of \n     many lower-income households.\n       The 1990s also saw explosive growth in predatory small \n     loans--payday loans, car title pawn, rent-to-own, and refund \n     anticipation loans--typically carrying effective interest \n     rates in triple digits. The Fannie Mae Foundation estimates \n     that these ``loans'' annually involve 280 million \n     transactions worth $78 billion and carrying $5.5 billion in \n     fees. The typical purchaser of these financial products has \n     income in the $20,000 to $30,000 range with a \n     disproportionate number being women.\n       Both proper regulation and education are necessary to \n     insure that lower and moderate income Americans are not \n     subject to abusive lending practices and that they have the \n     knowledge to make effective decisions in an increasingly \n     complex financial services marketplace. We applaud you for \n     proposing this comprehensive and achievable vision for \n     improving financial awareness and decision-making. We look \n     forward to working with you and leaders in the House of \n     Representatives to put such an approach in law as soon as \n     possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Travis B. Plunkett,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                                    July 28, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: AARP is pleased to offer our support \n     for your legislation, the ``Financial Literacy and Education \n     Coordinating Act of 2003,'' that will begin to address this \n     nation's need to improve financial literacy.\n       Last year, at the Senate Banking Committee's hearing on the \n     status of financial literacy and education in America, AARP \n     President Tess Canja documented in her testimony the need for \n     a coherent and coordinated national strategy to make \n     available a well-researched and well-evaluated progression of \n     financial literacy programs and services. Your legislation \n     establishes a permanent inter-agency platform for developing \n     a national financial literacy strategy, and it will begin to \n     provide the necessary coordination to integrate and to help \n     deliver educational and training programs that already exist \n     at the federal, state and local levels. For example, the \n     Congress is working to expand the availability of credit \n     reports and credit scores to all Americans. This is critical \n     information for consumers, but it does not become effective \n     knowledge until it is understood.\n       The dramatic loss in stock market valuations in recent \n     years highlights the financial vulnerability facing many \n     retired Americans. The haunting prospect of an underinformed \n     generation of Baby-Boomers nearing retirement age suggest \n     that there is little time to waste in developing, testing and \n     arraying improved financial education and training services.\n       We look forward to actively working with you to enact the \n     ``Financial Literacy and Education Coordination Act of \n     2003.'' If there are further questions, please do not \n     hesitate to call upon me, or have your staff contact Roy \n     Green of our Federal Affairs staff at (202) 434-3800.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael W. Naylor,\n     Director of Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      National Council on Economic\n\n\n                                                    Education,\n\n                                                    July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes,\n     U.S. Senator, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: We at the National Council on \n     Economic Education (NCEE) strongly endorse the Financial \n     Literacy and Education Coordination Committee Act. This Act, \n     which proposes establishing a committee chaired by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, to coordinate the activities of \n     all Federal Agencies with an interest in financial and \n     literacy, could not come at a better time.\n       This is a time of growing public interest in financial \n     education. Parents everywhere want their children to know how \n     the world works before they go to work in it, and to possess \n     the basic knowledge and decision-making skills that will help \n     them to become productive and responsible citizens, \n     employees, consumers, savers and investors.\n       In response to the growing interest in financial literacy, \n     a number of government agencies have set up departments \n     focusing on this issue. In our opinion, the fact that the \n     Coordinating Committee will bring the various departments \n     together will reduce duplication of much needed resources, \n     and get new programs into the community more quickly. We also \n     understand that the Coordinating Committee will work with \n     non-profits, and state and local organizations--both private \n     and public--to develop strategies for improving financial \n     literacy. We welcome this inclusive approach to getting a \n     sound economic education into the hands of our young people.\n       The NCEE is pleased to support the Financial Literacy and \n     Education Coordination Committee Act. Please keep us informed \n     of its progress.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Robert F. Duvall,\n     President & Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Howard University,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senate \n         Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: Last year, as a representative of \n     higher education and Historically Black Colleges and \n     Universities, I testified before the Committee in support of \n     its proposed national strategy to promote financial literacy \n     and education. Today, I remain steadfast in my advocacy of \n     this initiative.\n       Financial illiteracy continues to plague many American: an \n     unfortunate reality that further underscores the urgent need \n     for The Financial Literacy and Education Coordinating Act. It \n     provides the most effective solution to establishment of a \n     nationwide program that will protect and educate our \n     citizens.\n       Although financial literacy should be a lifelong program \n     beginning in elementary school, I believe that higher \n     education has a special responsibility to ensure that \n     students in postsecondary institutions develop sound \n     financial competency as early in their college careers as \n     possible.\n       The typical college graduate leaves school with an average \n     of $19,400 in student loans. Throughout their matriculation, \n     students are routinely bombarded by aggressive credit card \n     companies who entice them with offers of free gifts and easy \n     credit. The addition of credit card debt creates an \n     overwhelming burden on recent graduates.\n       Promoting financial education for our youth is consistent \n     with Howard University's core values. The University, in \n     collaboration with other organizations--including our \n     strategic partner Fannie Mae--is addressing the national \n     financial literacy problem as it relates to African Americans \n     and other minorities, who are already disadvantaged by the \n     wealth gap. Howard believes that the ability to make informed \n     financial decisions is an increasingly important skill.\n       We have introduced a number of initiatives to empower our \n     students and members of the community by teaching them the \n     importance of effectively managing their money and improving \n     their credit so that the dream of homeownership and other \n     personal financial opportunities can become a reality.\n       We now look to the Congress to enact legislation that will \n     buttress our efforts in this regard. The Financial Literacy \n     and Education Coordinating Act is indeed representative of a \n     worthy, collective, non-partisan effort that will have a \n     lasting impact on generations to come.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               H. Patrick Swygert,\n                                                        President.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\n                                S. 1470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Financial Literacy and \n     Education Coordinating Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there is substantial evidence that many Americans do \n     not have an adequate basis for making sound decisions about \n     personal and household finances;\n       (2) financial education could play a critical role in \n     equipping consumers with the knowledge to make wise \n     decisions, especially for lower income consumers and those \n     underserved by the mainstream financial system;\n       (3) an increased awareness of the availability of credit \n     scores and credit reports, the process of accessing them, \n     their significance in obtaining credit, and their effects on \n     credit terms, are of paramount importance to consumers;\n       (4) easily accessible and affordable resources which inform \n     and educate investors as to their rights and avenues of \n     recourse should be provided when an investor believes his or \n     her rights have been violated by unprofessional conduct of \n     market intermediaries;\n       (5) a basic understanding of the operation of the financial \n     services industry would help consumers and their families to \n     make more informed choices about how best to progress \n     economically, avoid harmful personal debt, avoid \n     discriminatory and predatory practices, invest wisely, \n     develop financial planning skills necessary for maximizing \n     short- and long-term financial well being, and better prepare \n     for retirement;\n       (6) comprehensive financial education would help to provide \n     individuals with the necessary tools to create household \n     budgets, initiate savings plans, manage debt, and make \n     strategic investment decisions for education, retirement, \n     home ownership, or other savings goals; and\n       (7) improved financial decision making, not simply more \n     knowledge, should be the primary financial education goal.\n\n     SEC. 3.

COMMITTEE DUTIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Committee shall--\n       (1) not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, develop a national strategy to promote basic \n     financial literacy among all American consumers;\n       (2) coordinate Federal efforts to implement the strategy \n     developed under paragraph (1);\n       (3) not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, and annually thereafter, submit a report to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House \n     of Representatives regarding actions taken and progress made \n     by the Committee in carrying out this Act during the \n     reporting period, and any challenges remaining to \n     implementation of such purposes; and\n       (4) provide testimony by the chairperson of the Committee \n     to either Committee referred to in paragraph (3), upon \n     request.\n       (b) Strategy.--The strategy to promote basic financial \n     literacy required to be developed under subsection (a)(1) \n     shall provide for--\n       (1) participation by State and local governments and \n     private, nonprofit, and public institutions in the creation \n     and implementation of such strategy;\n       (2) the development of methods--\n       (A) to increase the general financial education level of \n     current and future consumers of financial services and \n     products; and\n       (B) to enhance the general understanding of financial \n     services and products;\n       (3) review of Federal activities designed to promote \n     financial literacy and education and development of a plan to \n     improve coordination of such activities;\n       (4) the identification of areas of overlap and duplication \n     among Federal financial literacy and education activities and \n     proposed means of eliminating any such overlap and \n     duplication; and\n       (5) a proposal to the President of a Federal financial \n     literacy and education budget that supports such strategy and \n     eliminates funding for such areas of overlap and duplication.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Head Start Act to designate up to 200 \nHead Start centers as Centers of Excellence in Early Childhood, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I introduce today a bill to be \nconsidered as part of the legislation reauthorizing Head Start. My bill \nwould create a way for states to help strengthen and coordinate Head \nStart, but would continue to send federal funds directly to grantees \nfor the 19,000 Head Start centers that serve one million disadvantaged \nchildren.\n  My proposal authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ncreate a nationwide network of 200 Centers of Excellence in Early \nChildhood built around exemplary Head Start programs. These Centers of \nExcellence would be nominated by Governors. Each Center of Excellence \nwould receive a Federal bonus grant of at least $100,000 in each of 5 \nyears, in addition to its base funding. And each State would receive a \ngrant to establish and fund a State Council in Early Childhood, which \nwould work with the State Head Start collaboration office to showcase \nthe work of exemplary Head Start centers within a state, capture and \ndisseminate best practices, and identify barriers to and opportunities \nfor coordinated service delivery.\n  The bill would authorize $100 million for those grants for each of \nthe 5 years.\n  The Centers of Excellence bonus grants will be used for centers:\n\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\n\n       (1) to work in their community to model the best of what \n     Head Start can do for at-risk children and families, \n     including getting those children ready for school and ready \n     for academic success;\n       (2) to coordinate all early childhood services in their \n     community;\n       (3) to offer training and support to all professionals \n     working with at-risk children;\n       (4) to track these families and ensure seamless continuity \n     of services from prenatal to age 8;\n       (5) to become models of excellence by all performance \n     measures and be willing to be held accountable for good \n     outcomes for our most disadvantaged children; and\n       (6) to have the flexibility to serve additional Head Start \n     or early Head Start children or provide more full-day \n     services to better meet the needs of working parents.\n\n  Head Start has been one of our country's most successful and popular \nsocial programs. That is because it is based upon the principle of \nequal opportunity, which is at the core of the American character. \nAmericans uniquely believe that each of us has the right to begin at \nthe same starting line and that, if we do, anything is possible for any \none of us.\n  We also understand that some of us need help getting to that starting \nline. Most Federal funding for social programs is based upon this \nunderstanding of equal opportunity.\n  Head Start began in 1965 to make it more likely that disadvantaged \nchildren would successfully arrive at one of the most important of our \nstarting lines, the beginning of school.\n  Head Start over the years has served hundreds of thousands of our \nmost at risk children. The program has grown and changed. It has been \nsubjected to debates and studies touting its successes and decrying its \ndeficiencies. But Head Start has stood the test of time because it is \nso very important.\n  We have made great progress in what we know about the early growth \nand development of young children since Head Start began in 1965. At \nthat time very few professionals had studied early childhood education. \nEven fewer had designed programs specifically for children in poverty.\n  The origins of Head Start had its roots in an understanding that \nsuccess for these children was not only about education. The program \nwas designed to be certain these children were healthy, got their \nimmunizations, were fed hot meals, and, of crucial importance that \ntheir parents were deeply involved in the program.\n  From the beginning comprehensive services and parent and community \ninvolvement were essential parts of good Head Start programs. And that \nis still true today. In the early days, teacher training and curriculum \nwere seen as less important. But we now know a great deal more about \nbrain development and how children learn from birth.\n  Today young children are expected to learn more and be able to do \nmore in order to succeed in school. Public schools offer kindergarten \nand 40 states now offer early childhood programs.\n  In addition to the $7 billion spent each year on federal Head Start \nprograms, there are 69 other federal and state programs costing $18 \nbillion a year. The greatest increases have come in private spending as \nparents seek early childhood development services for their own \nchildren.\n  As Congress approached the 5-year reauthorization of Head Start, \nPresident Bush challenged Congress to make a ``good Head Start program \nexcellent.'' The President suggested four objectives for strengthening \nHead Start:\n\n       (1) Improve school readiness by focusing more attention on \n     specific cognitive development;\n       (2) Increase accountability;\n       (3) Improve coordination with other programs that serve \n     young children, including public and private schools.\n       (4) Increase state involvement in strengthening Head Start \n     by transferring federal funding for Head Start to states, \n     with certain criteria and restrictions.\n\n  The House of Representatives completed work last week on the \nreauthorization bill. It is called the School Readiness Act. It made \nsignificant progress toward the President's first three objectives: \nschool readiness, accountability, and coordination.\n\n       (1) On school readiness, the bill would ensure a greater \n     number of Head Start teachers are adequately trained.\n       (2) On accountability, the triennial reviews are \n     strengthened by adding unscheduled visits, and chronic \n     underachievers would be subject to a more aggressive review.\n       (3) On coordination, the bill expands the requirements for \n     the State Head Start Collaboration Offices to coordination.\n\n  As for the idea of letting states administer Head Start, the House \ncreated a pilot program that would allow eight states to take over Head \nStart as long as they maintain or improve the level of services.\n  As the Senate begins its consideration of Head Start, I believe there \nis consensus about the need to improve school readiness, \naccountability, and coordination of programs--but no consensus on how \nto involve the states more actively.\n  I believe that states should be more involved with Head Start. States \nhave primary responsibility for setting standards for and funding \npublic education. A child who arrives at school too far behind the \nstarting line may never catch up. In addition, the state is in the best \nposition to help coordinate the variety of public and private programs \nthat have grown up since Head Start began.\n  But the need to involve states does not necessarily mean sending \nfederal dollars first to states and then to Head Start centers. As \nimportant as the state is, education and caring for children is \nprimarily local--a community and family responsibility. I believe that \nin education and in child care local solutions work best.\n  While Head Start centers are uneven in performance, they have \ngenerally excelled in two areas critical to success in caring for \nand educating children--developing community support and encouraging \nparental involvement. I do not believe that it would be wise--at least \nat this stage of the Head Start program--to risk interrupting the \nstrong community support and parental involvement in the 19,000 Head \nStart centers by transferring funding to the states. There are other \nand better ways to meet this objective.\n\n  That is why I believe creating a nationwide network of 200 Head Start \nCenters of Excellence in Early Childhood is the right step for the next \n5 years. Governors would nominate 149 of these centers. Governors would \ncreate or designate a State Council for Early Childhood. Governors \ncould then use these Centers of Excellence and the State Council to \nencourage other centers to adopt best practices and to improve \ncoordination of programs.\n  At the federal level additional funds will be made available--$100 \nmillion is authorized--for research on the effectiveness of these \nCenters of Excellence as a strategy for coordination of all early \nchildhood federal and state programs and ensure school success for at-\nrisk children.\n  In addition, I would hope the President would convene an annual \nconference of these Centers of Excellence and State Councils to \nhighlight their successes. After four years, we would learn from these \nactivities how state involvement in Head Start might be increased in \nthe next 5-year authorization.\n  Alex Haley, the author of Roots lived by these six words, ``Find the \ngood and praise it.'' For me that was an invaluable lesson. My mother \ntaught me another invaluable lesson--the importance of preschool \neducation. When I was growing up, she ran a kindergarten in a converted \ngarage in our backyard in Maryville, Tennessee. She helped our \ncommunity appreciate the value of a good preschool program. I have \nremembered both lessons in trying to fashion this proposal to bring out \nthe best in Head Start.\n  The work that the House of Representatives has done on readiness, \naccountability and coordination--plus the adoption of this proposal for \n200 Centers of Excellence in Early Childhood should provide a strong \nbasis for our Head Start reauthorization bill.\n  The president would have challenged the Congress to improve Head \nStart in four major respects--readiness accountability, coordination, \nand state involvement--and he will be able to sign legislation that \nwill do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a one-page \nsummary of my bill and a copy of the bill itself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Head Start Centers of Excellence in Early Childhood\n\n       What are the objectives for reauthorization? The \n     reauthorization should strengthen Head Start for one million \n     disadvantaged\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\n     children in all 19,000 Head Start Centers by improving (1) \n     school readiness, (2) accountability, and (3) coordination \n     with other programs that serve young children, including \n     public and private schools.\n       What is the proposal? In support of these objectives, to \n     create a nationwide network of 200 Centers of Excellence in \n     Early Childhood built around exemplary Head Start centers. \n     These Centers of Excellence will receive a special grant to \n     serve as a ``magnet'' for teachers and others working with \n     at-risk young children to come, learn, and develop action \n     plans to take back to improve their own practices.\n       Exactly how would the Centers of Excellence do this? The \n     Centers of Excellence will strengthen Head Start, early \n     childhood programs and public and private schools by: (1) \n     modeling excellence in high quality seamless service \n     coordination while achieving measured academic success in \n     pre-literacy, number recognition and school readiness; (2) \n     modeling the use of effective accountability systems; (3) \n     coordinating services for low-income children from prenatal \n     through age 8; (4) following children who transition from \n     Head Start to public or private schools, working with both \n     their parents and their teachers; (5) providing support and \n     training to teachers and others working with those low-income \n     children, sharing best practices and dramatically leveraging \n     themselves; (6) having the flexibility to serve additional \n     Head Start or Early Head Start children or to provide more \n     full-day services to better meet the needs of working \n     parents.\n       Who could become a Center of Excellence? All 19,000 Head \n     Start centers would be eligible to apply for five-year \n     designations as a Center of Excellence in Early Childhood.\n       Who would pick the Centers of Excellence? The Secretary of \n     HHS. One hundred forty-nine (149) of the Centers picked would \n     be selected from among applicants nominated by governors; the \n     other 51 would be picked by the Secretary to try to achieve a \n     goal of one in each state.\n       What are the criteria for selection? (1) a track record of \n     achieved measured academic success including school \n     readiness, (2) a strong demonstrated ability to work with \n     parents and the community, (3) the ability to serve as a \n     model of high quality seamless service coordination, (4) the \n     ability to provide outreach support and training for teachers \n     in other Head Start programs, and in other early childhood \n     settings and in public and private schools, (5) ability to \n     work in partnership with the State Head Start Collaboration \n     Office.\n       What would the states' role be in these Centers of \n     Excellence? (1) For 149 of the 200 Centers the Governor's \n     nomination is a necessary part of the application. (2) Each \n     state will receive a grant to establish and fund a State \n     Council in Early Childhood which will work with the Head \n     Start Collaboration Office to tie together the work of \n     exemplary Head Start centers within a state, capture and \n     disseminate emerging best practices and identify barriers to \n     and opportunities for better coordination of service \n     delivery.\n       How will Centers of Excellence be funded? Each Center of \n     Excellence will receive a five-year grant directly from HHS. \n     These excellence grants are bonus grants and are in addition \n     to the center's base Head Start funding.\n       What is the total Cost of the Centers of Excellence? $100 \n     million--which includes grants to 200 Centers of Excellence \n     in Early Childhood, the grants to state council as well as \n     the costs of research and HHS administrative costs.\n\n                                S. 1474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote \nthe competitiveness of American businesses, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nchange the way this country taxes business income, whether earned at \nhome or abroad. The bill I am introducing, the ``Promote Growth and \nJobs in the USA Act of 2003,'' or the ``Pro Grow USA Act,'' was made \nnecessary because the World Trade Organization has ruled that a \nsignificant feature of our current tax system, the Extraterritorial \nIncome Exclusion (or ETI), is an impermissible trade subsidy under WTO \nrules.\n  This final WTO ruling followed a similar decision of that body made a \nfew years ago that a previous U.S. tax provision, the Foreign Sales \nCorporation (or FSC), was also an illegal trade subsidy under the WTO \nrules. After that first WTO decision, Congress replaced the FSC \nprovision with the ETI provision, which generally replicated the \nbenefits of the FSC to its recipients. Both provisions were designed to \nhelp U.S. exporters better compete in the global economy.\n  Unfortunately, we now find ourselves in the very unpleasant situation \nof having to repeal the ETI tax benefit. This repeal will cost the \nexporters of this nation more than $4 billion per year. Failure to \nrepeal it by the end of 2003 could bring upon us trade sanctions by the \nEuropean Union, which has already been authorized by the WTO to assess \nthese sanctions in an amount exceeding $4 billion per year.\n  Even though I am not enthusiastic about introducing legislation to \nrepeal that tax benefit, I believe we should make a virtue out of \nnecessity. This is what I am trying to accomplish with this bill. We \nknow we cannot, in a WTO-compliant way, give those lost tax benefits \nback to the companies that are losing them by the repeal. What we can \ndo, however, is pass tax reform measures to strengthen all American \nbusinesses.\n  I see this as an opportunity to once again make America the world's \ngreatest location to start a business, and the world's greatest \nlocation to grow a business.\n  Today, savings and investment dollars flow around the world at the \nspeed of light, and businesses look all over the world when deciding \nwhere to put their global headquarters, their research departments, and \ntheir manufacturing operations. We need to take these facts into \naccount when we reform our tax rules, which we now are forced to do. \nOur goal should be to make the U.S. economy a magnet for greater \ninnovation and greater capital formation.\n  I believe, that this is the right time to look at how our companies \ndo business overseas, both how they export products abroad and how they \nexpand their operations abroad. And, I believe we should also take this \nopportunity to examine whether our tax policy can be improved to better \nhelp U.S. firms that operate only domestically grow and thrive.\n  In my view, the ETI repeal has to address the legitimate concerns of \nboth domestic producers and U.S.-based multinationals. Both kinds of \ncompanies hire Americans, both kinds of companies make interest \npayments and dividend payments to Americans, and both kinds of \ncompanies pay American taxes.\n  In response to this situation, Members of Congress have introduced \nseveral proposals to repeal and replace the ETI benefit. One leading \nproposal would create a new, lower tax rate for American manufacturers. \nWhile I am certainly not opposed to lowering tax rates on U.S. \nmanufacturers, I am convinced that such a solution, by itself, is not \nadequate. This is because it ignores the very real problems our tax \ncode presents to U.S. businesses that expand overseas.\n  As with several of my colleagues on the Finance Committee, I have \nlong been interested in improving our tax rules that govern \ninternational transactions. They are woefully out of date and harm the \nability of U.S. firms to compete on a global basis. Moreover, the rules \nare mind numbingly complex.\n  Legislation I introduced with Senator Baucus in 1999 would have gone \na long way toward updating and simplifying these laws so they work much \nbetter. Some of those provisions were included in a large tax bill that \nboth the Senate and House passed that year that was unfortunately \nvetoed by President Clinton for reasons unrelated to the international \nprovisions.\n  Since then, however, there has been a great deal of interest in \nreforming the international rules, but the opportunities to bring such \nmeasures to the floors of the House and Senate have been quite limited, \nuntil now. As I mentioned, I believe that the repeal of the ETI \nrepresents a rare opportunity to address these much-needed changes.\n  Another major solution to the ETI repeal and replacement problem is \nthe one taken by Chairman Bill Thomas of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee in the bill he introduced last Friday. I want to emphasize \nthat while my bill and Chairman Thomas's bill are very different in \nmany respects, they are very much alike in the approach they take to \nthe problem. Both Chairman Thomas and I believe it is vital to address \nthe issues presented by both domestic businesses and by multinational \nfirms.\n  There are three principles underlying my legislation. The first is \nthat as we repeal ETI, we should strive to replace it with provisions \nthat would increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies at home as \nwell as abroad, and that would increase the productivity growth of our \neconomy. I want to increase the ability of all American firms to \ncompete, both those just at home and those that also operate abroad\n  There is a false notion we hear from time to time that if we make it \neasier for U.S. companies to operate effectively on a worldwide basis, \nwe are making them more likely to move U.S. jobs abroad. I believe just \nthe opposite is true--that making U.S. firms more competitive worldwide \nincreases the quality and quantity of American jobs.\n  When companies expand overseas, they likely hire more people at the \nU.S. headquarters. The R jobs, the marketing jobs, management and \nsupport jobs--we can have those jobs here, supporting a U.S. company's \nworldwide operations. I think we should make it easier to grow those \nkind of good-paying headquarters jobs right here at home.\n  The second principle is that we ought to simplify the tax code to the \nextent possible. My bill would do this both in the international arena \nand in the depreciation rules.\n  Finally, I want to make it clear that I disagree with the notion that \nreplacing the ETI provision has to be a zero\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\nsum game. The Senate budget resolution calls for nearly $500 billion \nmore in tax cuts outside of budget reconciliation. I believe we should \nbe willing to spend some of this tax cut money to ensure that all \nAmerican businesses are better able to grow and compete.\n  Notwithstanding our new deficit projections, I still believe that \nPresident Bush and those who support him are on the right track in \ntrying to pass tax cuts to increase economic growth and productivity, \ncombined with spending discipline. One thing is for certain--we will \nnever get out of a deficit mode with the slower growth that comes from \ntax hikes and more government spending.\n  I understand the political realities facing the Senate in this, the \n108th Congress. I understand that a bill featuring $200 billion or more \nin additional tax cuts is not likely to attract the kind of bipartisan \nsupport it needs in order to be marked up in the Finance Committee and \nto make it to the floor of the Senate.\n  Therefore, my goal in introducing this legislation is threefold. \nFirst, I hope to help convince my colleagues of the importance of \nmeeting our WTO obligations this year, by repealing the ETI provision. \nAs our economy struggles to shake off the last recession, the last \nthing we need is to impose large and onerous trade sanctions upon it.\n  Second, I want to expand the options on the table for the Finance \nCommittee to consider when we start putting the bill together this \nautumn. Even in a revenue neutral environment, the ideas put forward by \nmy bill should provide many additional choices for the Committee to \nconsider.\n  Finally, I hope that by introducing this legislation, we will end up \nwith a final bill that will be more beneficial to U.S. domestic and \nU.S.-based multinational companies and their workers. In my view, we \nsimply cannot afford to focus on just workers for domestic companies or \njust on employees of global companies. We need both for our long-term \nprosperity.\n  The bill I am introducing today has four major components. First, of \ncourse, it repeals the ETI provision and provides three years of \ngenerous transition relief. When a representative of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's office testified before the Finance Committee a few \nweeks ago, I asked him what the appropriate phase-out of the ETI \nbenefit might be, so as not to trigger the trade sanctions by the E.U. \nIn reply to my question, he stated that he believed the Europeans would \nview one or two years as a normal and expected phase out period.\n  On the other hand, the USTR official indicated that he believed that \na longer period of, four or five years I believe he said, would \ndefinitely cause some real concern on the part of the Europeans. \nTherefore, I included a three-year phaseout of the ETI benefit in my \nbill. Specifically, the benefits of the ETI exclusion would be phased \nout at the rate of 25 percent in 2004, 50 percent in 2005, 75 percent \nin 2006, and no benefits in 2007 and thereafter.\n  Second, the bill contains a substantial international tax reform \ntitle. Our international tax system is based on two key principles, \nneither of which work very well in practice under our current outdated \nlaws. The first principle is that U.S. companies that pay income tax to \nother countries should not be double taxed on that income. The second \nprinciple is that companies engaged in active overseas businesses \nshould not pay tax on that income until it is returned to the U.S. \nparent corporation. Our current rules violate these principles again \nand again, and I think it's time to return to these principles.\n  For example, our foreign base company tax rules, which make it \nexpensive for companies to create an overseas regional marketing and \ndistribution network for U.S. products, are an anachronism. They hurt \nU.S. exports, and need to be fixed. But we are told that repealing \nthese rules would cost the Treasury too much revenue, and that they may \nopen up opportunities for transfer pricing abuses.\n  Recognizing this revenue concern, I am proposing to allow a repeal of \nthe foreign base company rules as long as the base company is in a \ncountry with which we have a comprehensive tax treaty, or when the U.S. \nparent has an advanced pricing agreement in place with the IRS. These \nbackstops should reduce these concerns about base company repeal.\n  Further, I want to open a debate on the merits of a territorial tax \nsystem. I want to open that debate by proposing an expansion of the \ntemporary dividend repatriation proposal that some of my colleagues \nhave embraced, and that I myself voted for in the Finance Committee and \non the floor. While I believe that such a temporary provision has merit \nfrom an economic stimulus standpoint, I have real tax policy concerns \nabout it.\n\n  Therefore, in my bill I propose a permanent, reduced corporate tax \nrate of 5.25 percent to companies that repatriate foreign earnings to \nthe U.S., as long as they spend that money on higher levels of business \nequipment and research expenditures. Overseas profits can pay for new \nmachines, new research, and better jobs right here at home, and \nmultinational businesses will be given a strong incentive in my bill to \ninvest in such economically positive activities. I hope that my \ncolleagues will give serious consideration to this proposal.\n  In the 107th Congress, Senator Breaux and I introduced S. 1475, a \nbill to provide an appropriate and permanent tax structure for \ninvestments in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the possessions of \nthe United States. That bill would have allowed subsidiaries of U.S. \ncompanies incorporated in Puerto Rico and the U.S. possessions to \nrepatriate active business income earned in these jurisdictions at the \nequivalent of a 5.25 percent tax rate.\n  As I just mentioned, the bill I am introducing today would provide \ngenerally comparable treatment for U.S. subsidiaries incorporated in \nall foreign jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. \npossessions, to the extent the companies invested those repatriated \nearnings on higher levels of business equipment and research.\n  As a result of expanding the scope of last year's bill, I recognize \nthat U.S. companies might not be encouraged to invest in Puerto Rico \nand the U.S. possessions as compared to any foreign country. Since \n1921, the United States has accorded preferential tax treatment to the \nbusiness operations of U.S. companies in Puerto Rico and the U.S. \npossessions. This tax treatment offsets U.S. regulatory mandates--such \nas minimum wage and environmental and safety regulations--and has \nsupported Puerto Rico's industrial development program, which has \nresulted in an increase in Puerto Rico's per capita income from 16 \npercent of the U.S. average in 1948 when the industrial incentives \nprogram began, to 32 percent today.\n  I remain concerned about the economic development of Puerto Rico and \nthe U.S. possessions and therefore will continue to support separate \nlegislation that supports employment and economic opportunity for \nAmerican citizens living in the Commonwealth and the possessions.\n  The third section of my bill extends and expands the research credit \non a permanent basis. This provision is identical to the bill that \nSenator Baucus and I introduced earlier this year. And as many of my \ncolleagues know, a permanent research credit enjoys significant \nbipartisan support here in the Senate, both on and off the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Finally, the bill offers real depreciation reform. The bill offers \nthree years of complete expensing of business equipment and leasehold \nimprovements. It builds on the bonus depreciation incentives we \nincluded in both the 2002 stimulus tax cut bill and the growth tax cut \nbill we passed earlier this year.\n  Essentially, all the same kinds of assets that qualified for the \nbonus depreciation benefits in those two bills would now qualify for \n100 percent immediate expensing under this bill. Moreover, the bill \nwould extend the Section 179 expensing provision for small businesses \nby one full year. Economists tell us that what this recovery lacks is \ncapital spending by business. By building on the incentives we passed \nin the earlier tax bills, we can get capital spending moving again. \nThis will lead to higher productivity and higher wages.\n  I would like to comment on more aspects of the depreciation section \nof my bill. I have been told by some of my business constituents in \nUtah that the bonus depreciation provisions are not\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\nhelpful to them. This is because those companies are currently \nsuffering losses and have no current taxable income. Moreover, some of \nthese businesses have been having difficulties for so long that they \nhave no recent year when tax was paid to which they may carry back a \nnet operating loss.\n  One tax attribute that many of these companies do have, however, is \nprepayment credits under the Alternative Minimum Tax. As many of my \ncolleagues know, the AMT has the perverse effect of hurting companies \nwhen business conditions are poor, thus exacerbating an already \ndifficult financial situation. So, unprofitable companies often find \nthemselves continuing to pay the alternative minimum tax.\n  In order to assist companies like the ones I described, my bill \nincludes a provision that would allow a taxpayer to elect to forego the \nexpensing of newly acquired business property and instead to \neffectively monetize their corporate alternative minimum tax credits to \nthat extent. This simple proposal bestows no new tax benefits on these \ncompanies, but rather delivers the full expensing provision at the time \nit is most needed by the company and in the economy generally.\n  Moreover, this provision helps to equalize the tax treatment between \nfully taxable companies that can take full advantage of tax incentives \nand their less fortunate competitors that cannot at the present fully \nutilize those benefits. Having Congress assist those companies who are \nenjoying good times at the expense of those who are struggling is not \nin the best interest of this nation.\n  I hope this bill will make a positive contribution to the debate in \nboth the Senate and the House. And, I hope the final ETI repeal and \nreplacement bill that the President signs will be more beneficial to \nmore domestic and multinational companies because of the ideas we are \nproposing.\n  Finally, I hope that throughout this debate, as accusations and \nproposals fly back and forth regarding how best to help the U.S. \neconomy, we keep our eyes on the real goal--keeping America's workers \nthe most productive in the world, whether they work in an office park \nor in a factory. And as the 1990s proved beyond doubt, high \nproductivity and lower unemployment rates can easily go hand in hand. \nAs we saw in the 1990s, higher productivity is the key to higher wages \nand better jobs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of my bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nETI Repeal and Replacement Bill--Promote Growth & Jobs in the USA (PRO \n                         GROW USA) Act of 2003\n\n\n                     Section-by-Section Description\n\n            Title I--Repeal ETI & Provide Transition Relief\n\n       Section 101. Repeal of exclusion for extraterritorial \n     income.\n       Provides for repeal of ETI regime with three years of \n     transition relief, (i.e., 75 percent of current benefit in \n     2004, 50 percent in 2005, and 25 percent in 2006).\n\n    Title II--Simplification of Rules Relating to Taxation of U.S. \n                      Businesses Operating Abroad\n\n        Subtitle A--Treatment of Controlled Foreign Corporations\n\n       Section 201. Exceptions from foreign base company sales and \n     services income rules.\n       Provides for repeal of the foreign base company sales and \n     services income rules for income derived either from \n     transactions covered by an Advanced Pricing Agreement with \n     IRS (APA) or from transactions with countries with whom the \n     U.S. has a comprehensive income tax treaty and exchange of \n     information program, excluding Barbados. Provides that \n     transactions in which an APA would not apply will not trigger \n     subpart F income in any case. This provision allows companies \n     to centralize their offshore marketing and sales operations \n     in one country without triggering current U.S. tax.\n       Section 202. Look-thru treatment of payments between \n     related controlled foreign corporations under foreign \n     personal holding company income rules.\n       Dividends, interest, rents, and royalties received by one \n     CFC from a related CFC would not be treated as foreign \n     personal holding company income to the extent attributable to \n     non-subpart F earnings of the payor. Under current law, many \n     companies can already achieve this result through the use of \n     hybrid branches. This provision would simplify the subpart F \n     rules and reduce the expense of international tax planning.\n       Section 203. Look-thru treatment for sales of partnership \n     interests.\n       Treats the sale of a partnership interest by a CFC as the \n     sale of a proportionate share of partnership assets for \n     purposes of determining foreign personal holding company \n     income under subpart F.\n       Section 204. Repeal of foreign personal holding company \n     rules and foreign investment company rules.\n       Eliminates redundancy in the U.S. tax code. Recommended by \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation, in its simplification study.\n       Section 205. Clarification of treatment of pipeline \n     transportation income.\n       Foreign base company oil-related income would not include \n     income derived from a source within a foreign country in \n     connection with the pipeline transportation of oil or gas \n     within such foreign country. Pipeline transportation income \n     is not mobile income, and the arms-length price of such \n     income is readily determined.\n       Section 206. Permanent extension and modification of \n     Subpart F exemption for active financing.\n       Permanently extends the subpart F exemption for active \n     financing income, currently due to expire January 1, 2007. \n     This provision first became law in 1997, and accords with the \n     underlying policy that income earned by a domestic parent \n     corporation from active foreign operations conducted by \n     foreign corporate subsidiaries generally is subject to U.S. \n     tax only when repatriated. Until such repatriation, the U.S. \n     tax on such income is generally deferred. In addition, for \n     purposes of defining ``qualified banking or financing \n     income'' (under section 954(h)(3)), activities conducted by \n     employees of certain related persons are treated as conducted \n     directly by an eligible CFC or qualified business unit in its \n     home country.\n       Section 207. Expansion of de minimis rule under subpart F.\n       Expands Subpart F de minimis rule to be the lesser of 5 \n     percent of gross income or $5 million. Current law threshold \n     is 5 percent of gross income or $1 million. Recommended by \n     the Joint Committee on Taxation in its simplification study, \n     this provision would simplify tax planning for small- and \n     medium-sized companies just starting their overseas \n     operations.\n       Section 208. Modification of interaction between Subpart F \n     and PFIC rules.\n       Adds an exception to the rules governing the overlap of the \n     Subpart F and passive foreign investment company rules for \n     U.S. shareholders that face only a remote likelihood of \n     incurring a Subpart F inclusion in the event that a CFC earns \n     Subpart F income, thus preserving the potential application \n     of the passive foreign investment company rules in such \n     cases. Recommended by the Joint Committee on Taxation in its \n     Enron report. This provision would raise a small amount of \n     revenue.\n       Section 209. Determination of foreign personal holding \n     company income with respect to transactions in commodities.\n       Allows a company to hedge its commodities without \n     triggering Subpart F as long as the company uses these \n     commodities in the course of its business. Since hedging \n     allows companies to lock in long-term prices on commodities \n     with fluctuating spot-market prices, this hedging simplifies \n     long-run business planning, and is an integral part of a \n     company's active operations.\n       Section 210. Repeal of foreign base company shipping income \n     rules.\n       Foreign base company shipping rules are repealed outright. \n     The proposal also relaxes the ``active rents'' test under \n     subpart F for rents derived from aircraft or vessels. \n     Requires the CFC receiving such rental income to be actively \n     in the business of renting or leasing such aircraft or \n     vessels. The current ``active rents'' test, by looking at the \n     CFC's active leasing expense rather than its actual activity, \n     sets too high a bar for companies leasing aircraft and \n     vessels.\n       Section 211. Reduced tax on repatriated earnings previously \n     exempt from tax under Subpart F.\n       Allows companies to repatriate overseas profits at a \n     reduced tax rate as long as those funds are spent to increase \n     U.S. innovation. Specifically, reduces the tax on repatriated \n     earnings by 85 percent, to a 5.25 percent rate, to the extent \n     that a company's spending on equipment and research exceeds \n     an ``innovation baseline.'' The innovation baseline is \n     defined as 85 percent of the average spending on equipment \n     and research over the past three years. This permanent \n     provision encourages companies to repatriate overseas profits \n     that would otherwise likely remain offshore.\n\n         Subtitle B--Provisions Relating to Foreign Tax Credit\n\n       Section 221. Interest expense allocation rules.\n       Modifies current-law interest expense allocation rules by \n     providing a one-time election for the common parent of an \n     affiliated group to allocate and apportion interest expense \n     of domestic members of a worldwide affiliated group on a \n     worldwide-group basis and allows a one-time election for \n     financial subgroups to allocate interest expense by applying \n     fungibility principles on a worldwide basis. Current interest \n     allocation rules assume that money borrowed in the U.S. is \n     used in overseas operations, and thereby reduces reported \n     foreign source income. This may artificially reduce the \n     foreign tax credit limitation, even for companies that have \n     paid substantial foreign taxes.\n       Section 222. Extension of period to which excess foreign \n     taxes may be carried.\n       Allows a 20-year carryforward of foreign tax credits. \n     Extending the carryforward from five years to 20 years allows \n     companies more opportunities to avoid double taxation.\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\n       Section 223. Ordering rules for foreign tax credit \n     carryforwards.\n       Reorders the utilization of foreign tax credits so that \n     credits carried from prior years would be used before current \n     year credits under a first-in-first-out rule, instead of the \n     current-law last-in-first-out rule. By allowing companies to \n     use their oldest foreign tax credits first, this provision \n     would reduce the possibility of double taxation.\n       Section 224. Repeal of limitation of foreign tax credit \n     under alternative minimum tax.\n       Eliminates the arbitrary and unfair 10 percent haircut on \n     foreign tax credits that can be applied to the alternative \n     minimum tax.\n       Section 225. Look-thru rules to apply to all dividends from \n     noncontrolled section 902 corporations.\n       Current law provides look-through treatment to dividends \n     from section 902 corporations for dividends paid out of \n     earnings and profits accumulated from 2003 onward. This \n     provision gives such treatment to all dividends, regardless \n     of the year the earnings and profits from which a dividend is \n     paid were accumulated. The current rules for dividends from \n     section 902 corporations are complex and result in compliance \n     burdens for taxpayers; this provision would simplify the Code \n     and remove these burdens. This proposal is based on a Joint \n     Committee on Taxation recommendation.\n       Section 226. Reduction to 2 foreign tax credit baskets.\n       Reduces number of foreign tax-credit baskets to two: \n     General Category Income and Typically-Low-Taxed Income \n     (TyLT). The TyLT tax basket would include income from the \n     eliminated passive, shipping, and DISC/FSC baskets. The \n     General Category Income basket would include income from the \n     old general limitation basket, as well as income from the \n     high withholding interest income and financial services \n     income baskets. The current-law division of income into \n     multiple baskets is a leading source of tax complexity.\n       Section 227. Recharacterization of overall domestic loss.\n       Allows companies with an overall domestic loss to more \n     easily use their foreign tax credits. This proposal would \n     provide symmetry in the treatment of U.S. and foreign losses \n     for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Current law makes \n     it difficult for companies to use these credits when they \n     have overall domestic losses.\n       Section 228. Repeal of special rules for applying foreign \n     tax credit in case of foreign oil and gas income.\n       Repeals special rules for applying foreign tax credits in \n     the case of foreign oil and gas income. Current law places \n     special restrictions on foreign tax credits derived by the \n     foreign oil and gas extraction industry.\n       Section 229. Increase in individual exemption from foreign \n     tax credit limitation.\n       Increases the current exemption from the foreign tax credit \n     limitation for certain individuals under section 904(j) from \n     $300, $600 in the case of a joint return to $500, $1,000 in \n     the case of a joint return, and indexes those amounts for \n     inflation. This simplifies tax filing for individual \n     investors who hold small amounts of foreign investments.\n       Section 230. U.S. property not to include certain assets of \n     CFCs.\n       Reforms the rules regarding investments in U.S. property by \n     CFCs so that ``U.S. property'' does not include certain \n     securities acquired and held by a CFC in the ordinary course \n     of its business as a dealer in securities.\n       Section 231. Attribution of stock ownership through \n     partnerships to apply in determining section 902 and 960 \n     credits.\n       For foreign tax credit purposes, allows stock owned \n     indirectly through a partnership to be treated as \n     proportionately owned by the partners. By allowing foreign \n     tax credits to pass through to partners, potential for double \n     taxation is reduced. Recommended by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation in its simplification study.\n       Section 232. Provide equal treatment for interest paid by \n     foreign partnerships and foreign corporations.\n       Provides foreign partnerships with the same sourcing \n     treatment on interest payments as foreign corporations. \n     Current law states that if a foreign partnership has any U.S. \n     operations, then any interest paid by that partnership is \n     U.S. source. By contrast, for foreign corporations with U.S. \n     branch operations, only interest payments from the U.S. \n     branch are U.S. source.\n       Section 233. Application of look-thru rules to interest, \n     rents, and royalties.\n       Applies look-through rules to interest, rents, and \n     royalties received or accrued from noncontrolled 902 \n     corporations and entities that would be CFCs if they were \n     foreign corporations.\n       Section 234. Clarification of treatment of certain \n     transfers of intangible property.\n       This resolves an uncertainty that arose in connection with \n     changes made to section 367(d) in 1997.\n\n                      Subtitle C--Other Provisions\n\n       Section 251. Application of uniform capitalization rules to \n     foreign persons.\n       Requires the use of U.S. generally accepted accounting \n     principles rather than UNICAP rules for purposes of \n     determining earnings and profits as well as subpart F income. \n     For most firms, this will prevent companies from having to \n     keep accounting books in both UNICAP and GAAP formats. This \n     simplification proposal was recommended by the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation in its simplification study.\n       Section 252. Treatment of certain dividends of regulated \n     investment companies.\n       Exempts from U.S. withholding tax certain dividends \n     received by nonresident alien individuals or foreign \n     corporations from a regulated investment company. Such \n     exemption would apply to dividends paid out of short-term \n     capital gains and interest income that would itself be exempt \n     from withholding.\n       Section 253. Repeal of withholding tax on dividends from \n     certain foreign corporations.\n       Extends an exemption from the withholding tax to dividends \n     paid by certain foreign corporations. Recommended by the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation in its simplification study.\n       Section 254. Airline mileage awards to certain foreign \n     persons.\n       Grants Treasury authority to exempt from the air travel \n     excise tax amounts attributable to mileage awards issues to \n     persons outside the United States.\n       Section 255. Interest payments deductible where \n     disqualified guarantee has no economic effect.\n       Eliminates the limitation for the deduction of interest as \n     a result of section 163(j) for interest payments on debt \n     guaranteed by a foreign person as long as the taxpayer \n     establishes that it could have borrowed the same amount of \n     debt from an unrelated lender without a guarantee. The \n     Secretary would be granted authority to disregard such a \n     showing if the terms of the loan are substantially \n     dissimilar. This proposal properly focuses the U.S. earnings \n     stripping rules on the realm of possible abuse: related party \n     debt.\n       Section 256. Modifications of reporting requirements for \n     certain foreign-owned corporations.\n       Creates de minimis exception for reporting, and provides \n     companies a 60-day window for translating documents into \n     English.\n       Section 257. Repeal of tax on certain U.S. source capital \n     gains of nonresident aliens.\n       Repeals the tax on net U.S. source capital gains of \n     nonresident alien individuals present in the U.S. for 183 \n     days or more during a taxable year. Recommended by the Joint \n     Committee on Taxation in its simplification study.\n       Section 258. Election not to use average exchange rate for \n     foreign tax paid other than in functional currency.\n       Allows companies an election to use the effective exchange \n     rate on the day of payment rather than an annual average \n     exchange rate. Exchange rates in many countries are volatile, \n     which can turn an annual average rate into an inaccurate \n     indicator of taxable income.\n       Section 259. Study of impact of international tax laws on \n     taxpayers other than large corporations.\n       The Secretary of the Treasury shall conduct a study \n     regarding the impact of the international tax rules on \n     smaller taxpayers, in particular regarding the compliance \n     burden on such taxpayers. The study shall set forth \n     suggestions of how the compliance burden could be reduced for \n     smaller taxpayers. Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a \n     report of such study.\n\n Title III--Credit for Increasing Research Activities, provisions are \n   identical to S. 664, the Hatch-Baucus research credit bill, which \n             enjoys the bipartisan support of 30 senators.\n\n       Section 301. Permanent extension of research credit.\n       The research credit, which is scheduled to expire on June \n     30, 2004, would be extended permanently.\n       Section 302. Increase in rates of alternative incremental \n     credit.\n       The rates of the current-law alternative incremental \n     credit, which is elective, would be increased as follows:\n       Tier One, qualified research expenditures (QREs) in excess \n     of 1.0 percent of base amount,--increase from 2.65 percent to \n     3 percent.\n       Tier Two, QREs in excess of 1.5 percent of base amount,--\n     increase from 3.2 percent to 4 percent.\n       Tier Three, QREs in excess of 2.0 percent of base amount,--\n     increase from 3.75 percent to 5 percent.\n       Section 303. Alternative simplified credit for qualified \n     research expenditures.\n       The proposed alternative simplified credit (ASC) would \n     provide a meaningful incentive for companies to perform R \n     activities in the United States as opposed to other countries \n     that provide more substantial incentives for such activities. \n     The ASC is an elective credit that equals 12 percent of the \n     excess of current-year qualified research expenses \n     (``QREs''), as defined under section 41(b), over 50 percent \n     of the taxpayer's average QREs for the prior three years. For \n     start-up taxpayers, the credit would equal 6 percent of \n     current-year QREs.\n       The election, once made, would apply for taxable years \n     ending after the date of enactment, and all subsequent \n     taxable years, unless revoked with the consent of the \n     Secretary of Treasury. Taxpayers that have previously elected \n     the Alternative Incremental Research Credit (AIRC) could \n     apply the new computational rules or continue to calculate \n     the credit under the AIRC rules.\n\n         Title IV--Reform of Depreciation of Business Property\n\n       Section 401. 100 percent expensing for certain property \n     through 2006.\n       Provides immediate write-off for all business equipment and \n     leasehold improvements, the same property which benefits from \n     the\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\n     2002 and 2003 Tax Acts' bonus depreciation provisions. \n     Effectively, this provision would expand the bonus \n     deprecation to 100 percent and extend it through 2006.\n       Section 402. One-year extension of expensing for small \n     businesses.\n       The expansion of section 179 (allowing small businesses to \n     immediately write off their business property) is extended \n     through 2006, rather than expiring at the end of 2005 as is \n     now the law.\n       Section 403. Election to increase minimum tax credit \n     limitation in lieu of bonus depreciation.\n       Would allow taxpayers making investments in business \n     equipment and leasehold improvements (which would otherwise \n     qualify for immediate expensing under Section 401) to elect \n     to claim accumulated AMT credits in lieu of claiming \n     immediate expensing. Specifically, a taxpayer making the \n     election would forego the expensing and would either reduce \n     its current-year regular or minimum tax liability or be \n     allowed an unlimited carryback of AMT credits in an amount \n     not to exceed the amount of foregone expensing multiplied by \n     0.35, i.e., the assumed corporate tax rate. The provision \n     would expire at the same time as the expensing provision. \n     Taxpayers making the election would not reduce the basis of \n     eligible property and the depreciation adjustments of the AMT \n     would not apply to such property. Provision would expire at \n     the end of 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 1476. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage investment in facilities using wind to produce electricity, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Wind Power Tax \nIncentives Act of 2003. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Dayton. \nThis legislation makes it easier for farmers and others around the \ncountry to invest in wind power for commercial electricity production. \nWind power is a clean, economical, and reliable source of renewable \nenergy abundant on farms and in rural areas in Iowa and elsewhere.\n  With this legislation we can help farmers help themselves by \ndeveloping a new source of income, and help the rest of the country in \nthe production of renewable energy. Farmers are ready to take on this \neffort. A recent study found that 93 percent of corn producers support \nwind energy generally. They also strongly support the farm bill's \nhistoric energy title.\n  This bill complements the farm bill's energy programs and other wind \npower initiatives currently being considered by this body. The bill \nwould make changes to Federal tax law to make the section 45 wind \nproduction tax credit more widely available to farmers, farm \ncooperatives, and other investors. Section 45 of Federal tax law \nprovides a tax credit, currently 1.8 cents per kiowatthour, for \nelectricity actually produced and sold during the first ten years of \nthe life of a wind turbine. The credit has been extraordinarily \nsuccessful in spearheading the installation of new wind power capacity \nby utilities and in bringing down the cost of this sustainable energy \nsource to consumers. However, certain barriers have prevented wide use \nby farmers and other investors.\n  It's time to take the next step and help our family farmers and other \ninvestors benefit from the credit as well. Our legislation does this by \nmaking three changes to the tax code. First, under current tax law most \nlosses, deductions, and credits from passive investments cannot be used \nto reduce taxes on wages or other income. So a farmer who passively \ninvested in wind energy could not use the tax credits to offset taxes \non farm income. This bill creates an exception to passive loss \nrestrictions for an interest in a wind facility that qualifies for the \nsection 45 credit. The wind facility's loss or tax credits could then \noffset the income or taxes on the taxpayer's farming business. Similar \nexceptions currently apply to oil and gas investments. To prevent \npotential abuse by wealthy taxpayers, the exception is limited to \ntaxpayers with income under $1 million.\n  Second, under current law individual and corporate taxpayers are \nsubject to an alternative minimum tax (AMT) if their tax rates fall \nbelow certain levels. Taxpayers subject to an AMT cannot currently use \nthe section 45 wind tax credit. This bill allows a farmer or other \ntaxpayer who invests in a wind electric generating facility to use the \nresulting tax credit against the taxpayer's alternate minimum tax \n(AMT). Similar provisions already exist for several other tax credits. \nAgain, this provision is limited to taxpayers with income under $1 \nmillion.\n  Third, the bill allows cooperatives to invest in qualified wind \nfacilities and pass through the section 45 credits to cooperative \nmembers. This will allow farmers to join together and pool their \nresources in a cooperative and still take advantage of the credit.\n  The benefits of this legislation are obvious. Increased renewable \nenergy production lessens our dependence on foreign oil, provides \nenvironmental and public health gains, bolsters farm income, creates \njobs and boosts economic growth, especially in rural areas. The Nation \nmust move toward energy independence, and domestically produced wind \npower, along with other forms of renewable energy like biofuels, play \nan important part in this endeavor.\n  I want to thank Senator Dayton for co-sponsoring this legislation \nwith me. His leadership in this area will be instrumental to moving the \nbill forward. I am hopeful we can pass this legislation soon to help \nsecure a brighter future for our Nation's farmers and fellow citizens.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1476\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wind Power Tax Incentives \n     Act of 2003 ''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to posthumously award a Congressional gold medal to \nCelia Cruz; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to honor the magnificent life, and \nthe legacy, of Celia Cruz, and to introduce legislation to award her \nposthumously our Nation's highest civilian award, the Congressional \nGold Medal. This award would be an appropriate tribute to Ms. Cruz's \nlife, given her innumerable accomplishments in the world of \nentertainment, her work as an ambassador of Latino culture, and her \nmany contributions to American society.\n  Celia de la Caridad Cruz Alonso was born on October 21 during the \n1920's. She died on July 17, 2003, at her home in Fort Lee, NJ.\n  Over a prolific 50-year career as an entertainer, Celia Cruz, the \n``Queen of Salsa,'' recorded more than 50 albums. Each was a showcase \nof her talent, flair, and the passion she brought to her work. Her \ncollaborative efforts ranged from work with legendary salsa artist Tito \nPuente, pop star David Byrne, and hip-hop producer Wyclef Jean. Through \nthose cross-cultural efforts, Cruz's music reached over four \ngenerations of fans, and helped break down ethnic and cultural \nbarriers.\n  Celia Cruz's gifts as an entertainer were recognized throughout the \nworld, and she won hundreds of awards, most notably a 1990 Grammy Award \nand Billboard Magazine's ``Lifetime Achievement Award'' in 1995. In \n1994, Ms. Cruz was recognized by President Clinton with a National \nEndowment of the Arts award.\n  While best known for her work as an entertainer, Celia Cruz was much \nmore than a singer to her fans, especially to Latinos in America. She \ntouched the lives of millions. The outpouring of sorrow that \naccompanied the news of her passing underscores that point. More than \n100,000 people turned out to pay their respect, and honor the memory of \nCelia Cruz at her wake in Miami, FL. More than 75,000 people lined the \nstreets of Manhattan--some crying, many singing and fondly recalling \nMs. Cruz's life--as her funeral procession made its way from the St. \nPatrick's Cathedral.\n  The enormous outpouring of support that accompanied news of the death \nof Celia Cruz provides some indication about the special nature of this \namazing woman. Her story is that of a girl from meager means in Havana, \nCuba who eventually grew up to become a ``queen.''\n  Celia Cruz was one of 14 children raised in Havana's Santa Suarez \ndistrict. As a child, she could be heard by neighbors as she sung her \nsiblings to sleep. She received her first award in a competition on the \ntalent show La Hora Del Te on Radio Garcia Serra, in which she won \nfirst prize.\n  Her first break came in 1950 when she took over as the lead singer \nwith Cuba's Sonora Matancera. Cruz's first recording was a 78 rpm \nsingle released with Sonora Matancera in January 1951, entitled ``Cao \nCao Mani Picao''.\n  On July 15, 1960, Cruz and members of her band fled Cuba for the \nUnited States, to escape the regime of Fidel Castro. They were able to \nget out by convincing Castro's officials that the group was simply \ngoing on another tour abroad. Enraged by the singer's choice to pursue \nfreedom, Castro never forgave Cruz for this and refused to let Celia \nreturn to Cuba--even as her mother was sick and when her father passed \naway.\n  In the 60's, Celia Cruz and Pedro Knight, her husband and a member of \nthe band, decided to make America their permanent home and Celia Cruz \nbecame a citizen of the United States.\n  During that time, Celia Cruz transformed from a gifted, charismatic \nCuban-American singer to a woman who would become the ``Queen of \nSalsa.''\n  In 1966, she teamed up with the legendary Tito Puente and together \nthey released eight albums. Although her classic style, the origins of \nsalsa, did not immediately appeal to Latin youth during the 1960's, \nCelia Cruz returned with a vengeance after a stint in the Operetta \n``Hommy,'' in the early 1970's.\n  By 1973, Latin pride had begun to take hold in American cities with \nlarge Latino communities--particularly in New York, New Jersey and \nFlorida.\n  In New York, Latin musicians had begun to mix classical musical \nstyles from Puerto Rico, such as Bomba and Plena, with classical \nmusical styles from Cuba, such as Mambo and Son, combining them with \nthe trombone for a more urban sound. This combination created what is \nnow known as salsa--and Celia Cruz was a pioneer of the genre.\n  Ms. Cruz signed with Fania Records, one of the major salsa record \nlabels of the time, and in the summer of '74 released Celia & Johnny, \nthe first in a series of collaborations with Johnny Pacheco. Building \nupon the success of these albums, Cruz then recorded albums with other \ntop leaders on the Fania roster, like Willie Colon, Papo Lucca and Ray \nBarretto, whose bands each had their own trademark sound. She toured \nwith the Fania until 1988.\n  While Latin music has historically been predominately dominated by \nmale artists the talent of Celia Cruz could not be ignored. Her \nflamboyant clothing, charismatic presence, proud\nvoice and her trademark ``Azuuuuuuuuuuuuucar!'' tag line became \nlegendary.\n  In addition to her lucrative recording career, Cruz also had roles in \nseveral American films such as Salsa, the Mambo Kings and the Perez \nFamily. She was a true pioneer.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Celia Cruz received hundreds of awards as a \nresult of her contributions to music, most notable the Grammy Award and \nthe National Endowment of the Arts Award from President Clinton. Her \ncontributions to society and her contributions to Latino culture have \nalso been well recognized. Among those the Presidential Medal in Arts \nfrom the Republic of Colombia and the Hispanic Heritage Award's \nLifetime Achievement Award.\n  Other notable recognitions bestowed upon Ms. Cruz include an honorary \nDoctorate of Music from Yale, a star on Hollywood's ``Walk of Fame,'' \nand the keys to the cities of Union City, NJ; Miami, FL; Dallas, TX; \nand New York City.\n  Those recognitions are all noteworthy, and the life of Celia Cruz \nwarrants each and every one of them. But of the hundreds of awards won \nby Celia Cruz, there is one award that she did not receive, but most \ncertainly deserves the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  This award is considered our Nation's highest civilian honor, and has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\nawarded to a rare and esteemed group of individuals. Notable recipients \ninclude George Washington, Sir Winston Churchill, Bob Hope, Robert \nFrost, Joe Louis, Mother Teresa, and most recently Tony Blair.\n  The standards for considering legislation authorizing Congressional \nGold Medal state that, among other things, ``the recipient shall have \nperformed an achievement that has an impact on American history and \nculture that is likely to be recognized as a major achievement in the \nrecipient's field long after that achievement.''\n  Celia Cruz, music pioneer and the acknowledged ``Queen of Salsa,'' \ncertainly fits the criteria to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. \nCelia Cruz, ambassador of Latin culture, impassioned voice of freedom, \nand American is what the Congressional Gold Medal is about.\n  This award would properly honor the legacy, and the life, of Celia \nCruz. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and \nask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 202\n\n       Whereas 2003 marks the 70th anniversary of the Ukraine \n     Famine, a manmade disaster that resulted in the deaths of \n     millions of innocent Ukrainian men, women, and children and \n     annihilated an estimated 25 percent of the rural population \n     of that country;\n       Whereas it has been documented that large numbers of \n     inhabitants of Ukraine and the then largely ethnically \n     Ukrainian North Caucasus Territory starved to death in the \n     famine of 1932-33, which was caused by forced \n     collectivization and grain seizures by the Soviet regime;\n       Whereas the United States Government's Commission on the \n     Ukraine Famine concluded that former Soviet leader Joseph \n     Stalin and his associates committed genocide against \n     Ukrainians in 1932-33, using food as a political weapon to \n     achieve the aim of suppressing any Ukrainian expression of \n     political and cultural identity and self-determination;\n       Whereas, as a result, millions of rural Ukrainians starved \n     amid some of the world's most fertile farmland, while Soviet \n     authorities prevented them from traveling to areas where food \n     was more available;\n       Whereas requisition brigades, acting on Stalin's orders to \n     fulfill the impossibly high grain quotas, seized the 1932 \n     crop, often taking away the last scraps of food from starving \n     families and children and killing those who resisted;\n       Whereas Stalin, knowing of the resulting starvation, \n     intensified the extraction from Ukraine of agricultural \n     produce, worsening the situation and deepening the loss of \n     life;\n       Whereas, during the Ukraine Famine, the Soviet Government \n     exported grain to western countries and rejected \n     international offers to assist the starving population;\n       Whereas the Ukraine Famine was not a result of natural \n     causes, but was instead the consequence of calculated, \n     ruthless policies that were designed to destroy the \n     political, cultural, and human rights of the Ukrainian \n     people;\n       Whereas the Soviet Union engaged in a massive coverup of \n     the Ukraine Famine, and journalists, including some foreign \n     correspondents, cooperated with the campaign of denial and \n     deception; and\n       Whereas, 70 years later, much of the world is still unaware \n     of the genocidal Ukraine Famine: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the millions of innocent victims of the Soviet-\n     engineered Ukraine Famine of 1932-33 should be solemnly \n     remembered and honored on the 70th anniversary of the famine;\n       (2) the 70th anniversary of the Ukraine Famine should serve \n     as a stark reminder of the brutality of the totalitarian, \n     imperialistic Soviet regime under which respect for human \n     rights was a mockery and the rule of law a sham;\n       (3) the Senate condemns the callous disregard for human \n     life, human rights, and manifestations of national identity \n     that characterized the Stalinist policies that caused the \n     Ukrainian Famine;\n       (4) the manmade Ukraine famine of 1932-33 was an act of \n     genocide as defined by the United Nations Genocide \n     Convention;\n       (5) the Senate supports the efforts of the Government of \n     Ukraine and the Verkhovna Rada (the Ukrainian parliament) to \n     publicly acknowledge and call greater international attention \n     to the Ukraine Famine; and\n       (6) an independent, democratic Ukraine, in which respect \n     for the dignity of human beings is the cornerstone, offers \n     the best guarantee that atrocities such as the Ukraine Famine \n     never beset the Ukrainian people again.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to submit a Senate Resolution \nregarding the genocidal Ukraine Famine of 1932-33. The resolution \ncommemorates the millions of innocent victims of this Soviet-engineered \nfamine and support the efforts of the Ukrainian Government and \nParliament to publicly acknowledge and call greater international \nattention to one of the 20th century's most appalling atrocities.\n  This year marks the 70th anniversary of Stalin's man-made famine, one \nof the most heinous crimes in a century notable for events that \ndemonstrated the cruelty of totalitarian regimes. Seventy years ago, a \nfamine in Soviet-dominated Ukraine, and bordering ethnically-Ukrainian \nterritory in Russia, resulted in the deaths of millions of\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\nUkrainians--estimates range from between four and ten million. In his \nseminal book on the Ukraine Famine, Harvest of Sorrow, British \nhistorian Robert Conquest writes, ``A quarter of the rural population, \nmen, women, and children, lay dead or dying, the rest in various stages \nof debilitation with no strength to bury their families or neighbors.'' \nConquest and many others, including eyewitnesses and recently opened \narchives, chronicle the devastating human suffering of this man-made \nfamine.\n  The Ukraine Famine was not the result of drought or some other \nnatural calamity, but of Soviet dictator Stalin's utterly inhumane, \ncoldly calculated policy to suppress the Ukrainian people and destroy \ntheir human, cultural, and political rights. It was the result of \npurposeful starvation. Communist requisition brigades, acting on \nStalin's orders to fulfill impossibly high grain quotas, took away the \nlast scraps of food from starving families, including children, often \nkilling those who resisted. Millions of rural Ukrainians slowing \nstarved amid some of the world's most fertile farmland, while \nstockpiles of expropriated grain rotted by the tons. Meanwhile, the \nSoviet Government was exporting grain to the West, rejecting \ninternational offers to assist the starving population, and preventing \nstarving Ukrainians from leaving the affected areas in search of food \nelsewhere. The Stalinist regime--and, for that matter subsequent Soviet \nleaders--engaged in a massive coverup of denying the Ukraine Famine. \nRegrettably, they were aided and abetted in this campaign of denial and \ndeception by some Western journalists, including Americans.\n  The final report of the Congressionally-created Commission on the \nUkraine Famine concluded in 1988 that ``Joseph Stalin and those around \nhim committed genocide against Ukrainians in 1932-33.'' James Mace, who \nwas staff director of the Commission, recently wrote: ``For Stalin to \nhave completely centralized power in his hands, he found it necessary \nto physically destroy the second largest Soviet republic, meaning the \nannihilation of the Ukrainian peasantry, Ukrainian intelligentsia, \nUkrainian language, and history as understood by the people; to do away \nwith Ukraine and things Ukrainian as such. The calculation was very \nsimple, very primitive: no people, therefore, no separate country, and \nthus no problem. Such a policy is genocide in the classic sense of the \nwork.''\n  It is vital that the world not forget the Ukraine Famine, honor its \nvictims, and reiterate our support for Ukraine's independence and \ndemocratic development as the best assurance that atrocities such as \nthe famine become truly unimaginable. I urge colleagues to join me in \ncommemorating this genocide perpetrated against the Ukrainian people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10072-1", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 203--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF VANCE HARTKE, FORMER \n             UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR THE STATE OF INDIANA\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Frist, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \nByrd) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

As the distinguished Senator from Alabama noted, this \nwas introduced today by the two Senators from Indiana and by the two \nleaders.\n  We express our heartfelt condolences to the family of Vance Hartke. I \nwas one who admired his work, his leadership. While I did not have the \nopportunity to serve directly with him, his legacy remains today in the \nmany ways he affected public policy during his 18 years in the Senate. \nHe will be missed.

I further ask consent that the Senate recess \nfollowing that vote until 2:15 p.m. for the weekly party lunches.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On behalf of the majority leader, I advise all Senators \nthat the Senate will resume consideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. It \nis the majority leader's hope to dispose of the two pending CAFE \namendments tomorrow morning. In addition, the Senate will conduct its \nthird cloture vote on the Owen nomination for the Fifth Circuit \ntomorrow at 12:15. Therefore, Senators should expect the possibility of \nseveral votes prior to the party lunches. Members will be notified when \nthe first vote is scheduled.\n  For the remainder of the day, the Senate will continue debate on the \nEnergy bill. The Senate may also begin consideration of the Chile and \nSingapore trade agreement bills tomorrow. Therefore, Senators should \nexpect votes throughout the afternoon and into the evening tomorrow.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just to clarify, because I think this is \nan important scheduling to note, if I could ask the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, under this unanimous consent request, it would \nthen appear that there would be a vote on the Owen nomination at 12:15 \nbut that votes on the two pending CAFE amendments, the Durbin amendment \nand the Levin amendment, could occur prior to 11:15, which is when we \nare scheduled to debate the Owen nomination; is that correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As I understand the agreement and the majority leader's \nposition, it is his hope to dispose of those two CAFE amendments \ntomorrow morning. I would think the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is my understanding, that we will have a vote at \n12:15 on the Owen nomination and Senators should be advised there could \nbe one vote, perhaps two votes, prior to 11:15 on the two amendments \noffered by the Senators from Illinois and Michigan having to do with \nthe CAFE standards.\n  I thank the Senator for his answer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/07/28/senate-section/article/S10077-2", "month": "07", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
