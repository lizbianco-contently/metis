Mr. President, I was intending to speak earlier this week \non the subject of trade, but because of the Senate schedule I decided \nto wait until today, when we don't have Senate business that would \nrequire votes.\n\n[[Page S9658]]\n\n  Before I get to the subject of trade, I first want to mention that \nthis morning in the Congressional Daily, there is a lead story that \nsays:\n\n       Growing GOP resistance might doom farm money in homeland \n     funding bill.\n       It says here that House Republican leaders are digging in \n     against a package of drought assistance that Senators added \n     to the Homeland Security appropriations bill.\n\n  The House Republican leaders say that the drought amendment doesn't \nhave a head of steam.\n  I am wondering how is it these leaders seem to think that spending is \nvery important when it comes to funding the reconstruction of Iraq--\nwhich ran through here like a big old truck in fifth gear--but when it \ncomes to spending here at home to help people, in this case helping \nfamily farmers through a real tough time, they say we don't know that \nwe can do that. They are going to dig in our heels.\n  The Senate passed disaster relief for farmers. We also supported \ndisaster relief for the victims of hurricanes. I have never in all the \ntime I have been in Congress opposed disaster relief for those who have \nbeen victims. It seems to me, whether it is the fury of a hurricane \nthat hits your area or drought or some other act of nature or God, when \npeople are victimized, the rest of this country will extend its hands \nand say, you are not alone, we want to help. And we have always done \nthat.\n  For those poor folks in Florida and the rest of the Southeast who \nhave been hit by hurricane after hurricane, we have a responsibility to \nhelp them and we did and we will. We will do more. But it is also the \ncase, for example in my State, where torrential rains meant that 1.7 \nmillion acres of ground couldn't even be planted and family farmers who \nrely on that planting to make a living will lose their opportunity and \nperhaps lose their farm if they don't get help. In August there was a \nfreeze, and that freeze dramatically injured crops. And there was a \ndrought in the southeast part of my State, where between January and \nJuly they received 2.2 inches of moisture in 6 months, and they too \nneed some hope.\n  So when we pass disaster assistance, whether it is for the hurricane \nvictims or for those in agricultural areas that suffer weather-related \ndisasters, and then we hear that there is opposition to this by the GOP \nin the House of Representatives, I ask myself this: Why is it that they \nare so anxious to help everybody except the people in this country?\n  I offered an amendment last year on the floor of the Senate to strip \nabout $20 billion out of the bill for Iraq reconstruction which the \nPresident sent to us. That was the single largest cut in spending \nproposed on the floor of the U.S. Senate last year. Why did I offer \nthat amendment? Because the President said, let's spend this money for \nreconstructing Iraq, when, in fact, Iraq has plenty of money to \nreconstruct itself. Iraq has the second largest reserves of oil in the \nworld. It is perfectly capable, especially with oil prices where they \nare. Iraq is now pumping slightly less than 3 million barrels a day--\nabout 2.5 million. But they clearly have the capability to pump oil and \nsell the oil and raise the money to reconstruct themselves.\n  Instead, what we have is a roads program in Iraq paid for by the \nAmerican people; we have an education program in Iraq paid for by \nAmerican taxpayers; we have a jobs program in Iraq paid for by American \ntaxpayers; we have a health care program for Iraq paid for by American \ntaxpayers. You name it, We have all of these programs in Iraq paid for \nby us, the American taxpayers. The supporters of that bill were rushing \nto get that through the Congress and couldn't get it through quickly \nenough.\n  Now when some folks in this country are hurting and we pass a \ndisaster relief bill to say, you are not alone, we want to give you \nsome help, we have the GOP leaders in the House saying, you can't do \nthat. Why not? That is investing here at home, at least. You were so \nquick to rush $20 billion to Iraq to reconstruct Iraq; how about \nreturning some money to help those family farmers who have suffered \nweather-related disasters?\n  This isn't over. There is going to be a big fight. If that is the \nattitude of other side, we are going to have a big fight about this \nbecause we owe it to those producers across the country who live on the \nland, who go to the fields in the morning alone to plow with nothing \nbut hope that somehow things will work out. When they have weather-\nrelated disasters, they too need some help. They too deserve our help. \nSo this is going to be a big fight.\n  We are not going to sit idly by and have GOP leaders in the House say \nthat this isn't going to happen. It is going to happen one way or the \nother. We are going to make this happen. If we can spend nearly $20 \nbillion on reconstruction in Iraq, this country can surely open up its \npocketbook and provide some much needed help for family farmers in a \nsignificant part of this country who have suffered weather-related \ndisasters. That is a fact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9658-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9658-S9661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTERNATIONAL TRADE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the Senate floor to \nspeak about international trade, a subject about which I've spoken many \ntimes before.\n  I have just finished reading a book by Lou Dobbs. It is a quite \nremarkable book. And I wanted to share some of its observations with my \ncolleagues.\n  At the outset, let me say that Lou Dobbs describes himself in this \nbook as a lifelong Republican. This issue of trade is not the ideas of \none political party or the other; the book is about a failed trade \nstrategy which undermines the strength of this country by shifting \nAmerican jobs overseas. The title of his book is ``Exporting America: \nWhy Corporate Greed is Shipping American Jobs Overseas.''\n  Lou Dobbs has been vilified for writing this book. But it is a rare \nand wonderful book. I am not in the business of selling anybody's \nbooks, but to those who are interested in this issue of what is \nhappening to American jobs, who are interested in what is happening \nwith our trade strategy, this is a good book to read.\n  We have lost nearly 2 million private sector jobs in this President's \nterm, a fair amount of it to outsourcing. The outsourcing issue is one \nwe need to explore in some depth.\n  I offered an amendment on the Senate floor not long ago. It says, let \nus eliminate out of our tax system incentives for American companies to \nshift their jobs overseas. If companies decide to ship jobs overseas, \nwe ought not give them a tax break. That makes no sense at all.\n  Now, on page 19 of this book, Mr. Dobbs writes:\n\n     . . . American multinational companies that are outsourcing \n     and offshoring are also essentially firing their customers. \n     India can provide our software; China can provide our toys; \n     Sri Lanka can make our clothes; Japan can make our cars. But \n     at some point we have to ask, what will we export? At what \n     will the Americans work? And for what kind of wages? No one \n     I've asked in government, academia, or even the private \n     sector has been answering those questions.\n\n  On page 31, Mr. Dobbs says:\n\n       Big business is saying that all we need to do to become the \n     most competitive nation on Earth is to cut wages, throw out \n     our environmental, worker safety, investor protection, \n     product liability, and consumer laws, and eliminate corporate \n     tax obligations altogether--and while we're at it, let's \n     repeal those unfriendly antitrust laws. There's no doubt the \n     result would be sharply lower wages and higher profits, but \n     the result would also be a plummeting standard of living and \n     the shattering of the American dream.\n\n  For writing a book that expresses a radical thought that we ought to \nbe standing up for American jobs and try to find ways to stop shipping \nAmerican jobs overseas, Mr. Dobbs has been wildly vilified.\n  The executive director of the Business Roundtable says this of Mr. \nDobbs:\n\n       It's as if whatever made Linda Blair's head spin around in \n     The Exorcist had invaded the body of Lou Dobbs and left him \n     with the brain of Dennis Kucinich.\n\n  That's from John Castellani, executive director of the Business \nRoundtable. It is such a colorful quote. But it isn't even original. \nDaniel Henninger of the Wall Street Journal had written those same \nwords about Lou Dobbs just 2 months earlier.\n  Let me share a few other of Mr. Dobbs' observations. One of the \npoints he makes, which I have also made on the floor of the Senate \noften, is that the actual rules of trade are now being set by \ncorporations. They have no allegiance to nations, much less individual \ncommunities or towns. They certainly\n\n[[Page S9659]]\n\nhave no allegiance to government. And the corporations set the rules of \ntrade. Mr. Dobbs says:\n\n       Corporations have overwhelmed governments in the borderless \n     global economy. And corporate logos in many cases have more \n     powerful symbolic importance than national flags. In part, \n     that's because more than half of the largest 100 economies in \n     the entire world are corporations.\n\n  Mr. Dobbs in his book used figures from the year 2000 to come up with \nhis conclusions. At the time, Wal-Mart was equivalent to the 25th \nlargest economy in the world. I have actually looked at the figures \nfrom 2003. What you see is that Wal-Mart, when you compare countries \nand corporations by size, is number 20 in the world. Wal-Mart is bigger \nthan Austria, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Turkey, \nDenmark, and Poland, to name a few. But, then, the list of top 100 \neconomies also includes ExxonMobil, so is General Motors, Royal Dutch/\nShell, Ford Motor, DaimlerChrysler, and dozens of other corporations.\n\n  On page 40 of his book, Lou Dobbs says this:\n\n       We might begin by reminding our business leaders and \n     politicians that Americans want to be regarded as citizens, \n     not just consumers, and that they need to see this country of \n     ours first as a nation, not [just] a marketplace.\n\n  It seems to me it is a good starting point for this discussion. There \nis so much effort these days to outsource almost everything, not \nunderstanding that it begins to diminish and erode the basic economic \nstrength of our country.\n\n       Forty state governments are now outsourcing what were \n     American jobs.\n\n  Again, this is from Mr. Dobbs's book.\n\n       The state of Indiana's Department of Workforce Development \n     is responsible for helping out of work Indiana citizens find \n     jobs. Ironically, the department awarded a $15 million \n     contract to update its computers to a firm in Bombay, India. \n     The project would have provided employment to sixty-five \n     workers coming from India on L-1 visas.\n\n  Why would they do that? Because of the millions of dollars it would \nsave. But I expect the taxpayers of Indiana would have preferred their \ntax dollars be used to help those who are out of work in Indiana.\n  Again, this is quoting Lou Dobbs:\n\n       Only after a loud public outcry did the governor of Indiana \n     cancel the contract.\n\n  A recent survey found that 40 States plus the District of Columbia \nhave food stamp help desks that use operators in foreign countries.\n  In January of 2004, the Times of India ran a story with this \nheadline: ``Silicon Valley Falls to Bangalore.'' It says:\n\n       BANGALORE: The inevitable has happened. Bangalore, which \n     grew under the shadow of America's Silicon Valley over the \n     last two decades, has finally overtaken its parent.\n       Today, Bangalore stands ahead of Bay Area, San Francisco \n     and California, with a lead of 20,000 techies, while \n     employing a total number of 150,000 engineers.\n\n  Service jobs are being exported from this country. It is true in \nalmost every single area.\n  Massachusetts General Hospital had a firestorm on its hands when it \nwas learned that the hospital was sending x rays and MRIs to India for \nexamination, even though it is illegal for technicians in India to \ndiagnose U.S. patients. And even though Medicare does not pay for work \ndone outside the United States, hospitals have found a way around that. \nThey just have an American doctor do a cursory review of the work and \nthen sign off on it.\n  This again is from Lou Dobbs's book.\n  Recently, we had a statement by Mr. Greg Mankiw, who is the head of \ndomestic policy, the top economist in the Bush administration, that \ncaused a great deal of consternation. He said that this administration \nsupports outsourcing.\n  Lou Dobbs, I think correctly, points out in his book that both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations have done very little to \naddress these issues and, in fact, in many cases have made them worse. \nSo this is not about one party or the other. Neither political party, \nin my judgment, has developed a set of policies that would address \nthis. I think both political parties have largely been silent on this \nissue or have done things that have made this problem worse.\n  But the current administration has said that outsourcing is really a \ngood policy. In February, the Los Angeles Times reported that the \nadministration, the White House, was endorsing outsourcing.\n  This is what Lou Dobbs had to say about Mr. Mankiw. He said:\n\n       A number of people on Capitol Hill thought Mankiw should \n     have resigned, but I disagreed. On my broadcast . . . I \n     called for the President to fire him. Not merely because I \n     obviously disagreed with him, but because Mankiw's statement \n     raised the administration's support of overseas outsourcing \n     to a declaration of government policy.\n\n  To drive home the point, Mr. Mankiw, the chairman of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers, told reporters that the President plainly \nsupported shifting jobs overseas, provided those jobs could be done \nmore cheaply overseas. This is what Mr. Mankiw said to reporters:\n\n       Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade.\n       More things are tradable than were tradable in the past. \n     And that's a good thing.\n       Maybe we will outsource a few radiologists. What does that \n     mean? Well, maybe the next generation of doctors will train \n     fewer radiologists and will train more general practitioners \n     or surgeons. . . . Maybe we have learned that we don't have a \n     comparative advantage in radiologists.\n\n  And the President's report said this about outsourcing:\n\n       One facet of increased services trade is the increased use \n     of offshore outsourcing in which a company relocates labor-\n     intensive service industry functions to another country.\n\n  In fact, the President's report says when it comes to trade, white-\ncollar jobs should be no different from manufacturing jobs.\n  Well, after many of us raised some real questions about this, \nincluding Lou Dobbs, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan said:\n\n       We certainly don't want to do anything that would undermine \n     free trade.\n\n  Mr. Dobbs concludes: I believe this is a declaration of Government \npolicy with respect to outsourcing.\n  So this is what is happening in the private sector with respect to \nthe outsourcing of jobs.\n  The Wall Street Journal ran a feature article that I read some while \nago that was interesting to me. It was an article on IBM's outsourcing \npractices. It described internal company memos which described a \nstrategy to systematically outsource American jobs overseas.\n  This is from an IBM memo. It says: ``Do not be transparent regarding \nthe purpose/intent'' and cautions that the ``Terms `On-shore' and `Off-\nshore' should never be used.'' The company expects to shift about 3,000 \njobs from the U.S. overseas. So they advise managers on how to \ncommunicate the news to the affected employees. The memo says that \nanything written to employees should first be ``sanitized'' by human \nresources and communications staffers.\n  The plan IBM had, according to the Wall Street Journal, would move \njobs from U.S. locations, including Connecticut, New York, North \nCarolina, and Colorado. It would transfer them to India, to China, and \nto Brazil. It says:\n\n       Some of the foreign programmers will come to the U.S. for \n     several weeks of on-the-job training by the people whose jobs \n     they will take over.\n\n  That's an aspect of offshoring that many high-tech workers regard as \nparticularly humiliating.\n  So this internal memo directs managers to say this to workers about \nto lose their jobs:\n\n       This action is a statement about the rate and pace of \n     change in this demanding industry. . . . It is in no way a \n     comment on the excellent work you have done over the years.\n\n  So see you later. We are going to move your job to India or China or \nBrazil. Thank you. You have done excellent work. The fact that you have \nlost your job is in no way a comment on the excellent work you have \ndone.\n  Now, what are our trade officials doing about this? I will tell you \nwhat--they are trying to facilitate even more outsourcing, by enabling \ncorporations to use even cheaper overseas labor.\n  Let me review some of the trade agreements we have been doing \nrecently. Let me talk about CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade \nAgreement. This would integrate our economy with that of El Salvador, \namong others.\n  This is from a recent news story, describing how El Salvador is \nscarred by child labor. Subsistence work in sugarcane fields leads to \ninjuries, continuing poverty.\n\n       Jesus Franco, 14 years of age, has scars crisscrossing his \n     legs from his ankles to his\n\n[[Page S9660]]\n\n     thighs and more on his small hands. For more than half of his \n     young life, he has spent long days cutting sugarcane. He has \n     the machete scars to prove it, and so do his four sisters, \n     age 9 to 19. His story is repeated countless times across \n     Latin America, where children even younger than he are found \n     working in cane fields at subsistence wages, $75 a month, \n     which isn't even enough to pay for basic food needs.\n\n  So we are now going to integrate our economies with those of El \nSalvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica in a Central America Free \nTrade Agreement and set up our sugar producers for failure. That is \nwhat this is about, among other things.\n  Let me tell you about some kids who came to a hearing we had, who \nwere working in a factory overseas producing rugs. These were kids who \nwere locked in the factories, young kids 10, 11, 12 years old, \nproducing carpets and rugs. We discovered that some of them had gun \npowder put on the tips of their fingers, and then it was lit so that it \nwould burn the tips of their fingers and create big scars on all their \nfingertips. They did that so that when these young kids were sewing \nwith needles, when they stuck their fingers, it wouldn't hurt because \nthey had been scarred by the burns. Young kids with scarred fingers \nusing needles to produce carpets to be sent to our stores. Free trade? \nHardly.\n  Let me give some other examples. I have spoken often about Huffy \nbicycles. They were made in Ohio, manufactured in a plant by people who \nmade $11 an hour and were proud of their jobs. Huffy bicycles were 20 \npercent of the American marketplace for bicycles. They were sold in \nSears and Wal-Mart and K-Mart. Huffy bicycles had a decal on the front \nof the American flag.\n  Well, Huffy bicycles aren't made in the United States anymore. They \nare made in China. They closed the plant, fired the workers, and said: \n$11 an hour is too much for workers in Ohio who make bicycles. We will \nmake them in China. And, by the way, the last job was to take the flag \ndecal off the bike and replace it with a decal of a globe. Now Huffy \nbicycles, if you buy them, are made in China, made by people who work \nfor 33 cents an hour. They work 12 to 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. \nShould we compete with that? Can we compete with that, with kids and \nothers making 33 cents an hour? Huffy bicycles are gone. The people in \nOhio who made them were fired. And Chinese workers now work 7 days a \nweek at 33 cents an hour to make Huffy bicycles.\n  Another American company that moved its production overseas is Radio \nFlyer. They made the little red wagons. Everybody has ridden in a \nlittle red wagon. It was American for 100 years. This is pure \nAmericana, except Radio Flyer is not made here any longer. After 100 \nyears, the jobs of the American people who made the little red wagon \nare gone. The workers were fired. The jobs moved to China for low labor \ncosts.\n  The list goes on and on. Fig Newton cookies. That is an all-American \ncookie. Every kid grew up with a Fig Newton cookie someplace on the \nshelf. But Fig Newton cookies are now made in Mexico. So when someone \nsays to you, let's have some Mexican food, you can say: How about Fig \nNewtons. They left the United States. The people who made them are out \nof jobs.\n  The list goes on and on and on. The question is, Where will it end \nand when will it end? Should American workers be asked to compete with \na 14-year-old working in a sugar field for subsistence wages? Should \nAmerican workers in a textile plant be asked to compete with a 9-year-\nold kid who has gun powder burns on his or her fingertips to spare them \nthe pain of the stabbing of needles when they make the carpets? Should \nan American worker be asked to compete with someone who makes 33 cents \nan hour working in a plant in China making bicycles or Radio Flyer \nlittle red wagons?\n  Let me describe the plight of a young woman in China and describe the \ncircumstances under which we are asked to compete these days by those \nwho want to find the lowest wages available on the face of the Earth \nand fatten profits, even while they diminish the standard of living. \nThis is a story from the Washington Post. It is entitled ``Worked Till \nThey Drop. Few Protections for China's New Laborers.''\n  This picture is of a girl named Li Chunmei.\n  It reads:\n\n       On the night she died, Li Chunmei must have been exhausted.\n       Co-workers said she had been on her feet for nearly 16 \n     hours, running back and forth in the Bainan Toy Factory, \n     carrying toy parts from machine to machine. This was the busy \n     season before Christmas when orders peaked from Japan and the \n     United States for the factory's stuffed animals.\n       Long hours were mandatory, and at least two months had \n     passed since Li and the other workers had enjoyed even a \n     Sunday off.\n       Lying on her bed that night, staring at the bunk above her, \n     the slight 19-year-old complained she felt washed out. The \n     factory food was so bad, she said, she felt as if she had not \n     eaten at all. ``I want to quit,'' one of her roommates . . . \n     remembered her saying. ``I want to go home.''\n       Her roommates had already fallen asleep when Li started \n     coughing up blood. They found her in the bathroom a few hours \n     later, curled up on the floor, moaning softly in the dark, \n     bleeding from her nose and mouth. Someone called an \n     ambulance, but she died before it arrived.\n       The exact cause of her death remains unknown. But what \n     happened to her last November in this industrial town in \n     southeastern Guangdong Province is described by family, \n     friends, and co-workers as an example of what China's more \n     daring newspapers call . . . ``over-work death.''\n       The story of her death highlights labor conditions that are \n     the norm for a new generation of workers in China, tens of \n     millions of migrants who flock from the nation's impoverished \n     countryside to its prospering coast.\n\n  The question for this country is, Do we want to ask the American \nconsumer to compete against companies that work a young girl to death, \nthat put a young boy in a cane field with scars on his legs and arms, \nor put a young child in a factory making carpets? Is that what we want \nto ask our economy to do? Clearly that is importing low wages to this \ncountry. It is not just exporting American jobs, it is importing low \nwages.\n  I want to turn for a moment to a Nobel prize-winning economist named \nPaul Samuelson. I studied Samuelson in college.\n  Samuelson wrote the textbook on economics. If you went to college in \nthe last 30, 40 years, you studied Samuelson. Professor Paul Samuelson \nis now 89 years old.\n  I have such respect for this man, Paul Samuelson. He has, just this \nmonth, started weighing in, at age 89, on the issue of outsourcing.\n  He has always been a free trader, a believer in Ricardo and the \ndoctrine of comparative advantage, and Adam Smith. You know, the common \nsense notion that if you can produce the textiles in England--the sheep \nand the wool and the textiles--and you can raise the grapes in Portugal \nto produce the wine, it makes good sense for England to trade the \ntextiles for the wine, and the English can drink and the Portuguese can \nwear wool. That is the trade we have all learned in textbooks--classic \neconomics, the doctrine of comparative advantage.\n  The New York Times reports, however, that Paul Samuelson is \nrethinking the effects of outsourcing.\n\n       At 89, Paul Samuelson, the Nobel Prize-winning economist \n     and professor emeritus at MIT, still seems to have plenty of \n     intellectual edge and the ability to antagonize and amuse. \n     His dissent from mainstream economic consensus about \n     outsourcing and globalization will appear later this month in \n     a distinguished journal, cloaked in clever phrases and \n     theoretical equations, but clearly aimed at the orthodoxy in \n     his profession.\n\n  I will give you a couple quotes:\n\n       Being able to purchase groceries 20 percent cheaper at Wal-\n     Mart does not necessarily make up for the wage losses.\n       If you don't believe that outsourcing changes the average \n     wages in America, then you believe in the tooth fairy.\n\n  That is Paul Samuelson, speaking today.\n  The fact is, when we talk about the issue of trade and fair trade, \nfor some reason, we have just lost common sense.\n  Let me describe our trade with Korea in the area of automobiles. In \n2003, we imported from Korea 692,000 cars. Guess how many American cars \nwe sold in Korea? We sold 3,800. I will say that again. Ships brought \nKorean cars here, nearly 700,000 of them, and we were able to sell not \nquite 4,000 cars in Korea. Why is that? Is it because we produce a \ndramatically inferior car? No. The Koreans want access to our \nmarketplace. They want to sell to the American consumer, but they don't \nwant American vehicles in Korea. They just don't.\n\n[[Page S9661]]\n\n  We sit around thumbing our suspenders and smoking cigars and \npontificating about free trade, never willing to say to the Koreans: If \nyou want to trade with us, I will tell you what, then be fair. If our \nmarket is open to you, your market must be open to us. If not, sell \nyour cars in Zambia. Go try to sell them there. You don't sell them in \nthe American marketplace unless your market is open to our product.\n  How about China? It is interesting. We did a bilateral trade \nagreement with China. I would love to find the negotiator who made that \ndeal for us.\n  Here is what our negotiator agreed to. After a phase-in, the Chinese \nwill impose a 25-percent tariff on American cars that would be sold in \nChina. And we will only have a 2.5-percent tariff on Chinese cars they \nwant to sell in the United States. The Chinese can have a tariff 10 \ntimes the size of ours on reciprocal automobile trade.\n  I think that is stark raving nuts. Who on Earth could have negotiated \nsuch an incompetent deal? Do we not have people who will stand up for \nthe interests of this country for a change?\n  Here is what I suggest for that trade negotiator. That trade \nnegotiator should have worn this shirt during the negotiations.\n  You know we just finished the Olympics. We asked the Olympic athletes \nto wear a uniform so we could look down and see where they are from, \nand it always says USA. God bless them. I would love our trade \nnegotiator, just once, to wear a uniform that says USA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would love, just once, to ask our trade negotiators to \nwear a uniform so at least they know on whose behalf they are \nnegotiating.\n  I am so tired of what is happening in international trade \nnegotiations. Will Rogers said, 70 years ago, that the United States of \nAmerica has never lost a war and never won a conference. He must surely \nhave been thinking about our trade negotiators. It doesn't matter what \nit is--the United States-Canada FTA, CAFTA, NAFTA, WTO--all our \nnegotiators have to do is show up and lose. They do it routinely.\n  This isn't a partisan issue, international trade. I think both \nRepublicans and Democrats have let this country down. We need a new \ntrade strategy.\n  Globalization is here, that is true. We are not going to turn back \nglobalization, but we at least, by God, ought to have rules that are \nfair to this country and to the workers of this country and to the \nbusinesses of this country that do business here and stay here.\n  I have one final point. This Senate did not even have the strength \nand the backbone to at least shut down the perverse tax incentives that \nreward companies that export U.S. jobs. If we cannot take the first \nbaby step in the right direction, it is a pretty hopeless situation.\n  We will have an opportunity to address these issues next year. I hope \nRepublicans and Democrats today will decide in unison that exporting \nthese jobs hurts this country, and there are policies and approaches we \ncan do to change the fortune of this country's economic future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak in morning business for so much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9661-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9661-S9663]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAQ\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nwar in Iraq and what I consider to be a larger problem confronting this \nNation, indeed, confronting the American people, particularly during an \nelection year. It is really a challenge we all have, and that is how, \nin a country that is founded on the legitimacy of our laws, being \nfounded on consent of the governed, how do the people know what is \nhappening, not just in their Government but in the world? How do they \nget good information?\n  I will give an example. Two nights ago, I received a call from one of \nmy constituents in Lubbock, TX, who said he had heard we were going to \nreinstate the draft because of concerns about Iraq and Afghanistan and \nAmerican forces being spread too thin. Of course, I told him we have \nmore than 2.5 million men and women in uniform, including our Active \nDuty, our Reserves, and our National Guard. I said the phrase I have \ncome to use often, and that is that we are out of balance, but we are \nnot out of troops.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld yesterday spoke before the Armed Services \nCommittee--the distinguished Presiding Officer, of course, is a member \nof that committee and heard those remarks as well--that we are in the \nprocess of restructuring our military forces so we can access more of \nthose forces, so we can put those troops where they need to be. That is \na process that is part of the global posture review and certainly the \nBase Realignment and Closure Commission process that goes forward next \nyear, all of which falls under the heading of transformation.\n  Getting back to the question my constituent asked--which is, I am \nworried because I hear that we may reinstate the draft--I asked \nSecretary Rumsfeld that very question. Indeed, I alluded to a statement \nthat had been made the day before by the Democratic Presidential \nnominee where it was said that it was possible that the President would \nreinstate the draft to handle the war in Iraq if President Bush was \nreelected. This statement followed on a charge last week that the \nPresident was planning a surprise postelection callup of additional \nGuard and Reserve troops.\n\n  I asked the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Rumsfeld, for the record: \nAre there any plans for a postelection callup of additional Guard and \nReserve troops, and is there any truth to this rumor that the President \nplans to reinstate the draft?\n  He gave a very spirited response, but the bottom line is he said: \nThat is nonsense. It is not true. It is false.\n  I guess if he could find other ways to try to get that message \nthrough, he would do that. I cannot remember if it was Mark Twain who \nsaid rumor makes it halfway around the world while the truth is still \nputting on its shoes, or something to that effect. It is in that vein \nthat I come to the floor of the Senate to talk about Iraq.\n  Let me start by sharing the results of a recent nationwide poll of \nthe Iraqi people conducted by the Independent Institute for \nAdministrative and Civil Society Studies. I refer to this poll because, \nof course, like the distinguished Presiding Officer, I am sure she has \nexperienced troops who have been in Iraq and come back to the United \nStates, who read the newspaper accounts, watch TV news, and do not \nrecognize what they are seeing and reading because, indeed, the troops \nin Iraq, in addition to being everyday heroes, are well disciplined, \nmorale is high, and they know they are doing an important job and they \nare getting the job done. But they come back to the States, read a \nnewspaper and watch the news, and they are met with gloom and doom and \npessimism about our prospects.\n  I worry--and I expressed this concern yesterday--that particularly in \nan election season, those of us who are in elected office need to be \nvery careful and very responsible about our statements, even when we \nare in the heat of political combat, because we do not want to do \nanything that would have the consequence of demoralizing our troops or \nbreaking the resolve of the American people as we fight this global war \non terror.\n  But this poll of the Iraqi people I believe is important because it \nconsisted of more than 2,300 household interviews and was distributed \nacross Iraq's 18 provinces. Here are just a few of the interesting \nstatistics this survey reveals:\n  A full 75 percent of the Iraqis expressed hopefulness about the \nfuture of the nation, and more than 70 percent say they would not leave \ntheir country even if they were given an opportunity to live elsewhere.\n  While earlier polls show the Iraqis were concerned with security, and \nthat is obvious to all of us that they would be and should be, as we \nare, the Iraqi police and army are gaining the confidence of the Iraqi \npeople to deal with their transition from a terrible, bloodthirsty \ndictator under Saddam Hussein\n\n[[Page S9662]]\n\nto now this interim government leading up to full democratic elections \nin late January. More than two-thirds of the respondents expressed \ntrust for the Iraqi men and women trying to bring about peace and \nstability and security--that is, the growing Iraqi Army and security \nforces--and, in fact, as the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, the \nsingle largest component of the coalition efforts in Iraq now are \nIraqis. More than 238,000 Iraqis serve as part of that country's \nsecurity force as we speak. As we have heard from Secretary Rumsfeld \nand others, that will continue to grow.\n  General David Petraeus is assigned the job of making sure they are \ntrained. As we train more recruits to become good security forces in \nIraq, it will decrease the pressure on America to provide those \nsecurity forces and others of our coalition partners. That is good news \nto me and I am sure good news to people all across this country.\n  This same survey revealed that the interim government of Iraq is \ntrusted by 65 percent of its citizens.\n  I wish all of us in elected office could claim those sorts of \napproval ratings in the United States, but I will not go there. The \nIraqi courts and judges, the most important component of restoring \nrespect for the rule of law in Iraq, are trusted by more than 64 \npercent of Iraqis responding to this survey of 2,300 households. More \nthan 77 percent of those polled believe that holding regular, fair \nelections is the most important political right for the Iraqi people.\n  I will talk more to that in a moment, because I am afraid there are \nsome who do not believe that the people of the Middle East are capable \nof democracy and doubt their aspirations for liberty. But 77 percent of \nthose polled believe that holding regular, fair elections is the most \nimportant political right for the Iraqi people.\n  Finally, 58 percent of those polled believe that democracy in Iraq is \nlikely to succeed. That is a far cry from the doom and gloom preached \nby some of the naysayers in this election season and, indeed, some of \nwhat we see on our televisions and read in our newspapers.\n  Yesterday, in a joint session of Congress, I had the honor to hear \ninterim Prime Minister Allawi speak. He started out his remarks, after \na few moments, with these words: Thank you, America. Thank you, \nAmerica, for delivering the Iraqi people from a terrible dictator and \ntyrant in Saddam Hussein.\n  He went on to express his appreciation not only for the sacrifices of \nthe men and women in uniform but to all of the people of this great \ncountry who hold the ideal of liberty, freedom, and opportunity as not \njust an American aspiration but something that everyone, every human \nbeing, aspires to.\n  I will quote from his remarks because they go to the heart of the \npessimism that is expressed in some quarters about the Middle East and \nwhat is happening in Iraq. He said:\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen, good will aside, I know that many \n     observers around the world honestly wonder if we in Iraq \n     really can restore our economy, be good neighbors, guarantee \n     the democratic rule of law and overcome the enemies who seek \n     to tear us down. I understand why, faced with the daily \n     headlines, there are these doubts. I know, too, that there \n     will be many more setbacks and obstacles to overcome.\n       But these doubters risk underestimating our country and \n     they risk fueling the hopes of the terrorists.\n\n  I will read that again because it is so important. Prime Minister \nAllawi said:\n\n       But these doubters risk underestimating our country and \n     they risk fueling the hopes of the terrorists.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Despite our problems, despite our recent history, no one \n     should doubt that Iraq is a country of tremendous human \n     resources and national resources.\n       Iraq is still a nation with an inspiring culture and \n     tradition and an educated and civilized people. And Iraq is \n     still a land made strong by a faith which teaches us \n     tolerance, love, respect and duty.\n       Above all, they risk underestimating the courage, \n     determination of the Iraqi people to embrace democracy, peace \n     and freedom, for the dreams of our families are the same as \n     the dreams of the families here in America and around the \n     world. There are those who want to divide our world. I appeal \n     to you, who have done so much already to help us, to ensure \n     they don't succeed.\n       Do not allow them to say to Iraqis, to Arabs, to Muslims, \n     that we have only two models of governments, brutal \n     dictatorship and religious extremism. This is wrong.\n       Like Americans, we Iraqis want to enjoy the fruits of \n     liberty. Half of the world's 1.5 billion Muslims already \n     enjoy democratically elected governments.\n       As Prime Minister Blair said to you last year when he stood \n     here, anywhere, any time ordinary people are given the chance \n     to choose, the choice is the same: freedom over tyranny, \n     democracy not dictatorship, and the rule of law not the rule \n     of the secret police.\n       Do not allow them to convince others that the values of \n     freedom, of tolerance and democracy are for you in the West \n     but not for us.\n       For the first time in our history, the Iraqi people can \n     look forward to controlling our own destiny. This would not \n     have been possible without the help and sacrifices of this \n     country and its coalition partners. I thank you again from \n     the bottom of my heart.\n\n  Finally, the Prime Minister said:\n\n       And let me tell you that as we meet our greatest challenge \n     by building a democratic future, we the people of the new \n     Iraq will remember those who have stood by us. As generous as \n     you have been, we will stand with you, too. As stalwart as \n     you have been, we will stand with you, too. Neither tyranny \n     nor terrorism has a place in our region or our world. And \n     that is why we Iraqis will stand by you, America, in a war \n     larger than either of our nations, the global battle to live \n     in freedom.\n\n  I believe that lengthy quote is worth hearing again because I also \nwant to talk a minute about the nature of the threat we confront and \nthat Prime Minister Allawi spoke of, not just a war confined to Iraq \nbut indeed a global war on terrorism.\n  It was 3 years ago this month that we were forced to realize as a \nnation that the terrorist foe we had been fighting on the margin for \nyears sought a more deadly goal than we ever suspected. The terrorist \nthreat we battle today does not just seek victory over America; it \nseeks an extermination of our unity, our culture, our liberty, \neverything that makes America the envy of the free world today.\n  I think of recent expressions I have read. The 9/11 Commission did a \nvery good job of expressing the nature of the threat Prime Minister \nAllawi spoke of and that we confront today. Under its recommendations, \nthe 9/11 Commission said:\n\n       The enemy is not just ``terrorism.'' It is the threat posed \n     specifically by Islamist terrorism, by Bin Ladin and others \n     who draw on a long tradition of extreme intolerance within a \n     minority strain of Islam that does not distinguish politics \n     from religion, and distorts both.\n       The enemy is not Islam, the great world faith, but a \n     perversion of Islam. The enemy goes beyond al Qaeda to \n     include the radical ideological movement, inspired in part by \n     al Qaeda, that has spawned other terrorist groups and \n     violence. Thus our strategy must match our means to two ends: \n     dismantling the al Qaeda network and, in the long term, \n     prevailing over the ideology that contributes to Islamic \n     terrorism.\n\n  Skipping down a paragraph, they conclude from this reading:\n\n       What should Americans expect from their government? The \n     goal seems unlimited: Defeat terrorism anywhere in the world.\n\n  We have seen--and it is not a matter of taking my word for it or even \nthe 9/11 Commission's word for it or Prime Minister Allawi's word for \nit--that the war we are fighting is not confined to Iraq. It is not \nconfined to Afghanistan. In fact, I think those who suggest otherwise \nare ignoring the lessons of history, as well as the sage words of the \n9/11 Commission, the Prime Minister, and others.\n  We have seen the evil works of this terrorist wave, and not just on \n9/11. We saw the attack on the USS Cole in 2000, an attack that killed \n17 American sailors and wounded 39. We saw the bombing in Bali in \nIndonesia 2 years ago. We see, it seems like with horrible regularity, \nPalestinian suicide attacks in Israel, and the United Nations compound \ncar bomb attack in Iraq.\n  This year alone we have seen massacres in Madrid, the Twin Tupolev \nbombings in Russia, and the suicide car bomb attacks in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Most recently, we have seen the butchery by terrorists who \nmurdered children in the schoolyards of Beslan.\n\n  No, the war on terror is not limited to Iraq. It is not limited to \nAfghanistan. They are but fronts in the global war we are waging today. \nIn fact, it was the combatant commander, the Central Command General \nJohn Abizaid, who only a couple of months ago admonished all of us in \nthe Senate not to look at the war as though looking through a soda \nstraw, not to look at what is happening in Afghanistan and at what is \nhappening in Iraq and say this is all there is, this is reality.\n\n[[Page S9663]]\n\nIndeed, some have even suggested that the war in Iraq is a diversion \nfrom the real war on terror. But, of course, that is flying in the face \nof the facts: the long litany of terrorist attacks in many different \nparts of the world, the presence of Al Qaeda forces and allies in Iraq, \nand, of course, what Prime Minister Allawi has said as well.\n  Indeed, during this political season when international affairs and \nthe war on terror is a prime topic in political debates and \ndiscussions, there appears to be an attempt to decouple Iraq from the \nglobal war on terrorism, to suggest that it is a distraction. But I \nhope I have convinced those within the sound of my voice that cannot be \ntrue; that is not true. Indeed, I believe that argument is a disservice \nto the American people and our forces in the field, whose resolve must \nremain strong as we continue to fight this great scourge on humanity.\n  Under President Bush's leadership, despite the naysayers who claim \nthis task could not be done, we have confronted this evil for what it \nis. We have employed the very best weapon America has to offer: the \npower of our ideals and the power of liberty. Even as we battle them \naround the world, the terrorists have flocked to specific points to \nbattle us. As coalition forces liberated Iraq and Afghanistan, they \nhave been attracted to Iraq and Afghanistan like moths to the flame. \nWhy? Because they realize that their dark ideology of hate will not--\ncannot--survive the spreading light of freedom.\n  The spread of democracy, the new foundation of the rule of law, and \nthe creation of fledgling representative governments that honor and \nrespect human rights--together these actions spell out the increasing \nmarginalization of the terrorists, as they have fewer and fewer places \nto run and hide. Ultimately, they herald the end of terrorism as we \nknow it.\n  Of course, none of us asked for this task. We cannot erase 9/11, as \nmuch as our hearts desire it. We cannot change the past. But we must \nacknowledge that this responsibility has fallen to us--in this time, in \nthis generation--and we must and we will win by fighting this enemy \nwhere they plot and plan, so we do not have to fight them on American \nsoil.\n  I want to reiterate: We must always remain conscious in this body as \nelected officials, as representatives of our States and of this great \nNation--we must always be conscious of the fact that the words we say, \nparticularly during an election season, can have a broad and negative \neffect on the morale of our soldiers in the field. We must continue to \ngive our forces all the support they need and stay focused on our goal. \nAnd while our enemies began this fight on their terms, we will finish \nit on ours.\n  We will widen the span of the democratic peace into places where the \nenemy trains and recruits. We will liberate the people held under the \nyoke of darkness and despotism for generations. And around the world we \nwill hear the rumble of millions of people waking to discover that yes, \nat long last, they are free.\n  Madam President, the terrorists have heard a great noise in Iraq--and \nit is the sound of their doom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9663-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9663-S9665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SECRET HOLDS\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I think if you walked down the streets of \nthe small towns in North Carolina or Oregon and asked people what the \n``secret hold'' is in the Senate, my guess is you would not find one \nout of a thousand people who would have any idea what this \nextraordinarily important rule is here in the Senate. As the President \nknows, it is possible for any Member of this body to put a hold on a \nbill or nomination, and do it in secret. It is one of the most \nextraordinary powers a Member of the Senate has.\n  Senator Grassley and I have led, over more than 5 years, a bipartisan \neffort to try to change it, to have some sunlight over the secret hold. \nWe have been fortunate to have the support of Senator Lott and Senator \nDodd. Senator Byrd has been exceptionally helpful on it. I am very \nhopeful that we will finally get this changed when the Senate resumes \nin January, after the election.\n  Senator Frist has been very kind meeting with us. He, of course, \nbecame the leader and had a lot on his plate besides the question of \nreform of Senate rules. But we saw again last week why this is so \nimportant. Right in front of the desks here in the front of our \nChamber, we saw Senators scurrying around, trying to figure out who had \na hold on their bill; who, in effect, was using in these last few days \nof our proceeding with our work before the election, who was holding up \nlegislation they had worked on for months, and in a couple of cases, \nfor years.\n  I think this is fundamentally wrong. The rules of this body and the \nprecedents established, as Senator Byrd has taught us so well, make so \nmuch sense. But this is a flagrant example of abuse of the rules, to \nhave in the last few days of a Senate session Senators scurrying about \nhere in the front of the Chamber, trying to figure out who is objecting \nto something they have worked on.\n  I think we all ought to be held accountable. If you object to a \nnomination or a piece of legislation, fine. But with that right should \ncome accountability. I am very hopeful we can get those rules changed. \nAnd in the spirit of changing those rules, Senator Grassley and I have \nsaid we are in effect going to jump-start the process by making it \nclear that if we have an objection to the consideration of a nomination \nor a bill, we are going to come to the floor and announce it.\n  For that reason, I want to take a few minutes and outline why I \npublicly have placed a hold on the nomination of Deborah Majoras to \nchair the Federal Trade Commission. She now serves in a recess \ncapacity. Of course, the FTC is the agency that is in a very strong \nposition to protect the American consumer from price gouging at the gas \npumps. But instead of doing its job, the Federal Trade Commission, in \nmy view, has chosen to waste the taxpayers' money by very recently \nissuing a self-serving report that they use to justify their lack of \nenforcement action to block oil companies from merging.\n  In making these comments, I want to make it clear that there are a \nhost of reasons why gasoline prices are going up. Worldwide demand is \ncertainly a big factor. We see that higher demand is contributing to \nhigher prices, particularly in the case of China. Certainly the \nmischief of OPEC is a very significant factor. Certainly the inability \nto put in place the kind of conservation practices our country needs in \nthe transportation sector. There are a host of reasons why gasoline \nprices have soared. But the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO), our \nindependent body that audits these kinds of issues, said in an \nimportant recent study that the oil industry mergers the Federal Trade \nCommission keeps approving are a significant factor in why gasoline \nprices are so high.\n  In fact, the GAO found that the oil industry mergers that went \nthrough in the 1990s increased concentration in the oil industry \nsignificantly and increased gasoline prices for consumers by as much as \n7 cents per gallon on the west coast of the United States.\n  Let us acknowledge there are a variety of reasons that gasoline \nprices have soared. But the GAO has found in an independent review that \nthe policies of the Federal Trade Commission with respect to mergers \nhave hammered the consumer, especially on the west coast of the United \nStates, and in effect caused a shift of dollars out of the pockets of \nthe consumer and into the pockets of those oil companies that benefit \nfrom these mergers.\n  In effect, the Federal Trade Commission again and again has tried to \noffer excuses for their inaction on this oil company merger issue. In \ntheir recent report, the Federal Trade Commission tries to excuse their \ninaction by claiming that gasoline prices at the pump are determined by \nworld oil prices.\n  Again, no one disputes that can be a factor. But the record shows \nthere is a lot more to this than the Federal Trade Commission's \nsimplistic analysis.\n  Yesterday, for example, the price of a barrel of oil soared to $49 \nper barrel, just short of the all-time highest price on record. \nYesterday's price is 15 percent higher than the price of oil was just \nbefore the Memorial Day weekend.\n  In effect, there is a 25-percent difference in recent gasoline prices \nthat cannot be explained by the Federal\n\n[[Page S9664]]\n\nTrade Commission's simplistic analysis. Clearly, there is a lot more \ngoing on in U.S. gasoline markets than can be accounted for by world \noil prices alone.\n  In the hearings we held in the Commerce Committee, I have repeatedly \ncited the need on a bipartisan basis to make the case for why we need \nthe Federal Trade Commission to do a better job of watchdogging these \noil company mergers and protecting the consumer against anticompetitive \npractices.\n  I have asked repeatedly about this new study from the GAO. I have \nasked about the fact that the FTC issued a report which I think vastly \noversimplifies the reasons why gasoline prices are so high and is an \nexcuse to look the other way on this issue of oil company mergers. But \nthe GAO is not alone in documenting how the Federal Trade Commission \nregulators have been missing in action when it comes to protecting the \nAmerican consumer at the gas pump.\n  Since 2001, according to Bloomberg News, oil industry mergers \ntotaling $19.5 billion have been unchallenged by the Federal Trade \nCommission. Bloomberg reports also that these unchecked mergers have \nplayed a role in contributing to the highest gasoline prices in the \npast few decades.\n  According to our review and the Federal Trade Commission's own \nrecords, the agency imposed no conditions on 28 of 33 oil mergers since \n2001.\n  You can see the result of the Federal Trade Commission's inaction on \nthis issue at gas stations in Oregon and across the country.\n  Nationwide, the GAO found that between 1994 and 2002, gasoline market \nconcentration increased in all but four States. As a result of Federal \nTrade Commission merger policies, 46 State gasoline markets now face \nsignificant concentration which is almost double what we faced in 1994.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, oil industry officials, and consumer \ngroups in effect now agree that in concentrated gasoline markets--and \nthere are 46 gasoline markets, and I represent one of those markets--\nthe oil companies do not need to go out and directly collude in order \nto raise prices. They don't need to go off to a steakhouse somewhere \nand sit down and in effect set the prices. The Federal Trade \nCommission's own general counsel said recently:\n\n       It may be possible in selected markets for individual firms \n     to unilaterally increase their prices.\n\n  So what you have is the Federal Trade Commission's general counsel in \neffect admitting that the oil companies in these concentrated markets \nhave so much clout that in specific instances, they can price gouge \nwith impunity.\n  Despite all of the evidence that gasoline markets around the country \nhave become concentrated, and in these concentrated markets, individual \nfirms can raise prices and extract monopoly profits, the Federal Trade \nCommission sits on its hands.\n  The General Accounting Office, in a May 2004 report, identified two \nmajor changes that even occurred in the gasoline market as a result of \nthe wave of oil industry mergers and increased concentration during the \n1990s.\n\n       First, the availability of generic gasoline, which is \n     generally lower priced than branded gasoline, had decreased \n     substantially. Second, refiners now preferred to deal with \n     large distributors and retailers which has motivated further \n     consolidation in distributor and retail markets. The net \n     results of these changes are likely to be higher prices and \n     fewer choices for consumers when they purchase gasoline, \n     especially in the concentrated markets. We have seen almost a \n     doubling of the markets that are concentrated in recent \n     years.\n\n  Despite the troubling findings of the General Accounting Office's \nreport, Deborah Majoras has given no indication that she would in any \nway change the Federal Trade Commission's review of oil mergers. My \nsense is that Ms. Majoras hopes the General Accounting Office report \ndisappears, that somehow Members of the Senate, who are busy and have \nlots of assignments, are going to go on to other things and are going \nto forget about this report which documents that the policies of the \nFederal Trade Commission are hammering the people I represent in Oregon \nand up and down the west coast.\n  As far as I could tell, when she is not trying to ignore the General \nAccounting Office report, she has taken steps to discredit the work of \nthe General Accounting Office as she did in a letter to me.\n  An additional reason for my concern is that at virtually every \nopportunity, Deborah Majoras passes on the opportunity to even use her \noffice as a bully pulpit to say that she is concerned about this issue. \nWhen she came for her confirmation hearings, she didn't even mention \nhigh gasoline prices among the issues she thought warranted \nconsideration in her opening statement.\n  She didn't provide one significant new action she would take to \naddress this urgent consumer issue. On August 16, Ms. Majoras received \na recess appointment, and in the weeks since her recess appointment, \nthere is no evidence that anything is going to change. As far as I can \ntell, the evidence indicates the campaign of inaction on competitive \nprices in the gasoline markets will continue. For example, Deborah \nMajoras announced that her priority as Federal Trade Commissioner is \ngoing to be involved in the national campaign on obesity. Well, I don't \ntake a back seat to anybody in terms of fighting this problem. In fact, \nSenator Frist and I have introduced legislation directed at the growing \nproblem of childhood obesity. I hope Deborah Majoras will testify at \nthe hearing to be held the first week in October on the Frist-Wyden \nlegislation to tackle this serious problem of obesity.\n  But I come to the floor to say one reason I will continue the public \nhold I have on the Majoras appointment is that as she works on the \nimportant issue of obesity, she also needs to turn her attention to \nthose oil companies feeding off American consumers' hard-earned money. \nAs far as we know today, on her watch it is going to be business as \nusual in the gasoline market, with more oil company mergers, more \nconcentration of oil and gas industries and higher gasoline prices for \nconsumers at the pump. In my view, it is hard to find a more important \nconsumer protection issue that the Federal Trade Commission has a \nresponsibility for than overseeing competitive prices in our gasoline \nmarkets. High gasoline prices act like a tax on the consumers that \nreduces their purchasing power.\n  On average, gasoline prices are 20 cents a gallon higher than they \nwere at this time last year. These higher prices mean a typical family \nis spending $600 more this year to fill the gas tanks in their car than \nthey were a year ago.\n  Despite the urging that I and other colleagues have done, it has been \nhard to see the administration take any action to give the consumer a \nbreak from these record-high gasoline prices they have been paying \nthroughout the year. I think it is interesting that there was a new \ndevelopment with respect to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the last \n24 hours. In the last 24 hours, the administration announced it is \nnegotiating to provide loans of oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve at the request of oil refiners to help keep their refineries \nsupplied because of shortages of crude oil supplies in the Gulf of \nMexico following the recent hurricanes.\n  I want to be clear. If there are significant supply shortages that \ncan be relieved by the release of Strategic Petroleum Reserve oil, then \nI am all for making that oil available. That is what the Strategic \nReserve was created to address. But I think it needs to be pointed out \nthat this administration has a double standard with respect to using \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They are willing to use the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve to help big companies when they are in a jam, but \nthey are not willing to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help the \nlittle guy when the little guy is getting clobbered.\n  So I very much hope we will see a change in the administration's \npolicies with respect to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Let's use it \nwhen we need to help companies, which seems to be the case with respect \nto the situation in the Gulf following the recent hurricanes. But let \nus not have a double standard that says we will use the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve to help the big and powerful and sit on our hands \nwhen the little guy is getting hammered.\n  Let me close simply with one last point with respect to the role of \nthe Federal Trade Commission. I intend to keep the public hold on the \nMajoras appointment for as long as it takes, until\n\n[[Page S9665]]\n\nthat time when we see changes at the agency that will promote \ncompetition in our gasoline markets. Ms. Majoras has given no \nindication at her confirmation hearing or since then that she is going \nto change the Federal Trade Commission's oil companies' merger \npolicies, which the GAO found in an independent review have increased \ngasoline prices for consumers.\n\n  Ms. Majoras didn't even believe high gasoline prices were enough of a \nproblem for consumers to mention them in her opening statement at the \nconfirmation hearings. When I and others pressed her at the hearing to \nsay what she would do to protect consumers from higher gasoline prices, \nwe were not given one example of how to address this urgent issue. She \nsubsequently offered the committee a blueprint for inaction. Out of \nseven so-called commitments she wanted to make, three are a \ncontinuation of the status quo, and three essentially are public \nrelations activities. Only one would involve something new--an \ninvestigation of a refinery closure using a subpoena, which is sort of \nlike sending a search party after a horse that was turned loose years \nago.\n  Since her recess appointment more than 4 weeks ago, Ms. Majoras has \nmade it clear that protecting consumers from getting gouged at the gas \npump is simply not a priority.\n  For these reasons, I have placed a public hold on the Majoras \nnomination. I intend to continue to object to any unanimous consent \nrequest for the Senate to consider this nomination, until we see that \nthere are going to be some changes at the Federal Trade Commission to \nprotect gasoline consumers, particularly the ones I represent on the \nwest coast of the United States, who are now getting mugged at the gas \npump.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9665-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9665-S9666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE ADMINISTRATION POLICY IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, it has been another interesting week in \nthe public debate on Iraq. Yesterday, a joint session of Congress was \nconvened to hear the address of the Interim Prime Minister of Iraq, \nIyad Allawi.\n  I have heard many foreign leaders address joint sessions, and I have \nfound many of those addresses compelling, powerful, historic. Last year \nwe heard the Prime Minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, give a \nriveting speech, where a leader of a famous center-left democratic \nparty forcefully supported our President and his administration on a \nquestion that has always been best served when the parties join \ntogether: the question of war and security.\n  We all remember the speech Prime Minister Blair gave, and the \nrationale he reiterated for joining his nation's forces to the cause of \nthe coalition's liberation of Iraq. Prime Minister Blair and I come \nfrom two different political traditions, and we represent two different \npolitical philosophies, but I respect him and I admire him. His speech \nwas one of the best speeches I have heard given in a joint session.\n  But yesterday's speech by Interim Prime Minister Allawi was truly one \nof the most historic speeches by a foreign leader before this Congress.\n  Prime Minister Allawi was direct in his gratitude for the U.S. \ncontribution and sacrifice to liberate his country from tyranny. He was \ncompelling in his declaration that the Iraqi people are determined to \nmove forward in assuming their security and in conducting free and fair \nelections. And he committed his Government's partnership to fighting \nterrorism in that region and throughout the world. The House Chamber \nwas fully packed by my colleagues from both parties. The Prime Minister \nreceived much applause and, to the best that I could see, that applause \ncame from all of us. I am happy to recognize this because Prime \nMinister Allawi is not the Republican's ally in Iraq, he is America's \nally in Iraq.\n  As we know from his biographies in the press, the Prime Minister has \nworked with American administrations before this one, including a \nDemocratic administration. He is not beholden to Democrats or \nRepublicans. He is beholden to the cause of an Iraq that is free from \nterror and tyranny. And he has the scars to prove that.\n  This is why I was so appalled to hear some of the criticisms of Prime \nMinister Allawi that emanated from the other side yesterday. None was \nso appalling as this statement, quoted in today's Los Angeles Times, by \nJoe Lockhart, a senior adviser to the Kerry campaign:\n\n       The last thing you want to be seen as is a puppet of the \n     United States.\n\n  Now, what a thought to put out. What a condemnation of a man who \nrisks his life every day for freedom in Iraq and freedom throughout the \nwhole Middle East and freedom throughout the world.\n  ``The last thing you want to be seen as is a puppet of the United \nStates,'' said Mr. Lockhart who, last I checked, was not known for his \nforeign policy expertise. He continued:\n\n       You can almost see the hand underneath the shirt today \n     moving the lips.\n\n  Now, Madam President, this quote will be read in Iraq today. The \nreason it can be read in Iraq today is because today Iraq has freedom \nof the press.\n  The reason there is freedom of the press today is because a brutal \ntotalitarian dictatorship was deposed by a U.S.-led coalition. The \nreason there is freedom of the press today is because the United States \nhas sacrificed over 1,000 of our young men and women to free a country \nfrom a dictator who tortured his people, gassed his subjects, invaded \nhis neighbors, associated with terrorists and al-Qaida, built and hid \nweapons of mass destruction, repeatedly violated international law \nrequiring him to reveal the whereabouts of those weapons of mass \ndestruction, never allowed international inspectors to confirm the \ndestruction of those weapons, and never--never--ceased his virulent and \nhostile rhetoric against the United States, and who caused the death of \nat least 300,000 of his own fellow countrymen who now or did lay in \nmass graves.\n  Madam President, you know what is underneath the shirt of Prime \nMinister Allawi? Scars from an ax attack by Saddam's henchmen. And do \nyou know what is underneath those scars? A brave and patriotic Iraqi \nheart, beholden to no one but the cause of a free Iraq.\n  The Democratic spokesman's statement was a calumny, pure and simple. \nIt was a cheap and pathetic shot from a man whose only combat \nexperience is bullet points in 10-point font. It was a cheap jab to a \nman who barely survived an ax attack ordered by a tyrant we have \ndeposed, and who has been four times--four times--targeted by the \nterrorists and gangsters who kill our troops and the Iraqi people and \nwho would kill us if they could.\n\n  But let me be plain. The statement was worse than a calumny. It was a \ndeliberate attempt to undermine our mission in Iraq. And I am sick and \ntired of some suggestions I have heard in the press recently that we \ncannot speak plainly about these matters.\n  Prime Minister Allawi is as legitimate a politician as anyone in Iraq \ntoday. He has fought for the cause since before Joe Lockhart chose the \npencil as his weapon of choice. He can list more fallen, tortured, \nvanished comrades than Joe Lockhart can list maitre d's. He is the \nIraqi Interim Prime Minister because he was chosen last June by the \nIraqi Governing Council--Iraqis, if you will--to lead his own country. \nHe is the man we are relying on to lead us to elections in January, \nwhich is a key aspect of our policy in Iraq.\n  We are not there but to liberate these people. And we have done so, \nso far. And I am getting sick and tired of some who have found fault \nwith this in the most discouraging of ways. I think some of those \ncomments undermine our young men and women over there. How would you \nlike your sons or daughters over there to have to read this drivel that \nnot only has been said by Mr. Lockhart but others who have continually \nmaligned this war, continually maligned our cause, continually maligned \nour leaders, and, by implication, our efforts in this war?\n  When a Democratic spokesman publicly says Prime Minister Allawi is a \npuppet, which Prime Minister Allawi clearly is not, and he says so in a \nway that Iraqis under fire from terrorists and gangsters can read, \nthere is no way we can conclude that this is not undermining the \nInterim Prime Minister.\n  When the Interim Prime Minister is undermined, our political ally in \nIraq is undermined. And when our political ally in Iraq is undermined, \nthe work of\n\n[[Page S9666]]\n\nour soldiers--whose mission is to create the security to support our \npolitical strategy--is undermined. Their work is undermined.\n  Recently, there has been some tut-tatting in some of the press and \nthe antiwar movement that such declarations as I have just made are \nbeyond proper discourse.\n  Let me be clear: A state of war should give no cause for inhibiting \nfree speech in a democratic society, and I would tolerate no \nrestriction of free speech here or anywhere in the country.\n  After all, Michael Moore is free to denounce every manifestation of \nAmerican foreign policy; is he not? And we are upholding his right to \ndo so, as ridiculous and inane and asinine as his comments are. His \nantiwar work includes Serbian propaganda clips in defense of genocide \nin ``Bowling for Columbine'' to nice pictures of playful Iraqis \npeacefully flying kites in the halcyon days of Saddam Hussein, which is \nin his latest virulently anti-Bush creed, and, of course, cheered on by \nsome of our colleagues on the other side. The man is not an idiot, but \nhe acts like an idiot, and he is undermining our young men and women \nover there.\n\n  But likewise, honest policy debates--and the comments on the role \nrhetoric plays--should also not be restricted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thought I had 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business with 10-minute \ngrants.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think I can finish in the next 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. When a Democratic spokesman calls Prime Minister Allawi a \npuppet, that is not a suggestion as to what the Prime Minister could \nbetter do in his difficult job. That is a statement that undermines the \nPrime Minister, our ally in a war against terror and tyranny. And when \nyou undermine our principal ally in a war against terror and tyranny, \nyou are undermining our cause.\n  Madam President, I buried my brother-in-law at Arlington Cemetery \nlast week. I spoke of him on the Senate floor yesterday. He was a tough \nsergeant in the Marines. He had that unique pride that I have come to \nso admire in the Marines. His modesty over his sacrifices for his \ncountry was surpassed only by his love of his country. He was a true \nhero. He fought in Korea and Vietnam, and he bore the wounds of Vietnam \nthrough his life. Agent orange exposure killed him. And to his dying \nday, he thought the cause he fought for in Vietnam was just.\n  Last May, the Democratic nominee in this fall's Presidential campaign \nwas quoted as saying that President Bush ``didn't learn the lessons of \nour generation in Vietnam.'' I find this remark staggeringly ironic.\n  Let me say this, Madam President. I honor the service of all who \nfought bravely and honorably in Vietnam--everyone, without exception.\n  But there are two different interpretations of our Vietnam policy. \nThe antiwar movement's view on our Vietnam policy concluded that the \nuse of American power was immoral and not to be trusted. Today, that \nworld view is still very strong, overseas and here among the American \nleft.\n  It has not changed much, except that, today, the left, which still \ndistrusts the use of American power, believes that that power must be \nchecked by the international community. That view holds that American \npower is illegitimate without the sanction of other powers, including \nthe United Nations.\n  There is another view on Vietnam policy that my late brother-in-law \nheld. And that view is that the sacrifices of those who fought nobly \nand bravely in Vietnam are to be forever honored. That view--my view--\nis that the American military won that war. When President Nixon signed \nthe Paris Peace Treaty in early 1973, U.S. forces fighting with South \nVietnam had secured South Vietnam. The war was lost when the north \nviolated that peace treaty and a Democratic Congress failed to provide \nthe arms and funds to help an ally defend itself from an invasion \nsupported by the Soviets and the Chinese.\n  We made many policy mistakes in Vietnam, and the enslavement of the \nsouth to communism was a sad conclusion whose responsibility must never \nbe borne by those who fought, but by those who failed to hold the \ncourse.\n  Do you know what one of the earliest policy mistakes we made was? It \nwas when, under the Kennedy administration, the decision was made to \nstop supporting the Diem administration in South Vietnam. When that \nhappened, the south lost a leading figure, a political leader. Diem was \nno democrat, but he was our political ally. We dealt ourselves a \nserious political blow when we failed to support Diem. He was \nassassinated, and our political goals were undermined.\n  I am not going to stand by and be silent when our ally, Prime \nMinister Allawi, is undermined by rhetoric from a top spokesman of the \nother party. Because some people need to understand that rhetoric has \nconsequences.\n  Let debate rage, I say. Let the anti-war movement have its say, and \nlet Michael Moore collect his fees on college campuses. But I believe \nthat, in a time of war, we need to hold ourselves to higher standards \nof intellectual content, honesty and clarity.\n  Recently we have heard a lot about a CIA analysis from earlier this \nsummer. Am I the only one to notice that the people who have been \ndeclaring that CIA analyses are unreliable are treating this latest \nanalysis as holy writ? That the people who have taken the good work of \nChairman Roberts and our committee--which did a stark and honest review \nof the failings of pre-war intelligence--and concluded that the CIA \ncannot be trusted are now asking us to conclude, based on an analysis \nno one has read, that the President is lying?\n  A CIA analysis is just that: analysis. It is more than guesswork, but \nit is a lot less than prediction. Yes, the situation could go bad in \nIraq--very bad.\n  But at no time in American history has an administration conducting a \nwar concluded during a dark hour that success was no longer attainable. \nThat is not leadership. To focus on the course to success is not lying. \nIt is leadership. To focus on the darkness of the hour is not.\n  The situation in Iraq is difficult, but it will not go bad, because \nwe will not accept failure as an outcome. Failure would endanger our \nsecurity, and this administration will not allow that.\n  We are in a charged political season. The American public will choose \nwho they believe will best ensure their security. I would ask all who \nopine to remember that, while we are in a political season, we are in a \nwar. Let us criticize as best we can, but let us do just that: as best \nas we can.

Mr. President, I believe this body is about to \nconsider and pass the North Korea Human Rights Act and our amendment in \nthe nature of a substitute. It is cleared through the House of \nRepresentatives and is on our consent calendar. It is about to clear \nthrough here, I believe, and I am thankful to the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the staff of the committee, the chairman and ranking member, \nfor their work getting this moved forward.\n  This is about the fundamental human rights of the people of North \nKorea. It is my hope that this will pass today--and if not today, at \nleast Monday.\n  It is no secret that North Korea policy continues to be a matter of \nintense debate at the highest levels of our Government and governments \naround the world. Reasonable people with good intentions disagree \nvehemently on various aspects of what an appropriate North Korea policy \nshould be.\n  This is why I am pleased that the Senate, along with the House of \nRepresentatives, will soon be able to come together in unity and speak \nclearly on one particular set of issues regarding North Korea, and that \nis the most fundamental rights, human rights, of the\n\n[[Page S9667]]\n\npeople of North Korea, and to put that in a policy position.\n  The people of North Korea have endured some of the most horrendous \nassaults on the inherent dignity of human beings of any group of people \nin the world. Inside North Korea, the totalitarian dynasty of the Kim \nregime permits no dissent and maintains an inhumane system of prison \ncamps that houses an estimated 200,000 political inmates.\n  I have held a hearing on this. We have had satellite photography. \nPeople who have left the country have testified about this system of \ngulags that exists and is in operation today in 2004.\n  The regime strictly prohibits freedoms of speech, press, religion, \nassembly, and movement. Torture and execution, often in public, are \nregular tools of state control. Since the collapse of the centralized \nagricultural system in the 1990s, more than 2 million North Koreans are \nestimated to have died of starvation and related diseases. That is \nnearly 10 percent of the total North Korean population--over 2 million \npeople.\n  North Koreans outside of North Korea are also targets of abuse. Many \nthousands are hiding inside China, which currently refuses to allow the \nU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to evaluate and identify genuine \nrefugees among the North Korean migrant population. This is so even \nthough China is a signatory and has obligations as a party to the U.N. \nRefugee Convention.\n\n  China forcibly returns North Koreans to North Korea where they \nroutinely face imprisonment and torture and sometimes execution. The \nstories from North Korean refugees who are able to get out are \nabsolutely horrific.\n  Inside China, North Korean women and girls are particularly \nvulnerable to trafficking and sexual exploitation. Recent reports also \nindicate that chemical and biological experiments are going on in the \ncountry's gulags inside North Korea.\n  Let me explain what the bill does. The bill promotes the human rights \nof North Koreans by funding private, nonprofit human rights and \ndemocracy programs, increasing the availability of nonstate-controlled \nsources of information to North Koreans and U.S. broadcasting into \nNorth Korea, urging additional North Korea-specific actions by the U.N. \nHigh Commission on Refugees and by the U.N. Human Rights Commission.\n  The bill promotes responsible assistance to the North Korean people \nby increasing funding for humanitarian assistance to North Koreans \noutside North Korea. This would include refugees, orphans, widows, and \ntrafficking victims.\n  The bill endorses U.S. support for providing humanitarian aid inside \nNorth Korea but conditioning increases over current levels upon \nsignificant improvements in transparency, access, and monitoring. To \ndate, we have had no transparency; very little monitoring has been able \nto take place of the humanitarian aid we have provided to North Korea. \nIt conditions future direct aid to the North Korean Government on \nsubstantial progress on human rights and transparency benchmarks.\n  Let me elaborate a little bit on this final point. In an AP story \nthis morning that ran in the Kansas City Star, appearing in many papers \nacross the country, the headline reads: ``North Korea Asking for More \nForeign Aid.'' The article quotes an NGO official that the North Korean \nGovernment wants not only additional humanitarian aid but also \ntechnical assistance and developmental cooperation.\n  At the same time, we have stories and information from Secretary of \nState Colin Powell warning North Korea against conducting a new missile \ntest.\n  It would be naive for us to think that North Korea was not making a \nconnection between the two. That is, if aid is not forthcoming, they \nwill test new missiles. If that is not blackmail, I don't know what is. \nThis bill will make it clear that as a matter of U.S. policy, we will \nnot give in to those threats.\n  At the same time, I doubt that anyone in this body would oppose \nproviding aid if there were assurances that the distribution and use of \nsuch aid were conditioned on substantial improvement in human rights \nand transparency benchmarks, that NGOs would get complete access to \nvulnerable populations, that such aid would be clearly marked and \ntargeted for children and people in need and not the North Korean \nmilitary apparatus, and that the North Korean Government demonstrates \nthat it is cooperating with NGOs.\n  The bill additionally protects refugees by clarifying U.S. policy \ntoward North Korean refugees, and the eligibility of North Koreans for \nU.S. asylum and refugee processing; urging the U.N. High Commission for \nRefugees to use all available means to gain access and provide \nassistance to North Koreans in China; and seeking solutions to North \nKorea's lack of access to refugee protections.\n\n  As amended, the bill also asks the President to appoint a special \nenvoy for human rights in North Korea, a person of high distinction. We \nhave in mind someone such as former Senator John Danforth, now the U.N. \nRepresentative for the United States to the U.N., who was so \ninstrumental in bringing together the north/south peace accords in \nSudan.\n  In addition, the bill requires a number of reports that will keep the \nissue of human rights front and center so that even as we continue to \nseek a resolution to the nuclear issue, which we should, that this \nmatter of human rights is not swept under the carpet and that the \nmatter of human rights does not become a mere afterthought.\n  For too long, we have challenged rogue regimes on such fundamental \nissues and values as freedom of thought, religion, assembly, and press \nto back down now. We are not going to. We are going to continue to \nchallenge rogue regimes, such as North Korea, on how they treat their \nown people.\n  As experience has taught us, during the Cold War and the battle over \nideas during that period, these are some of the most effective ways in \nwhich we can promote freedom: open and democratic institutions within \nthese countries.\n  Recently, a leading member of South Korea's Congress said to me in my \noffice that North Koreans fear the West's criticism of its human rights \nmore than any criticism about its nuclear program. North Korea will \nthrow up all kinds of bluster when it comes to their threat as a \npotential nuclear power, but if you engage them on human rights, they \nbecome silent because even they know they cannot hide from the shame of \nthe crimes they have committed against their own people.\n  With this bill, the regime in Pyongyang will now have to answer for \nitself in multiparty talks or any other setting on such matters as the \ngulags, chemical experiments on human beings, the denial of food and \ndeliberate policies of starvation as a political tool, and a thousand \nother ways they violated human rights by which this regime in Pyongyang \nmaintains its tenuous hold on power.\n  I know some were concerned about the impact of the bill, but the bill \ndoes not tie the hands of the President and ongoing negotiations over \nNorth Korean nuclear activities. Rather, I believe this bill will \nstrengthen our negotiating position.\n  As I said at the outset, I thank the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee and the ranking member, Chairman Lugar and Ranking \nMember Biden, and their staff for their assistance in getting this bill \nto the floor. Hopefully, as I said, it will clear on Monday.\n  I thank the International Relations Committee, Chairman Leach of the \nAsia Pacific subcommittee and his staff, Jamie McCormick and Doug \nAnderson. Both Chairman Hyde and Congressman Lantos were critical in \nsecuring a bipartisan consensus in getting this bill to the floor in \nthe House.\n  I also recognize Peter Yeo of Mr. Lantos' staff and Sean Woo of my \nstaff for the tremendous work in getting this moving forward.\n  There is a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, a human rights crisis, \nand I believe on a humanitarian basis, we are seeing in places such as \nNorth Korea and the Sudan a use of a humanitarian tool to maintain \npower and, in the process, people are dying and being killed.\n  Countries such as North Korea and Sudan have created an axis of death \non their own people. This should not be, and it should not be allowed \nto take place in this world today. We need to stand up for the human \ndignity of\n\n[[Page S9668]]\n\nevery person, wherever they are located in the world.\n  The North Korea Human Rights Act highlights this problem and \nestablishes a position for this country that hopefully will be a model \nposition for many countries around the world in dealing with the human \nrights tragedy inside North Korea.\n  I thank the Members of this body for allowing this presentation. I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, South Dakotans have always been generous \nwhen our fellow Americans, even those living thousands of miles away, \nare suffering.\n  After September 11, we saw equipment makers, firefighters, school \nchildren, scout troops, church organizations, and countless other South \nDakotans donate whatever they could to the victims. One ranch couple, \nthemselves struggling, even sold 100 calves and dedicated the proceeds \nto the victims.\n  As hurricanes ravaged, and continue to threaten, Florida, South \nDakotans sent not only their prayers, but also generators and plywood. \nYet, while all of these things have taken place, South Dakota has been \nexperiencing its own disaster, the slow-motion disaster of drought.\n  For the last several years, South Dakotans have been impacted to \nvarying degrees by drought. In fact, 2002 was the worst drought since \nthe Dust Bowl year of 1936. That is why I have worked so hard to get \nnatural disaster aid for our state in the 2002 farm bill. The provision \nwas not in the House-passed farm bill, and it was opposed and \neventually stopped by the administration.\n  That is why I felt that as the Senate considered disaster assistance \nfor the people of Florida, it was time for us to look for ways to help \nthe people of South Dakota and other areas of the Nation who have been \nthe victims of agricultural disasters. Make no mistake about it, this \naid would help farmers and ranchers in Florida who have lost a majority \nof their citrus crop, much of the nursery stock and hundreds of head of \ncattle. In fact, farmers in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and \nGeorgia and all along the eastern seaboard were seriously damaged by \nthe myriad hurricanes, and the devastation may not be over. But for \nfarmers and ranchers in the upper Midwest, the drought has continued \nfor years.\n  On August 17, I wrote to the President expressing my support for \nassistance to hurricane victims and asking him to include other natural \ndisaster victims, including drought-related disaster relief, in any \nemergency-funding request that he might send to Congress. While the \nBush administration did not include this funding in its emergency \nhurricane funding requests, I still believed there was a way to secure \nthis assistance.\n  When the first disaster assistance bill for Florida was on the floor \nof the Senate, I attempted to include agricultural disaster assistance \nin that legislation. While a procedural maneuver blocked that effort, \nwe were able to secure a commitment from Senator Frist to allow a vote \non drought relief as part of the Homeland Security appropriations \nmeasure. On September 15, we got that vote, and the Senate passed a \nbipartisan provision for $2.9 billion in emergency disaster relief to \nagricultural producers.\n  This is a tremendously important for farmers and ranchers throughout \nthe Nation, including those in South Dakota. It is important for our \nnation's rural economy, and for all of the communities that have waited \ntoo long for this relief.\n  The package includes $2.5 billion in assistance to crop producers \nthrough the crop disaster program, $475 million to livestock producers \nthrough the livestock assistance program, and $20 million for the tree \nassistance program. While some of us would have preferred assistance \nfor both 2003 and 2004, the provision that passed would allow producers \nto choose compensation for either the 2003 or 2004 crop year.\n  The Senate's passage of this assistance is not the final step in this \nprocess, and the Senate and the House are currently meeting to resolve \nthe differences they have with the Homeland Security bill.\n  I am deeply troubled by news reports that some in the House \nRepublican leadership and the Bush administration are opposed to this \nmost recent emergency aid provision. I would hope that the broad \nbipartisan support for this disaster provision in the Senate will \nconvince the House and the President to provide the support farmers and \nranchers across the country so badly need.\n  I wholeheartedly support providing States like Florida with the \nassistance they need to bounce back from a hurricane. By unanimously \napproving this agriculture-related disaster aid, the Senate also \nacknowledged something South Dakotans know far too well: victims of \nagricultural natural disasters are no less deserving of assistance than \nvictims of hurricanes, floods, or tornadoes.\n  In South Dakota, we believe in helping our neighbors through tough \ntimes. But sometimes, we need some help, too.\n  I am hopeful that help will soon be on the way, and the \nadministration will reverse its long-standing opposition to \nagricultural disaster aid for farmers and ranchers throughout the \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9668-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9668-S9669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STATUS OF THE TRANSPORTATION BILL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the state \nof the transportation bill. That bill expired a year ago, and we have \nbeen operating on short-term extensions ever since. The delay has \ndenied us the opportunity to create over 100,000 jobs and has led to \ncontinuing uncertainty in the States as they try to make contract and \nconstruction decisions without knowing what funding will be available. \nOur states, our communities, and our infrastructure deserve better.\n  It is not as if there have been no efforts to pass a new and stronger \ntransportation bill. The Senate-passed transportation bill was a model \nof bipartisanship. It met the needs of States like South Dakota, which \nhave a sparse population, but have a large geography and many miles of \nroads. Likewise, it ensures that the more populated States were treated \nfairly.\n  In the Senate bill, we were able to reach an agreement that worked \nfor everyone. Our bill not only treated States fairly, but it treated \ntransit fairly. There has often been a struggle between highways and \ntransit, and the Senate bill struck a good balance. More importantly, \nit was a bill that did right by America's families, making critical \ninvestments in our infrastructure, and creating nearly 2 million jobs \nin the process.\n  The one area where we were unable to reach agreement was on the rail \nprovisions, and I am hopeful that we can work to remedy that as we move \nforward. Having a dependable and affordable rail system to transport \ngoods, including agricultural commodities, is critical to our Nation.\n  It is clear to me that despite the broad bipartisan agreement we were \nable to reach in the Senate, the rejection of that agreement by the \nPresident and some of the House majority leadership means that we are \nbeing denied the opportunity to debate and pass a bipartisan \ntransportation bill.\n  Senators Bond and Reid have suggested that we give some certainty to \nthe States by ensuring that they will have a steady funding stream for \nthe next 6 months. Senator Shelby and Senator Sarbanes, our leaders on \nthe Banking Committee and on transit issues, agree. I, too, think that \nthis is, unfortunately, the best course of action given the situation \nin which we find ourselves. And so I am hopeful that the majority \nleader will take up the bill early next week.\n  The reason for not completing this bill is clearly over the question \nof resources. The administration has not been willing to consider any \nbill that is anything other than their proposed $256 billion. In fact, \nthe President threatened to veto both the House and Senate-passed bills \nbecause they contained\n\n[[Page S9669]]\n\ngreater levels of investment. And yet, to invest significantly less \nthan the Senate was willing to invest fails to meet the goals I just \ndiscussed: to treat all States and modes of transportation fairly.\n  That does not mean that the Senate level is the only level and that a \nlong-term bill cannot be completed at a lower investment level. But I \nhave not seen, nor do I believe that anyone has seen, a willingness to \nseriously discuss that possibility.\n  Thus, we find ourselves in the unfortunate position of once again \nbeing up against the end of another extension. Rather than keeping \nStates in the dark about their future, it seems to me that the \nbipartisan approach of Senators Bond, Reid, Shelby and Sarbanes makes \nsense. In fact, several transportation groups have also called for a \nlonger-term extension. As I said, I hope and urge the majority leader \nto take up the Bond-Reid transportation extension early next week.\n  Transportation has, by and large, been a bipartisan endeavor. After \nall, our economy, our infrastructure, and our Nation's families need \nand deserve a good transportation bill, one that will create good jobs \nand provide the investments in our Nation's infrastructure that are so \ndesperately needed. I am hopeful that we can do better, that we will \nrenew our efforts and continue to work as hard as possible to find the \nbipartisan solution that has been so elusive. And I hope that we can \nreach that compromise sooner rather than later.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9669-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HOMELAND SECURITY NEEDS A GREEN LIGHT, NOT A BLUE SLIP\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last week, the Senate approved \noverwhelmingly the fiscal year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations \nbill. This bill makes critical investments in our protections here at \nhome. And in light of the constant threat warnings from law enforcement \nand homeland security officials, those investments cannot be made \nquickly enough. Yet it has been 10 days since the Senate passed the \nmeasure and the House has not even appointed conferees.\n  Why has any progress toward protecting the people hit a brick wall? \nThe legislation is in jeopardy because of the judgment of the chairman \nof the House Ways and Means Committee. I do not intend to talk about \nthe chairman in a negative light. But I must point out to Senators that \nthe chairman's actions could jeopardize the entire Homeland Security \nAppropriations bill.\n  During Senate debate, Democrat and Republican Senators worked to \ninvest additional dollars in homeland security. We must work to close \nthe gaps in our protections here at home. Too many exist, and you can \nbe sure that, if we know where those gaps are, so do the terrorists.\n  That is why it was welcomed on both sides of the aisle when the \nSenator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, suggested a way to include $784 \nmillion in homeland security protections without violating arbitrary \ncongressional spending limits. The Senator from Montana suggested that \nwe help to protect Americans from terrorist attack by extending \nexisting customs user fees that are set to expire in March 2005. It was \na commonsense approach, one that I applaud Senator Cochran, the \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Homeland Security panel, and the \nmajority leader, Senator Frist, for embracing. It was common sense \nbecause many of the agreement provided funding to key programs within \nthe Department of Homeland Security, most of which are customs related, \nand did so without violating the budget caps or adding to the deficit.\n  The Senate adopted that funding, approved the bill, and asked the \nHouse for a conference. We were making progress. We were helping to \nsave lives.\n  But then came the disappointment. The Senate was informed that the \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee has recommended that the House \nof Representatives ``blue-slip'' this legislation, returning the \nmeasure to the Senate. But the funding will help to protect this \ncountry from attack, and we should not allow congressional turf battles \nto stop it.\n  Congressman Martin Olav Sabo, the ranking member of the House \nAppropriations Homeland Security Subcommittee, and I have written to \nthe Speaker of the House and urge that the Speaker help to move this \nlegislation forward. We ought to send it to conference, complete our \nwork, and help to protect our country. Delay is unacceptable.\n  The additional funding provides needed investments to protect our \nborders, equip first responders, enhance air and rail security, and \nensure that security measures are provided to harden potential \nterrorism targets.\n  Specifically, the additional funding will allow Customs and Border \nProtection to purchase additional radiation detectors to respond to the \nthreat of a nuclear or radiological weapon being smuggled into this \ncountry. CBP is far behind on its plan for deploying 2,037 radiation \nportal monitors at our ports. The additional $50 million provided by \nthis amendment will allow CBP to deploy radiation portal monitors to \nscreen 100 percent of inbound containerized cargo at 30 additional \nseaport terminals.\n  This investment will provide Immigration and Customs Enforcement with \nan additional $50 million to address a manpower shortage within the \nFederal Air Marshal program and be more aggressive in placing air \nmarshals on high-interest flights.\n  The funding being stymied in the House would increase resources to \nequip and train our nation's firemen by providing an additional $50 \nmillion through the fire grants program, which is one of the best run \nprograms in the Federal Government.\n  The money would address the shortage of border employees by providing \n$150 million for more border inspectors and agents, and immigration and \ncustoms criminal investigators. The Department of Homeland Security has \nnot yet met the northern border staffing goals set in the U.S. PATRIOT \nAct. An additional $50 million is also included for the detention and \nremoval of illegal aliens.\n  This amendment strengthens the northern border by providing an \nadditional $200 million to speed up the development of five air wings \nalong the northern border which will track, identify, and intercept \naircraft that are unauthorized to enter U.S. airspace.\n  The funds advance efforts to protect the millions of Americans who \nuse public transportation over 32 million times per work day. The \nadditional $128 million was approved by the Senate so that the \nDepartment can pursue investments to harden the security of transit \nsystems by investing in additional law enforcement, canine teams, and \ntraining.\n  The legislation invests an additional $56 million to the Emergency \nManagement Performance Grants program to help emergency managers at the \nstate and community level to prepare, respond, and recover from all \nhazards.\n  Finally, the bill ensures that $50 million goes to high-risk non-\nprofit organizations to develop security plans and make necessary \nimprovements to prevent a terrorist attack.\n  The Department of Homeland Security is working day and night to stop \npotential terrorist attacks. But the Department cannot operate if it \ndoes not have any money. We cannot wait to address gaps in our nation's \ndefenses while this new department is crafted. Terrorists will not wait \nto attack anew.\n  We cannot afford delay. The Senate has passed this critical \nlegislation; now it requires the approval of the entire Congress. This \nbipartisan legislation must move quickly to bolster our weaknesses, \naddress our shortfalls, and protect American lives.\n  I urge the Speaker, and the chairman of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee to drop this threat of delay. The President, the Vice \nPresident, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, \nthe CIA Director, and the FBI Director have each stated quite clearly \nthat the country is at risk of attack. It serves no one's best \ninterests to bicker over turf battles when lives are at stake. For the \nsake of the people, for the sake of the nation, I urge the House to \nstrengthen the homeland security protections and make life more \ndifficult for the terrorists. Don't blue-slip this funding. Green light \nit instead.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9670-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9670]]\n                    WORKING FAMILIES TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the conference report \npassed yesterday by the Senate, the Working Families Tax Relief Act of \n2004. I supported this legislation, which will continue tax relief for \nthousands of middle-class families in Wisconsin and across the country. \nMost importantly, this bill provides for the extension of the $1,000 \nchild tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and the 10 percent bracket. \nThe bill also includes extensions important to business, such as the \nResearch and Development tax credit, which expired in June of this \nyear. Finally, the bill includes an acceleration of the increase from \n10 to 15 percent of refundability in the child credit, a provision that \nhelps the families who need it most. The end of the fiscal year is in \nsight, and the expiration of these cuts would negatively impact middle-\nclass families throughout the country. I supported this legislation \nbecause I believe it is the responsibility of Congress to do its best \nto provide economic stability for hardworking American families.\n  However, by passing this legislation, Congress is also failing in its \nresponsibility to our troops. Under current law, many soldiers are \nunable to claim the Earned Income Credit or the child tax credit \nbecause combat pay is excluded from the definition of earned income. \nMembers of the conference had an opportunity to permanently solve this \noversight in current law--despite Democratic efforts, the conference \nreport only solves the problem for two years. Without a permanent \nsolution, men and women serving on the front lines could potentially \nsee a tax increase in 2006. I believe Congress has a responsibility to \nthese brave men and women, and I hope we fulfill it before the end of \nthe year.\n  This legislation is far from perfect. However, I believe that the \nbenefits it will provide to middle class families across America are \nessential in today's economy. I thank my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9670-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FOREIGN OPERATIONS APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the fiscal year \n2005 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill.\n  Recently, the release of the 9/11 Commission report gave us all \nreason to redouble our efforts to focus on the importance of the \nforeign policy and foreign assistance priorities that are addressed in \nthis bill. The commission's intelligence reform proposals have been the \nfocus of most of the media attention surrounding the 9/11 report, but \nthe commission's call for more focused, effective ways to attack the \nterrorists and their organizations, and, critically, to prevent the \ncontinued growth of Islamist terrorism, deserve equally intense \nexamination and certainly deserve action. If we are to leave our \nchildren a safer world, we must take the long view in this struggle, \nand we must find ways to regain the kind of international support and \nresolve that emerged in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. That \nsupport--so critical to any effort to deny terrorists sanctuary, to \nunravel their financial networks, and to effectively piece together the \nintelligence picture that can reveal their plans and weaknesses--has \ndipped dramatically in recent years, and we have sustained terrible \nlosses of an extraordinarily valuable type of American power: our power \nto persuade, to lead, and to inspire. Throwing our support behind \ncitizens fighting corruption abroad, helping to strengthen networks \ncommitted to fighting international crime, investing in the future by \nsupporting child survival and health initiatives--all of these efforts, \nif pursued wisely, can help create a more secure world for the next \ngeneration.\n  In this context, it is important to note that the entire Foreign \nOperations Appropriations bill amounts to less than the amount that the \nU.S. has already appropriated for reconstruction projects in just one \ncountry: Iraq. When I reflect on this disparity, and then reflect on \nthe fact that resources in this bill are in many cases stretched very \nthin--for example, the appropriators, who I know strongly support the \nPeace Corps, were unable to meet the administration's requested funding \nlevel for that important program--I am concerned about the balance and \nfocus of U.S. policy in the midst of what is a truly global struggle \nagainst the terrorists who attacked this country.\n  I strongly support the provisions in this bill that provide resources \nfor the fight against HIV/AIDS, and believe that the U.S. must continue \nto ramp up assistance--and to ensure that this assistance is \neffective--to honor the commitments that the President has made to the \nmillions around the world struggling with this horrific pandemic.\n  I am pleased that this bill fully funds the President's request for \nassistance for Israel, as well as requests for Egypt, Jordan, \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. While the U.S. relationship with each of \nthese important countries is complex, there can be no question that \ncontinued U.S. investment in the future of these states makes good \nsense.\n  I continue to have concerns about the assistance provided to Colombia \nunder the Andean Counterdrug Initiative because of ongoing reports of \nhuman rights violations by armed groups in Colombia and links between \nparamilitary groups and the Colombian Armed Forces. I hope that the \nadministration will take seriously the provisions in this bill \nconditioning the obligation of much of this assistance on whether human \nrights, alternative development, and fumigation requirements are met.\n  I am pleased that an amendment I cosponsored, expressing the need for \ninternational support for the people of Haiti, was included in this \nbill. The latest disaster in Haiti, in which over 1,000 were killed in \nsevere flooding caused by Tropical Storm Jeanne, has only intensified \nthe suffering Haitians face on a daily basis from political insecurity \nand extreme poverty. This tragedy underscores the need for the \ninternational community to make a serious and sustained commitment to \nthe future of Haiti.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's \nSubcommittee on African Affairs, I am especially pleased that this bill \nprovides $5 million to establish pilot programs in the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo, Uganda, Burundi, and Liberia to address sexual \nand gender-based violence. My office worked with the appropriators on \nthis important provisions.\n  I also strongly support provisions in the bill calling for \nimprovements in the human rights situation in Uganda, and particularly \ncalling for greater efforts devoted to civilian protection and child \nprotection in the North. These provisions dovetail with the Northern \nUganda Crisis Response Act, a bill I authored which was passed by the \nSenate and House and signed into law this summer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9670-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9670-S9671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONTINUING CARE FOR RECOVERING FAMILIES ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the greatest domestic challenges \nfacing our country today is the soaring cost of health care. It is a \nserious problem for millions of families. But when the chief income \nearner in a family suddenly becomes unemployed, the problem can be \ncritical, and we give a helping hand. We give them the opportunity to \ncontinue their coverage through their employer for a reasonable period. \nFamilies who lost loved ones on September 11 deserve the same \nopportunity until they can land on their feet again.\n  The Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act I introduced \nyesterday with Senator Lautenberg and Senator Clinton recognizes that \nmany of the September 11 families are still struggling to recover and \nwe have an obligation to assist them.\n  Some of the families have found ways to cover their health costs by \npurchasing private insurance or obtaining grant assistance on their \nown. For others, employers have agreed to provide coverage. For still \nother families, however, the safety net is about to fall apart, because \ntheir coverage is about to expire under COBRA--the temporary low-cost \ncontinuation of coverage available under current Federal law for those \nwho change their job, lose their job, or for families that lose their \nchief income earner through death.\n  The Continuing Care for Recovering Families Act will give spouses and \nchildren of victims of September 11 the ability to purchase or continue \nto purchase coverage under COBRA indefinitely, as long as they enroll \nwithin 120 days after passage of the act or 120\n\n[[Page S9671]]\n\ndays after they lose their COBRA coverage. Eligibility for the program \nwould expire only if they enroll in a private insurance plan or become \neligible for Medicare.\n  The families of September 11 have shown great courage and \nextraordinary resilience. But we still have much more to do to help \nthem on their long and arduous road to recovery, and I hope very much \nthat we can pass this legislation this year. It will only affect a \nsmall number of families. But for them, it will make a world of a \ndifference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9671-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KEEP OUR PROMISE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the assault weapons ban expired last \nMonday, one of our Nation's law enforcement officers was recovering in \na Miami, FL hospital from two gunshot wounds inflicted by an AK-47 \nrifle. According to the Brady Campaign, all models of this make of \nassault rifle were prohibited at the time of the attack, but are now \nlegal due to the expiration of the assault weapons ban on September 13.\n  Last Monday, the Miami Herald reported that on September 12, 2004 \nMiami-Dade Police Officer Keenya Hubert was on a routine patrol when \nshe heard gunshots fired in a nearby neighborhood. She spotted a \nsuspicious vehicle leaving the area, called for backup, and pulled the \nvehicle over. Suddenly, the driver got out of his vehicle and fired \nnearly two-dozen bullets at Officer Hubert and her police car using an \nAK-47 assault rifle. One of those bullets struck Officer Hubert in the \nshoulder and another grazed her forehead. Later in the week a man was \narrested in connection with this attack. Press reports indicate the man \nhad been previously convicted of attacking two other police officers in \n1997.\n  Unfortunately, assault rifles like the one reportedly used in the \nattack on Officer Hubert's life as well as many other similar assault \nweapons are once again being legally produced and sold as a result of \nthe expiration of the assault weapons ban. The ban also included \nfirearms that can accept detachable magazines and have more than one of \nseveral specific military features, such as a folding/telescoping \nstock, protruding pistol grip, bayonet mount, threaded muzzle or flash \nsuppressor, barrel shroud or grenade launcher. Common sense tells us \nthat there is no reason for civilians to have easy access to guns with \nthese features.\n  In 1994, I voted for the assault weapons ban and in March of this \nyear I joined a bipartisan majority of the Senate in voting to extend \nthe ban for 10 years. Unfortunately, despite the overwhelming support \nof the law enforcement community, the ongoing threat of terrorism, and \nbipartisan support in the Senate, neither the President nor the \nRepublican Congressional leadership acted to protect Americans from \nassault weapons like the one used in the attack on Officer Hubert.\n  Last week, Sarah Brady, the wife of Jim Brady who was shot in John \nHinckley's attempted assassination of President Reagan, issued an open \nletter to President Bush expressing disappointment in his decision to \nallow the assault weapons ban to expire.\n  Mr. President, I hope that in the remaining days of the 108th \nCongress the Republican leadership and the President will reverse \ncourse and act to extend the assault weapons ban.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Sarah Brady's letter to President Bush \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 14, 2004.\n       Dear President Bush: I cannot begin to express my \n     disappointment in your decision to let the Assault Weapons \n     Ban expire yesterday.\n       Four years ago you said you supported renewal of the \n     assault weapons ban, though you made it clear that you were \n     generally opposed to reasonable gun violence prevention laws. \n     I was very happy to hear you say it then, because it was a \n     sensible position, and one long supported by such \n     conservative leaders as Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater. As \n     a lifelong Republican, it gave me hope that my party would \n     move away from the knee-jerk tendency to oppose whatever the \n     gun lobby said Republicans should oppose.\n       Now, these guns, designed by military scientists to inflict \n     the maximum level of damage to human beings, are back on our \n     streets.\n       You have broken your promise to the American people and you \n     should be ashamed. Jim and I loved Ronald Reagan, and one of \n     the main reasons we loved him was that he was always, always, \n     true to his word.\n       This law worked, and it saved lives. It saved the lives of \n     police officers and children. You cast your support aside for \n     a political endorsement. We all pay prices in life for our \n     actions. I hope the American people will make you pay a price \n     for this decision.\n       In your current campaign, you are pledging to keep America \n     safe. But your conscious decision to let this ban expire has \n     placed us all in jeopardy.\n       The expiration of this law is temporary. It will be \n     renewed: It is only a matter of how long it will take to \n     renew it. There is still time for you to show leadership, do \n     the right thing, and restore this law. But know that Jim and \n     I will continue our efforts to restore the ban, with or \n     without your help. And we will succeed. Lives are hanging in \n     the balance.\n       Mr. President, step forward and do the right thing.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sarah Brady.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9671-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9671-S9673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RELEASE OF YASER HAMDI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at a hearing Wednesday before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I asked some tough questions about the record of the \nDepartment of Justice in prosecuting terrorism cases. Later that day, \nthe Department announced the imminent release of Yaser Esam Hamdi, the \nso-called ``enemy combatant'' who has been held for nearly 3 years \nwithout being formally charged with any crime. During this period, the \nBush administration argued that it could deny Hamdi, a U.S. citizen, \ndue process and detain him indefinitely. In June, the Supreme Court \nstruck down the administration's assertion of unchecked executive \npower, ruling that Hamdi had the right to challenge his detention. \nRather than proceed in court, the Justice Department now says that it \nwill release Hamdi, who will renounce his U.S. citizenship and join his \nfamily in Saudi Arabia.\n  The Justice Department has claimed that Hamdi fought with the Taliban \nand posed a threat to our national security. Hamdi claimed that he was \nan innocent captured in Afghanistan by the Northern Alliance. We simply \ndo not know the truth. But, as the Rutland Herald correctly points out \nin its editorial Thursday, that is what trials are for. If Hamdi was a \ncombatant, or a civilian caught up in a combat zone, he should have \nbeen treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, which provide \nfor the treatment of soldiers and civilians in wartime. If Hamdi \ncommitted a crime, he should have been charged and tried. The timing of \nhis release is curious. Three months after the Supreme Court rejected \nthe administration's refusal to grant Hamdi due process, the Justice \nDepartment suddenly determined that Hamdi no longer posed a threat. Now \nit will release a person it previously claimed was so dangerous that he \nhad to be held for years in a military brig, mainly in solitary \nconfinement.\n  The Attorney General relied on powerful rhetoric to defend the \nDepartment's record. He liked to say that no one had successfully \nchallenged the Government's use of authority under the PATRIOT Act and \nthat no court had found the Government had overreached. Since the \nSupreme Court decisions on Hamdi and related cases last summer, it has \nbecome harder for him to make such claims. Those Court decisions do not \nstand alone in defining the Department's level of success, however. The \nlist of reversals of this Administration's policies and practices has \nbecome extensive. From the Department's involvement in rewriting our \ncountry's adherence to the Geneva Convention and the Convention Against \nTorture, which contributed to the breakdown at the Abu Ghraib prison \nand elsewhere, to the Supreme Court's rejection of the administration's \nGuantanamo practices, there is much that needs attention and \ncorrection.\n  Indeed, the Justice Department has accumulated one loss after another \nin terrorism cases. In recent weeks, we have witnessed the unraveling \nof the Department's first post-September 11 prosecution of a terrorist \nsleeper cell in Detroit. This followed on the heels of a growing list \nof losses and questionable cases, including the wrongful arrest of a \nPortland attorney based on a fingerprint mismatch; the acquittal of\n\n[[Page S9672]]\n\na Saudi college student who was charged with providing material support \nto terrorists; the release on bail of two defendants in Albany, NY, \nafter the Government admitted having mistranslated a key piece of \nevidence--the evidence referred to one defendant as ``brother,'' not \n``commander,'' as originally represented; the collapse of all charges \nagainst Muslim chaplain, James Yee, an Army Captain who served at \nGuantanamo and was originally accused of espionage; and the Supreme \nCourt's repudiation of the administration's claim that it can hold \ncitizens indefinitely as ``unlawful combatants,'' without access to \ncounsel or family. In addition to announcing its decision to release \nHamdi 2 days ago, the Government also folded its case against Ahmad al \nHalabi, a Senior Airman who served as a translator at Guantanamo Bay. \nAl Halabi once faced the death penalty for spying. He ultimately pled \nguilty to four minor charges, such as photographing a guard tower and \ntaking a classified document to his quarters; other charges were \ndropped.\n  The fact is, there have been only a few real victories in cases that \nhave brought terrorism charges since 9/11, and these have been \novershadowed by seemingly half-hearted prosecutions. We all remember \nthe antiterrorism sweeps that occurred after 9/11. The Justice \nDepartment detained over 5,000 foreign nationals in those sweeps, but, \nas law professor David Cole points out in an article in the October 4, \n2004, edition of The Nation, not a single one of them was charged with \nterrorism.\n  Department officials say their record since the 2001 attacks reflects \na successful strategy of catching suspected terrorists before they can \nlaunch deadly plots, even if that involves charging them with lesser \ncrimes. I certainly will not contest that lesser crimes are being \ncharged. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse \n(TRAC), of the approximately 184 cases disclosed as ``international \nterrorism'' matters, 171 received a sentence of one year or less. But \nis that making us safer? What exactly happens to a suspected terrorist \nwho spends 6 months in prison and then is deported to his country of \norigin in the midst of a war that has no end in sight? Does it really \nsquelch deadly plots?\n  The administration has yet to answer pointed questions about the \ndeportation of Nabil al-Marabh to Syria, a nation that is a state \nsponsor of terrorism. Al-Marabh was at one time Number 27 on the FBI's \nlist of Most Wanted Terrorists, and experienced prosecutors wanted to \nindict him. Why was he released? According to court records, Al-Marabh \nshared an address with defendants in the Detroit case who are now \nfacing only document fraud charges. What is going on here?\n  We still await the resolution of the case against Jose Padilla. The \nAttorney General made a frightening announcement from Moscow when Jose \nPadilla was arrested--as if the Government had miraculously averted a \nradioactive ``dirty bomb'' from being detonated in our heartland. As \nDeputy Attorney General James Comey represented to the Federal courts a \nfew months ago, the Government no longer even contends that Mr. Padilla \nwas engaged in a ``dirty bomb'' plot. We have yet to see criminal \ncharges against him, but I hope that we will. The Attorney General \nalways finds time to announce allegations and dangers to frighten the \nAmerican people but never seems to have time to be accountable when \nthose specters prove false, when criminal cases can not be made, or \nwhen the Government has overreached or when innocent Americans have \nbeen unfairly accused.\n  We will soon be asked to give the Government more tools, more powers, \nand even greater authorities. I hope that we will not be asked to add \nPATRIOT Act-related powers to legislation to implement 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations. The families of 9/11 victims have asked us to focus \nonly on those actions endorsed by the Commission. We should honor this \nrequest. Before Congress considers granting the Government more powers \nto add to the Federal arsenal, we must determine which tools are \nactually being used, and how are they working? Which tools are subject \nto abuse, and which need to be modified? I hope that we can start \ngetting some of those answers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the Rutland Herald \neditorial and The Nation article I mentioned earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Rutland Herald, Sept. 23, 2004]\n\n                         Constitutional Victory\n\n       One of the most alarming abuses in President Bush's war on \n     terrorism has come to a peculiar resolution. On Wednesday the \n     government announced it would release Yaser Hamdi from \n     custody.\n       Hamdi is an American citizen, born in Louisiana, and an \n     Arab whose family lives in Saudi Arabia. U.S. forces gained \n     custody of Hamdi when Northern Alliance officials handed him \n     over during the war in Afghanistan. The U.S. military was \n     rounding up Taliban fighters, and Hamdi ended up in \n     Guantanamo, Cuba.\n       Hamdi said he was wrongfully captured by the Northern \n     Alliance in northern Afghanistan and was wrongfully \n     imprisoned by the U.S. military. But the Bush administration \n     viewed him as an ``enemy combatant,'' a designation that led \n     to the government's asserted claim that it had the power to \n     rob Hamdi of all his rights.\n       It is unknown whether Hamdi is telling the truth when he \n     says he had nothing to do with the Taliban and was not \n     involved in the Afghan war. In America that is what trials \n     are for. Until found guilty of a crime, suspects are presumed \n     innocent and are protected by an array of constitutional \n     rights.\n       These rights ought to be cherished by every American. \n     Otherwise each person is vulnerable to government abuse. \n     These include the right to legal representation, the right to \n     know the charges one is facing, the right to bail, and the \n     right to a speedy and fair trial. Unrestrained by these \n     rights, the government could jail any one of us on the \n     flimsiest of excuses--or with no excuses.\n       It was a shocking event when the Bush administration \n     claimed it had the power to deny Hamdi all of those rights. \n     The claim was not made on the basis of any evidence or \n     charge. Bush was asserting he had the right to declare anyone \n     he saw fit to be an enemy combatant and to lock him or her up \n     with no trial, no charges, no legal representation.\n       Hamdi was just one man; there is one other, Jose Padilla, \n     who is being held on similar charges. But the power arrayed \n     against him was the power of a police state--until the \n     Supreme Court stepped in.\n       In June, the court ruled, 8-1, that Bush did not have the \n     power to discard the Constitution and that Hamdi had the \n     right to contest his detention. It was a victory celebrated \n     by civil libertarians of the left and the right. Then on \n     Wednesday the government announced it would release Hamdi to \n     Saudi Arabia, where he would rejoin his family, and he would \n     renounce his U.S. citizenship.\n       So for nearly three years the U.S. government, on the say \n     of President Bush, held a U.S. citizen in solitary \n     confinement on no charges. The Supreme Court has shown that, \n     in our constitutional system, the judiciary remains an \n     essential line to protect us against governmental abuse. \n     Authoritarian regimes frequently cite dangers to civil order \n     as an excuse to round up and jail people who are out of \n     favor. In Bush's hands the war on terrorism had become a war \n     on the Constitution. It appears that, fortunately, this time \n     the Constitution has won.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           [From the Nation]\n\n                            Taking Liberties\n\n                            (By David Cole)\n\n       On September 2, a federal judge in Detroit threw out the \n     only jury conviction the Justice Department has obtained on a \n     terrorism charge since 9/11. In October 2001, shortly after \n     the men were initially arrested, Attorney General John \n     Ashcroft heralded the case in a national press conference as \n     evidence of the success of his anti-terror campaign. The \n     indictment alleged that the defendants were associated with \n     Al Qaeda and planning terrorist attacks. But Ashcroft held no \n     news conference in September when the case was dismissed, nor \n     did he offer any apologies to the defendants who had spent \n     nearly three years in jail. That wouldn't be good for his \n     boss's campaign, which rests on the ``war on terrorism.'' \n     Here, as in Iraq, Bush's war is not going a well as he \n     pretends.\n       The Detroit case was extremely weak from the outset. The \n     government could never specify exactly what terrorist \n     activity was allegedly being planned and never offered any \n     evidence linking the defendants to Al Qaeda. Its case \n     consisted almost entirely of a pair of sketches and a \n     videotape, described by an FBI agent as ``casing materials'' \n     for a terrorist plot, and the testimony of a witness of \n     highly dubious reliability seeking a generous plea deal. It \n     now turns out that the prosecution failed to disclose to the \n     defense evidence that other government experts did not \n     consider the sketches and videotape to be terrorist casing \n     materials at all and that the government's key witness had \n     admitted to lying.\n       Until that reversal, the Detroit case had marked the only \n     terrorist conviction obtained from the Justice Department's \n     detention of more than 5,000 foreign national in \n     antiterrorism sweeps since 9/11. So Ashcroft's record is 0 \n     for 5,000. When the Attorney General was locking these men up \n     in the immediate wake of the attacks, he held almost daily \n     press conferences to announce how many ``suspected \n     terrorists'' had been\n\n[[Page S9673]]\n\n     detained. No press conference has been forthcoming to \n     announce that exactly none of them have turned out be actual \n     terrorists.\n       Meanwhile, despite widespread recognition that Abu Ghraib \n     has done untold damage worldwide to the legitimacy of the \n     fight against terrorism, the military has still not charged \n     any higher-ups in the Pentagon, and the Administration has \n     shown no inclination to appoint an independent commission to \n     investigate. It prefers to leave the investigation to the \n     Justice Department and the Pentagon, the two entities that \n     drafted secret legal memos defending torture.\n       And in late July, resurrecting the ideological exclusion \n     practices so familiar form the cold war, the Department of \n     Homeland Security revoked a work visa for a prominent Swiss \n     Islamic scholar who had been hired by Notre Dame for an \n     endowed chair in its International Peace Studies Institute, \n     DHS invoked a Patriot Act provision that, like the McCarran-\n     Walter Act of the cold war, authorizes exclusion based purely \n     on speech. If a person uses his position of prominence to \n     ``endorse'' terrorism or terrorist organization, the Patriot \n     Act says, he may not enter the United States. The McCarran-\n     Walter Act, on the books until its repeal in 1990, was used \n     to exclude such ``subversives'' as Czeslaw Milosz and Graham \n     Greene. This time the man whose views are too dangerous for \n     Americans to hear firsthand is Tariq Ramadan, a highly \n     respected intellectual and author of more than twenty books \n     who was named by Time magazine as one of the hundred most \n     likely innovators of the twenty-first century.\n       Notre Dame is not known as a hotbed of Islamic extremism--\n     and Ramadan is no extremist. He argues for a modernized \n     version of Islam that promotes tolerance and women's rights. \n     Two days after 9/11 he called on fellow Muslims to condemn \n     the attacks. In short, Ramadan is precisely the kind of \n     moderate voice in Islam that the United States should be \n     courting if it hopes to isolate Al Qaeda. The barring of \n     Ramadan reinforces the sense that the Administration cannot \n     or will not distinguish between moderates and extremists and \n     is simply anti-Muslim.\n       What is most troubling is that none of these developments--\n     the revelation of prosecutorial abuse in the interest of \n     obtaining a ``win'' in the war on terrorism; the continuing \n     failure to hold accountable those most responsible for the \n     torture at Abu Ghraib; and the exclusion of a moderate Muslin \n     as too dangerous for Americans to hear--is an isolated \n     mistake. Rather, they are symptoms of a deeper problem. The \n     President thinks he can win this war by ``acting tough'' and \n     treating the rule of law and constitutional freedoms as \n     optional. With enough fearmongering, that attitude may win \n     him the election. But it will lose the war.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of certain Bureau of \nLand Management land in the State of Nevada to the University and \nCommunity College System of Nevada, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and Senator Ensign \nto introduce the Nye County Higher Education Campus Conveyance Act. \nThis bill would transfer 280 acres of federal land in Nye County, NV, \nto the University and Community College System of Nevada for a much-\nneeded college campus.\n  As you may know, southern Nevada is one of the most rapidly growing \nregions of the country. For some time now, growth has been progressing \nout of Las Vegas, over the mountains, and into nearby surrounding \nareas. The Pahrump Valley in Nye County is one such area that is \ngrowing. However, Nye County does not have a single institution of \nhigher learning to serve its now more than 33,000 residents.\n  This bill would set the stage to change that. The land conveyed by \nthis bill would become the home of a college campus with facilities \nshared among the Community College of Southern Nevada, Nevada State \nCollege, and the Nye County School District.\n  In other States, educational systems can acquire land to accommodate \ngrowth relatively easily. In Nevada, where the Federal government owns \n87 percent of the land, even a new college campus requires an Act of \nCongress.\n  The college campus that this bill would enable will become an \nexceptional asset not only to the citizens of Nye County, but to all \nNevadans and ultimately to the Nation as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2846\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncongratulating the Croatian Fraternal Union of America on the occasion \nof its 110th anniversary.\n  This weekend, members of the Croatian Fraternal Union will gather in \nPittsburgh, PA to celebrate this significant event. As the CFU prepares \nfor this celebration, I would like to extend my best wishes to Mr. \nBernard Luketich, who serves as President of the CFU, and whom I have \nhad the pleasure of knowing and working with for many years.\n  The Croatian Fraternal Union in Ohio, particularly in the Cleveland \narea, has for decades promoted the understanding and preservation of \nthe Croatian heritage. Through its many cultural festivals, dances and \nother events, the local lodges have worked to ensure that the Croatian \nculture has remained strong and vibrant in Ohio.\n  I am honored to be a member of the Zumberak Lodge 859, and I attend \nas many of the lodge's events as my schedule allows. I fondly remember \ntaking my own granddaughters to see the CFU sponsored Tamburitzans \nperform, because I know it was important to expose the next generation \nto this wonderful art form and culture. This is the sort of important \nrole that the Croatian Fraternal Union's lodges have filled for the \npast 110 years, which continues today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/24/senate-section/article/S9674-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                     committee on foreign relations\n\n  Mr. CORNYN.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee \n     on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on \n     International Relations of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) JEM.--The term ``JEM'' means the Justice and Equality \n     Movement.\n       (3) SLA.--The term ``SLA'' means the Sudanese Liberation \n     Army.\n       (4) SPLM.--The term ``SPLM'' means the Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan, as \n     envisioned in the Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note), and \n     in the Machakos Protocol of 2002, is in jeopardy.\n       (2) Since 1989, the Government of Sudan has repeatedly \n     engaged in and sponsored orchestrated campaigns of attacking \n     and dislocating targeted civilian populations, disrupting \n     their ability to sustain themselves, and subsequently \n     restricting assistance to those displaced in a coordinated \n     policy of ethnic cleansing that is most recently evident in \n     the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (3) In response to 2 decades of civil conflict in Sudan, \n     the United States has helped to establish an internationally \n     supported peace process to promote a negotiated settlement to \n     the war that has resulted in a framework peace agreement, the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan \n     signed June 5, 2004.\n       (4) At the same time that the Government of Sudan was \n     negotiating for a final countrywide peace, enumerated in the \n     Nairobi Declaration on the Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan, \n     it refused to engage in any meaningful discussion with regard \n     to its ongoing campaign of ethnic cleansing in the region of \n     Darfur.\n       (5) It was not until the international community expressed \n     its outrage, through high level visits by Secretary of State \n     Colin Powell and others, and through United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1556 of July 30, 2004, that the Government \n     of Sudan agreed to attend talks to bring peace to the Darfur \n     region.\n       (6) The Government of the United States, in both the \n     executive branch and Congress, have concluded that genocide \n     has been committed and may still be occurring in Darfur, and \n     that the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear \n     responsibility for the genocide.\n       (7) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     has identified massive human rights violations in Darfur \n     perpetrated by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed, \n     which the Commissioner stated may constitute war crimes or \n     crimes against humanity.\n       (8) Evidence collected by international observers in the \n     Darfur region between February 2003 and September 2004 \n     indicate a coordinated effort to target African Sudanese \n     civilians in a scorched earth policy, from both air and \n     ground, that has destroyed African Sudanese villages, killing \n     and driving away its people, while Arab Sudanese villages \n     have been left unscathed.\n       (9) As a result of this coordinated campaign, which \n     Congress and the executive branch have declared to be \n     genocide, reports indicate tens of thousands of African \n     Sudanese civilians killed, the systematic rape of thousands \n     of women and girls, the destruction of hundreds of Fur, \n     Masalit, and Zaghawa villages and other ethnically African \n     populations, including the poisoning of their wells and the \n     plunder of crops and cattle upon which they sustain \n     themselves.\n       (10) According to the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, 1,400,000 people have been displaced in the Darfur \n     region of Sudan, of whom over 200,000 have been forced to \n     flee to Chad as refugees.\n       (11) The Government of Sudan conducted aerial attack \n     missions and deadly raids across the international border \n     between Sudan and Chad in an illegal effort to pursue \n     Sudanese civilians seeking refuge in Chad.\n       (12) In addition to the thousands of violent deaths \n     directly caused by ongoing Sudanese military and government \n     sponsored Janjaweed attacks in the Darfur region, the \n     Government of Sudan has restricted humanitarian and human \n     rights workers' access to the Darfur area, primarily through \n     bureaucratic and administrative obstruction, in an attempt to \n     inflict the most devastating harm on those displaced from \n     their villages and homes without any means of sustenance or \n     shelter.\n       (13) The Government of Sudan's continued support for the \n     Janjaweed and their obstruction of the delivery of food, \n     shelter, and medical care to the Darfur region is estimated \n     by the World Health Organization to be resulting in up to \n     10,000 deaths per month and, should current conditions \n     persist, is projected to escalate to thousands of deaths each \n     day by December 2004.\n       (14) The Government of Chad served an important role in \n     facilitating the Darfur humanitarian cease-fire (the \n     N'Djamena Agreement dated April 8, 2004) for the Darfur \n     region between the Government of Sudan and the 2 opposition \n     rebel groups in Darfur (the JEM and the SLA) although both \n     sides have violated it repeatedly.\n       (15) The people of Chad have responded courageously to the \n     plight of over 200,000 Darfur refugees by providing \n     assistance to them even though such assistance has adversely \n     affected their own means of livelihood.\n       (16) The cooperation and inclusion of all Sudanese is \n     essential to the establishment of peace and security \n     throughout all of Sudan.\n       (17) The African Union has demonstrated renewed vigor in \n     regional affairs through its willingness to respond to the \n     crisis in Darfur, by convening talks between the parties and \n     deploying several hundred monitors and security forces to the \n     region, as well as by recognizing the need for a far larger \n     force with a broader mandate.\n       (18) Despite the threat of international action expressed \n     through United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556 of \n     July 30, 2004, the Government of Sudan continues to obstruct \n     and prevent efforts to reverse the catastrophic consequences \n     that loom over Darfur.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE CONFLICT IN DARFUR, \n                   SUDAN.\n\n       (a) Sudan Peace Act.--It is the sense of Congress that the \n     Sudan Peace Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 note) remains relevant and \n     should be extended to include the Darfur region of Sudan.\n       (b) Actions To Address the Conflict.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) a legitimate countrywide peace in Sudan will only be \n     possible if the Agreed Principles of Part A of the Machakos \n     Protocol of 2002, confirmed by the Nairobi Declaration on the \n     Final Phase of Peace in the Sudan signed June 5, 2004, \n     negotiated with the SPLM, apply to all of Sudan and to all of \n     the people of Sudan, including the Darfur region;\n       (2) the parties to the N'Djamena Agreement (the Government \n     of Sudan, the SLA, and the JEM) must meet their obligations \n     under that Agreement to allow safe and immediate access of \n     all humanitarian assistance throughout the Darfur region and \n     must expedite the conclusion of a political agreement to end \n     the genocide and conflict in Darfur;\n       (3) the United States should continue to provide \n     humanitarian assistance to the areas of Sudan to which the \n     United States has access and, at the same time, develop a \n     plan similar to that described in section 10 of the Sudan \n     Peace Act to provide assistance to the areas of Sudan to \n     which United States access has been obstructed or denied;\n       (4) the international community, including African, Arab, \n     and Muslim nations, should immediately provide resources \n     necessary to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of \n     individuals at risk as a result of the Darfur crisis;\n       (5) the United States Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes \n     should travel to Chad and the Darfur region immediately to \n     investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity to develop \n     a more accurate understanding of the situation on the ground \n     and to better inform the report required in section 11(b) of \n     the Sudan Peace Act;\n       (6) the United States and the international community \n     should--\n       (A) provide all necessary assistance to deploy and sustain \n     an African Union Force of at least 4,200 personnel to the \n     Darfur region; and\n       (B) work to increase the authorized level and expand the \n     mandate of such forces commensurate with the gravity and \n     scope of the problem in a region the size of France;\n       (7) the President, acting through the Secretary of State \n     and the Permanent Representative of the United States to the \n     United Nations, should ensure that Sudan fulfills its \n     obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     1556 (July 30, 2004) and 1564 (September 18, 2004);\n       (8) sanctions should be imposed on the assets and \n     activities of those Sudanese Government officials and other \n     individuals that are involved in carrying out the atrocities \n     in the Darfur region;\n       (9) the Government of the United States should not \n     normalize relations with Sudan, including through the lifting \n     of any sanctions, until the Government of Sudan agrees to, \n     and takes demonstrable steps to implement, peace agreements \n     for all areas of Sudan, including Darfur; and\n       (10) Presidential Proclamation 6958 issued November 22, \n     1996, which suspends entry into the United States of members \n     of the Government of Sudan, officials of that Government, and \n     members of the Sudanese Armed Forces,\n\n[[Page S9689]]\n\n     should continue to remain in effect and be strictly enforced.\n\n     SEC. 5.
