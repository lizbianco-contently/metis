The finale is not freedom, but community destroyed and people \nself-enslaved.\n  Lord, we know that those Israelites, when freed, were given by Thee \nin the wilderness a purpose--to live by those basic commandments, rules \nfor peace and harmony. These we neglect at our peril. For if no divine \nnature, name, and day is shown reverence and there is not respect for \nparents, life, relationships, property, and truth, then a society \ndisintegrates from within, since there is no reverence and respect for \nanything but the solitary self.\n  Lord God, unless Thou build humanity's house, those who try labor in \nvain. Unless Thou guard a civilization's city, its protectors are \ncaught napping. So, grant grace to this elected body of Senators, \nleaders in this superpower, that they may be led to use aright our \nfreedom's dear-bought opportunities, aware of ends beyond the material \nand the visions that make life noble. This we ask in the name of love \nrevealed. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7175-3", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The President pro tempore led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7175-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 1 p.m. At 1 o'clock, the Senate will then resume \nconsideration of S. 14, the Energy bill. The chairman and the ranking \nmember will be here and will be prepared for Members to come forward \nwith their amendments over the course of today. This is an important \npiece of legislation that will enhance the energy security of this \nNation. I expect that the Senate will make substantial progress on this \nimportant bill this week.\n  As I announced previously, no rollcall votes will occur during \ntoday's session. However, Members will be able to offer amendments. I \nencourage them to do so. Any votes ordered on those amendments will be \nscheduled to occur during tomorrow's session.\n  Also this week the Senate will need to address the Defense \nauthorization bill that will be received from the House shortly. Prior \nto the recess, we finished action on the Senate bill; however, we still \nneed to dispose of a few remaining amendments prior to going to \nconference with the House. That should take only a couple of hours. We \nwill likely consider that bill one night this week after we spend the \nday on the consideration of the Energy bill. I will keep my colleagues \nadvised as to what evening that will be.\n  In addition, we have continued to try to reach agreements on the FAA \nreauthorization and the State Department reauthorization bills. At some \npoint we will have to proceed to those matters even if we are unable to \nreach a consent agreement for their consideration.\n  I should also mention there are a number of Executive Calendar \nnominations that have been pending for a long period of time. \nOftentimes these nominations get caught up in other issues. Again, at \nsome point, I will proceed to the consideration of those nominations \nthat have been pending for a while. If Members want to debate a \nparticular nominee, they will need to come to the Senate floor to do \nso.\n  In addition to the items I just mentioned, we have a number of other \nimportant issues to address, one of which is prescription drug benefits \nand strengthening and improving our Medicare Program for 35 million \nseniors and a million individuals with disabilities. I have stated for \na number of weeks--in fact, for the last couple of months--that we will \nbe addressing this particular issue, an issue that is important to the \nAmerican people, both those who are seniors now, those soon to be \nseniors, and future generations, and we will be addressing that this \nmonth. Much of that activity begins in the Finance Committee this \nweek--in fact, today there are discussions going on--and each and every \nday from now until we bring it to the floor. We plan on bringing that \nto the floor in 2 weeks.\n  Having said that, I look forward to a busy and productive legislative \nperiod prior to the next scheduled adjournment. A number of people are \ncoming back into town today after a period of a week being primarily at \ntheir homes with their constituencies across the United States of \nAmerica. We are hopping right into the Energy bill today\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\nand through this week, followed by a number of issues this week. We \nwill begin the appropriations process very quickly and spend a focused \nperiod of time on prescription drugs and strengthening and improving \nMedicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7176-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, although it is morning business, I will \ntalk about the energy policy we will be considering later today and for \nthe rest of the week. I am delighted we are going to work on that. We \nhave been working on an energy policy for some time. We worked on it \nlast year and passed it in the Senate and the House. Unfortunately, the \nsystem we used did not produce results and did not go through the \ncommittees; therefore, we had problems when we got to the conference \ncommittee.\n  This year, we are back again and more committed to complete our work \nthan we were last year. We should be. When we think about life, work, \nand the economy, what is more important than energy? Whatever we are \ndoing, wherever we are, whether we are driving, riding, reading, \ncooking, energy is consumed. It is certainly something we need to think \nabout, how it affects our lives and what impact we can have on energy.\n  What we are talking about is an energy policy. It is important to \nremember that. We are not talking about an issue that needs to be \nresolved, a part of the energy issue that needs to be resolved this \nweek or this month. We are talking about an energy policy. As we talk \nabout it, I am hopeful we can try to see a vision of where we want to \nbe in the future, what is necessary to be successful in the future, and \nthat we can set this policy in terms of what we need to do 10 or 15 \nyears from now. As we move toward that and make immediate decisions we \ncan gauge whether or not these decisions are useful in achieving the \ngoals we have set for ourselves. I think it is very important that we \ntake a look at all the aspects of energy. We have gotten ourselves into \na position where we have to rely about 60 percent on imports of oil \nfrom an area in the world that is very unsettled. So I think it is \nimportant that we take a look at conservation, that we look at \nalternatives, that we look at research, that we look at domestic \nproduction, so we can find a policy for the future.\n\n  As you will recall, one of the first things President Bush and Vice \nPresident Cheney moved toward when they came into office was to set an \nenergy policy, to begin to look ahead at what we need to be doing. They \nstill, of course, are very involved in that.\n  To achieve the kind of lifestyle we want in the 21st century, we have \nto have reliable energy and a clean environment. These two needs are \nnot necessarily conflicting. We have to deal with them so they do fit \ntogether. They can.\n  We need to modernize conservation. We obviously use more energy than \nis necessary. Sometimes we could make those changes just by our use. We \ncan make changes by using different kinds of equipment.\n  We need to modernize our infrastructure. Energy production has \nchanged over the years, whether it is gas that is produced in the West \nand the markets are in the Midwest or in the East, where you have to \nhave a way to get it there. We see more and more energy produced by \nmerchant generators, ready for markets a good ways away from the \ngenerator, where you have to have transmission.\n  We have to increase our supplies. We are going to be using more and \nmore energy, of course. That includes renewables. Excluding hydro, now \nrenewables only amount to about 3 percent of our total energy use. That \nis not very much. There are great opportunities to do more.\n  As we do it, we need to upgrade and increase our improvements for the \nprotection of the environment.\n  Of course, the thing that has become much more apparent to us lately \nis the need for security. So as we talk about energy, we have to look \nat security. We have to achieve energy independence for our economy. \nCertainly we will feel much more comfortable if we are less reliant on \nimporting what we use. Oil and fossil fuels produce about 85 percent of \nthe energy used in the United States. As I said, if you include hydro, \nthen renewables get up to about 7 percent, but it is still a relatively \nsmall amount. There is more we can do about that.\n  We have needed a policy. I come from a State that is sort of a \nfoundation for much of the energy we use, particularly fossil fuels, \ngas and coal. Wyoming is a place where there is a great deal of that. \nWe are third in the Nation in coal reserves. We provide 14 percent of \nU.S. coal. We rank seventh in oil production. We have reserves as well \nfor oil and gas. So we have to do some things a little differently than \nwe have.\n  For instance, coal is our largest resource of fossil fuel. If we are \ngoing to use it increasingly, as I think we should, particularly for \nthe generation of electricity, then we need to continue to work to make \nit clean. We need to have clean air. We need to have clear skies. We \ncan produce cleaner-burning coal or in some instances we are looking at \nways where perhaps you take coal and produce hydrogen. That makes it a \nlittle easier to transport. It makes it cleaner. Those are things we \nhave to look forward to, and that we can do.\n\n  Regarding the carbon that escapes into the air, we are looking at \nways of carbon sequestration, putting it back in the ground. We can do \nthat. But we have to have more experiments; we have to have more \nresearch. We have to have goals as to where we are going.\n  In terms of infrastructure, I mentioned if you are going to move \nelectricity, you have to have transmission. I understand that often \ntransmission is not what people like to have in their backyards. \nNevertheless, it has to be there. We had a good example of the problems \nwith that in California a couple of years ago, where you knew the \ndemand was there, the supply was somewhere else, and you had to get it \nto the market.\n  As I mentioned, our attempt last year to move into some of these \nareas did not succeed. We did not go through the process as we have \nthis year. We have had hearings. We have had committees. I thank \nSenator Domenici for keeping us on the right track to do that.\n  So what kind of policy? We need to have some fuel diversity. We need \nto have different kinds of fuel. We are looking at hydrogen; I suppose \nwe are looking at solar; we are looking at wind power. Many of those \nare available but, frankly, they are not economical at this time. We \nhave to do that. We have to strike a balance, as we move forward, with \nthe environment.\n  So there is much that can in fact be done. In this energy policy we \nwill be considering, we have a title on coal. That is mostly to do some \nexperiments on how that can be used cleaner or how it can be \ntransformed. We are going to do something with Indian energy so the \nreservations can produce more energy than they have in the past.\n  Some people kind of freeze up when you talk about nuclear energy. The \nfact of the matter is, in some States, 30 percent of their electricity \ncurrently is generated by nuclear. It is probably the cleanest fuel we \nhave. We have to work on the storage of the waste from nuclear, of \ncourse.\n  We have great opportunities to do some things with renewable energy. \nI think we need to be a little careful in setting mandates that we are \ngoing to be at a certain place at a certain time because that can turn \nout to be very expensive and difficult.\n  Regarding fuel efficiency, we can work on that in cars or whatever, \nand make them much more efficient than we have now.\n  I mentioned hydrogen. The President indicated he thinks hydrogen is \none of our best opportunities for a movement\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nof alternative fuels. He has put money in his budget for hydrogen work.\n  I am very hopeful that we do commit ourselves to coming up with some \nsolutions with regard to energy policy. I am a little concerned it is \nsort of on the base here and we will be moving off to other matters. I \nhope in this 2-week period this becomes our highest priority, that we \ncontinue to stick with it until we have accomplished the goal we set \nout to accomplish, and that is to have an energy policy for the Senate.\n  Second, I hope it can be a policy, not a great number of details, but \na view in the future as to where we are going to be, and then do the \nthings that are necessary for us to get there.\n\n  I am delighted we are going to be moving forward in this area.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7177-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDIA OWNERSHIP\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning the Federal Communications \nCommission made some decisions I think were wrong-headed and \ncounterproductive for this country. I would like to describe them just \nfor a moment.\n  The Federal Communications Commission, by a vote of 3 to 2, decided \nto change in a dramatic way the ownership rules with respect to \nbroadcast stations and newspapers around this country--radio, \ntelevision, newspapers. Let me describe where we may end up as a result \nof the FCC decisions.\n  As a result of what the FCC has decided today, it is likely that in \nthe largest markets of our country, the same company will own the \nnewspaper, three television stations, the cable company, and eight \nradio stations.\n  I can't think of anything more destructive to the interests of \nlocalism and to the interests of diversity, both of which are hallmarks \nof what we aspire to have in American broadcasting, and the free flow \nof information and diversity of information in this democracy of ours.\n  I don't understand why the FCC made this decision. The majority of \nthe members of the Senate Commerce Committee signed a letter asking the \nFCC to delay and provide their recommendations to us first so we could \nperhaps have a hearing and discuss it with them. But they didn't do \nthat. The first anyone knew of the specific recommendations was this \nmorning at about 10 o'clock. There were somewhere close to 500,000 \ncommunications from the American people to the FCC saying don't do \nthis. Instead, the FCC took this action. They say they took this action \nbecause there are more voices, there are more outlets and more \ndiversity; therefore, the old rules with respect to ownership are \noutmoded and old-fashioned.\n  That is simply not the case. Ninety percent of the top 50 cable \nstations are owned by the top handful of the broadcasters. Twenty-five \nof the top Internet sites are owned by the same companies. In terms of \ndiversity of thought in terms of where you get your news, it all comes \nfrom the same source--many voices, one ventriloquist.\n  Is that in the public interest? In my judgment, the answer is no. The \nFCC held only one hearing in Richmond, VA, and the rest of their work \nwas done largely in secret.\n  There is a history to some of this. The FCC today said that one \nownership group should be able to broadcast to 45 percent of the \nNation's audience. It is actually going to be much more than that \nbecause they have a rule that counts UHF stations and only 50 percent \nof the stations.\n  It is a complex system. But it is 45 percent of the national \naudience. It used to be 25 percent. In 1996, a piece of legislation--\nthe Telecommunications Act--came to the floor of the Senate taking that \n25 percent to 35 percent. I offered an amendment at that point to \nrestore the 25-percent limit; take the 35 percent out of the bill and \nrestore the 25-percent limit. We had a vote. The proponent on the other \nside in support of the 35 percent was Senator Dole from Kansas, a \npretty aggressive competitor, as a matter of fact. We had a vote and I \nwon. I was dumbfounded. I had no idea I would win. But I won by, I \nthink, three or four votes. That was about 4 in the afternoon when we \nconsidered the act in 1996.\n  On that same day, at about 7:30 in the evening, we had a another vote \nbecause Senator Dole was cagey enough to have another Senator change \nhis vote, and then we came back after dinner and had a vote on \nreconsideration. Apparently, three, four, or five Senators had some \nsort of epiphany over dinner. I lost. I have no idea what they had for \ndinner, or who talked to them, or how far their arms were bent. But I \nwon that vote for about 4 hours, and then I lost.\n  The result has been that for 7 years we have had a 35-percent \nownership cap with respect to a broadcasting company broadcasting \ntelevision signals across the country, providing that there is a limit \non broadcast stations--that you can't go over 35 percent of the \nnational audience.\n  Now the FCC this morning said they are taking that to 45 percent. \nThey are eliminating the ban on cross-ownership between newspapers and \ntelevision stations. This weekend one of the large newspaper chains was \nreported in a story that I saw to have said, Look, we intend to buy a \ntelevision station in every city in which we have a newspaper. We \nintend to do that.\n\n  I don't doubt it.\n  Another story which I read this weekend talked about the plan of one \nof the large broadcasting enterprises and all the deals they had lined \nup anticipating the FCC was going to do what they wanted them to do. \nThey have deal after deal. They are going to start. There will an orgy \nof concentration and mergers that start almost immediately.\n  What I would like to say to all of those who are now celebrating the \nFCC's decision today is that Congress will have another bite at this. \nThere are many ways to do it.\n  No. 1, we have a Congressional Review Act which is a form of \nlegislative veto dealing with rules that we don't like. It has been \nused rarely. But I think it should be used in this circumstance; it \nwould provide a vote here in the Congress, up or down, on this rule.\n  There are other approaches. Several of my colleagues--the Presiding \nOfficer is one--have introduced legislation restoring the 35-percent \ncap. That is a bipartisan piece of legislation cosponsored by \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Senate. Of course, there is always the \ntimeline tradition of, if everything else fails, attempting to \nlegislate on an appropriations bill.\n  But my point is this: I don't think the FCC decision this morning \nshould be considered the last and definitive word. My own personal view \nis that I hope we will attempt a form of ``legislative veto'' which is \nprovided for in law. But there will be attempts to overturn much of \nthis decision.\n  It makes no sense to me that we will have decided through a \nregulatory agency not to do effective regulation on behalf of the \nAmerican public, and to say, oh, by the way, concentration is not a bad \nthing. Let us just allow in one big American city the same company to \nbuy the cable company, buy three TV stations, eight radio stations, buy \nup the cable system, and buy the newspaper. It makes no sense to me \nthat a Federal regulatory body ought to do that.\n  I very much regret what the FCC did this morning. In the review \nmirror, this will be seen as a terrible decision that marches this \ncountry backward and not forward, and one that will well satisfy those \nwho have billions at stake because they have lobbied very hard to have \nthis kind of decision come from the FCC but one, in my judgment, which \nwill detract from the interest of localism. Those big enterprises win \nand American communities lose. Who is going to broadcast basketball \ngames? Who is going to broadcast the local baseball games?\n  The fact is, we have had some experience with concentration in the \nmedia in recent years--since 1996--and it isn't working. We are \ndestroying localism and destroying diversity. I think this Congress \nneeds to weigh in now and deal with the FCC.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7178-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n                             ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to make a comment finally on \nthe Energy bill which my colleague from Wyoming discussed moments ago.\n  If we have learned anything--and I expect we have learned a lot with \nrespect to the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the trouble in the Middle \nEast--it is that this country is foolish to continue its excessive \nreliance on oil from troubled parts of the world. When 55 percent of \nour oil comes from overseas and outside of our borders, and when the \nlargest growth in energy usage is for transportation and putting \ngasoline through our carburetors so we can drive back and forth to work \nand take trips and so on, this country ought to understand the great \nperil it is in--the peril to which the economy would be flat on its \nback tomorrow morning if, God forbid, the supply of oil from outside \nour borders was discontinued or interrupted. We need to understand \nthat. We need to pass an Energy bill that recognizes and addresses it.\n  The Energy bill, in my judgment, should be legislation that does four \nthings: incentivizes increased production of fossile fuels--yes, oil--\nusing clean fuel technology, coal and natural gas; incentivizes \nconservation and provides for substantial conservation initiatives; \nprovides for efficiency with all of these things that we use in our \ndaily lives, especially using electricity; and then, finally, addresses \nthe issue of limitless renewable sources of energy--ethanol, biodiesel, \nand especially, in my judgment, hydrogen.\n  If we fail to do all of that in an aggressive way, we will not have \nmuch of an Energy bill. We will, as we do every 25 years, come back and \ndebate where we should drill now. Digging and drilling is a policy that \nI call ``yesterday forever.'' It doesn't advance this country's \ninterests. Yes. We should produce more fossil fuels, and we will. But \nwe need to decide that putting gasoline through our carburetors is not \nwhat we want our grandchildren to do.\n  The President talked about moving to a hydrogen economy with fuel \ncells. I agree with that. Good for him. Putting his administration on \nline in support of that initiative makes great sense. Frankly, his \nspecific proposal was timid. It was not very bold. But he deserves \ngreat credit for moving in the right direction.\n  I and some of my colleagues will introduce legislation dealing with \nhydrogen and fuel cells. That will be a $6.5 billion program over the \nnext 10 years--a type of Apollo program. At the start of a decade we \nsaid, Let us have a man working on the Moon at the end of the decade. \nWe did it with timelines and with targets.\n  If we decide we ought to use hydrogen and fuel cells to power \nAmerica's vehicle fleet, and also some stationary engines, then we \nought to move in that direction boldly, not timidly. This is the time \nto do that with an energy bill. This is the time we decide the \ndirection in which we want America to move and then establish public \npolicy that makes that happen. I don't know whether we will have a bill \nthrough the Senate that does all that. I hope so. We will have many \namendments. I have some amendments I will offer to get us in that \nposition.\n  Let me make one additional point. Anyone who watched what happened in \nthe California and the west coast energy markets in the last couple of \nyears has to understand that if we pass an energy bill that does not \nprovide safeguards for the consumers, then we will have failed \nmiserably. We saw companies--and I will name Enron, for one, but there \nare others the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has already \nidentified--that were playing a monopoly game in west coast markets \nmanipulating loads--they were buying and selling energy to themselves, \njacking up prices, in some case, five, ten, and a hundredfold, and \nstealing from consumers. And it was not just a few dollars; they were \nstealing billions and billions of dollars from west coast consumers. \nThey are now going to be held criminally liable.\n  But while all that was happening, we had a Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission that was dead from the neck up. It would not do a thing; it \nsat on its hands, looking like a potted plant. It did not do a thing. \nSo this massive stealing went on in west coast markets because big \ncompanies that could control supply did control supply, manipulated \nload, and attempted to extract from the consumers in western America \nbillions of dollars in an unfair way. We must put safeguards in this \nlegislation that prevent that.\n  If anybody wonders about it, there is plenty written about it. Go \ntrace the trail that describes the Enron Corporation strategies called \n``Get Shorty,'' ``Fat Boy,'' and ``Death Star.'' Do you know what those \nare? Those are strategies to steal from consumers. The FERC is now \ndeciding there was plenty of activity, and there are criminal \ninvestigations going on that warrant perhaps prosecution of both \ncompanies and individuals.\n  But all that happened because we had regulators who did not want to \nregulate. Regulators were afraid to step in and take effective action. \nOnce again, it demonstrates that when you have the market power, the \nmuscle, and the clout, and you do not have regulators who effectively \nregulate it, people are victims. And in this case on the west coast, \nthe victims lost billions of dollars. The question is, How is there \ngoing to be recompense for that? How is that going to be resolved? Who \nis going to be tried? Which FERC investigations are sent to the Justice \nDepartment for criminal prosecution?\n  My point is, safeguards need to be in this energy bill dealing with \nthat. We have been through this once. We have colleagues still calling \nfor deregulation of these markets. Deregulation, when you have \ncompanies with market power willing to use it to the detriment of \nconsumers, is a devastating mistake. You need effective regulators, \nwearing referee shirts, who safeguard the interests of the consumers.\n  That has to be a part of this bill as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The National Energy Policy Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. I hope Senators and their staff are \npaying attention. We have been given this week, and it would seem like \npart of next week, to get an energy bill completed in the Senate. We \nknow this is an important bill, and we know these are important issues \nto Senators.\n  Nonetheless, it would seem to this Senator that we have had a very \nlengthy debate, a lot of amendments, and much discussion last year on \nan energy policy. Admittedly, much of\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nthat debate centered around the Alaskan wilderness provisions, and they \nare not going to be at issue in this bill unless somebody chooses to \nmake them so. As manager on this side, I am not aware of anyone who \nintends to do that. Not because people have changed their minds but \nbecause the issue seems to have been decided.\n  It seems to this Senator that much of the debate has been narrowed. \nNonetheless, there is a significant number of issues of consequence to \nmany Members. We did produce a bill in the committee in kind of rapid \ntime, but considering that many of the issues had been debated so \nfrequently, it appeared to this Senator, as chairman, that we did a \nrather good job. That does not mean we do not have some serious issues, \nbut I believe, since the House has once again produced a National \nEnergy Policy Act, we have a responsibility to produce one. In due \ncourse, we will be able to discuss with the Senate and with the people \nof this country what kind of bill we have.\n  As chairman, it was this Senator's hope we could produce a bill that \nover time gave to the American people an opportunity to use a variety \nof types of energy to meet both the residential and business energy \nneeds in America's future. In essence, we tried to produce a bill that \nwas going to enhance and increase production of various types of \nenergy.\n  We could have a serious discussion of what we see down the line for \nthe next 5, 10, 15, or 20 years that precipitates this bill and will in \nturn precipitate the debate on various amendments. However, it ought to \nbe clear to everyone that the United States has, all of a sudden, \nwithin the past 5 years decided the energy of choice seems to be \nnatural gas, aside from the fact that we still drive automobiles that \nuse petroleum products, and thus we are still very dependent upon crude \noil. We produce as much as we can at home and import a huge amount from \na large pool of oil which is now being produced by numerous countries \naround the globe.\n  At home, 90 percent of the new electricity production comes from \nnatural gas fired generation. There is nothing wrong with that, but \nthat, coupled with the direct use of natural gas in this country, means \nwe are rapidly moving toward a natural gas economy.\n  For some, there is no risk in that. For others, they ought to at \nleast be concerned. For others, it seems that we may run into a \nshortage of natural gas sometime in the not-too-distant future. To that \nend, this bill says we have an abundance of coal in our country; do \neverything we can to enhance the usability of coal by spending \nresources on science to develop and modernize and even build a \npowerplant that would be clean so that we can prove that in the future \ncoal can begin to fill the gap and begin to take the place of natural \ngas.\n  We have also gone ahead particularly at the persuasion of this \nSenator, the chairman, and said that maybe the time has come for a \nrebirth of nuclear power in America. We will have a good opportunity \nfor a lengthy and wholesome debate on where we are today, what went \nwrong in the past, and what we ought to be doing in the future, \nperhaps, as this bill envisions, giving nuclear power a chance to come \nback to life in America and become a powerful source of energy around \nthe world.\n  At the same time, renewables are of great concern to many Americans. \nA thorough reading of this bill plus the amendment which is \ncontemplated, the one produced by the Finance Committee, which has a \nsignificant provision in it for tax incentives for renewables--the \ntotality of the bill, plus the proposed amendment that would be \nattached from the Finance Committee, suggests to the American people \nthere will be a lot of windmills in our future. Literally, there will \nbe millions of them. They will be a significant portion of the grid in \nthe United States.\n  In addition, all other sources of energy--biomass and all related \nforms--are given some incentive, or in every way possible we have \nattempted to put all of them on an equal footing. There will be a \nvariety of energy types available to the American people in the \nforeseeable future.\n  Clearly, there will be seven or eight major issues. I am hopeful that \nethanol, which has become a huge issue even though it is not part of \nthe jurisdiction of this committee--the major ethanol bill currently \npending as an amendment has many considerations that will be brought to \nthe Senate's attention by Senators concerned about it and who want \nvarious changes in it. We would like that it be dealt with in due \ncourse, that it not take a huge amount of the time allotted for this \nentire bill. We are working together on both sides of the aisle to see \nif we can set that amendment aside while we pursue other amendments, to \nmove ahead, taking the ethanol provisions in due course.\n  This bill was reported on April 30 and laid before the Senate on May \n6. The Senate considered the measure for 3 days at the beginning of May \nduring which time the pending amendment relating to ethanol was laid \ndown. Today, we begin consideration of the measure. I believe we can \npredict the outcome of most of the major issues in this legislation. \nThe pending amendment is a bipartisan agreement on ethanol reached \nafter years of negotiation among the involved parties sponsored by the \nmajority and minority leaders and identical to language reported from \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works. I don't think there is \nany question but it will be adopted. However, there are some Senators, \nled by Senators Feinstein and Schumer, who oppose the amendment and \nhave the right to offer as many second-degree amendments as they like--\nas they did last year.\n  However, as with all major issues, the Senate spoke last year. For \nthe most part, the issues have not changed. I am certain the resolution \nof those matters will largely reflect the resolution achieved last \nyear. Last year, it took 6 weeks. There is no reason for it to take \nthat long this year. While some issues are clear, the legislation \nbefore the Senate also raised new issues which deserve the \nconsideration of the Senate. I expect amendments related to our titles \ndealing with electricity, Indian energy, nuclear energy--which I \nalluded to briefly--which are significantly different from those \nproposed last year, will take a little bit of time. I also think there \nare a few areas, such as climate change and renewable portfolio \nstandard, where the outcome may or may not be different from last year.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will give Members the opportunity to move as \nexpeditiously through some of these issues as possible. I want the will \nof the Senate worked, and I will do all I can to move the process \nalong. The majority leader has indicated the Senate will be on this \nbill this week and some portion of next week with only a few \ninterruptions for other matters that may need to be resolved. I \nunderstand we need to spend a few hours resolving some matters relating \nto the Defense authorization bill and may need to vote on a few judges. \nThose issues should not consume a lot of time.\n  For my part, I will be here waiting for amendments. I understand from \nmy distinguished colleague, Senator Bingaman, that he, too, is \navailable. We will spend as much time as necessary to move this bill \nalong. I hope a vote can occur tomorrow, perhaps as early as noon, and \nthen thereafter on a regular basis. Senators can expect votes at \nvarious times unless we reach some agreements, which everyone would \nknow about from time to time, on each of the days we are scheduled to \nbe in session this week and next week. There are amendments out there. \nI understand a number of Senators will offer amendments on the OCS \ninventory provisions of the bill. I have been told perhaps Senator \nMcCain plans to offer amendments related to climate change and perhaps \nCAFE. Senator Bingaman made it clear he plans to offer a number of \namendments. We are prepared and ready to proceed on those.\n  I encourage Members to be prepared to come to the Senate as soon as \npossible. We would like very much to be given the opportunity to get \nthis bill discussed and get the issues debated and voted on as soon as \npractical. This Senator thinks they are important. There are many \npeople in this country who think energy is important. Until there is a \ncrisis, we act as if we need not worry about an Energy bill, but things \nhave not changed that much. Whatever the crisis was or wasn't last year \nor the year before, it is practically the same for all intents and \npurposes today. We remain gravely dependent upon foreign oil. Clearly, \nthere are a number of bottlenecks created\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nboth by bureaucracy and statute that we are going to try to alleviate. \nThere are a number of incentives that ought to be built into the energy \nbase of our country.\n  As we look at the overall picture, the United States has a rare \nopportunity to see to it that it has plenty of energy of a variety of \ntypes and sources, and after the adoption of this policy through \nconference and through signature of the President so that America will \nnot have to be worried; we will clearly be in a position that the \nenergy we need to grow and prosper will be there.\n  Throughout consideration of this bill, there will be discussions \nabout conservation--saving of energy, the use of less energy wherever \nwe can, and promoting policy changes which will indeed promote the use \nof less rather than more energy. That, too, will create some very \nserious debates and serious discussions.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Bingaman. We \nare attempting to get a unanimous consent request in short order. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Domenici. \nI will just very briefly summarize the views I expressed in much \ngreater detail when we began this bill back in May.\n  My own view is there is much in this legislation that has come before \nthe Senate which I support. Unfortunately, there are also provisions in \nhere I do not support, and there are provisions left out of the bill \nthat I believe are important to include in any kind of comprehensive \nenergy bill we might pass through the Senate.\n  On that basis, I did not support the form of the legislation that \ncame out of the Energy Committee. I am hoping during the debate here on \nthe Senate floor we can correct the problems that I believe exist, that \nwe can add some provisions that will improve the bill as regards \nincreased efficiency in the use of energy, that will improve the bill \nas regards increased diversity in the sources of energy, that will \nimprove the bill as regards a consideration of climate change issues, \nalong with our energy policy. There are a variety of issues that need \nto be addressed, some that need to be corrected.\n  I look forward to the chance to debate those issues in detail as we \nget into the amendments. The chairman's intention, perhaps, is to try \nto begin dealing with the low-income home energy assistance issue \ntoday. I hope we can move ahead on that. It is an extremely important \nprovision of the bill. But I look forward to working with the chairman \nto try to move this legislation forward. In my view, it is important \nthe Congress act in this area. It is important the country modernize \nthe laws that affect our energy supply and energy usage. It has been \nmany years since we have done that in any comprehensive way. So I hope \nwe can make progress. I know that is the chairman's fondest hope. I \ncertainly join in that and intend to do all I can to cooperate.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have received consent from both sides \nfor the following consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending ethanol amendment be set \naside temporarily so that the Senator from New Mexico can offer an \namendment with reference to LIHEAP.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 840\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to explain what we have done and \nwhy we have done it. Obviously, there are Senators who want to debate \nand propose amendments to the ethanol provision. They are not available \ntoday.\n  On the other hand, there is an issue, the LIHEAP issue. Last year the \nLIHEAP bill was found in the Energy legislation. This year the Senate \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources voted for LIHEAP, to \nreauthorize the LIHEAP Act, and did not include it in the bill but \nrecommended that it would be offered on the floor as an amendment.\n  In compliance with that, I am going to offer the LIHEAP \nreauthorization amendment. It will be offered by myself, for myself and \nfor Senator Bingaman, in response to the recommendation of the Energy \nCommittee that such be the case.\n  With that, I send to the desk the low-income home energy assistance \nprogram, on behalf of myself, Senator Bingaman, and the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for himself and \n     Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 840.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reauthorize LIHEAP, Weatherization assistance, and State \n                            Energy Programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new title:\n\n                    TITLE XII--STATE ENERGY PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. 1201.

WEATHERIZATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Eligibility.--Section 412 of the Energy Conservation \n     and Production Act (42 U.S.C. 6862) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (7)(A), by striking ``125'' and inserting \n     ``150'', and\n       (2) in paragraph (7)(C), by striking ``125'' and inserting \n     ``150''.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 422 of the \n     Energy Conservation and\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\n     Production Act (42 U.S.C. 6872) is amended by striking the \n     period at the end and inserting ``, $325,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2004, $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and \n     $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.''.\n\n     SEC. 1203. STATE ENERGY PLANS.\n\n       (a) State Energy Conservation Plans.--Section 362 of the \n     Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6322) is \n     amended by inserting at the end of the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(g) The Secretary shall, at least once every 3 years, \n     invite the Governor of each State to review and, if \n     necessary, revise the energy conservation plan of such State \n     submitted under subsection (b) of (e). Such reviews should \n     consider the energy conservation plans of other States within \n     the region, and identify opportunities and actions carried \n     out in pursuit of common energy conservation goals.''.\n       (b) State Energy Efficiency Goals.--Section 364 of the \n     Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6324), is \n     amended to read as follows:\n\n\n                    ``state energy efficiency goals\n\n       ``Sec. 364. Each State energy conservation plan with \n     respect to which assistance is made available under this part \n     or after the date of enactment of this title shall contain a \n     goal, consisting of an improvement of 25 percent or more in \n     the efficiency of use of energy in the State concerned in \n     calendar year 2010 as compared to calendar year 1990, and may \n     contain interim goals.''.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 365(f) of the \n     Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 5325(f)) is \n     amended by striking the period at the end and inserting ``, \n     $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and \n     $125,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the amendment increases the \nauthorization for the low-income home energy assistance program from \nthe current authorization of $2 billion annually to $3.4 billion for \neach of the fiscal years 2004 through 2006. The amendment also expands \neligibility for the Weatherization Assistance Program to include \nfamilies with household incomes at or below 150 percent of the poverty \nlevel established by OMB, which is equivalent to the existing LIHEAP \neligibility.\n  The amendment also increases funding to $325 million for fiscal year \n2004 through $400 million for 2005, and $500 million for 2006.\n  Finally, the amendment establishes procedures for regular review of \nexisting State energy conservation programs. It sets State energy \nefficiency goals, reducing energy use by 25 percent by 2010 from energy \nusage in 1990, and it expands and extends authorization for these \nprograms to $100 million in fiscal year 2004 and 2005, and $125 million \nfor 2006.\n  I urge my colleagues to agree to the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment that \nSenator Domenici sent to the desk. I think it makes some very much \nneeded improvements in the existing Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \nProgram and also in the Weatherization Assistance Program. It also \nprovides additional funds for development of State energy plans.\n  I think these are very important provisions. We did not have that \nsevere of a winter in many parts of the country this year. Accordingly, \nwe didn't see as many headlines about the importance of this Low-Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program as we have in some previous years. But \nthe truth is, this is an extremely important program for a great many \nof our citizens who are low income and who do need the help. It is \nimportant for them in heating their homes in the winter, and it is \nimportant for them in keeping their homes reasonably cool in the \nsummer. We are starting the summer.\n  I went through Dallas on the plane Friday on my way back to \nWashington. It was 96 degrees. I am sure that is a mild foretaste of \nwhat we are going to be seeing in the future as far as the temperature \nin Dallas and in many parts of the country, particularly in the \nsouthern sections of the country.\n  The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program assists people in \npaying their utility bills for air-conditioning just like it assists \nthem in paying their utility bills for heating.\n  It is very clear when you look at studies that there are a \nsignificant number of people in this country, particularly elderly \npeople in the Southern States, who, in fact, die because of excess heat \nand the inability to cool their apartments or their homes.\n\n  This is a very important program. It is one that we need to deal \nwith. It is one we tried to deal with in the Energy bill last year. We \npassed it through the Senate in very much this same form. We had \ngeneral support from the House of Representatives to include it in a \nfinal bill to go to the President had we been able to get agreement on \na final bill. But there was no disagreement about this part of the \nprogram or this part of the legislation.\n  I believe very strongly this should be agreed to and should be \nincluded in this Energy bill.\n  I notice the House has addressed it already in the Energy bill they \nhave passed. It clearly needs to be part of our Energy bill as well so \nthat when we go to conference we can, in a meaningful way, conference \nwith the House of Representatives on this important issue.\n  I hope this will be agreed to. I look forward to additional debate on \nit as necessary.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 841 to Amendment No. 840\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have already indicated to the Senate \nthat while this amendment was in the Energy bill last year, and while \nit was considered by the Energy Committee of the Senate and handled in \na manner that I have described, it is not included in the bill but \nrecommended for submission as an amendment, which has been done. It is \nclear the jurisdictional issue which has arisen did not come up last \nyear, as I understand it, from the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico who was chairman last year. It was not raised. So we proceeded \nas if the same were to occur this year. Such is not the case in that \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the committee of jurisdiction \ndesire to challenge the inclusion of that.\n  They are aware of the fact that the amendment is going to be included \ntoday. The chairman of the appropriate committee, Senator Gregg, is not \nhere today. He will be here tomorrow. Thus, we will not complete debate \non this until he comes back tomorrow. But I am going to send to the \ndesk, as they understand this is going to be the case, in behalf of \nSenator Gregg, an amendment to my amendment which strikes the section \nof the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program substitute and \nextensive Senate language; that when the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions reauthorizes the LIHEAP Act of 1981, the \ncommittee should consider increasing the authorization of the program \nto $3.4 billion to better serve the needs of low-income and other \neligible households.\n  I, therefore, send in amendment to the desk in behalf of the chairman \nof the committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment which does what I have just described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Gregg, \n     for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Dodd, Ms. \n     Collins, and Mr. Reed, proposes an amendment numbered 841 to \n     amendment No. 840.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the \n reauthorization of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981)\n\n       Strike section 1201 (relating to the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Program) and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1201. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE REAUTHORIZATION \n                   OF THE LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE ACT OF \n                   1981.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (referred \n     to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') is the primary Federal \n     program available to help low-income households, individuals \n     with disabilities, and senior citizens meet their home energy \n     bills and maintain their health and well-being;\n       (2) home energy costs are unaffordable for many low-income \n     households, individuals with disabilities, and senior \n     citizens living on fixed incomes;\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\n       (3) those households often carry a higher energy burden \n     than most United States households, spending up to 20 percent \n     of their household income on home energy bills;\n       (4) States provided more than 4,000,000 households with \n     LIHEAP assistance in 2002;\n       (5) LIHEAP is currently able to serve only 15 percent of \n     the 30,000,000 households who are income-eligible for \n     assistance under LIHEAP; and\n       (6) the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \n     has jurisdiction over the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Act of 1981, which provides authority for LIHEAP, and is \n     working towards reauthorizing the Act prior to its expiration \n     in 2004.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, when the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions reauthorizes the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), the committee should \n     consider increasing the authorization of appropriations under \n     section 2602(b) of that Act (42 U.S.C. 8621(b)) to \n     $3,400,000,000, in order to better serve the needs of low-\n     income and other eligible households.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I understand it, this is the second-\ndegree amendment. Clearly, it will be debated tomorrow when Senator \nGregg and Senator Kennedy return. We will see what the wish of the \nSenate is. I join with my colleague, Senator Bingaman, in stating that \nI hope we will leave it in this bill. I think the House has done the \nsame. I think it is important that we adopt the LIHEAP bill and that we \ndo it now. Obviously, there is no need for the Senator from New Mexico \nto debate any further on this issue because the opponents have to be \nheard from and they won't be here until tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for Senators again, let me repeat that \nwe are awaiting the return of Senator Gregg to debate this issue; that \nis, the second-degree amendment which was just offered a few moments \nago. In the meantime, the entire Energy bill is before us. Amendments \nwould not be in order obviously. We will await their return and then \nbegin the debate. After we finish the debate, we will vote on LIHEAP.\n  We will also debate the ethanol amendment. We are attempting to work \nwith Senators who have serious issues with reference to ethanol to see \nif we can't line those up so that we will be ready to proceed in due \ncourse and with some degree of dispatch.\n  Having said that, I don't believe there is going to be any further \nsignificant business on this bill. I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7182-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, in opening the Senate this morning, I spoke \ngenerally of the schedule for the next month. There are a number of \nitems that I outlined which we will be addressing.\n  The first is energy, and we will continue that debate, possibly later \ntoday but through tomorrow, the next day, the next day, the next day--\nthrough this week. It is a very important debate as we work toward that \nobjective, increasing domestic production, decreasing our dependence on \nforeign sources, addressing issues such as renewable energy sources \nthat we all know are so important, and accomplishing all that with a \nlot of attention and focus and care with regard to the environment as \nwell as the economy of this great country.\n  I mentioned this morning that we have begun, weeks ago--in fact, \nmonths ago--addressing the issues surrounding the strengthening of our \nMedicare Program--strengthening it, preserving it, improving it--and at \nthe same time addressing an issue that seniors feel strongly about, \npeople in Medicare feel strongly about, but also soon-to-be-seniors and \nthat younger generation, and that is to include a new benefit of \nprescription drugs as part of our health care for seniors program, our \nMedicare Program.\n  As I talked to a number of people over the last week, a lot of people \nsaid, Why now? There are a lot of reasons why now. The bigger question \nI have is why didn't we do it 6 months ago or a year ago or 2 years \nago. Prescription drugs have become an integral part of health care \ndelivery, of the tools, of the equipment, of the armamentarium that a \nphysician has, that a nurse has, that health care providers have, to \ngive people security, health security, and especially to give seniors \nhealth care security. That is the purpose of our Medicare Program, to \ngive seniors that health care security. Yet we have this very important \nbenefit today--much more important today than 10 years ago or 20 years \nago or 30 years ago when Medicare was started--these prescription \ndrugs, which are vital to health care security for seniors.\n\n  We will be addressing, 2 weeks from today on the floor of the Senate, \nfor a 2-week period, how to strengthen and improve Medicare. To answer \nthat question, Why address the issue now? I think there are three \nreasons.\n  First, I think we have a unique opportunity because the political \nenvironment is right. When I say political environment, I mean the \nresponsiveness that we demonstrate to what our constituents want and \nwhat they demand and, indeed, what they deserve. Indeed, in terms of \nthe political environment, we have seen the call for prescription \ndrugs, proposals to deliver prescription drugs, enter into a number of \ncampaigns 6 months ago around the United States of America, in the \ncampaign cycles from 2 years ago, and that is simply a reflection of \nthe importance of the issue to the American people.\n  Second, we have a unique opportunity because, I believe, the \nlegislative stars are aligned at this point in time--unlike last year, \nunlike 3 years ago, and possibly unlike 2 or 3 years from now. By that \nI mean that we have a President of the United States who has spoken out \nboldly and forcefully that this is important to our domestic agenda. In \nfact, the President put out a framework several months ago \ndemonstrating his commitment and the commitment of this administration \nto strengthening Medicare, to improving Medicare, and at the same time \nadding this new and important benefit of prescription drugs.\n  When I say the legislative stars are aligned, it starts in many ways \nthere because it takes that bold leadership because this will be the \nsingle most significant and most expensive change in the history of \nMedicare, a new benefit at the same time we strengthen and modernize \nMedicare. But it also takes bold leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives and bold leadership on the floor of the Senate. As a \nphysician, as majority leader of the Senate, I have made it very clear \nthat this is a huge priority for the leadership of this body. Indeed, \nthat reflects the leadership in the last Congress where Medicare reform \nand modernization and prescription drugs were discussed on the floor \nfor 2 or even 3 weeks, but where we were not able to bring to it a \nconclusion.\n  Then we have a House of Representatives, as we look at these \nlegislative stars. Indeed, it is lined up. This will be the third \nCongress, maybe the fourth\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\nbut the third Congress that I recall, that will have put forth and \npassed a bold, comprehensive plan.\n  So when you have bold leadership in the White House by the President \nof the United States, you have this body, which is committed--committed \nto giving our seniors what they deserve, you have a majority leader who \nhappens to be a physician, who has taken care of, personally, tens of \nthousands of patients who would be beneficiaries of this type of \nprogram--and a House that is committed, we can do it.\n  The third reason we have this unique opportunity, and which is one \nthat we have little control over, is the unprecedented aging of the \npopulation which was defined post-World War II and what we know today \nas the baby boomers. This unprecedented fertility curve that happened \nafter World War II, this move in our population which begins to hit in \nabout 6 or 7 years, resulted in a doubling of the number of seniors. \nFrom where we are today over the next 30 years, that doubling of the \nnumber of seniors is going to call for health care security. It is \ngoing to make it very expensive. Therefore, we need to look in whatever \nwe do today to make sure we meet that fundamental criterion of having \nit be sustainable over time, and not to make promises that can't be \nsustained when we are going to have twice as many people demanding and \ndeserving the services for that health care security.\n  That unprecedented tidal wave of the aging of our population is what \nwe need to face as responsible legislators. What complicates that huge \nincrease in demand for services is that in the pay-as-you-go system, \nthe number of workers out there who are actually paying into the system \nis going to fall over time. About seven workers in 1970 would support \none senior. I just told you that we are going to double the number of \nseniors. But no longer having seven workers support every senior, it is \nnow down to about four workers for every senior. And it will go down to \nabout 2.9 workers for every senior. For every one senior you have over \nhere, you are going to have fewer people working harder to provide \nthose services, and on top of that you have a doubling of the number of \nseniors receiving those services.\n  This underscores the need to approach this modernization, this \nstrengthening, this reform, this improvement of Medicare, especially \nsince we are adding on top of that system I just described the single \nlargest addition of benefits in the history of Medicare.\n  Even with benefits as designed today which we have already promised, \nthe system itself is difficult to sustain because of this doubling of \nseniors, and with almost a halving of the number of people paying in. \nOn top of that, we have the challenge of adding a very expensive \nservice.\n  It is estimated that seniors will spend about $2 trillion in \nmedicines over the next 10 years. I would say that is a low estimate. \nIf we were to promise all seniors all of their prescription drugs for \nthe next 10 years, that would be $2 trillion which we would be putting \non the system. Today, for all health care, we spend about $250 million \na year. That simply can't be sustained long term. But that is the \nchallenge which we have.\n  Let me say that as a physician and as someone who has been involved \nin delivering care to seniors, Medicare has been hugely successful. The \nMedicare Program, which is now a little over 35 or 38 years old, has \nbeen hugely successful. Seniors would have been driven to financial \nruin. They would not have received the health care benefits because \nthere would be too many barriers without this great program. The \nproblem and the challenge is that the program itself has not changed \nvery much over the last 30 years. We have changed it a little bit on \nthe floor of the Senate, but at the same time health care delivery has \nchanged dramatically. We know better how to deliver care in a \ncontinuous way that looks at quality, constant monitoring, and chronic \ndisease, but none that have ever been incorporated into this \ngreat program, but a stagnant program that hasn't kept up with the \ntimes, with the great advances, such as difficult heart transplants--I \nwas involved in putting in artificial hearts as a surgeon in that \narena--with a little stint; and the angioplasty. None of that was done \nin 1965 when Medicare started--zero.\n\n  The system changes so little. And you can go through every specialty \nof health care. These rapid changes in health care simply are \nincorporated only very slowly with years of lag time, if they are \nincorporated at all. In Medicare, there is very little preventive \nmedicine, for example. It has been a great program, a tremendous \nprogram, and a program we need to preserve. But we need to improve it \nand strengthen it over time.\n  Our challenge is that a lot of the seniors listening to me are \nthinking their Medicare is OK. You politicians up there in Washington, \nDC may have been a doctor in the past and now may be a U.S. Senator, \nbut just do not touch what I have. I may be 80 years old, or 85. I \ndon't want any politician tinkering with my health care that I think is \nOK.\n  That is going to be a challenge as well because a lot of people are \ngoing to say don't touch it at all.\n  I would argue that seniors deserve for us to touch it. Don't take \nanything away from seniors. If they want to keep what they have today, \nthey can keep exactly what they have. But at the same time we have an \nobligation to let seniors and soon-to-be seniors know the program is \nnot as good as health care which can be delivered today, and which is \ndelivered today in the private sector. They need to know that.\n  For example, Medicare doesn't cover catastrophes. That simply means \nif you are very sick, with Medicare there is no limit of $1,000, \n$10,000, $50,000, or $100,000 that you are going to pay in. You are \nalways going to be paying out-of-pocket a certain percentage. For \nexample, with physicians, you might be paying 15 or 20 percent of \nwhatever that physician charges. But for the rest of your life--no \nmatter if you have a catastrophe, if you had $100,000 in bills, there \nis no cap in Medicare. That is not true in the private sector. There is \na catastrophe cap for most health care plans.\n  Second, Medicare today does not offer very much in the way of \npreventive care. We know that if we catch the disease early and we \nmanage it well before you require hospitalization, before you require \nsurgery, and before you require radiation therapy, you are going to \nhave huge cost savings. But, more importantly, you will have a better \nquality of life for the rest of your life.\n  That takes prevention--catching those cancers when they are tiny, \nbefore they have spread throughout the body, or catching that heart \ndisease before it has manifested itself in shortness of breath, or \ncongestive heart failure and not being able to get out of bed. We do it \nall the time today. Yet annual physical exams are not covered in \nMedicare.\n  I would tell seniors who say they are getting good coverage today to \nask whether there should be some prevention involved. Right now \nMedicare has very little.\n  Second, wouldn't you like to have a plan that limits your out-of-\npocket expenditures?\n  Third, Medicare today--as great a program as it has been--does not \ncover prescription drugs. If you talk to seniors today and ask somebody \nwho is 80 or 85 years of age, Are you on prescription drugs, they will \nsay, No, hopefully, but in all likelihood they will say Yes, for my \ndiabetes, or for my congestive heart failure, or for my obstructive \npulmonary disease, for my arthritis. Really, you can pick any one as \nyou go through.\n\n  Thus, I would argue, if you are saying you deserve health care \nsecurity, you deserve some health with your prescription drugs, yet you \ndon't get it today at all in Medicare, there are things which we can do \nto strengthen it. The value of the benefit package is inferior to what \nis in the private sector today--inferior to what I would argue seniors \ndeserve today.\n  I list these things because it is important for people to realize \nthat as good as Medicare is, it simply does not provide what is \navailable and what seniors deserve. If you are a senior, look at your \ntotal expenditures for health care. Medicare only pays about half of \nthem. That means you have to figure out some way to pay for the other \nhalf. You might do it by buying other supplementary insurance policies, \nor by getting discounts, or whatever you have to do. In some way or \nanother you have to figure out how to pay for it.\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\n  That is certainly not true for people in this body, or for the 9 \nmillion Federal employees who are not responsible for 50 percent of \ntheir health care today under their insurance program.\n  We need to change Medicare so it gives a better value and so our \nseniors will be able to get the health care they need without being \nunfairly punished by having to pay so much out of pocket--so much more \nthan, say, Federal employees. The list goes on.\n  As we debate, we will talk more at length about these issues.\n  I want to mention one other problem with Medicare that we need to \ndebate on this floor; that is, the fragmentation of the system.\n  In 1965, through compromise at the time, there was a Part A for \nphysicians and a Part B for hospitals. It has been fragmented into two \nseparate categories.\n  Today, health care needs to be continuous. There needs to be a \ncontinuum. You want ongoing, continuous quality management, and you \ndon't need different financing systems or different record keeping or \ndifferent deductibles or different copayments set up. It is just not an \nefficient and effective way to deliver health care today.\n  In short, the Medicare system--again, as good as it is--does not live \nup to the standard we have set in the private sector. It is now time to \naddress that gap, which we will be doing on the floor of the Senate.\n  Medicare today is still set up the way it was in the 1960s and in the \n1970s to respond to acute episodic care. People get sick and go to the \nhospital. You treat them, and they go home.\n  That is not the way health care is delivered today in the private \nsector where you want to keep people out of the hospital, where it is \nnot just acute care, where you are not just responding to a heart \nattack. The idea today is to prevent the heart attack in the first \nplace. Now we have the expertise to do it, we have the medicines to do \nit, but seniors are not getting it today.\n  So what are we going to see play out here in the next month? We will \nbegin to hear--probably starting tomorrow--a lot of discussion of the \nvarious plans that have been both proposed in the past and that the \nFinance Committee is thinking about. The Senate Finance Committee now \nis developing a balanced plan, a balanced proposal that draws upon a \nlot of the legislation that has come to this body, legislation that, in \nthe last Congress, was the tripartisan plan, and a plan from several \nyears ago that John Breaux and I worked on, and a House-passed plan \nfrom last Congress and the Congress before, and the framework put forth \nby the President of the United States.\n  I hope and pray but I am committed to see that we develop a \nbipartisan plan, bringing the best out of this body, from Democrats and \nRepublicans, to address some of the needs--hopefully all of the needs--\nthat I outlined a few minutes ago that make Medicare today less than \nwhat seniors deserve.\n  Over the next 2 weeks there will be a lot of discussion on this \nissue. Two weeks from now, on the floor of the Senate, we will be \ndebating the legislation for 2 weeks. I am hopeful we can pass a plan \nout of the Senate before July 1 that responds to these needs.\n  I mention it has to be balanced and it has to be bipartisan. I say \nthat for lots of reasons. In large part, it is because this is a huge \nchallenge. We are going to have to take the very best of the Republican \nideas, the very best of the Democrat ideas, the very best of the \nPresident's ideas, and the very best of the House's ideas and put them \ntogether. This will be the single largest expansion of Medicare in the \nhistory of the Medicare Program. As I said, it is going to be about $2 \ntrillion that seniors are going to be spending over the next 10 years. \nWe need to debate, as we go forward, how we can lower that barrier so \nseniors can get those prescription drugs.\n  I will close by saying that reform, modernization, strengthening has \nto be linked to prescription drugs, and prescription drugs have to be \nlinked to strengthening and improving Medicare. It does not make sense \nin a fragmented system that doesn't have very much in preventive care \nthat was built on a 1960s model. It does not make sense to superimpose \na brand new benefit without taking advantage of putting all that in a \nsingle system that gives continuity, quality assurance, a systems \napproach where you can reduce medical errors that we know occur today.\n  There are five key principles that will guide our legislative \nefforts.\n  I think, first and foremost, we need to stress that whatever we do \nneeds to be patient-centered. We need to think of that senior, what we \ncan do to give him or her health care security, building whatever \nchanges are needed around that.\n  Second, our seniors deserve the opportunity to voluntarily choose the \nhealth care plan, the health care coverage that best meets their \nindividual needs. It is revolutionary in many ways but to look at a \nsenior and say: You will have the opportunity, A, to keep exactly what \nyou have now, what you have under current law, or, B, you can choose a \ntype of coverage that better meets your individual needs, which may \nfocus on your chronic disease of heart failure, which may involve \ndisease management of your diabetes, and which will include preventive \ncare, so whatever your status is when that progresses, we will pick it \nup early. Seniors will be able to voluntarily choose the type of health \ncoverage and drug benefit that best meets their individual needs.\n\n  Third, seniors also deserve coverage where they have continuous \nquality management and safety improvements, and that requires a systems \napproach. You hear about these medical errors being made in hospitals, \nconfusing prescriptions and medicines that interact with each other. I \nthink that is the sort of thing we can avoid if we incorporate it in \nthe legislation. I know we can do it in the legislation that evolves \nover the next several weeks.\n  Fourth, as I look at these principles, seniors deserve to be able to \ncapture innovation. If we figure out a newer, better way to do \nsomething that will improve health care, that innovation should be \ncaptured. You should not have to wait 4 years to have access to \ninnovation. It was 4, maybe even 5 years after heart transplants were \nwidely available that they were made available in the Medicare Program. \nSeniors should not have to wait that long, if it is crystal clear, if \nthe data is there, that this type of therapy is effective.\n  The fifth principle I would add is that seniors deserve coverage that \nis less bureaucratic, that has less paperwork, that is more flexible, \nso it can, indeed, adapt to the times.\n  We have a huge task ahead of us. A lot of people say they don't know \nif it can be done over the course of the next month. I am confident it \ncan be done, in large part because much of the work was done in the \nlast Congress, and it is being done both on the floor of the Senate and \nin the House of Representatives. We have made tremendous progress. We \nare building on a lot of the work that has been done in the past.\n  I am confident it can be done because the American people want it to \nbe done. I am confident it can be done because people in this body--\nDemocrat and Republican--want to do what is best for seniors, what is \nbest for individuals with disabilities. I think we are going to see \nthat responsiveness of this body play out over the next 4 weeks. I am \nexcited about it.\n  The House of Representatives will likely be considering strengthening \nMedicare, addressing prescription drugs over the course of this month \nas well. If we can both accomplish that--which we are going to work \nvery hard to do--within 6 months, 8 months, or less than a year from \nnow, seniors will have a benefit as they reach out to obtain and use \nthose prescription drugs as part of their health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I welcome our colleagues back. We are \nlooking forward to a very productive few weeks. We know we have a lot \nof work to do in a relatively short time. In particular, work on the \nEnergy bill is\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\ngoing to require a good and vigorous debate. I know there are a number \nof Senators wishing to offer amendments. I hope we can begin that \nprocess in earnest tomorrow. I know there are a number of my Democratic \ncolleagues who have particular issues they wish to address. We will get \ninto many of those issues in earnest as amendments are offered over the \nnext several days.\n  I didn't have the opportunity to hear the distinguished majority \nleader, but he has indicated to me--and I understand he has announced--\nthat it is his interest and his plan to bring up the Medicare reform/\nprescription drug legislation the last couple of weeks of June. We \ncertainly welcome that. We are looking forward to another debate, \npicking up where we left off last year.\n\n  I am concerned, I suppose, that we are moving quickly to this \nlegislation without the benefit of extended discussion or hearings in \nthe committee. I was rather roundly criticized last year after giving \nthe Finance Committee a certain deadline and having failed to meet \nthat, going to the floor so that we could ensure that we would do all \nthat was possible to get a bill through the Senate in order to \nconference with the House prior to the end of the session. That wasn't \npossible, but we made every concerted effort and certainly a case that \nwe could not afford to wait beyond the August recess, which is why we \ntook up the bill last July.\n  We have not had, as I say, an opportunity to see the ideas that our \ncolleagues on the other side are considering as we look at prescription \ndrugs. But I was very appreciative of the report that I got about the \nmajority leader's comments with regard to the value of Medicare. I \nthink it is important to note that some of our colleagues on the other \nside have argued that we ought to eliminate Medicare, or terminate \nMedicare, or dramatically change Medicare--but the distinguished \nmajority leader has noted that Medicare is a very valuable program, and \nindeed that is the case.\n  Before Medicare was created--about 1965--less than half of all senior \ncitizens had health insurance. Today, almost every senior citizen has \nhealth insurance. So I think that alone argues very well for the \nimportance of recognizing the universality of access to health \ninsurance by those at least over the age of 65. We only wish we could \nreplicate that for the rest of the population.\n  I think it is also important to note two other things. First, \nMedicare administrative costs are about 2 to 3 percent. That compares \nvery favorably to the administrative costs of private health care--some \n15 percent. So you have Medicare administrative costs at such a point \nthat would leave 97 percent of the revenue generated that could go to \nbenefits, where in the case of private health insurance, only about 85 \npercent of what revenue is generated is left that could go to benefits. \nThat is a dramatic difference.\n  So those who argue that somehow the private sector is so much better, \nI argue that at least from a benefits structure, an efficiency point of \nview, you can certainly argue that the Medicare prototype or paradigm \nis so much more efficient. I also argue that in South Dakota it is \nalmost impossible to get private health care benefits. You cannot find \nthem in many parts of my State. That is true of a lot of rural areas. \nHealth care benefits, health care insurance in rural areas is almost \nnonexistent, especially if it is provided through managed care. We have \nno managed care, virtually, in South Dakota.\n  So those who argue that somehow there is a panacea in the private \nsector overlook the fact that oftentimes, when it comes to rural areas \nin particular, it is almost impossible to use a private health care \nmodel. That is why we fought so hard last year. That is why when we \noffered the so-called Gramm-Miller-Kennedy legislation, we said, No. 1, \nthere has to be a defined benefit; No. 2, a defined premium; No. 3, a \nway to ensure that rural areas are provided with the benefits; No. 4, \nwe have to ensure as well that there isn't a coverage gap, a so-called \nsickness gap that was used oftentimes to make up for the fact that we \nneeded to provide benefits right out of the box, but because we had \nlimited dollars, they would go through a coverage gap before the \nbenefits would kick in again.\n\n  Now, unfortunately, on all of those particular points, the bill \noffered by our Republican colleagues last year failed. There was a \ncoverage gap. You paid premiums into this health insurance plan all \nyear long, but I'm concerned that in some cases the benefits could kick \nout in February and might not kick back in again until roughly October. \nSo you went through all of the spring and summer paying into the system \nbut not getting any benefit back. That coverage gap was a serious \nomission and, frankly, one of the reasons we didn't believe that plan \nhad much merit. They could not tell us what it was going to cost on a \nmonthly premium, or what the benefits were going to be. They suggested \nthings, but there wasn't any defined benefit. There wasn't any defined \npremium.\n  Then, of course, one of the biggest concerns many of us had is we \ncould not count on the plan being offered in rural areas--especially in \nStates like mine.\n  So I hope as we begin, we can all agree, No. 1, Medicare is a \ncritical program, a success story of tremendous magnitude. Any time you \ncan say you have eliminated the lack of access to health care for a \ncertain group of people almost entirely, that is a success. That is \nexactly what we have done. Can it be improved? Again, like the majority \nleader, I think absolutely it can be. We ought to be providing more \npreventive care. We ought to find ways in which to promote wellness. \nThat ought to be part of any plan. I personally believe there ought to \nbe a lot more screening, a lot more access to all of the available \ntechniques, all of the available methods of ensuring that we catch \nillness early, so preventive care is one of those things we can do. \nAdding a prescription drug benefit--absolutely. But if we are going to \ndo this, let's not make this a big roll of the dice with senior \ncitizens and say we cannot tell you what the premium is going to be, or \nwhat the benefits are going to be, or we cannot tell you for sure when \nyour coverage kicks out and when it kicks back in with the coverage \ngap, or we cannot tell you for sure whether it is going to be offered \nin rural areas, and we will have just a Medicare backup in case all of \nthis fails.\n  Well, that isn't a plan many of us would feel very good about, if, \nultimately, that were the final vote. But I start with the hope and, I \nmust say, the expectation that we can work together to find common \nground; that we can address many of these shortcomings that were so \nevident in last year's legislation among some of our Republican \ncolleagues; and that we can work together constructively.\n  I don't see any reason we cannot finish this legislation by the end \nof this month. But if that is going to happen, I hope, indeed, we can \nsend each other a clear message that we are not looking for a 51-vote \nsolution; we are looking for a 70, 80, or 90-vote solution. We are \nlooking for a compromise in this legislation that brings about a broad \nconsensus.\n  I hope we can use some discipline and avoid bringing up extraneous \nissues. We don't need to get into the array of controversial things \nthat have nothing to do with prescription drugs or Medicare. If you \nwant to derail prescription drugs, bring up any one of these \nextraordinarily controversial things, but I think it would be a very \nunfortunate set of circumstances. I am optimistic, having been given \nthe report of the distinguished majority leader, and I am hopeful that \nwe can work together so that by the end of this work period, not only \nwill we have accomplished a good deal with regard to energy policy, but \nwe will be able to say to seniors and to the country that we have at \nlong last agreed on starting a Medicare benefit for prescription drugs \nthat we can feel good about, that seniors understand, that would be \noffered in rural areas, and that builds on the model that has been such \na success now for the last 40 years.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this weekend's violent repression of \ndemocracy activists in Burma underscores the illegitimacy and brutality \nof the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, and its political \narm, the Union Solidarity Development Association, USDA.\n  Although reports are still coming in from the field, Burmese \ndemocracy activist Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and supporters of the National \nLeague for Democracy, NLD, were attacked on Saturday by armed agents of \nthe junta in Yaway Oo, some 400 miles north of Rangoon. Four people \nwere reported killed, and scores injured and arrested--including Suu \nKyi and other members of the NLD.\n  Given the SPDC's total disregard for the human rights and dignity of \nthe people of Burma, I expect the death toll and number of arrests \nrelating to this incident to rise over the next few days and weeks.\n  Between the attack and the closure of NLD offices and universities, \nthe SPDC has launched a blitzkrieg on freedom in Burma.\n  My immediate concern is for the welfare of all NLD members and their \nsupporters, and for safety and security of Suu Kyi. The world must know \nfor certain that Suu Kyi is alive and well. It is absolutely essential \nthat U.N. Special Envoy Tan Sri Razali Ismail meet with Suu Kyi and \nother imprisoned activists should he travel to Burma later this week.\n  The international community must meet this brutal assault not with \ndiplomatic niceties, but with forceful condemnation and concrete \nsanctions against the thugs in Rangoon.\n  In response to Suu Kyi's arrest and the murder of Burmese democracy \nactivists, the administration should immediately--right now--expand the \nvisa ban against the SPDC to include past and present leadership of \nboth the Council and the USDA. SPDC and USDA assets should be \nidentified in the United States and frozen right now.\n  To paraphrase Winston Churchill, it is time to draw the sword for \nfreedom and cast away the scabbard.\n  Mr. President, I am going to continue to closely follow developments \nin Burma. I will have more to say on this matter tomorrow and later in \nthe week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7186-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, Thursday, May 22, the 5th U.S. Army \ndemobilized Battery C, 2nd Battalion of the South Dakota National \nGuard's 147th Field Artillery. This unit, from Redfield and Miller, was \namong more than 20 Guard and Reserve units from my State called to \nactive duty in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Today, these soldiers and their service become a part of South \nDakota's military heritage. Like those who served in the two world \nwars, in Korea, in Vietnam and numerous other places, this new \ngeneration has answered the call. They have offered to make every \nsacrifice, including life itself, to protect our freedom and security. \nWe must never forget them or the honor with which they served.\n  This unit participated in a mobilization with few precedents in South \nDakota history. Nearly 2,000 Guard and Reserve troops were called to \nactive duty in our State, by far the largest mobilization since World \nWar II. At the time the fighting began, units from more than 20 \ncommunities had been called up, from Elk Point in the south to Lemmon \nin the north, from Watertown in the east to Custer in the west. Indeed, \nour State's mobilization rate ranked among the highest of all the \nStates on a per-capita basis.\n  These soldiers were proud to serve, and their communities are proud \nof them. Across the State, thousands of citizens pitched in to \nparticipate in send-off parades, to lend a hand for families who \nsuddenly had to get by without a mom or dad, and even to assist with \nfinancial hardships caused by the mobilization. This mobilization was a \nStatewide effort, in many ways.\n  South Dakota's Guard and Reserve units provided our active duty \nforces in Iraq with invaluable support. Many units did not participate \ndirectly in combat, which ended more quickly than anyone expected. But \nwe all know that the battle would have been waged much differently if \nour Guard and Reserve units had not been ready to deploy as needed. \nFurthermore, we know that some units will play an important role in the \nwork of restoring peace and order to Iraq, as well as rebuilding basic \ninfrastructure. These tasks will be vital to ensuring that Iraq becomes \na stable nation, hopefully with a prosperous economy and democratic \ngovernment. This is how we can win the peace and save future \ngenerations from another conflict.\n  In addition to the service of this particular unit, I want to \nacknowledge the sacrifices and dedication of the families who stayed \nhome. They are the unsung heroes of any mobilization. They motivate and \ninspire those who are far from home, and they, too, deserve our \ngratitude.\n  Today, I join these families and the State of South Dakota in \ncelebrating the courage, commitment, and success of the members of the \n147th Field Artillery, and I honor their participation in this historic \nevent in our Nation's history. Welcome home. Thanks to all of you for \nyour courage, your sacrifice, and your noble commitment to this country \nand its ideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7186-4", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7186-S7187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         JOBS AND GROWTH TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for H.R. \n2, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.\n  Former President Ronald Reagan often said, ``If you want more of \nsomething, subsidize it. If you want less of it, tax it.'' In recent \npolls, the American people have consistently said they want more job \ncreation and more economic growth. This legislation, which President \nBush is expected to sign into law this weekend, is specifically \ntailored to achieve these very important goals--by reducing taxes in \nthe right way, it will enable businesses to create jobs and it will \nspur greater economic growth. It will also help American families keep \nmore of their hard-earned money to spend or save, as they see fit.\n  One of the most important things the legislation does is accelerate \nthe tax rate cuts already scheduled to take effect. In 2001, Congress \npassed a law that set in motion a series of income tax rate reductions \nthat were scheduled to be phased in over the next several years. \nBecause of the slow phase-in, the 2001 tax cuts had a muted impact on \nthe U.S. economy and taxpayers felt little benefit. The bill we pass \ntoday will make all of those rate reductions effective this year. \nTaxpayers will see their withholding adjusted almost immediately and \nwill begin reaping the benefits right away.\n  A key component of this provision is that it brings the top tax rate \ndown to 35 percent--the same rate that corporations pay. While \nopponents claim this will only benefit wealthy taxpayers, I suggest \nthat they look at what kind of taxpayers fall into the top bracket. The \noverwhelming majority--nearly 80 percent--of taxpayers in the top \nbracket have small business income. Small businesses, which are pass-\nthrough entities that are taxed at individual rates, are responsible \nfor the creation of at least half of all jobs in the economy; reducing \ntheir tax burden will help them expand and create more jobs. Fairness \nand sound economics dictate that we should not tax small businesses at \na higher rate than we tax big corporations. This bill fixes this so \nthat the top small business rate will be the same as the top corporate \nrate.\n  Our bill also significantly reduces the taxes individuals pay on \ndividends they receive from corporations. In order to change investment \nbehavior--and we know that the ongoing economic troubles are almost \nexclusively related to a collapse in business investment, not to a \nproblem of consumer demand--taxpayers must see a meaningful and \npermanent reduction in rates at the margins. The bill we pass today \ndoes that.\n  Under current law, a corporation pays taxes on its earnings, usually \nat a rate of 35 percent, and its shareholders\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\nwill pay ordinary income rates--currently, the top rate is 38.6 \npercent, on any dividends distributed by the corporation. President \nBush said we should end this double taxation by eliminating entirely \nthe tax on individuals. I fought hard for the original Senate bill that \nwould have done this, and I still believe that is the best tax and \neconomic policy. However, the conferees from the House were unwilling \nto agree. The compromise we settled on will reduce the individual tax \nrate for dividends to 15 percent--a significant improvement over \ncurrent law. I will continue to work to eliminate the double tax on \ndividends.\n\n  The bill we pass today also reduces the capital gains rate from 20 \npercent to 15 percent, the same rate we will now apply to dividends. I \nbelieve this is also good policy and I hope we can work to eliminate \nthe tax on capital gains too. The dividend and capital gains tax relief \nshould boost stock values significantly and should make it much less \ncostly for businesses to expand and create jobs. Nearly 420,000 Arizona \ntaxpayers will benefit from the dividends and capital gains tax relief.\n  This legislation also includes a number of provisions designed to \nprovide much-needed tax relief to American families. It increases the \nchild tax credit to $1,000 per child, with a good portion of the tax \nbenefits being sent to families as early as this summer. It also \nprovides additional relief from the marriage penalty. In Arizona alone, \nnearly 450,000 families will benefit from the child credit increase and \nmore than 600,000 will benefit from the marriage penalty relief.\n  As I have said, I believe this is a very good bill that will do much \nto encourage job creation and economic growth, but I believe it could \nhave been better. If the House had been willing to accept some offsets, \nwe could have paid for the $20 billion in temporary State aid this bill \nprovides. I also believe we should have held firm to the Senate \nposition and eliminated the double tax on dividends. Regardless, I am \nvery proud of the business, individual and family tax relief we have \nprovided in this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7187-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate \ncrimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I introduced \nthe Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention a landmark report \nby the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee's Research \nInstitute, ADCRI, entitled, ``Report on Hate Crimes and Discrimination \nAgainst Arab Americans: The Post-September 11 Backlash.'' This report \ncatalogues the experiences of the Arab-American community for the year \nfollowing the tragic September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. According to \nthe report, over 700 violent incidents targeting Arab Americans, or \nthose perceived to be Arab Americans, Arabs and Muslims occurred in the \n9 weeks following the attacks.\n  The report demonstrates the profound challenges confronting the Arab-\nAmerican community, as well as other communities caught up in the post \nSeptember 11 backlash. However, the report also emphasizes that \nAmericans have consistently demonstrated their commitment to \nmaintaining tolerance and respect for all Americans and that hatred is \nconfined to a distinct minority. It is this minority that breeds hatred \nand violence against innocent individuals.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend us against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well. This is a challenge that none of \nmy colleagues should shy away from.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7187-2", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BRANDON WORKMAN\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \naccelerate the increase in the refundability of the child tax credit, \nand for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. M. President, I am proud to introduce today the Working \nTaxpayer Fairness Restoration Act. I offer this bill on behalf of the \nnearly 12 million children who were left behind when President Bush \nsigned the 2003 tax bill.\n  The bill that I am introducing, with many of my good friends, \nincluding Senators Snowe, Warner and Jeffords, will restore a provision \nleft on the cutting-room floor when House and Senate leaders finalized \nthe conference report on the tax cut. Our bill will restore the \nadvanced refundability of the child tax credit.\n  My friend from Maine and I have worked since 2001 to ensure that all \nworking families benefit from the child tax credit. We worked to ensure \nin the 2001 tax cut that the child tax credit was refundable. During \nFinance Committee deliberations on this year's tax bill, I successfully \noffered an amendment that would have advanced the refundability of the \nchild tax credit. Regrettably, that provision was dropped in \nconference.\n  Unless we pass the bill that I am introducing today, families with \nincomes between $10,500 and $26,625 will not get the $400 checks that \nwill be mailed in July as part of the 2003 tax bill. Since nearly half \nthe taxpayers in Arkansas have adjusted gross incomes less than \n$20,000, Arkansas families are among the hardest hit by this omission \nin the new tax law.\n  Consider this: The base pay for a private in the military is just \nunder $16,000 per year. The average Arkansas firefighter makes between \n$22,000 and $25,000 a year. Many of those enlisted men, who could be \ngiven a few days' notice before being shipped off to war, and those \nfirefighters, who could get no more than a few minutes' notice before \nrushing into a terrorist attack, have families. They work hard to \nsupport their families and to protect us. Yet they got left out when \nnegotiators shook hands over the final tax bill.\n  I wasn't in the room during those negotiations in the dark of night, \nand I understand that very few of my colleagues were. But we are here \ntoday, united in our effort to fight for these working families.\n  Advancing the refundable portion of the child credit to cover these \nfamilies will cost only $3.5 billion--just 1 percent of the entire cost \nof the tax cut. This measure had strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate, and I was proud to play a leading role to expand the children \ntax credit in the Senate bill. I'm glad to have bipartisan support in \nmy effort today to restore this provision.\n  We will pay for this tax relief for working families by shutting down \nsome Enron-related tax shelters. This pay-for was included in the \nSenate version of the 2003 tax bill, so it has already received the \nblessing of a majority of the Senate.\n  Especially as our nation contends with a sluggish economy, we should \nensure that everyone benefits from the tax cut. After all, buying blue \njeans for schoolchildren, washing powder for the laundry or tires for \nthe car costs just as much for a family making $20,000 a year as it \ndoes for a family making $100,000. If we want to get our economy back \non track, we need to make sure that we're putting money into the \npockets of consumers who will spend it.\n  This isn't about partisanship--as is evidenced by the cosponsors of \nthis bill--it is about doing what's right for\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nfamilies who may need a little extra help. We should fix this problem \nimmediately. Let's make these families a priority now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON:\n  S. 1163. A bill to condition of receipt certain State revolving funds \non the restriction of development or construction of new colonia and \ncolonia structures along the border between the United States and \nMexico; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a bill to \nimprove the deplorable housing situation on the U.S. border with \nMexico. In Texas along the 1,248 mile stretch from Cameron County to El \nPaso County, there are more than 1,400 colonias, or underdeveloped \nsubdivisions, that suffer from such conditions as open sewage, a lack \nof indoor plumbing, and poor housing construction. These colonias are \nthe most distressed areas in the country, yet despite terrible living \nconditions, they have grown in population. The legislation I introduce \ntoday, along with the Colonias Gateway Initiative Act which I am \nsponsoring, will go a long way toward eliminating the substandard \nliving conditions that should not exist here in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  This legislation will prohibit Federal funding for counties and \nmunicipal governments that refuse to enforce reasonable rules to \nprevent the development or construction of any new colonias that lack \nwater, wastewater, and other basic infrastructure needs. I have \ninserted and the Senate has passed this exact language into the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill every year since fiscal year 2001.\n  In 1993, I visited with a woman named Elida Bocanegra, who led me \nthrough the streets of the colonia where she lived. Elida showed me her \ncommunity, which lacked paved roads, wastewater facilities and running \nwater. Quite frankly, I could not believe I was in America. After that \nexperience, the first amendment I offered as a U.S. Senator authorized \n$50 million for a colonias clean-up project.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to provide from the Highway Trust Fund additional funding for \nIndian reservation roads, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the American \nIndian Reservation Transportation Improvement Program Act. I am pleased \nto be joined, as I have been each time that I have introduced \nlegislation dealing with the Indian Reservation Roads program, by my \ngood friends, Senators Inouye and Campbell. I am confident that we will \nreplicate the success we have had in our previous endeavors to improve \nthis important program.\n  In 1982, when I served on the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, several members of the Navajo Nation Tribal Council \nCommittee on Transportation approached me with an interesting \nproposition. These Navajo Councilmen believed that the time had come \nfor Indian tribes to participate directly in our National Highway Trust \nFund programs.\n  I agreed with these gentlemen, the Senate agreed with me, and the \nCongress and President Reagan approved Indian tribal participation in \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation highway construction program for \nthe first time in our Nation's history.\n  By the mid-1980's, Indian Reservation Roads, IRR, funding was at \nabout $100 million per year nationwide. By the late 1980's, however, \nIRR funding fell to about $80 million per year. In ISTEA, for the early \n1990's, we were able to raise this critical highway construction \nfunding to about $190 million per year.\n  Then, in TEA-21, The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, \nwe succeeded in bringing annual IRR funding up to $275 million for \nfiscal years 1999 through 2003.\n  As we seek to promote economic opportunities on our Nation's tribal \nreservations, I believe it is imperative that we once again increase \nthis vital infrastructure funding. I am aware that the National \nCongress of American Indians, NCAI, is recommending a large jump to \n$500 million per year for the construction program; $100 million for an \nIndian transit program; $50 million for Indian bridges; $70 million, \nplus $26 million in Interior funding, for road maintenance; and several \nother additions for a total of $907 million in DOT funds in FY2004. By \nthe year FY2009, the NCAI recommendations would exceed $1.4 billion \nannually.\n  While I am sympathetic to the need for such large increases, I am \nkeenly aware of competing needs around the country for medical \nresearch, economic stimulus, and for our national defense, to name just \na few. Therefore, I am compelled to recommend increases for the IRR \nprogram that are more likely to win acceptance among my colleagues.\n  For highway construction, I am recommending an immediate increase of \n$55 million in the first year to a new total of $330 million. My bill \nwould then increase the amount for construction by $30 million each \nyear so that the program receives $480 million in the final year of the \nauthorization. For the Indian bridge program, I am recommending $15 \nmillion per year, an increase of $6 million annually. And for State \nroads that serve as key bus routes for Indian children, primarily on \nour Nation's largest Indian reservation--the Navajo Nation--I am \nrecommending increasing this vital funding from $1.5 million per year \nto $3 million in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, to $4 million in fiscal \nyears 2006 and 2007, and $5 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2009.\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\n  My final recommendation is to create a rural transit program for \nIndian Reservations. Because the Federal Highway Administration and the \nFederal Transit Administration each have their areas of expertise that \ncan make such a program a success, my legislation will require the two \nagencies to work together for the benefit of the tribes who participate \nin this program. My suggestion is to fund this program at $20 million.\n  In closing, I want to thank the Navajo Nation Transportation \nCommittee and the tribal transportation department for keeping me \ninformed of their progress and continuing needs. I believe my bill will \nbe a positive answer to their requests. In addition, the Pueblo Indians \nand Apache Indians of New Mexico have continuing development needs, \nincluding new and improved roads to reach their many attractions for \ntourists and other visitors.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in increasing the Indian Reservation \nRoads program funds in our Federal Highways Programs to the degree I \nhave requested in this bill. I thank my colleagues and urge their \nsupport for these increases as we reauthorize TEA-21 for six more \nyears.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1165\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to resolve the boundary conflicts in Barry and Stone \nCounties in the State of Missouri; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nresolve the unfortunate boundary line disputes in Southwest Missouri \nthat have resulted from conflicting Federal Government land surveys \nperformed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the United States \nForest Service, USFS, respectively. The land involving these disputed \nproperty lines is located in the vicinity of the Cassville District of \nthe Mark Twain National Forest in Barry and Stone Counties adjacent to \nTable Rock Lake.\n  During the 1970's, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, through various \nprivate land surveyors, surveyed this area around Table Rock Lake. In \nits surveys, the Corps found that most of the original ``corner \nmonuments'' or boundary lines laid out by the U.S. General Land Office, \nGLO, in its original land surveys performed in the 1840's were either \nlost, stolen or had eroded over the years. Because of this, Corps \nsurveyors used existing de-facto land markers in the vicinity of the \noriginal GLO monuments as the basis for its new survey. Prior to the \nCorps surveys, these defacto monuments were recognized by local \nsurveyors as legitimate boundary markers and were used in survey after \nsurvey over the decades.\n  For almost 30 years, private landowners in Barry and Stone Counties \nbought and sold their land based on the surveys performed by the Corps \nin the 1970's. However, several years ago, the USFS performed new land \nsurveys using surveying technology that had only recently become \navailable. As a result of these new surveys, the USFS now claims that \nthe boundary lines in its surveys conflict with the boundary lines \nestablished in the previous corps surveys. In addition to this, the \nUSFS has announced that the Corps surveys are incorrect and that \nproperty lines all over this area are in the wrong place.\n  Because of these new revelations, many private property owners in the \nvicinity of the Mark Twain National Forest, who bought and paid for \ntheir land in good faith based on a previous Federal Government survey, \nare now being told that they have encroached on USFS land.\n  USFS has begun telling these private landowners that their land now \nbelongs to the Federal Government, and that they will have to reimburse \nthe USFS for the Federal land that the landowners now occupy. \nNaturally, these actions have produced chaos, confusion and anger among \nlandowners in these two counties.\n  Needless to say, it is inherently unfair and absolutely devoid of any \ncommon sense to expect private landowners to compensate the Federal \nGovernment for land that they have already purchased simply because the \ngovernment has changed its collective mind about where Federal property \nbegins and ends.\n  Over the past 18 months, I have repeatedly asked the USFS and the \nArmy Corps of Engineers to work together to find a solution that would \nresolve this problem. Unfortunately, after 18 month of debate and \ndisagreement, the Corps of Engineers and the USFS have been unable to \nagree on a resolution of this problem. In the meantime, the lives of \nmany of these Missouri residents continue to be disrupted.\n  Therefore, I have concluded that Federal legislation represents the \nonly feasible solution to this boundary problem. This legislation \nauthorize the Secretary of the Agriculture to convey, without \nconsideration, title to land in which there is a boundary conflict, \nwith adjoining federal land, to private landowners, who can demonstrate \na claim of ownership because they relied on a subsequent land survey \napproved by the Federal Government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/06/02/senate-section/article/S7195-1", "month": "06", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 840.
