Mr. President, over the weekend, east of Fallujah, Iraq, \na roadside bomb exploded, taking the life of SSG Kenneth Hendrickson, a \nmember of the National Guard 957th Multi-Role Bridge Company.\n  SSG Hendrickson is from Bismarck, ND, where he lived with his wife \nand son and near his mother Adeline. His father, Lyle Hendrickson, is \nnow a Pendleton County commissioner in South Dakota.\n  Staff Sergeant Hendrickson was only 4 weeks away from returning home. \nShortly before the attack that would take his life, his parents were \ntold not to send anymore letters or care packages because he would be \nheading home before any other mail could reach him in Iraq.\n  Staff Sergeant Hendrickson served his country with courage. Every \nAmerican owes him and the entire Hendrickson family a debt of thanks \nfor his service, as well as his sacrifice. His death reminds us that \nnearly 150,000 of our sons and daughters still face danger in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and that fathers, mothers, husbands, wives, and children \nstill wait anxiously for their loved ones' safe return.\n  It reminds us, too, that more than 500 American soldiers have been \nlost since the Iraqi war began and about 3,000 have been wounded.\n  The families of South Dakota have borne a particularly heavy toll \nduring this war. South Dakota has a higher proportion of its citizens \nserving the Guard in Iraq than any other State in the country right \nnow.\n  There is nothing we can do to fully repay the men and women for their \nservice. But in thanks for their commitment to our protection, we must \ncommit ourselves to their protection as well. Our first responsibility \nis to give them every tool and technological advantage available to \nhelp them do their jobs and return home safely.\n  Regrettably, we have received numerous reports that the Defense \nDepartment is not doing all it can with regard to protecting our \ntroops. From the very first deployments, we were\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\ntold members of the South Dakota Guard and Army Reserve were not \nequipped with the most effective body armor that should be standard \nissue. Soldiers from other States have suffered similar supply \nshortcomings.\n  We attempted to address this issue in the supplemental appropriations \nand the regular 2004 Defense appropriations bill with an extra $420 \nmillion specifically to ensure that every soldier facing fire had the \nbest body armor money can buy.\n  The DOD promised us the problem would be solved by the beginning of \nDecember. As it became clear they would miss this deadline, we were \nthen told it would be solved this January. However, today, 10 months \nafter the start of the conflict in Iraq, we continue to hear reports \nthat Guard and Reserve personnel, as well as others, lack top-of-the-\nline body armor and other vital equipment.\n  In a few days, another 800 South Dakota Guard soldiers will be sent \nto Iraq to begin a year-long deployment. They have volunteered to face \ndanger on our behalf. We owe them and the families they leave behind \nevery effort to protect them from harm. Our obligation to stand by \nGuard members and Reservists cannot and should not end once they return \nhome.\n  Increasingly, Guard members are facing the same bullets as full-time \nsoldiers. We owe them the same commitment to their health and well-\nbeing. That means giving them access to the same health care that full-\ntime soldiers currently enjoy.\n\n  Recent studies indicate now one-fifth of National Guard and Reserve \nmembers lack health care when they come home. Last year, thanks in part \nto a bipartisan coalition of Senators, we established a 1-year program \nto provide a significant number of our Reservists and their families \naccess to TRICARE, the military health care system, when they are not \non duty. Today, that same bipartisan coalition will introduce \nlegislation to make that coverage permanent.\n  Our bill would improve the readiness of our force and enhance the \nability of the military to recruit and retain a new generation of \nsoldiers. This legislation is important because these troops are \nperforming a greater share of the fighting than at any other time in \ndecades.\n  By May, 40 percent of the more than 100,000 U.S. troops in Iraq will \nbe Guard members or Reservists. Yet as we depend more heavily on their \nservice, we are receiving troubling signs of discontent and \ninstability.\n  A recent internal survey showed the rate of those Reservists who \ndecide not to reenlist could double in just a few years. Just last \nweek, LTG James R. Helmly, head of the Army Reserves, said:\n\n       This is the first extended-duration war our Nation has \n     fought with an all-volunteer force. We must be sensitive to \n     that, and we must apply proactive, preventive measures to \n     prevent a recruiting-retention crisis.\n\n  Unless this recruiting/retention crisis is addressed, those losses \ncould severely undermine unit readiness and erode America's national \nsecurity.\n  Over the weekend, America lost another hero in Iraq with the death of \nSGT Kenneth Hendrickson. His death serves to remind us of the service \nand sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and what they do for \ntheir country. Their commitment to us is beyond question. It is time we \ndemonstrated real commitment to them and their families as well.\n  Our Guard and Reserve members have not failed us. We must not fail \nthem. We must support our troops, not really with words but with \naction.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. I see on the announcement of the schedule for this \nafternoon that there is an agreement that we will vote on another \nFederal judge. It is my understanding this will be the 170th judge we \nhave approved in the Senate, and with President Bush having given an \ninterim appointment for 1 year to Judge Pickering, the numbers are now \n170 approved by the Senate during the term of President Bush and only 4 \nwho have not gotten approval.\n  Does the Senator agree that those are the numbers?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada, the distinguish \nassistant Democratic leader, is right. That record exceeds the record \nof any predecessor in this period of time. Obviously, the Bush \nadministration has 1 year left before the end of its term. So there is \nlittle doubt that they will probably continue to set records with \nregard to the confirmation of judges.\n  I might add, this is a time when the Democrats were, at least for a \nperiod of time, actually in the majority. They have had good \ncooperation. The four who have not been confirmed have not been \nconfirmed for good reason. Again, we will address the issue of greater \nnumbers and more cooperation this afternoon, as the Senator suggests, \nwith the confirmation of yet another judge.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for one final question, for those \nout there who are saying we are turning down President Bush's judicial \nnominations, the facts are that we have approved 170 who are now or \nshortly will be sitting as judges in the Federal system--they have been \napproved by the Senate--and we have turned down 4. The number then is \n170 approved, 4 turned down. Those are pretty good numbers; does the \nSenator agree?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct. That would be a pretty \nremarkable record if this were the sports world, the business world, or \nthe academic world. I was just reminded that 100 of the 170 who were \nconfirmed were confirmed under a Democratic-controlled Senate. So I \nthink we can look back with great satisfaction.\n  I know there are some who argue we have not been tough enough, we \nhave not been aggressive enough. But I think, as we have said on many \noccasions, where we agree with the President, we will support him. \nWhere we disagree, we have no recourse but to continue to raise these \nreservations and objections, especially with regard to lifetime \nappointments to the Federal bench. I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nraising the issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3108, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3108) to amend the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     temporarily replace the 30-year Treasury rate with a rate \n     based on long-term corporate bonds for certain pension plan \n     funding requirements and other provisions, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Grassley amendment No. 2233, of a perfecting nature.\n       Kyl amendment No. 2236 (to amendment No. 2233), to restrict \n     an employer that elected an alternative deficit reduction \n     contribution from applying for a funding waiver.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, prior to a vote in \nrelationship to amendment No. 2236, there will be 30 minutes equally \ndivided between the chairman and ranking member or their designees, \nwith the initial 10 minutes under the control of the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes of the manager's \ntime on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, Minnesota is home to Northwest Airlines as well as \nIspat Inland Steel Mining Company. I rise today in support of the \npension legislation before us and to urge my fellow colleagues to vote \nfor this bill today.\n  Let me be clear. This legislation is about protecting American \nworkers\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\nand their pension benefits. We are discussing this today because of the \nlong arm of September 11 that continues to swipe through the economic \nlandscape and affect the hard-working people of this country.\n  On January 1, 2000, airline workers' pension plans were over 100 \npercent funded and business was good for their companies. This, of \ncourse, changed dramatically in the days following September 11, and \nthe economy is now beginning to show signs of life again.\n  The airline industry, because of its cyclical nature, always reacts \nstrongly to the economy. This, coupled with the rise in costs because \nof new security measures, a dropoff in passengers, and Eisenhower \nadministration interest rates, has made it difficult, if not \nimpossible, for airlines to keep their pensions fully funded.\n  With regard to steel, Ispat Inland Mining Company is a key component \nof one of the largest operating integrated steel manufacturers in the \nNation and a highly productive mine in my State. Ispat Inland Mining \nCompany and its parent company employ close to 7,000 people who have \nhad the benefit of a defined pension plan since 1936. While funding of \nthis plan has often exceeded 100 percent of the total obligations, \nfunding levels have never fallen below 90 percent of the obligation \nuntil 2003. I think all my colleagues are aware of the impact that the \neconomy and foreign imports have had on the steel industry in the last \ncouple of years.\n  The problem for these companies is the deficit reduction \ncontribution, DRC, which requires companies to close the underfunded \ngap on an accelerated basis. This results in materially higher pension \ncontributions during periods of economic decline. So what sounds like \ntough medicine turns out to be poison--poison--for the airline and \nsteel workers. A major risk is that the accelerated deficit reduction \ncontributions could force the airlines and steel companies to seek \nchapter 11 protection, force them into bankruptcy. Companies, such as \nNorthwest, that are coming back could be forced into bankruptcy by this \nrequired accelerated payment.\n  Unfortunately, I think many understand that in chapter 11 bankruptcy \nthe most likely outcome is the termination of pension plans and the \ntransfer of unfunded liabilities to the PBGC. In effect, we would be \ndestroying the very pension plans that Congress is seeking to preserve.\n  We must take immediate action to ensure that pension plan termination \nis a phrase that never enters the corporate boardroom. People who have \ninvested their lives in a company should not have to live in fear that \nthey will be left out in the cold when they retire.\n  This legislation represents a commonsense approach to help solve the \nproblem. We are providing temporary 2-year relief from some of the \ncashflow requirements of the DRC, and during this period it is \nimportant to understand that companies are still going to make their \nnormal required pension contributions. Pension benefits being accrued \nby active workers will continue to be funded during this temporary \nperiod and lessen any potential risk to the PBGC. I reiterate that the \nrelief is for a portion of the deficit reduction contribution payment, \nnot the regular pension payment. Pension payments are going to be made.\n\n  I am also extremely pleased that my amendment to include iron ore in \nthe definition of steel was included in the managers' amendment. \nMinnesota is the largest producer of iron ore and taconite in the \nUnited States. These products are essential for integrated steel \ncompanies. Advances in technology have found a use for a lower grade \niron ore called taconite. Taconite is crushed, processed into hard, \nmarble-size pellets, and shipped to steel mills. The taconite pellets \nare melted in blast furnaces and then blown with oxygen to make steel. \nAs a result, a healthy steel industry means a more viable taconite \nindustry and more jobs for this economy.\n  The AFL-CIO, the Airline Pilots Association, and the International \nAssociation of Machine and Aerospace Workers support this legislation.\n  With this bill, we are not letting businesses off the hook but we are \ntaking the appropriate steps to provide retirement security for \nconstituents across this Nation.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation \nthat will help restore long-term health to American businesses and \nprotect the retirement money for millions of American workers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout an amendment which I have offered on behalf of U.S. Airways. It \nis an amendment which provides that the pension plan would be \nreinstated. It had been required to fund it within a 5-year period. The \namendment would allow up to 30 years. It would actually save the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation money.\n  The complexity had arisen as to whether this amendment was relevant. \nAs the Congressional Record will show, I spoke about the amendment on \nMonday explaining what the amendment sought to do and detailing the \nhistory as to what had happened with a bill offered by Senator Santorum \nand myself last January 9, and in the hearing of the subcommittee which \nI chair on January 14.\n  I had a series of conversations with the Parliamentarian as to \nwhether the amendment was relevant. I sought unanimous consent on \nMonday to set aside the pending second-degree amendment and an \nobjection was raised. Then a little after 4 yesterday afternoon, I \nconsulted with the Parliamentarian, who had not yet reached a decision, \nand suggested that my staffer confer with the Deputy Parliamentarian, \nwhich was done yesterday afternoon.\n  I was surprised to find a unanimous consent agreement entered into \nwhich precluded the amendment. I have a call in to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Grassley. If possible, I ask if he would \ncome to the floor so we can discuss this matter. The issue was also \npresented to Senator Kennedy. If possible, I ask that he come to the \nfloor. We are operating under a very tight time constraint with the \nagreement now calling for a vote on the pending amendment by about \n11:40, and then votes sequencing to final passage.\n  As a matter of basic fairness, I think we are entitled to have a \nvote. I am not unaware of the fact that there will be a later pension \nbill, but this matter is of great importance to my constituents. The \nU.S. Airways pilots, under the revised plan, sought to have their \npensions reduced to about 25 percent when it was not possible to \nreinstate the earlier plan with an extension of up to 30 years. I think \nthey are entitled to a vote, and we will be back on this matter if we \nare not able to get a vote today.\n  When the Parliamentarian is under active consideration and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, myself, is pursuing the matter, it seems to \nme as a matter of basic fairness we ought not to be foreclosed. So I \nintend to go to the Finance Committee now to talk to Senator Grassley \nto see if we can get a resolution by the Finance Committee, but that is \nthe essence of the situation.\n  To repeat, I think we are entitled to a vote. For the record, I know \nSenator Reid is prepared to object, but I ask unanimous consent that I \nbe permitted to offer this amendment with a 10-minute time agreement \nwhich will not delay the final passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have objections from the \nmajority and minority now on the Finance Committee and also from the \nmajority on the HELP Committee. So based upon that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I understand the reasons of the Senator from Nevada. As \nI said, I am going to be on my way to the Finance Committee to see if I \ncan get a change of decision by the Finance Committee so we can offer \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2263\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there have been a series of discussions, \nand we have worked out an accommodation to permit me to introduce the \namendment on behalf of US Airways pilots. We will handle the vote on a \ndivision vote so that there is at least a semblance of what has \noccurred.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to call up \namendment No. 2263 and that there be a division vote and I be permitted \nto speak under this unanimous consent request for up to 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2263.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the restoration of certain plans terminating \n                                in 2003)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, this amendment would do justice to the US \nAirways pilots who have been very unfairly treated by what has happened \nto the pension with US Airways.\n  The airline has had great problems, as have all the airlines, \nfollowing 9/11. They have been in bankruptcy and have been \nrestructuring their operation. There have been tremendous concessions \nmade by employees of US Airways and the pilots pension was abrogated.\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\n  On January 9, 2003, Senator Santorum and I introduced S. 119, which \nwould have allowed the US Airways pension plan to have up to 30 years \nto meet its obligations instead of the 5-year period. The requirement \nof the 5-year period made it impossible for the pension plan to be \ncontinued. My Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation held a hearing on January 14, 2003, and explored the options.\n  The PBGC declined to honor the request of the US Airways pilots. We \nhave now offered an amendment, which is now pending, which would grant \nup to 30 years for the pension plan to be funded. We call for a \nreinstatement of the earlier plan. In the interim, US Airways has \noffered an additional benefit and we would agree to an offset of that \nagainst the amendment which we are now offering.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time until I hear the \narguments in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senate in a quorum call?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest to my friend from Pennsylvania it appears as if \nthere will be no one speaking in opposition of the argument. It has \nbeen argued several times before. We should move on. We have people who \nare calling both cloakrooms because of the prearranged vote 20 minutes \nago. They have schedules--some downtown, some up here--and I wonder if \nthe Senator could move forward on his final remarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I offer one additional argument; that is, \nif the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, had been \nadopted in a timely way, US Airways would have been able to meet its \npension obligations. We intend to revisit this on the pension bill \nwhich will be coming up at a later time. I have no illusions about the \nlikelihood of success today.\n  However, US Airways pilots have been unfairly treated. When the plan \nwas changed, they got about 25 percent on the dollar. When US Airways \nwould have an obligation to fund the plan, but for a 30-year period, it \nwould save money for the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and they \nwould not have to make payments. So it would be a win-win situation at \nall times.\n  That concludes my argument. I am ready for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe Senator has requested a division vote. All those Senators in favor \nof the amendment will rise and stand until counted.\n  All those opposed will rise and stand until counted.\n  On a division, the amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2236\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, any time we have is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Presiding Officer would yield, we \nhave a unanimous consent request.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that following the vote on passage of the pension rate bill \ntoday, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the \nfollowing nomination on today's Executive Calendar: calendar No. 425, \nthe nomination of Gary L. Sharpe to be a U.S. District Judge for the \nNorthern District of New York.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to a vote on \nthe confirmation of the nomination; further, that following the vote, \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then return to legislative session. I further ask consent that \nthere be 4 minutes equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nmember before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2236\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on agreeing to the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The amendment (No. 2236) was rejected.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Grassley-Baucus-\nGregg-Kennedy amendment. I commend the Finance and HELP Committees for \nworking together in a bipartisan effort to secure the pensions of \nalmost 45 million workers.\n  This legislation is vital to preserving defined benefit pension \nplans, which provide retirees with a monthly benefit that is secured by \nthe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Nearly 35 million workers and \nretirees are covered by single employer plans, and an additional 9.7 \nmillion are covered by multiemployer plans. In all, one in five workers \nparticipates in a defined benefit plan.\n  Unfortunately, these defined benefit pension plans are facing several \nchallenges due to the following ``perfect storm'' of economic \nconditions: the downturn in the stock market was the longest since the \nGreat Depression; the 30-year Treasury bond interest rates have been at \nhistorically low levels; and the weak economy has made it even more \ndifficult for companies to make payments and pay the excise taxes as \ncurrently required by law.\n  As a result of these circumstances, many pension plans are under-\nfunded, and this legislation would help companies weather this storm. \nThere are three main components of this legislation. The first is a 2-\nyear replacement of the 30-year Treasury bond rate used to calculate \nemployers' contributions to pension plans with a corporate bond rate. \nThe second is partial, temporary relief from deficit reduction \ncontributions. The third is relief for multiemployer plans, which often \naid low-wage workers, as well as workers in short-term or seasonal \nemployment.\n  I support all three of these provisions and would like to speak in \nparticular about the need for deficit reduction contribution relief. \nThis relief would aid companies that had well-funded pension plans as \nrecently as 2000, but, due to the current economic storm, need \nassistance now. The assistance we are providing is temporary--only for \n2 years--and partial. It would allow troubled industries, such as \nairlines and steel, to regain their financial footing by providing \nrelief of up to 80 percent in 2004 and up to 60 percent in 2005.\n  I understand that there are concerns regarding liability to the PBGC. \nIf a company we are providing relief to now is forced to terminate its \npension later, PBGC would takeover the pension, and the liability would \nbe increased by the amount of DRC relief that the company had received. \nHowever, this does not take into consideration that if we do not \nprovide companies with DRC relief now, they may be unable to pay their \nDRC surcharges and therefore will be more likely to have their pensions \ninvoluntarily terminated in the first place.\n  Furthermore, the DRC provision in the Pension Funding Equity Act \nwould ensure that no plan will lose ground. Companies that receive DRC \nrelief would be required to contribute at least the amount necessary to \nfund the expected increase in current liability that results from \nbenefits that have accrued during the year.\n  Finally, I know that several Cabinet Secretaries have expressed their \nopposition to DRC relief. However, the White House, in its Statement of \nAdministration Policy, also has acknowledged that ``The DRC is part of \na flawed system of funding rules that should be reviewed and \nreformed.'' Although the White House would prefer to address DRC \nchanges in the context of broader pension reform, we must provide aid \nto these companies and their workers now. For example, United Airlines, \nbased in my home State of Illinois, would benefit from the DRC relief \nin this legislation, and as a result, the pensions of the almost \n130,000 participants in United's pension plans, including over 22,000 \nparticipants in Illinois, would be more secure.\n  Overall, the Grassley-Baucus-Gregg-Kennedy amendment will provide \nnecessary relief for the 45 million workers\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nwho participate in our single and multi-employer pension plans. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in preserving the future of these defined \nbenefit pension plans and supporting this important legislation.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2233\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Iowa.\n  The amendment (No. 2233), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                          multiemployer relief\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This amendment provides short-term relief for \nmultiemployer pension plans that are struggling to cope with \nunprecedented losses on their equity investments in the first few years \nof this decade. The temporary funding relief would help plans deal with \nthe investment losses they suffered through 2002, by letting them \npostpone amortization of the portion of those losses that would \notherwise be recognized for funding purposes in any two of the plan \nyears beginning after June 30, 2002 and before July 1, 2006.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. The proposed relief would permit a short-\nterm postponement of the losses that count toward the required funding \nin any two of the plan years beginning after June 30, 2002 and before \nJuly 1, 2006. The relief may be taken for no more than 2 years.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. For funding purposes, most multiemployer plans \nrecognize investment losses gradually over a period of years. So, part \nof a plan's investment losses incurred in 2000, for example, would \nfirst be recognized under the funding rules in the 2001 plan year. The \nportion of those losses that show up in the funding requirements during \nthe relief period would be eligible for the relief.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As this discussion demonstrates, the focus of the \nrelief is on the portion of the loss that would be recognized for any \nof the plan years for which the relief is available. That is what the \nlanguage means when it refers to losses ``for the plan year.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2233\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This amendment specifically addresses the problems faced \nby the steel and airline industry. However, I also have concerns about \nother types of companies. Some of these companies should be allowed to \naccess the DRC relief that is in this bill. I believe my colleagues \nshare my concerns, and that is why we have included an application \nprocess in this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. We have included the application process \nin this amendment so that other types of companies will also be allowed \nto access the DRC relief in this bill. This application process should \nallow other employers to receive relief, just like the steel and \nairline companies.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This application process is a fundamental piece of the \namendment. It would not be fair to exclude all other employers from the \nDRC relief. There are many companies in other industries that really \nneed this relief, and we have provided access though the application \nprocess.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We have all agreed on the importance of this piece of \nthe amendment, and we all understand that it is not intended to be \nwindow dressing. We expect that Treasury will adhere to the legislative \nintent in crafting this proposal, and implement the application process \nin a way that allows other employers to receive real relief, much like \nthe steel and industry industries will receive.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I share my colleagues' concern, particularly with respect \nto how this application process would apply to small businesses. It is \nvery important that other companies have access to this relief. The \napplication process must provide a means of bringing relief to small \ncompanies.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to see that the \nSenate is taking action on the Pension Equity Act of 2003.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, the pension discount rate relief \ninitiative, enacted in 2001, expired last month. Passage of H.R. 3108 \nwill provide a resolution to this very serious issue. This bill \nreplaces the outdated 30-year Treasury bill rate with a rate based on a \ncomposite of investment grade long-term corporate bonds. Failure to act \non this bill will cause the statutory rate that pension plans must use \nto calculate their assets and liabilities to return to the old 30-year \nrate. Companies with pension plans will shortly have to begin making \nlarge contributions to their plans in the year to come.\n  An amendment to H.R. 3108 will provide relief from the deficit \nreduction contribution, DRC, requirements that certain plans are now \nfacing. Under the current pension funding rules, companies that offer \ndefined benefit pension plans are required to make additional \ncontributions to those plans when they are less than 90 percent funded. \nA pension plan's funding level is determined by comparing the plan's \ncurrent assets to its promised benefits and then calculated as to \nwhether the two will match up by the time the promised benefits are \ndue.\n  The recent drop in the stock market, low interest rates, and generous \npension benefits agreed to in better times have caused many defined \nbenefit pension plans to fall well beneath the 90 percent threshold. As \na result, many companies are being required to make substantial \ncontributions at the time they can least afford them. The Finance \nCommittee reported bill, which I support, included fair DRC relief.\n  While I support these provisions related to pensions, I am \ndisappointed that this body has not worked to enact further reforms. \nTwo months ago, I, along with Senators Snowe and Hatch, introduced S. \n1912, the Retirement Account Portability Act of 2003. In brief, this \nbill will make a number of improvements in the retirement savings \nsystem to help families preserve retirement assets. It will, for \nexample, enhance the portability of retirement savings by expanding \nrollover options in traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and SIMPLE Plans. The \nbill also clarifies that when employees are permitted to make after-tax \ncontributions to retirement plans, those after-tax amounts may be \nrolled over into other retirement plans eligible to receive such \nrollovers. This clarification will make it easier for workers to move \nall elements of their 401(k) or 403(b) savings when they change jobs \nand move between the private sector and the tax-exempt sector.\n  In addition, the bill builds on defined contribution plan reforms \nenacted in 2001 by requiring a shortened vesting schedule for employer \nnonelective contributions, such as profit-sharing contributions, to \ndefined contribution plans. As a result, employer contributions will \nbecome employee property more quickly, helping workers to build more \nmeaningful retirement benefits. This new vesting schedule corresponds \nto rules for 401(k) matching contributions enacted in 2001.\n  The bill also helps preserve retirement savings by allowing plans to \ndesignate default IRAs or annuity contracts to which employee rollovers \nmay be directed. Employers should be more willing to establish default \nIRA and annuity rollover options as a result, making it easier for \nemployees to keep savings in the retirement system when they change \njobs.\n  For workers who leave a job without claiming their retirement \nbenefits, the bill improves on the automatic rollover provisions \nenacted in 2001, by allowing certain small distributions from \nretirement plans to be sent to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, PBGC, ensuring that participants are ultimately reunited \nwith their earned benefits. The bill also expands the scope of the \nPBGC's successful Missing Participants Program that matches workers \nwith lost pension benefits.\n  The Retirement Account Portability Act of 2003 will benefit employees \nof State and local governments, including teachers, through a number of \nthis bill's technical corrections that will facilitate the purchase of \nservice credits in public pension programs, allowing State and local \nemployees to more easily attain a full pension in the jurisdiction \nwhere they conclude their career. The bill also contains provisions \nthat will clarify eligibility rights of certain State and local \nemployees who participate in a section 457 deferred compensation plan.\n  As this body moves to pass H.R. 3108 today, I thank Senators Grassley \nand Baucus for their hard work on this legislation. I also thank \nSenators Gregg and Kennedy for their contributions to this initiative. \nI look forward to working with my distinguished chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the HELP and Finance Committees in moving S. 1912 and other \nmeasures that will\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\nproactively improve the mechanisms we use for pension and retirement \nplans.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we need to ensure that the retirement \nbenefits Americans have been promised are secure. The bipartisan \nPension Funding Equity Act of 2003 is a first step toward improving \nretirement security for Americans, and I support it.\n  As you know, the legislation will help stabilize the traditional \npension plans known as defined benefit plans that cover almost 45 \nmillion Americans. These plans are in trouble because historically low \ninterest rates and the last few years of decline in the stock market \nhave combined to leave them underfunded.\n  To help stabilize these plans, the Pension Funding Equity Act \nprovides temporary contribution relief for both single-employer plans \nand multi-employer plans. Of the 45 million working Americans \nparticipating in defined benefit pension plans, 35 million of them are \ncovered by single-employer plans and 9.7 million are covered by multi-\nemployer plans. Defined benefit plans promise workers a monthly \nretirement benefit that these 45 million workers are counting on. It \nwould be tragic if these funds went bankrupt--or if employers gave them \nup.\n  Of the millions of workers participating in defined benefit pension \nplans, 40 percent are in construction, 30 percent are in retail and \nservice industries, and 10 percent are in trucking services. These \nworkers are the backbone of our labor force, and the first step toward \nensuring their retirement security depends on passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Pension Funding Equity Act of \n2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the \nbill, as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON STATUS OF PRIVATE PENSION \n                   PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:-\n       (1) The private pension system is integral to the \n     retirement security of Americans, along with individual \n     savings and Social Security.\n       (2) The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is \n     responsible for insuring the nation's private pension system, \n     and currently insures the pensions of 34,500,000 participants \n     in 29,500 single-employer plans, and 9,700,000 participants \n     in more than 1,600 multiemployer plans.\n       (3) The PBGC announced on January 15, 2004, that it \n     suffered a net loss in fiscal year 2003 of $7,600,000,000 for \n     single-employer pension plans, bringing the PBGC's deficit to \n     $11,200,000,000. This deficit is the PBGC's worst on record, \n     three times larger than the $3,600,000,000 deficit \n     experienced in fiscal year 2002.\n       (4) The PBGC also announced that the separate insurance \n     program for multiemployer pension plans sustained a net loss \n     of $419,000,000 in fiscal year 2003, resulting in a fiscal \n     year-end deficit of $261,000,000. The 2003 multiemployer plan \n     deficit is the first deficit in more than 20 years and is the \n     largest deficit on record.\n       (5) The PBGC estimates that the total underfunding in \n     multiemployer pension plans is roughly $100,000,000,000 and \n     in single-employer plans is approximately $400,000,000,000. \n     This underfunding is due in part to the recent decline in the \n     stock market and low interest rates, but is also due to \n     demographic changes. For example, in 1980, there were four \n     active workers for every one retiree in a multiemployer plan, \n     but in 2002, there was only one active worker for every one \n     retiree.\n       (6) This pension plan underfunding is concentrated in \n     mature and often-declining industries, where plan liabilities \n     will come due sooner.\n       (7) Neither the Senate Committee on Finance nor the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), \n     the committees of jurisdiction over pension matters, has held \n     hearings this Congress nor reported legislation addressing \n     the funding of multiemployer pension plans;\n       (8) The Senate is concerned about the current funding \n     status of the private pension system, both single and multi-\n     employer plans;\n       (9) The Senate is concerned about the potential liabilities \n     facing the PBGC and, as a result, the potential burdens \n     facing healthy pension plans and taxpayers;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor and Pensions should conduct hearings on the \n     status of the multiemployer pension plans, and should work in \n     consultation with the Departments of Labor and Treasury on \n     permanent measures to strengthen the integrity of the private \n     pension system in order to protect the benefits of current \n     and future pension plan beneficiaries.\n\n     SEC. 9.

Madam President, before we proceed to the next vote, I do \nwant to make a couple quick comments regarding the schedule.\n  First, I am very pleased with the bipartisan vote on the passage of \nthe pension bill. I congratulate the managers.\n  At this point, the regular order would be for the Senate to request a \nconference with the House to reconcile the differences in the Senate \nbill and the House bill. I understand from the Democratic leadership \nthat they have an objection to appointing conferees at this time. I \nhope we can work this out. This is an important piece of legislation \nthat we need to address and clearly need to conference this matter with \nthe House.\n  Having said that, I will continue to talk with the Democratic leader \nin an effort to proceed with the regular order on appointing conferees.\n  For the schedule, the next vote, which will occur shortly, will be \nthe last vote of the week. On Monday, we will proceed to consideration \nof the highway bill. We will have a vote on Monday, and I expect that \nvote to be in relation to a judicial nomination. We will be announcing \nlater in the day the timing of that vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we conclude our debate on this bill, I \nthank all of my colleagues for the fruitful debate we have had on these \nissues, which are vitally important to America's workers and their \nfamilies.\n  I thank Senator Frist and Senator Daschle for their leadership in \nensuring that this bill was passed quickly. I also thank my colleagues, \nSenator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and Senator Gregg for working with me \nto develop this moderate, bipartisan measure to protect our Nation's \npension plans. And I thank the following staff members for all of the \nwork they have done on this bill: Rohit Kumar, counsel and policy \nadviser to Majority Leader Frist; Chuck Marr, economic policy adviser \nto Minority Leader Daschle; David Thompson, labor and pensions policy \ndirector for Senator Gregg; Diann Howland, pension policy adviser to \nSenator Grassley; and Judy Miller, professional staff member for \nSenator Baucus. I particularly thank my own staff--Holly Fechner, chief \nlabor counsel; Portia Wu, labor and pensions counsel; and Kathleen \nWildman, labor policy office staff assistant--for all of their hard \nwork on this issue.\n  Defined benefit pension plans provide certainty and security for \nworkers and retirees. I believe that we can--and we must--do more to \nprotect the security of America's workers and retirees. Americans who \nhave worked hard and played by the rules deserve to enjoy their old \nage, to retire without having to worry whether they have enough money \nto pay for their prescription drugs, to pay for electricity, or even to \npay for food.\n  There are many challenges facing our pension system. Our Nation's \npension participation rate is the lowest it has been in over a decade. \nPart-time and low-wage workers continue to lag behind other workers in \npension coverage.\n  We must improve our pension system so that all workers can have a \npension. We must increase pension portability for workers--who may have \nmany jobs over a lifetime--without sacrificing security. We must ensure \nthat companies adequately fund their pension plans. We must encourage \ncompanies to put more money into their pension plans when times are \ngood, instead of only penalizing them when times are bad.\n  By passing this bipartisan legislation, we are taking a much-needed \nfirst step to stabilize our pension plans.\n  This legislation has three critical components to help defined \nbenefit pension plans. First, it temporarily replaces the 30-year \nTreasury bond rate used to calculate employers' required contributions \nto pension plans with a corporate bond rate. This will stabilize our \nNation's defined benefit pension plans and enable them to continue to \nprovide the benefits they have promised.\n  Second, it provides for additional deficit reduction contribution \nrelief to companies that had well-funded pension plans in the past and \nneed extra assistance now. This relief will help protect the pensions \nand jobs of workers in these industries.\n  Finally, the bill includes important relief for multiemployer plans, \nwhich fill major needs in our pension system. Multiemployer plans \nprovide pensions to many low-wage workers, as well as short-term and \nseasonal workers who might not otherwise be able to earn a pension.\n  I thank all of my colleagues for the support they have given to this \nbill. This is an important first step, but it is only a first step. I \nhope my colleagues will join with me in the future to improve and \nexpand our defined benefit system, so that we can ensure that all \nAmericans receive the secure retirement they deserve.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \njust passed the Pension Stability Act by an overwhelming margin. I \nspoke yesterday on behalf of the legislation, because I understand how \nimportant these changes are to the employers who offer defined benefit \npension plans and to the employees who are counting on those pension \nbenefits. I would like to just add a few words today to encourage the \nHouse of Representatives to quickly approve the bill, as amended by the \nSenate, and get this legislation to President Bush at the earliest \npossible date.\n  The pension reforms provided in this bill are urgently needed. Many \nlarge companies have contacted me to stress how important it is that \nCongress act to update the interest rate used in calculating pension \nliabilities. Continuing to require employers to use the outdated 30-\nyear Treasury rate would jeopardize pension plans for millions of \nworkers. I have also met with several executives from our Nation's \nairlines. The temporary relief from deficit reduction contributions \nprovided by this bill is critically important to our struggling airline \nindustry.\n  As a result of both September 11 and the slow economy during the last \nfew years, our Nation's airlines have dealt with extremely difficult \nbusiness conditions. The industry has already laid off more than \n200,000 people, and many airlines are struggling either to emerge from \nbankruptcy or to avoid having to file for bankruptcy. By providing \nairlines some breathing room when it comes to pension payments, we can \nprotect workers' benefits that might otherwise be cancelled and protect \nworkers' jobs that might otherwise be cut. Ultimately, this bill is an \neffort to do what we can to take care of workers who have already seen \ninvoluntary furloughs, seen their wages reduced, and seen their \npensions cut. In my judgment, preserving the benefits and rights of \nworkers who make our industries strong is crucial to strengthening our \neconomy.\n  This bill will help employers to honor their commitments to their \nemployees, many of whom have already sacrificed so much for their \ncompanies. I am very pleased that by a vote of 86 to 9, my Senate \ncolleagues approved this bill. I hope that the House will listen to the \nclear message that we sent today. For the sake of employers and their \nemployees, Congress and the President must enact these pension reforms \nnow.\n  (At the request of Mr. DASCHLE, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate passed critical \npension funding\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\nreform legislation that will protect millions of American workers from \nlosing their defined benefit pension plans. Although only a temporary \nsolution, the Pension Funding Equity Act is essential to prevent \ncompanies from having to freeze or terminate their defined benefit \npension plans because of outdated rules that determine how their \npension plan liabilities are calculated.\n  Defined benefit pension plans are an essential component of \nretirement security for over half of America's working men and women. \nUnfortunately, trends show a decline in the use of defined benefit \npension plans, with only one quarter as many companies providing \ndefined benefit plans today as did 20 years ago. Since 2003, 3.3 \nmillion Americans having lost their pension coverage. The volatility in \nthe stock market in the last few years--in which Americans lost \nbillions in retirement assets--leaves little doubt that we must do more \nto reverse the decline in the use of defined benefit pension plans and \nexpand the retirement security of defined benefit pension plans to more \nAmericans. The Pension Funding Equity Act is an important step towards \naddressing this challenge.\n  In the last 3 years, companies that provide defined benefit pension \nplans to their employees have come under extreme financial stress due \nto the sluggish economy and changes in the interest rate that \ndetermines their pension plan liability. The Pension Funding Equity Act \nof 2003 provides much needed relief to help these companies maintain \nretirement benefits for their employees as the country works towards \neconomic recovery. This legislation provides a temporary 2-year period \nof funding relief by updating the interest rate that companies must use \nwhen calculating the liabilities of their pension plans. A more \naccurate mix of long-term corporate bond rates will replace the now \ndefunct 30-year Treasury rate in the calculation of pension plan \nliabilities.\n  In addition to protecting the defined benefit plans of American \nworkers, the Pension Funding Equity Act is expected to provide $16 \nbillion in additional savings to companies, which will facilitate job \ncreation by freeing up funds for additional wages and hiring.\n  I applaud the passage of the Pension Funding Equity Act and look \nforward to working with my colleagues in crafting a long-term solution \nto improve and expand our pension system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S304-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S304-S307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n    NOMINATION OF GARY L.

Sharpe to \nbe United States District Judge. The clerk will state the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Gary L. Sharpe, of New \nYork, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District of \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today in support of our nominee to \nthe U.S. District Court of the Northern District of New York, Gary L. \nSharpe.\n  Judge Sharpe graduated magna cum laude from Buffalo University in \n1971 where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Three years later, he \ngraduated from Cornell Law School.\n  Judge Sharpe had a distinguished legal career prior to his \nappointment as a Federal magistrate judge for the Northern District of \nNew York in 1997. He had been an Assistant Broome County District \nAttorney in Binghamton, a special assistant New York Attorney General \nin Syracuse, a supervisory Assistant U.S. Attorney, and the interim \nU.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York.\n  Judge Sharpe is also a Vietnam veteran, having served our country in \nboth the U.S. Army and Navy.\n  Judge Sharpe has a wealth of experience that will serve him well on \nthe Federal bench. I am very confident that he will make an excellent \nFederal judge. I commend President Bush for nominating him, and I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting his nomination.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last week I shared with the Senate \nseveral disappointing developments regarding judicial nominations: the \nPickering recess appointment, the renomination of Claude Allen, and the \npilfering of Democratic offices' computer files by Republican staff. In \nspite of all those affronts, Senate Democrats today cooperate in the \nconfirmation of another nominee. We do so without the kinds of delays \nand obstruction that Republicans employed when President Clinton's \njudicial nominees were being obstructed and Republican Senators \ncomplained about his recess appointments as an affront to the \nConstitution and the Senate.\n  The first nominations issue I would like to discuss is the recess \nappointment of Judge Pickering. Just a few days ago on January 16, \nPresident Bush made his most cynical and divisive appointment to date \nwhen he bypassed the Senate and unilaterally installed Charles \nPickering to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. That \nappointment is without the consent of the Senate and is a particular \naffront to the many individuals and membership organizations \nrepresenting African Americans in the Fifth Circuit who have strongly \nopposed this nomination.\n  With respect to his extreme judicial nominations, President George W. \nBush is the most divisive President in American history. Through these \nnominees, President Bush is dividing the American people and \nundermining the fairness and independence of the Federal judiciary on \nwhich all Americans depend.\n  After fair hearings and open debate, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nrejected the Pickering nomination in 2002. Originally nominated in 2001 \nby President Bush, this nominee's record underwent a thorough \nexamination by the Senate Judiciary Committee and was found lacking. \nJudge Pickering's nomination was rejected for this promotion by the \nCommittee in 2002 because of his poor record as a judge and the ethical \nproblems raised by his handling of his duties in specific instances. \nNonetheless, the President sent back his nomination to the Senate last \nyear, the first in our history to reject the judgment of the Judiciary \nCommittee on a judicial nominee. This is the only President who has \nrenominated someone rejected on a vote by the Judiciary Committee for a \njudicial appointment.\n  The renomination of Charles Pickering lay dormant for most of last \nyear while Republicans reportedly planned further hearings. Judge \nPickering himself said that several hearings on his nomination were \nscheduled and cancelled over the last year by Republicans. Then, \nwithout any additional information or hearings, Republicans decided to \nforego any pretense at proceeding in regular order. Instead, they \nplaced the name of Judge Pickering on the committee's markup agenda and \npushed his nomination through with their one-vote majority. The \ncommittee had been told since last January that a new hearing would be \nheld before a vote on this nomination, but that turned out to be an \nempty promise.\n  Why was the Pickering nomination moved ahead of other well-qualified \ncandidates late last fall? Why was the Senate required to expend \nvaluable time rehashing arguments about a controversial nomination that \nhas already been rejected? The timing was arranged by Republicans to \ncoincide with the gubernatorial election in Mississippi. Like so much \nabout this President's actions with respect to the federal courts, \npartisan Republican politics seemed to be the governing consideration. \nIndeed, as the President's own former Secretary of the Treasury points \nout from personal experience, politics governs more than just Federal \njudicial nominations in the Bush administration.\n  Charles Pickering was a nominee rejected by the Judiciary Committee \non the merits--a nominee who has a record that does not qualify him for \nthis promotion, who injects his personal views into judicial opinions, \nand who has made highly questionable ethical judgments. The nominee's \nsupporters, including some Republican Senators, have chosen to imply \nthat Democrats opposed the nominee because of his religion or region. \nThat is untrue and offensive. These smears have been as ugly as they \nare wrong.\n\n[[Page S305]]\n\nYet the political calculation has been made to ignore the facts, to \nseek to pin unflattering characterizations on Democrats for partisan \npurposes and to count on cynicism and misinformation to rule the day. \nWith elections coming up this fall, partisan Republicans are apparently \nreturning to that page of their partisan political playbook.\n  Never before had a judicial nomination rejected by the Judiciary \nCommittee after a vote been resubmitted to the Senate, but this \nPresident took that unprecedented step last year. Never before has a \njudicial nomination debated at such length by the Senate, and to which \nthe Senate has withheld its consent, been the subject of a presidential \nappointment to the federal bench.\n  In an editorial following the recess appointment, The Washington Post \nhad it right when it summarized Judge Pickering's record as a Federal \ntrial judge as ``undistinguished and downright disturbing.'' As the \npaper noted: ``The right path is to build consensus that \nnonpartisanship and excellence are the appropriate criteria for \njudicial selection.'' Instead we see another dangerous step down the \nRepublican's chosen path to erode judicial independence for the sake of \npartisanship and their ideological court-packing efforts. The New York \nTimes also editorialized on this subject and it, too, was correct when \nit pointed out that this end-run around the advice and consent \nauthority of the Senate is ``absolutely the wrong choice for one of the \nnation's most sensitive courts.''\n  Civil rights supporters who so strenuously opposed this nominee were \nunderstandably offended that the President chose this action the day \nafter his controversial visit to the grave of Dr. Martin Luther King \nJr. As the Nation was entering the weekend set aside to honor Dr. King \nand all for which he strived, this President made one of the most \ninsensitive and divisive appointments of his Administration.\n  So many civil rights groups and individuals committed to supporting \ncivil rights in this country have spoken out in opposition to the \nelevation of Judge Pickering that their views should have been \nrespected by the President. Contrary to the false assertion made by The \nWall Street Journal editorial page, the NAACP of Mississippi did not \nsupport Judge Pickering's nomination. Instead, every single branch of \nthe Mississippi State Chapter of the NAACP voted to oppose this \nnomination--not just once, but three times. When Mr. Pickering was \nnominated to the District Court in 1990, the NAACP of Mississippi \nopposed him, and when he was nominated to the Fifth Circuit in 2001 \nand, again, in 2003, the NAACP of Mississippi opposed him. They have \nwritten letter after letter expressing their opposition. That \nopposition was shared by the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, the Magnolia Bar Association, the Mississippi Legislative \nBlack Caucus, the Mississippi Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, \nRepresentative Bennie G. Thompson and many others. Perhaps The Wall \nStreet Journal confused the Mississippi NAACP with the Mississippi \nAssociation of Trial Lawyers, which is an organization that did support \nthe Pickering nomination.\n  This is an administration that promised to unite the American people \nbut that has chosen time and again to act with respect to judicial \nnominations in a way that divides us. This is an administration that \nsquandered the goodwill and good faith that Democrats showed in the \naftermath of September 11, 2001. This is an administration that refused \nto acknowledge the strides we made in filling 100 judicial vacancies \nunder Democratic Senate leadership in 2001 and 2002 while overcoming \nanthrax attacks and in spite of Republican mistreatment of scores of \nqualified, moderate judicial nominees of President Clinton.\n  The second disappointing development is the renomination of Claude \nAllen as a nominee to the Fourth Circuit. Last week, the President sent \nthe nomination of Claude Allen back to the Senate. From the time this \nnomination was originally made to the time it was returned to the \nPresident last year, the Maryland Senators have made their position \ncrystal clear. This Fourth Circuit vacancy is a Maryland seat and ought \nto be filled by an experienced, qualified Marylander. Over the Senate \nrecess, the White House had ample time to find such a nominee, someone \nof the caliber of sitting U.S. District Court Judges Andre Davis or \nRoger Titus, two Maryland lawyers whose involvement in the State's \nlegal system and devotion to their local community is clear. This \nrefusal to compromise is just another example of the White House \nengaging in partisan politics to the detriment of an independent \njudiciary.\n  The additional disappointment we face is the ongoing fallout from the \ncyber theft of confidential memoranda from Democratic Senate staff. \nThis invasion was perpetrated by Republican employees both on and off \nthe committee. As revealed by the chairman, computer security was \ncompromised and, simply put, members of the Republican staff took \nthings that did not belong to them and passed them around and on to \npeople outside the Senate. This is no small mistake. It is a serious \nbreach of trust, morals, the standards that govern Senate conduct, and \npossible criminal laws. We do not yet know the full extent of these \nviolations. But we need to repair the loss of trust brought on by this \nbreach of confidentiality and privacy if we are ever to recover and be \nable to resume our work in a spirit of cooperation and mutual respect \nthat is so necessary to make progress.\n  Democratic cooperation with the President's slate of judicial \nnominees has been remarkable in these circumstances. One way to measure \nthat cooperation and the progress we have made possible is to examine \nthe Chief Justice's annual report on the Federal judiciary. Over the \nlast couple of years, Justice Rehnquist has been ``pleased to report'' \nour progress on filling judicial vacancies. This is in sharp contrast \nto the criticism he justifiably made of the shadowy and unprincipled \nRepublican obstruction of consideration of President Clinton's \nnominees. In 1996, the final year of President Clinton's first term, \nthe Republican-led Senate confirmed only 17 judicial nominees all year \nand not a single nominee to the circuit courts. At the end of 1996, the \nRepublican Senate majority returned to the President almost twice as \nmany nominations as were confirmed.\n  By contrast, with the overall cooperation of Senate Democrats, which \npartisan Republicans are loath to concede, this President has achieved \nrecord numbers of judicial confirmations. Despite the attacks of \nSeptember 11 and their aftermath, the Senate has already confirmed 169 \nof President Bush's nominees to the Federal bench. This is more judges \nthan were confirmed during President Reagan's entire first 4-year term. \nThus, President Bush's 3-year totals rival those achieved by other \nPresidents in 4 years. That is also true with respect to the nearly \nfour years it took for President Clinton to achieve these results \nfollowing the Republicans' taking majority control of the Senate in \n1995.\n  The 69 judges confirmed last year exceeds the number of judges \nconfirmed during any of the 6 years from 1995 to 2000 that Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate during the Clinton Presidency years in which \nthere were far more vacant Federal judgeships than exist today. Among \nthose 69 judges confirmed in 2003 were 13 circuit court judges. That \nexceeds the number of circuit court judges confirmed during all of \n1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000, when a Democrat was President.\n  The Senate has already confirmed 30 circuit court judges nominated by \nPresident Bush. This is a greater number than were confirmed at this \npoint in the presidencies of his father, President Clinton, or the \nfirst term of President Reagan. Vacancies on the federal judiciary have \nbeen reduced to the lowest point in two decades and are lower than \nRepublicans allowed at any time during the Clinton presidency. In \naddition, there are more Federal judges serving on the bench today than \nat any time in American history.\n  I congratulate the Democratic Senators on the committee for showing a \nspirit of cooperation and restraint in the face of a White House that \nso often has refused to consult, compromise or conciliate. I regret \nthat our efforts have not been fairly acknowledged by partisan \nRepublicans and that this Administration continues down the path of \nconfrontation. While there have been difficult and controversial \nnominees whom we have opposed as we exercise our constitutional duty of \nadvice and\n\n[[Page S306]]\n\nconsent to lifetime appointments on the Federal bench, we have done so \nopenly and on the merits.\n  For the last 3 years, I have urged the President to work with us. It \nis with deep sadness that I see that this administration still refuses \nto accept the Senate's shared responsibility under the Constitution and \nrefuses to appreciate our level of cooperation and achievement.\n  Today, the chairman held another hearing on another circuit court \nnominee. That hearing is another demonstration of how untrue the \nrhetoric is that is so often bandied about by Republican partisans that \nDemocrats are obstructing the confirmations of this President's \njudicial nominees. The reality is that we have cooperated to an \nextraordinary extent, especially when contrasted with Republican \ntreatment of President Clinton's judicial nominees.\n  Today's hearing was the second in the last 2 weeks for circuit court \nnominees. Traditionally, the number of nominees who have received \nhearings and who are considered in a presidential election year has \nbeen lower than in other years. In 1996, only four circuit court \nnominees by President Clinton received a hearing from the Republican \nSenate majority. In 2000, only five circuit court nominees by President \nClinton received a hearing from the Republican Senate majority. Of \ncourse, two of those outstanding and well-qualified nominees in 2000 \nwere never allowed to be considered by the committee or the Senate. By \ncontrast, here we are, before the end of the first month of 2004, and \nwe have already held hearings for two circuit court nominees. By the \nstandard Republicans set in 1996 and 2000, we would be half done for \nthe entire year.\n  Moreover, that we are proceeding to confirm Judge Sharpe today is \nanother example of Democratic cooperation in the wake of the \nPresident's recess appointment of Charles Pickering. This temporary \nappointment can be distinguished from President Clinton's recess \nappointment of Judge Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit in December \n2000 in many ways, including from the manner in which Republican \nSenators reacted to President Clinton's recess appointments by shutting \ndown the confirmation process.\n  Roger Gregory had been denied a Judiciary Committee hearing even \nthough he had the bipartisan support of both of his home State \nSenators--Democratic Senator Chuck Robb and Republican Senator John \nWarner. By contrast, Judge Pickering participated in hearings and an \nextensive record was developed on which his nomination was opposed in \nthe Judiciary Committee and in the Senate on the merits on the basis of \nhis record as a district court judge. Roger Gregory's nomination was \nnever allowed to be considered by the Judiciary Committee. By contrast, \nJudge Pickering's nomination was fully and fairly debated in 2002 and \nrejected by the Judiciary Committee. Indeed, Judge Pickering's \nrenomination was the first time a President had resent a judicial \nnomination to the Senate after the Judiciary Committee had voted on and \nrejected that judicial nomination. Likewise, Judge Pickering's \ntemporary appointment is the first after rejection by the Judiciary \nCommittee and after the Senate has debated a judicial nomination and \nwithheld its consent.\n  Moreover, Roger Gregory's recess appointment fit squarely in the \ntradition of Presidents exercising such authority in order to expand \ncivil rights and to bring diversity to the courts. Four of the five \nfirst African American appellate judges were recess-appointed to their \nfirst article III position, including Judge William Hastie in 1949, \nJudge Thurgood Marshall in 1961, Judge Spottswood Robinson in 1961, and \nJudge Leon Higginbottom in 1964. Unlike these nominees and the public \npurposes served, Judge Pickering was opposed by civil rights groups, \nincluding all chapters of the Mississippi NAACP, the Southern Christian \nLeadership Conference, and by the Magnolia Bar Association. Rather than \nbring people together and move the country forward, this President's \nrecess appointment is another source of division.\n  The Senate reaction to the recess appointments of President Clinton \nand President Bush has also differed dramatically. When President \nClinton used his recess appointment power to appoint James Hormel \nAmbassador to Luxembourg, Senator Inhofe responded by saying that \nPresident Clinton had ``shown contempt for Congress and the \nConstitution'' and declared that he would place ``holds on every single \nPresidential nomination,'' which Republicans did in obstruction of \nPresident Clinton's nominees. Republicans continued to block \nnominations until President Clinton agreed to make recess appointments \nonly after Congress was notified in advance. On November 10, 1999, 17 \nRepublican Senators sent a letter to President Clinton telling him that \nif he violated the agreement, they would ``put holds for the remaining \nof the term of your Presidency on all of the judicial nominees.''\n  In November 1999, President Clinton sent a list of 13 positions to \nthe Senate that he planned to fill through recess appointments. In \nresponse, Senator Inhofe spoke out on the Senate floor denouncing five \nof the 13 civilian nominees with a threat that if they went forward, he \nwould personally place a hold on every one of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees for the remainder of the administration. That led to \nmore delays and to the need for a vote on a motion to proceed to \noverride the Republican objections.\n  When President Clinton appointed Judge Gregory, Senator Inhofe called \nit ``outrageously inappropriate for any president to fill a federal \njudgeship through a recess appointment in a deliberate way to bypass \nthe Senate.'' Judge Gregory was eventually confirmed after his \nrenomination in 2001 with near unanimity. There was only one negative \nvote. Senator Lott cast that vote and his spokesman said his opposition \nwas done to underscore his stance that ``any appointment of federal \njudges during a recess should be opposed.'' Ironically, Senator Lott is \nnow one of Judge Pickering's strongest supporters.\n  As far as I know, no Senate Democrats were consulted by this \nPresident before he made his divisive appointment of Judge Pickering. \nIt was only after President Bush appointed Charles Pickering to the \nbench that I learned about the appointment. Despite that, Senate \nDemocrats are today participating in making sure the process of \njudicial appointments moves forward. Democrats have not obstructed the \nconfirmation process for judicial and executive branch nominations as \nRepublicans did when President Clinton made recess appointments. In \nfact, already this week, less than 2 weeks after President Bush \nappointed Judge Pickering and a number of other executive branch \nofficials, we have joined in confirming 18 Presidential nominees by \nunanimous consent. Today we proceed to confirm a judicial nominee in \nspite of the President's recent actions and those of Senate \nRepublicans.\n  The nomination of Judge Gary Sharpe has the support of both his home \nState Senators, both of whom are Democratic Senators. The Democratic \nSenators who serve on the Judiciary Committee all supported this \nnomination when it was reported favorably to the Senate in October last \nyear. Had the Republican leadership wanted to proceed on it, this \nnomination could easily have been confirmed in October, November or \nDecember last year before the Senate adjourned. Instead, partisans \nchose to devote 40 hours to a talkathon on the President's most \ncontroversial and divisive nominees rather than proceed to vote on \nthose judicial nominees with the support of the Senate. The delay in \nconsidering this nomination is the responsibility of the Republican \nleadership.\n  I congratulate Judge Sharpe and his family on his confirmation. He is \nthe 170th judge confirmed by the Senate and will be the 171st appointed \nby President Bush.\n  I yield to the senior Senator from New York and his colleague so they \ncan have the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I will speak for 1 minute and then I \nwill yield 1 minute to my colleague, Senator Clinton.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I am pleased to rise today in support \nof Gary Sharpe's nomination to be a judge in the Northern District of \nNew York.\n  Before I discuss Judge Sharpe's impressive qualifications, I wish to \nmake one point to my colleagues.\n\n[[Page S307]]\n\n  If my math is right, when Judge Sharpe is confirmed today--and I \nexpect he will be confirmed unanimously because, as my colleagues will \nsee, he is an example of the nominees we get when the process works \nright--he will be the 170th judicial nominee of President Bush's we \nwill have confirmed.\n  I note that at the outset because to hear the hue and cry from some \non the other side, one would think that we were roadblocking every \nnominee who comes before us. With this confirmation, the numbers stand \nat 170 to 5.\n  That's a record for which the Buffalo Bills and Buffalo Sabres would \nkill. When you win over 97 percent of the time, you are doing pretty \ndarn well.\n  I won't belabor the point, but it's important to note that this \nprocess can work and that it frequently does. The process works when we \nwork together to choose nominees who are excellent, moderate, and \ndiverse--the three criteria I use when evaluating judicial nominees. \nAnd Judge Sharpe easily clears that bar.\n  For the past 6 years, Judge Sharpe has served with distinction as a \nUnited States Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of New York. \nBefore taking the bench, he spent his professional career working as \none of the best prosecutors Northern New York has ever seen. He spent \nnearly a decade in state court as a prosecutor from Broome County.\n  He then went over to Federal court where he was an assistant United \nStates attorney before becoming the U.S. attorney for the Northern \nDistrict.\n  Judge Sharpe is a graduate of two fine New York schools, the \nUniversity of Buffalo which he graduated magna cum laude and Phi Beta \nKappa--and Cornell Law. After graduating college, but before heading to \nlaw school, Judge Sharpe served in the U.S. Armed Forces as a member of \nthe Naval Reserve. He is also a Vietnam veteran, having served there in \nthe Army from 1966 to 1968.\n  We have talked to lawyers in the Northern District and they simply \nrave about Judge Sharpe. One judge upstate said, ``He's the best lawyer \nI've ever known.'' That's pretty high praise.\n  I congratulate Judge Sharpe and his wife, Lorraine, on this \ntremendous honor and achievement. I know Chief Judge Scullin is anxious \nto have him and that Judge Sharpe is going to be a great addition to \nthe Northern District bench.\n  Again, Madam President, overall, we are at 170 nominees to 5. We have \nblocked 5. That is not too many, and those are the most egregious ones.\n  Second, in New York, we have worked this out. When the administration \nwants to play ball with Senators, they can fill the bench. In New York, \nwe will have no more vacancies because we have agreed. They have chosen \nnominees who are conservative but not out of the mainstream, and we \nhave gone along.\n  Third, Judge Sharpe clearly is an excellent nominee. He is not just \naverage; he is not just above average; he is at the very top. We talked \nwith lawyers in the Northern District. They say: He is the best lawyer \nI have ever known.\n  He is moderate. He deserves to be on the bench. I fully support his \nnomination and urge my colleagues to do as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise in very strong support of the \nnomination of Magistrate Judge Gary Lawrence Sharpe who has been \nnominated to the United States District Court for the Northern District \nof New York.\n  Judge Sharpe has more than 20 years of experience as a prosecutor. \nFrom 1974 to 1981, he served as an assistant district attorney and \nsenior assistant district attorney for Broome County. After serving for \na year as a special assistant New York attorney general, in 1982 he \nbecame an assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New \nYork. He served in that office until 1997, when he was appointed a U.S. \nmagistrate judge for the Northern District of New York.\n  Even with all of his prior prosecutorial responsibilities, Judge \nSharpe made time to serve as a member of the Broome County Prisoner \nRehabilitation Board, PROBE, the Onondaga County Substance Abuse \nCommission, and the Onondaga County Youth Court. More recently, he \nworked with the Department of Probation to develop the High Impact \nIncarceration Program, HIIP, a program for defendants who have \nsubstance abuse problems and who might be candidates for release.\n  Judge Sharpe's years of service as a magistrate judge have provided \nhim with even more experience, which will serve him well as a U.S. \ndistrict court judge. Without question, Judge Sharpe has the intellect, \njudicial demeanor, and commitment to justice to serve the Northern \nDistrict of New York as a district court judge with distinction.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to support this nomination.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Schumer, for the important role he \nhas played on the Judiciary Committee. I second his comment that in New \nYork we have worked together with the administration to nominate and \nconfirm judges who will be a real credit, not only to the bench but to \nthis administration and to our country. Magistrate Judge Gary Lawrence \nSharpe is at the top of that list.\n  In addition to all of his qualifications, he has also found time as a \nprosecutor to serve in capacities to assist with prisoner \nrehabilitation, to work with youth, and to work with people who are in \nthe grips of substance abuse to try to bring down the impact of \nincarceration.\n  I think he will not only serve with distinction in New York but \ndemonstrate clearly that this is the kind of conservative Republican \nnominee whom we could be unanimously confirming. I commend him to the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is, Will \nthe Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Gary L. Sharpe, of \nNew York, to be United States District Judge for the Northern District \nof New York?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak today about S. 1691, the \nWartime Treatment Study Act. During World War II, the United States \nfought a courageous battle against the spread of Nazism and fascism. \nNazi Germany was engaged in the horrific persecution and genocide of \nJews. By the end of the war, 6 million Jews had perished at the hands \nof Nazi Germany.\n  The Allied victory in the Second World War was an American triumph, a \ntriumph for freedom, justice, and human rights. The courage displayed \nby so many Americans, of all ethnic origins, should be a source of \ngreat pride for all Americans. But we should not let that justifiable \npride in our Nation's triumph blind us to the treatment of some \nAmericans by their own government.\n  Sadly, as so many brave Americans fought against enemies in Europe \nand the Pacific, the U.S. Government was in some cases curtailing the \nfreedom of some of its own people here, at home. While, it is, of \ncourse, the right of every Nation to protect itself during wartime, the \nU.S. Government can and should respect the basic freedoms that so many \nAmericans have given their lives to defend. Of course, war tests our \nprinciples and our values. And as our Nation's recent experience has \nshown, it is during times of war and conflict, when our fears are high \nand our principles are tested most, that we must be even more vigilant \nto guard against violations of the Constitution.\n  Many Americans are aware of the fact that, during World War II, under \nthe authority of Executive Order 9066, our Government forced more than \n100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes into internment camps. \nJapanese Americans were forced to leave their homes, their livelihoods, \nand their communities. They were held behind barbed wire and military \nguard by their own government.\n  Through the work of the Commission on Wartime Relocation and \nInternment of Civilians created by Congress in 1980, this unfortunate \nepisode in our history finally received the official acknowledgement \nand condemnation it deserved. Under the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, \npeople of Japanese ancestry who were subjected to relocation or \ninternment later received an apology and reparations on behalf of the \npeople of the United States.\n  While I commend Congress and our Nation for finally recognizing and \napologizing for the mistreatment of Japanese Americans during World War \nII, our work in this area is not done. We should also acknowledge the \nmistreatment experienced by many German Americans, Italian Americans, \nand European Latin Americans, as well as Jewish refugees.\n  Most Americans are probably unaware that during World War II, the \nU.S. Government designated more than 600,000 Italian-born and 300,000 \nGerman-born U.S. resident aliens and their families as ``enemy \naliens.''\n  Approximately 11,000 ethnic Germans, 3,200 ethnic Italians, and \nscores of Bulgarians, Hungarians, Romanians or other European Americans \nliving in America were taken from their homes and placed in internment \ncamps. Some even remained interned for up to 3 years after the war \nended. Unknown numbers of German Americans, Italian Americans, and \nother Europeans Americans had their property confiscated or their \ntravel restricted, or lived under curfews.\n  S. 1691 would not grant reparations to victims. It would simply \ncreate a commission to review the facts and circumstances of the U.S. \nGovernment's treatment of German Americans, Italian Americans and other \nEuropean Americans during World War II.\n  A second commission created by this bill would review the treatment \nby the U.S. Government of Jewish refugees who were fleeing Nazi \npersecution and genocide. German and Austrian Jews applied for visas, \nbut the United States severely limited their entry due to strict \nimmigration policies, policies that many believe were motivated by fear \nthat our enemies would send spies under the guise of refugees and by \nthe unfortunate anti-foreigner and anti-Semitic attitudes that were, \nsadly, all too common at that time.\n  It is time for the country to review the facts and determine how our \nrestrictive immigration policies failed to provide adequate safe harbor \nto Jewish refugees fleeing the persecution of Nazi Germany. The United \nStates turned away thousands of refugees, delivering many to their \ndeaths at the hands of the Nazi regime.\n  As I mentioned earlier, there has been a measure of justice for \nJapanese Americans who were denied their liberty and property. It is \nnow time for the U.S. Government to complete an accounting of this \nperiod in our Nation's history.\n  Let me repeat that the bill I have introduced, along with Senator \nGrassley, does not call for reparations. All it does is ensure that the \npublic has a full accounting of what happened. I believe that is the \nright and, yes, the patriotic thing to do. It is patriotic to ensure \nthat the Government owns up to its mistakes. We should be very proud of \nour victory over Nazism, as I certainly am. But we should not let that \npride cause us to overlook what happened to some Americans and refugees \nduring World War II. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nWartime Treatment Study Act.\n  The Judiciary Committee has reported this bill favorably. It has been \ncleared by my Democratic colleagues. Unfortunately, someone on the \nother side of the aisle has placed a hold on the bill. This anonymous \nperson or persons are unwilling to identify themselves or to explain \nthe reasons for the hold. I think some Republican colleagues have been \ntrying to figure out for me what the problems is. Frankly, I find it \nhard to imagine why someone would object to a fairly straight-forward, \nnon-controversial bill such as this. So, Mr. President, I will try \nagain.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 309, S. 1691, a bill to \nestablish commission, to review the facts and circumstances surrounding \ninjustices suffered by European Americans, European Latin Americans, \nand Jewish Refugees during World War II, that the bill be read the \nthird time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that the title amendment be agreed, with the above occurring \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina. Mr. President, reserving the right to \nobject, I have been informed that our leadership is working on a method \nfor this proposal to move forward. I admire what the Senator is doing \non a personal basis. With that understanding, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I know the Senator from South Carolina \nwas a supporter of this legislation in committee, and he is doing what \nhe must do in representing that side of the aisle.\n  I am disappointed that there is an objection to moving this bill. The \nJudiciary Committee has now reported this bill favorably to the floor \non two occasions--last Congress and again this Congress. I would like \nto know what their concerns are. So far, we have never heard a \nsubstantive objection. There is a secret hold being used here. That is \nunfortunate. This bill is long overdue. It is not controversial. In \nfact, I specifically was promised by the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee late in the 106th Congress, when I was hoping the issue of \nGerman Americans would be linked to a bill going through Congress on \nItalian Americans. I was assured this was not controversial and\n\n[[Page S309]]\n\nthis would be taken care of. Nonetheless, this has occurred. There is \nno reason the Senate should not take up and consider this bill without \nfurther delay.\n  Again, had the representative of the majority stayed, I would have \nasked whether there was a time when they would expect to be ready for \naction. I will find other ways to ask the other side to work with me to \npass the bill. I took the comments of the Senator from South Carolina \nin good faith that he has spoken to the leadership and that they are \nwilling to work with us. I hope we can sit down and work this out as \nsoon as possible to ensure that the U.S. Government accounts for what \nhappened so many years ago.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S309-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S309-S311]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CAROLINA PANTHERS\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, when Jerry Richardson founded the Carolina \nPanthers 9 years ago, he said his goal was to be in a Super Bowl within \n10 years. After upsetting the Philadelphia Eagles recently, this dream \nhas become a reality. But the dream is not over, of course. There is \none more hurdle the Panthers must clear.\n  Today I salute Jerry, Coach John Fox, and the Panthers players for \ngiving North Carolinians a season with a fairy tale ending. When Coach \nFox arrived in 2002, the Carolina Panthers were 1 and 15. This \nturnaround has been nothing short of miraculous, and it is not just the \nfact that the Panthers have made it to the Super Bowl but how they got \nto Houston.\n  The Panthers are called the ``Cardiac Cats'' because 10 of their \nvictories have been achieved by 6 points or less, and they have won 4 \nof their 5 overtime games this season.\n  All over the State, ``Go Panthers'' signs adorn buses, mailboxes, and \ncars, and those black and blue jerseys have become the fashion craze of \nthe day. Even Coach Fox had to comment on the groundswell of fan \nsupport after about 10,000 of them--10,000, Mr. President--showed up on \na blustery day as the team left for Houston. ``It makes you proud,'' he \nsaid.\n  Charlotte Observer columnist Danny Romine Powell wrote recently:\n\n       A team has transformed a city into Mount Olympus. We're \n     eating ambrosia with the gods.\n\n  How true, indeed. I want the Panthers to know that this Senator is \ncoming to Houston, and I can't wait to watch the ``Cardiac Cats'' shock \nthe world with a victory. In fact, I have challenged my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, to a friendly wager. I am putting up \nour famous North Carolina barbecue against his New England clam \nchowder.\n  I love something that Coach Fox tells his team each week. He says:\n\n       We will define ourselves. No one else is going to do that \n     for us.\n\n  It is a motto that stands true for all of North Carolina. Earlier \nthis week, late night host David Letterman cracked:\n\n       Who knew Carolina had a team.\n\n  I daresay that after Sunday the world will know.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               AMERICA'S INTELLIGENCE-GATHERING APPARATUS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning and part of this afternoon \nMr. David Kay who was the top U.S. weapons inspector in Iraq until he \nresigned last week testified before the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. Kay has been interviewed extensively on media programs, including \nthe ``Today'' show, and interviewed by Reuters, and others, so I have \nread a substantial amount of what he has said. And I listened today to \nhis testimony, at least in part, before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  The debate that has gone on, and I suspect the debate that will ensue \nfrom his testimony today, will perhaps be a debate about whether the \nright decision was made when this country decided to embark on this \nmission in Iraq with United States troops, which has resulted in the \nelimination and removal of Saddam Hussein as President of that country. \nIn many ways, I think that is not the most relevant debate to have at \nthis moment. I think the debate to have at this moment is on what the \nimplications of what Mr. Kay has said to us are for the safety and the \nsecurity of this country, and what its implications are for the ability \nof this country to understand where dangers exist around the rest of \nthe world, and where our national security is at stake.\n  Let me see if I can paraphrase some of what Mr. Kay has said. He told \nthe Armed Services Committee that the failure to turn up weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq has exposed weaknesses in America's \nintelligence-gathering apparatus.\n  Is there a time in which our intelligence-gathering apparatus has \nbeen more important to this country than this particular time?\n  In the shadow of 9/11/2001, with the prospect of terrorists wanting \nagain to commit an act of terror in this country, we are required to \naccept the judgment of our intelligence community: the best \nintelligence we have available to us that this is a threat or that is a \nthreat. Now Mr. Kay says that what we believed about Iraq's weapons was \nalmost all wrong. And I certainly include myself here. And he says the \nintelligence community has failed, quote, unquote, the President.\n  Well, look, if the intelligence community has failed--and it seems \nclearly to have failed in a significant way--then it has failed not \nonly the President of the United States, it has failed this Senate, and \nit has failed the people of the United States.\n  I, and all of my colleagues, have sat in the Intelligence Committee \nroom here in the Senate. That very special room, which is designed for \ntop secret briefings, is a room in which all of us have had top secret \nbriefing after top secret briefing from CIA, from Condoleezza Rice, the \nNational Security Adviser, and from others. In that room, eyeball to \neyeball with our intelligence community, we have been told certain \nthings that they believe to be true with respect to a threat--the \nthreat from Iraq, the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and \nothers.\n  If, in fact, there is a failure--and it appears to me that there is a \nfailure; the top weapons inspector says there is a failure--if that \nfailure exists--and it does--then it is a failure not just for the \nPresident of the United States, it is a failure for this country and \nfor this Senate.\n  All of us, then, had been told, face to face by our intelligence \ncommunity, what they expected to be the case in Iraq, and it turns out \nnot to be the case.\n  Now, do people have a right to be wrong? Yes, they do. But we spend \nbillions and billions and billions of dollars on intelligence, and if \nthis country--in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and \nconfronting the prospect of future terrorist attacks--does not have an \nintelligence community that gives us great confidence, then we are in \ntrouble.\n  I would think the President, and certainly this Congress, should \ndemand to know what happened. We ought to seek answers. There has to be \naccountability. Where does the buck stop?\n  If, in fact, we have had a failure of our intelligence community--\nagain, not my words, the words of Mr. David Kay, the top weapons \ninspector; words he uttered today before the Armed Services Committee, \nwords he uttered in interview after interview--if there is, in fact, a \nfailure, then we ought to demand immediately to understand: What was \nthe failure? How did it occur? Whose responsibility was it? And, most \nimportantly, how do we fix it on an urgent basis?\n  Let me read some of the quotes. I will not read the quotes from \ntoday's hearing because I do not have them all, although I was able to \nlisten to much of the hearing.\n  But this is from Mr. Kay's appearance on the ``Today'' show, which I\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nwatched with great interest. He was asked on the ``Today'' show about \nthe presentation before the United Nations of Secretary of State Colin \nPowell. As you know, we received top secret briefings, and then we \nreceived briefings in other venues from the Vice President, from \nCondoleezza Rice, and others in the administration. Following those \nbriefings, the Secretary of State made a lengthy presentation to the \nUnited Nations, and he set out chapter and verse, including pictures \nand charts, of the threat that existed.\n  I want to read to you the question that was asked:\n\n       Almost a year ago Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed \n     the United Nations. Here's what he had to say.\n\n  Then they showed a tape of Secretary Powell at the U.N. saying, \n``[Our] conservative estimate [is] that Iraq today has a stockpile of \nbetween 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agents.'' The interviewer \nthen asked Mr. Kay: ``Is that conservative or is it just plain wrong?''\n  Mr. Kay responds: No, I think that was the estimate based on \ninformation and intelligence before the war. It turns out to be wrong, \njust wrong.\n  Next question: So what was the problem with the intelligence? Why \nwere we so wrong?\n  Mr. Kay said: Well, don't forget, Iraq is not the only place we have \nbeen wrong recently. We have been wrong about Iran. We have been wrong \nabout Libya's program. We clearly need a renovation of our ability to \ncollect intelligence.\n  The question was asked: Here is what you said to Tom Brokaw: \n``Clearly the intelligence we went to war on was inaccurate, wrong. We \nneed to understand why that was. If anyone was abused by the \nintelligence, it was the President of the United States rather than the \nother way around.''\n  My point is simple: If anyone was abused in this country by bad \nintelligence, by inaccurate intelligence, it is not just the President, \nit is Members of the Senate who sat eyeball to eyeball with our \nintelligence officers and with those who run our intelligence community \nwho told us what they believed to be the case, which turns out now not \nto be accurate. The American people were failed. The Senate was failed. \nTo use another word Mr. Kay used, the President was failed.\n  So why is it the case that we don't see someone standing on the \ntallest stump saying: There is something wrong here. We need to get to \nthe bottom of it, and now. This country's security depends on it.\n  Today somewhere someone is assessing intelligence picked up over \ntelephone lines or computer transmittals or any number of ways to \nevaluate what is happening with terrorist cells. Where might they be \nplanning to attack us. What might the attack be when they attempt to \nenter this country once again and kill Americans. Well, that same \nintelligence community that has been so wrong, according to Mr. Kay--\nand I think now according to most Members of the Senate who would \nassess that--are they the ones still analyzing this?\n  My question is where is the accountability? I think the President and \nthe Congress ought to join together in a common bond and common \ninterest to demand how this happened. There isn't any question that we \nought to have a completely independent commission evaluating and \nstudying and investigating this right now. There ought to be an \nindependent investigation right now. I hope finally the Congress will \ndo that.\n  Second, I believe next week, Mr. Tenet, Condoleezza Rice ought to be \ninvited to the intelligence room and all 100 Senators ought to hear \ntheir response to this proposition that the intelligence community has \nfailed us. This isn't a politician speaking. This is a top weapons \ninspector who just came from Iraq. This is Mr. Kay.\n  I remember when Mr. Kay was appointed with great fanfare. This is a \nstraight shooter, a tough guy, no nonsense. He went to Iraq. He came \nback, and he finally quit. He said there weren't weapons of mass \ndestruction. The intelligence was bad. The intelligence community \nfailed this President. He forgot to say, failed this Congress and \nfailed the American people.\n  I am telling you, whether it is tomorrow or next week or next month, \nthis country's security and safety rest on good intelligence. If we \nhave questions about an intelligence community that Mr. Kay says has \nfailed us and if we don't, with great urgency, rush to find out what \nhappened with an independent evaluation, shame on us.\n  This isn't about politics. It is about the safety of America. It is \nabout being effective in the fight against terrorism. It is about \nhaving an intelligence community that works, that gets it right, and \nthat doesn't fail this President or this Congress or this country.\n  I hope Senator Frist and Democratic leader Daschle will ask Mr. Tenet \nto come to room 407 and address all 100 Senators and answer all of the \nquestions of the Senators that stem from this testimony of the top \nweapons inspector who has said our intelligence community failed us. We \nought to do that, and we ought to do it now. Days, weeks, or months \nshould not go by without us having answers to this question. It is easy \nto be critical. It is much more difficult to be constructive. It is not \nbeing critical for Mr. Kay, the top weapons inspector appointed by \nPresident George W. Bush, to come to this Congress and tell the truth. \nWhen he tells the truth, we have a responsibility to follow that truth \nwherever it leads.\n\n  There are some here who don't want to do that. They are worried about \npolitics. It doesn't matter who is President. We have an intelligence \ncommunity on which we spend a great deal of money. In fact, the amount \nis classified information. The American people should trust me when I \nsay we spend a substantial amount of money on intelligence. The \nsecurity and safety of this country and the American people rests on \nour ability to make sure that money is spent wisely in an intelligence \ncommunity that gets it right and provides good information to this \ncountry. We cannot any longer decide this is business as usual, one \nmore hearing, one more set of questions that remains unanswered.\n  Saddam Hussein is gone, and the world is better for it. Saddam \nHussein was a bad guy. We opened up football-field-sized graves in Iraq \nwith tens of thousands of skeletons of people murdered by this regime. \nThat is a fact. Saddam Hussein crawled into a rat hole. That says a lot \nabout him. He is now in jail, soon to be on trial, perhaps soon to meet \nwith the ultimate penalty. This is not about Saddam Hussein. This \ndiscussion is about whether this country is able to protect itself from \na terrorist attack a month from now or a year from now. Do we have an \nintelligence community that gets it right? Mr. Kay seems to say no. \nThat community has failed us. He says they have not just failed in \nIraq, they have gotten it wrong in Libya and Iran. We need a renovation \nof our ability to collect intelligence.\n  Incidentally, Mr. Kay, former top weapons inspector of this \nPresident, said this morning he favors an independent commission to \ntake a look at and investigate the failure of the intelligence \ncommunity. I hope we will move with great haste to embrace that \nrecommendation. It is not just his recommendation. Senator Daschle and \nothers have made that same recommendation in the Senate.\n  We need to move with great urgency. This is about the safety and \nsecurity of our country.\n  My colleague from Florida is on the floor and wishes to speak to an \nissue. Time is short. We have an urgent requirement to pursue this \nissue. I call on Senator Frist next week to give all of us here in the \nSenate the opportunity to hear and question Mr. Tenet, head of the CIA, \nas well as Condoleezza Rice, National Security Adviser. We should have \nthat opportunity because they, in top secret briefings, gave us \ninformation. They represented the intelligence, the community of \nintelligence and the assessment of the intelligence community prior to \ngoing to war in Iraq.\n  That assessment is what Mr. Kay refers to when he says there was a \nfailure. The assessment that apparently was accepted--perhaps embraced, \ncertainly embraced--by the Secretary of State when he went to New York \nand made his presentation to the United Nations was a failure of \nintelligence. I think the Secretary of State would want these answers. \nThe President certainly needs these answers. He should demand it this \nafternoon. The Senate deserves these answers next week at the very \nlatest.\n\n[[Page S311]]\n\n  I call on Senator Frist to convene a meeting next week of the 100 \nSenators in our Intelligence Committee room so we can question and hear \nfrom the head of the CIA and the head of the National Security Council, \nMr. Tenet and Ms. Rice. Mr. Tenet and Ms. Rice ought to present \nthemselves, and we should begin this process of finding out what \nhappened. Why did it happen.

Mr. President, I express my appreciation to \nthe Senator from North Dakota for the case that he has made, which has \nbeen very disturbing to us as two Senators, because the information we \nhave received over the last several days causes us not only to scratch \nour heads but to shake our heads--that the intelligence we received in \nthe secure rooms of this Capitol complex was either so faulty that we \nare in a considerable degree of vulnerability, that we are not getting \naccurate information upon which to defend this country, or that the \ninformation that was presented to us was faulty not because of the \nsources of that information and the analysis but there was some \nsuggestion of coloring that information to reach a certain conclusion.\n  I think this is far beyond Republicans and Democrats. This is about \ndefense of the homeland. This is about America. Just because this has \ncome up in January of an election year, with Dr. Kay coming forth and \ntelling us today in the Armed Services Committee that he concluded this \nlast November, then it is sure time for us to get some answers for the \nprotection of this country and its people.\n  I want to take this occasion to inform the Senate of specific \ninformation that I was given, which turns out not to be true. I was one \nof 77 Senators who voted for the resolution in October of 2002 to \nauthorize the expenditure of funds for the President to engage in an \nattack on Iraq. I voted for it. I want to tell you some specific \ninformation that I received that had a great deal of bearing on my \nconclusion to vote for that resolution. There were other factors, but \nthis information was very convincing to me that there was an imminent \nperil to the interests of the United States.\n  I, along with nearly every Senator in this Chamber, in that secure \nroom of this Capitol complex, was not only told there were weapons of \nmass destruction--specifically chemical and biological--but I was \nlooked at straight in the face and told that Saddam Hussein had the \nmeans of delivering those biological and chemical weapons of mass \ndestruction by unmanned drones, called UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles. \nFurther, I was looked at straight in the face and told that UAVs could \nbe launched from ships off the Atlantic coast to attack eastern \nseaboard cities of the United States.\n  Is it any wonder that I concluded there was an imminent peril to the \nUnited States? The first public disclosure of that information occurred \nperhaps a couple of weeks later, when the information was told to us. \nIt was prior to the vote on the resolution and it was in a highly \nclassified setting in a secure room. But the first public disclosure of \nthat information was when the President addressed the Nation on TV. He \nsaid that Saddam Hussein possessed UAVs.\n  Later, the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, in his presentation to \nthe United Nations, in a very dramatic and effective presentation, \nexpanded that and suggested the possibility that UAVs could be launched \nagainst the homeland, having been transported out of Iraq. The \ninformation was made public, but it was made public after we had \nalready voted on the resolution, and at the time there was nothing to \ncontradict that.\n  We now know, after the fact and on the basis of Dr. Kay's testimony \ntoday in the Senate Armed Services Committee, that the information was \nfalse; and not only that there were not weapons of mass destruction--\nchemical and biological--but there was no fleet of UAVs, unmanned \naerial vehicles, nor was there any capability of putting UAVs on ships \nand transporting them to the Atlantic coast and launching them at U.S. \ncities on the eastern seaboard.\n  I am upset that the degree of specificity I was given a year and a \nhalf ago, prior to my vote, was not only inaccurate; it was patently \nfalse. I want some further explanations.\n  Now, what I have found after the fact--and I presented this to Dr. \nKay this morning in the Senate Armed Services Committee--is there was a \nvigorous dispute within the intelligence community as to what the CIA \nhad concluded was accurate about those UAVs and about their ability to \nbe used elsewhere outside of Iraq. Not only was it in vigorous dispute, \nthere was an outright denial that the information was accurate. That \nwas all within the intelligence community.\n  But I didn't find that out before my vote. I wasn't told that. I \nwasn't told that there was a vigorous debate going on as to whether or \nnot that was accurate information. I was given that information as if \nit were fact, and any reasonable person then would logically conclude \nthat the interests of the United States and its people were in \nimmediate jeopardy and peril. That has turned out not to be true.\n  We need some answers, and I saw the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee ask the chairman for a further investigation into \nthis matter. I heard the chairman say: I will take it under \nconsideration.\n  I hope that is a positive sign and not a negative sign. We need to \nget to the bottom of this for the protection of our country. It is too \nbad this is coming up in the year 2004, which happens to coincide with \nthe Presidential election, because people are going to immediately say \nthis is partisan politics.\n  The fact is, this is the politics of the protection of our country, \nand we need some answers. I don't want to be voting on war resolutions \nin the future based on information that is patently false when \neverybody is telling me, looking me eyeball to eyeball, that it is \ntrue.\n  I am hoping, as the Senator from North Dakota has suggested, that we \nhave a convening of the appropriate intelligence officials in the \nsecure room and that members of the intelligence community, as well as \nmembers of the administration, will come and explain, in addition to \nwhat Dr. Kay has explained on the public record--which is revealing \nenough in itself--what, in fact, happened and how we are going to \ncorrect the process and the analysis of information so that we never \nhave this kind of miscalculation and misinformation again.\n  Either the intelligence community's self-examination, its analysis \nwas hugely faulty, or there were the hints at taking information and \ncoloring it, called stacking the news and coming out with a conclusion \nthat was wanted. I think we have to find out what happened.\n  It is not a question of whether or not Saddam Hussein ought to be \ngone. Thank goodness he is gone. That probably had a very salutary \neffect on the United States in that part of the world, that the United \nStates will back up its intentions with force. But when the United \nStates makes decisions about a preemptive war, a war now that has \nclaimed the lives of over 500 American men and women, then we have to \nhave a much higher standard of accuracy of the information upon which \nwe make the judgments to send America's finest on to the battlefield.\n  I can tell you about all the soldiers from Florida who are now laid \nto rest. There are plenty of reasons I am raising these questions, but \nif for no other reason than to raise the questions for the mamas and \nthe daddies and the spouses and the children of those soldiers. That is \nplenty justification enough. But the justification is much greater, and \nthat is the justification of making sure we can protect ourselves in \nthe future.\n  In a war against terrorists, our defense is only going to be as good \nas the information we receive to stop the terrorists. We had a colossal \nfailure of intelligence on September 11, 2 years ago. We can't afford \nthat kind of failure again. Yet we have just found out that when we \nwere given the reasons for going to war, that was faulty intelligence. \nAmerica can't afford too many more of these, for the protection of \nourselves and our loved ones.\n\n[[Page S312]]\n\n  This is something of considerable concern to me personally. I know it \nis of considerable concern to the rest of the Senate. I hope the \nmajority leader of this Senate, Senator Frist, is going to listen to \nthose of us in this Chamber who say that this request has nothing to do \nwith politics. Let's get to the bottom of what is the truth and how we \nmake sure that information in the future is true.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about our \nNation's immigration policy.\n  Early this month, I applauded President Bush by talking about his \nprinciples which he believes ought to be embodied in comprehensive \nimmigration reform. The President spoke courageously and forthrightly, \nand I urge Congress to heed the President's call.\n  We must acknowledge the truth. We need to be honest. The fact is, we \nhave done far too little to repair a system that calls out--indeed, a \nsystem that cries out--for reform. Our homeland security demands an \naccounting of the identities of an estimated 8 to 10 million \nindividuals currently living illegally in the United States, including \ntheir reason for being here and allowing an informed judgment on \nwhether they pose a danger to us. For those who are deportable \ncriminals, that judgment must be swift and sure.\n  The truth is the vast majority of undocumented immigrants in this \ncountry are not here as drug dealers, violent criminals, or terrorists. \nRather, they are here doing the best they can to work hard so they can \nprovide for their families. We can no longer deny the sheer number of \nundocumented individuals or the extent of our economy's dependence on \nthe labor that they provide, nor can we ignore the horrible costs that \nmany of these individuals pay when it comes to human smuggling.\n\n  In the wake of 9/11, much of the increased enforcement effort that we \nhave made in terms of our border security has succeeded in blocking off \nthe easiest transit points along our border, but that only means they \nresort to more remote and dangerous areas to cross, and sometimes with \ndeadly results.\n  These individuals are also relying more on human smugglers, known as \ncoyotes. Hundreds of undocumented individuals have died in the past 2 \nyears. An immigration policy that ignores the reality of human \nsuffering and death cannot be tolerated in a humane society.\n  For too long, the political extremists have dominated the debate \nabout immigration. There are those who say they want to build a wall \naround our country, and others, on the other end of the spectrum, who \ncry for unconditional, complete amnesty. But both of these extremist \nproposals are unrealistic, and they leave many problems unanswered. \nWhat America needs instead is a comprehensive and fundamentally strong \nimmigration system that bridges the gap between our economic and \nsecurity needs. I believe a comprehensive, commonsense guest worker \nprogram is a critical first step toward fixing our immigration policies \nand adapting to modern realities. That is why last summer I introduced \nthe Border Security and Immigration Reform Act of 2003. I urge my \ncolleagues to educate themselves about the contents of this bill and to \nrecognize that we must act to bring our broken immigration system into \nthe 21st century.\n  Here are the key elements of my proposal. We need immigration reform. \nI believe we need an immigration system that will put homeland security \nfirst. Any reform of our immigration laws must be able to distinguish \nbetween the benign and the dangerous. Our law enforcement resources, \nlimited as they are, must be able to be focused and dedicated to \nhunting down the real threats to our Nation, whether they are the \nsmugglers, the drug dealers, or the terrorists, not simply those who \nare merely looking for a better life for themselves and their loved \nones.\n  Currently, the whereabouts of 80,000 criminal alien absconders, \naliens who have been convicted of a felony and ordered deported, is \nsimply unknown to our Government. They vanished and we don't know where \nthey are. They are running free within our borders.\n  In addition, we don't know the whereabouts of hundreds of thousands \nof other undocumented aliens who are under final orders of deportation. \nThey simply have no other appeal, they are under final orders to leave, \nand they simply, again, melted into America.\n  This must change. Our immigration authorities must be given not only \nadequate funding and resources but adequate priorities as well. They \nmust be allowed to spend more time on those who are a threat to us and \nnot just those who come here to perform work that Americans by and \nlarge will not perform. Ignoring the problem--something we have done \nfor some time now--won't solve any of our border security or \nimmigration problems, and it will not make our Nation any more secure. \nIdentifying, detaining, and deporting real threats to our Nation and \nour families will.\n  Second, my bill will help bring millions of current undocumented \nimmigrants out of the shadows and under the rule of law and onto the \ntax rolls. Under my proposal, guest workers will no longer fear the \nauthorities but, rather, will come to see the law as an ally and not as \nan enemy. This, in turn, will help protect immigrants from exploitation \nand violence and help end the death dealing of human smugglers. We must \nbring these workers out into the open, out of the shadows, out of the \ncash economy, and onto the tax rolls, which I believe will ultimately \nhelp restore respect for the rule of law.\n  Third, our immigration system must give a real incentive for \nundocumented workers who come to this country to work on a temporary \nbasis. It must give them a real incentive to ultimately return to their \nhome country. I believe my proposal is unique in this respect--\nsomething we call ``work and return.'' My proposal gives undocumented \nimmigrants a real reason to come out of the shadows, to work within the \nlaw, to be accounted for, and then to return to their homes and their \nfamilies in their home country, with the pay and the skills they \nacquire as guest workers in the United States.\n\n  In my recent visit with government leaders in Mexico City, I was \nrepeatedly told that Mexico wants, indeed Mexico needs for its young, \nenergetic risk takers and hard workers ultimately to come back home, \nand particularly to come back home with the capital and savings and the \nskills that they acquire when they work in the United States. They need \nthese people to come back to their home country and to buy a house, to \nstart a business, so that these small business owners, these potential \nentrepreneurs, can help strengthen the middle class in countries like \nMexico. But our current immigration policy fails to give undocumented \nimmigrants any real incentive to make a return to their home country.\n  Of course, I have mentioned Mexico, but this would hold true for many \nother countries that would also be covered by this program.\n  The fact is, there will be no end to illegal immigration across our \nsouthern border without economic recovery south of the border. Those of \nus in America cannot afford for our southern border to remain a one-way \nstreet.\n  Guest workers should, yes, be allowed to come out of the shadows and \nregister for a program that will allow them to transit back and forth \nacross the border in a way that they do not have to turn their lives \nand their fortunes over to coyotes and human smugglers. But ultimately \nreal reform would make sure that these guest workers, after working \nhere temporarily in the United States, must return to their country of \norigin.\n  President Bush called us to this task in his State of the Union \nspeech just a couple of weeks ago now. I believe we in Congress have a \nduty to confront this challenge. We should hide our head in the sand no \nlonger. We cannot, in my view, simply ignore the fact that there are \nliterally hundreds of thousands of people under final orders of \ndeportation. There are 80,000 criminal\n\n[[Page S313]]\n\nalien absconders currently loose in this country, and our law \nenforcement authorities simply don't know where they are. But as for \nthose who are not a threat, those who want nothing more than the \nopportunity to work temporarily and return to their homes with the \nsavings and the skills they need in order to have a better life in \ntheir home country, I believe we must move these temporary workers out \nof the shadows. We must at the same time ensure the security of our \nborders. We must restore respect for our law, and we must bring our \nbroken immigration system into the 21st century.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In 1999, a 37-year-old man was the target of a brutal anti-gay attack \non a cruise ship off the California coast. The victim was assaulted in \na hallway of the ship by two other passengers who called him a \n``faggot'' several times. He sustained injuries including a broken \nnose, three skull fractures around his eyes, chipped teeth and multiple \ncontusions.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S313-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S313-S315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENFORCING U.S. IMMIGRATION LAWS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we all agree that among the things we \nlearned from the September 11 attacks was that we need to do a much \nbetter job of enforcing our immigration laws. While no system is \nfoolproof, we should at least make it as difficult as possible to evade \nour border controls and enter this country illegally.\n  In doing so we must also be sure that we protect the rights and \ndignity of innocent travelers, to ensure that those who have every \nright to come to this country are able to do so with a minimum of delay \nand difficulty. We must also ensure that we do not betray our historic \ncommitment to asylum, a dedication to provide refuge to those who flee \noppression.\n  Since September 11, we have thwarted some illegal immigrants, \nalthough we do not know how many of them, if any, sought to come here \nto commit acts of terrorism. But we have also read about instances \nwhere innocent people were swept up by our border patrol agencies, and \nsubjected to unnecessary and humiliating treatment.\n  These abuses not only damage the individual, but they damage our \nimage around the world. As a result, people who would otherwise travel \nto the United States, as tourists, students, or for business, are \ndeciding against coming out of fear that because of their race, or \nethnicity, or nationality, or just because of the chance of a mistake, \nthey might be mistreated or imprisoned.\n  Today I want to call attention to two cases. The first case involves \nMs. Antje Croton, a German citizen married to an American school \nteacher from Brooklyn, whose ordeal was described in the January 21, \n2004 edition of the New York Times.\n  Ms. Croton encountered a nightmarish immigration fiasco as she and \nher infant daughter tried to re-enter the United States after spending \nthe holidays in Germany. The New York Times called Ms. Croton's ordeal \n``Kafkaesque.'' There is no better word for it.\n  Concerned that her travel permit had expired in July, Ms. Croton \nvisited a Department of Homeland Security, DHS, office in New York City \nbefore leaving the country for Germany on December 9, 2003. After \ntalking to officials there, she was assured that her permit was valid \nthrough April 2004. Believing her documents were in order, Ms. Croton \nleft for Germany.\n  Upon her return, Ms. Croton was told by an immigration official at \nthe airport in New York that her travel permit had expired, and that \nshe could not enter the country. With her infant daughter, Ms. Croton \nwas interrogated until 2 a.m. and told she was to be put on the next \nplane back to Germany, all without informing her husband, who was \nwaiting in the terminal.\n  At one point, Ms. Croton and her daughter were taken to a room where \na dozen individuals, including some who were suspected of transporting \ndrugs and illegal firearms, were being held. After several more hours \nof back and forth, immigration officials finally gave Ms. Croton the \noption of leaving the airport if she bought a return ticket that left \nfor Germany within 30 days.\n  Ms. Croton and her husband spent the next 30 days negotiating layers \nof byzantine immigration rules and regulations in an effort to resolve \nher case before she was forced to depart. Even with the help of elected \nofficials and immigration lawyers, the couple was getting nowhere. It \nwas only after an inquiry from a New York Times reporter that the DHS \nbegan to pay attention.\n  The second case involves Sonam, a 30-year-old Buddhist nun whose \nplight was recounted in the January 27, 2004 edition of the Washington \nPost. Sonam, who goes by only one name, was detained at Dulles \nInternational Airport last August after arriving from Nepal.\n  After her father was arrested and tortured, Sonam fled from her \nnative Tibet, controlled by China, to Nepal 3 years ago. She reached \nNepal by walking for 8 days across mountainous territory. She then fled \nNepal last summer, after the government there began returning Tibetan \nrefugees to China, where they face prison and torture.\n  Sonam was granted asylum by a United States immigration judge last \nNovember, but the DHS immediately appealed the ruling and refused to \nrelease Sonam from custody during the pendency of the appeal. As a \nresult, she may spend years in a local jail outside Richmond where she \nhas been detained. In this jail, she is housed among common criminals \nand is unable to communicate with anyone because she does not know \nEnglish.\n  The DHS defends its punitive policies toward asylum seekers on the \ngrounds that it is concerned that terrorists may manipulate the asylum \nprocess. It strains belief to imagine that the DHS believes that a nun \nfrom Tibet with no knowledge of English or history of violence, whom a \nU.S. Government official has found deserving of asylum, is a potential \nterrorist.\n  Even Asa Hutchinson, the DHS Undersecretary for Border and \nTransportation Security, told the Post that ``[e]ven a well-balanced \npolicy can get out of kilter on an individual case because someone has \nexercised poor judgment.'' It is clearly the case here that someone at \nDHS is exercising poor judgment, and Secretary Ridge or Undersecretary \nHutchinson should do something to rectify this injustice.\n  There is no question that securing our borders from international \nterrorists, criminals, and illegal immigrants is one of the most \nimportant responsibilities of the Federal Government. We are more aware \nof this today than ever before.\n  But this does not give DHS a license to act in a bureaucratic and \nheavy-handed manner, which is precisely how it appears they behaved in \nthese cases.\n  Border security involves striking a balance. Instead of wasting time \nand resources scaring and harassing a German woman and her baby or a \nTibetan nun, who pose no threat to the security of the United States, \nDHS should be focused on stopping real terrorists and criminals. \nMoreover, in the Croton case, an immigration official told Ms. Croton \nthat her paperwork was in order before she left the United States.\n  Thanks to the New York Times and others, the Croton case may be \nheaded for a happy ending. But this is an instance where the victim \nspoke English,\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\nis married to an American, and is a citizen of a nation that is a close \nally of the United States.\n  What if this had involved someone who spoke little or no English? \nWhat if the person in question were not married to an American citizen? \nWhat if the media and elected officials had not been aware of it, and \nhad not gotten involved? I suspect the individual would have been \ndeported, even though their only offense was listening to the advice of \nan immigration official.\n  Meanwhile, the outcome of the Sonam case remains unclear, and unless \nthe DHS acts, she can expect to spend most if not all of 2004 behind \nbars.\n  There are probably dozens, if not hundreds of other cases, of would-\nbe immigrants and asylum seekers that do not have happy endings that we \ndo not know about. Even one case like this is too many. Immigrants are \nresponsible for the diversity of cultures, ideas, and practices that \nmake up our society. We have an important responsibility to help those \nattempting to come to this Nation legally.\n  Equally important, we have an interest in treating immigrants fairly \nand with respect. Poor treatment of legal immigrants squanders goodwill \nthat the United States spends billions of dollars each year--through \nforeign aid, international exchanges, and public diplomacy programs--to \ncultivate.\n  To be sure, we want our DHS officials to do their jobs effectively. \nWe have to make sure that people entering this Nation are doing so \nlegally, and are not a threat to the United States. But, we also have \nto make sure that DHS officials act in a fair and professional manner.\n  I hope that the DHS is reviewing what went wrong in these cases, and \ntaking whatever steps are necessary to prevent it from happening again. \nI ask unanimous consent that the New York Times and Washington Post \narticles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 21, 2004]\n\n            Trip Home From Europe Becomes Kafkaesque Ordeal\n\n                          (By Nina Bernstein)\n\n       A German woman married to a Brooklyn schoolteacher had been \n     told that she had all her papers in order when she took a \n     quick trip to show off her infant daughter to her parents in \n     Germany.\n       But her return home in late December turned surreal and \n     terrifying when Homeland Security officials at Kennedy \n     Airport rejected her travel documents, confiscated her \n     passport, then detained her and the 3-month-old overnight in \n     a room with shackled drug suspects. They let her go only \n     after ordering her to leave the country no later than \n     tomorrow.\n       After a month of desperate efforts by her American husband, \n     their lawyers and legislators, late yesterday a spokeswoman \n     for the Homeland Security Department said that the woman, \n     Antje Croton, 36, would be granted a last-minute reprieve. \n     But Mrs. Croton said she had received no written \n     notification. ``I'm in a nightmare,'' she said as she packed \n     yesterday afternoon, having abandoned hope of straightening \n     out the problem. ``I feel like I'm in the wrong movie.''\n       Her husband, Christopher Croton, said the couple was not \n     convinced their ordeal was over. ``The experience has been \n     like trying to open a door to a room that does not exist,'' \n     Mr. Croton said. ``That's the irony here. My German-born wife \n     has to come here to experience this wall of, just The \n     State.''\n       He pointed out that other foreigners with fewer resources \n     have been caught in the same kind of bureaucratic confusion \n     ever since the Immigration and Naturalization Service was \n     absorbed by the Department of Homeland Security last year.\n       Mrs. Croton has lived in Park Slope for five years, and her \n     application for a green card has been pending for nearly two. \n     When her sister urged her to visit Germany, she wanted to \n     take no chances. So in October, she said, she asked \n     immigration officials at 26 Federal Plaza about getting a new \n     travel permit.\n       According to her account, an immigration official, C.E. \n     Herndandez, insisted that her old permit was still valid, \n     though it had a July expiration date, because it bore a stamp \n     saying ``April 2004.'' Reassured, Mrs. Croton departed on \n     Dec. 9. ``I did everything by the rules,'' Mrs. Croton said.\n       But on Dec. 22, when she returned to Kennedy Airport at 9 \n     p.m., exhausted after a 10-hour trip alone with her baby \n     daughter, Clara, front-line border security officers barred \n     her way. They said the immigration official had been wrong: \n     the July 2003 expiration, not the April 2004 stamp, applied, \n     and she could not enter the United States.\n       They interrogated her until 2 a.m., she said, as she wept, \n     tried to nurse her baby and pleaded with officials to call \n     her husband, who was waiting without word in the terminal.\n       Mrs. Croton, who has worked for an ad agency in Hamburg and \n     as a journalist in New York, and who recently started her own \n     Internet business as a handbag designer, said she was \n     astonished that the official questioning her had to struggle \n     to enter her replies in an archaic computer, hunting and \n     pecking and calling for help to save the document file.\n       ``Then this man says, `We are going to put you on the next \n     plane going back home.' ''\n       ``I said, `This is my home,' '' recalled Mrs. Croton, who \n     has lived in the same apartment with her husband since before \n     they were married in 2001.\n       She was then taken from the airport's terminal 1 to \n     terminal 4, she said, to a fluorescent-lit room where a dozen \n     detainees included a man who had been carrying an illegal gun \n     and several suspected drug couriers in shackles.\n       ``I couldn't even spell my name anymore,'' Mrs. Croton \n     said. ``Nobody who hasn't had a little infant and traveled on \n     a long-distance flight can understand. I said, `I need to lie \n     down. I'm shivering, I'm exhausted, I'm nursing.' '' But she \n     said an officer retorted: ``Stop crying. There were other \n     people here with kids, and it's not going to get you \n     anywhere.''\n       The most humane response, Mrs. Croton added, came from the \n     low-level worker who had driven her from one terminal to the \n     other. Learning that the mother had no diapers left for her \n     baby, the driver returned with three toddler-sized disposable \n     diapers, the only ones she could find.\n       In the morning, a supervisor told Mrs. Croton that she had \n     to board a plane to Germany, but she refused, fearing for her \n     health and the baby's. She was then offered another option: \n     to buy a ticket for a flight to Germany leaving within 30 \n     days, with no guarantee she could ever return.\n       The couple hoped to straighten out the mess before her \n     forced departure, but the red tape seemed impervious. Two \n     weeks ago, the couple went back to see Ms. Hernandez at \n     Federal Plaza, and she again told Mrs. Croton that her travel \n     document was still valid until April.\n       When told what had happened at the airport, other officials \n     said that without Mrs. Croton's confiscated passport and \n     file, their hands were tied. They were at an impasse until an \n     inquiry by a reporter for The New York Times to Janet \n     Rapaport, a spokeswoman for the Border Security section of \n     Homeland Security.\n       That resulted in a flurry of activity. Ms. Rapaport said \n     yesterday that a decision had been reached by Susan T. \n     Mitchell, director of New York field operations for Customs \n     Enforcement and Border Security, based on a review of Mrs. \n     Croton's file. Mrs. Croton would be allowed to stay and \n     pursue her green card application. ``I guess for humanitarian \n     reasons,'' Ms. Rapaport said.\n       ``I want to believe it,'' Mrs. Croton said. ``But they tell \n     me I can stay, and then I stay, and then what if they tell me \n     I'm a real lawbreaker?''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From Washingtonpost.com, Jan. 27, 2004]\n\n                  Granted Asylum, Nun Held in Va. Jail\n\n\n                 tibetan entangled in post-9/11 caution\n\n                             (By David Cho)\n\n       Hopewell, VA.--Sonam always feared her devotion to Buddhism \n     would land her behind bars in her native China. As it turns \n     out, she is serving a long term in jail--not in East Asia but \n     in central Virginia.\n       The 30-year-old Buddhist nun, who grew up in a Tibetan \n     village near the foot of Mount Everest, fled to the United \n     States in August after family members had been tortured and \n     friends jailed for their faith, she said. But when she \n     arrived at Dulles International Airport and requested asylum, \n     federal immigration officials detained her and placed her in \n     the local jail in this small city outside Richmond.\n       Sonam, who is known by that one name, has been here ever \n     since except for a brief visit in November to a court room in \n     Arlington where a federal immigration judge granted her \n     asylum. But even as she was hugging her attorney in \n     celebration, the lawyer from the Department of Homeland \n     Security announced that she was appealing the case.\n       Sonam was then shackled and returned to her cell, where she \n     waits for their next court date, which is likely to be in the \n     fall at the earliest, her attorney said.\n       Sonam is among thousands of asylum seekers who have fled \n     persecution in their homelands only to be jailed in the \n     United States, a new report by the New York-based Lawyers \n     Committee for Human Rights shows.\n       By law, the Department of Homeland Security detains all \n     asylum seekers who arrive without proper documents. But since \n     the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, federal immigration \n     officials have also been denying parole to those immigrants \n     and appealing rulings in their favor, a practice that can \n     keep them locked up for years, according to the report, which \n     monitored the department's activities for a year and details \n     scores of cases, including Sonam's.\n       Homeland Security officials deny they are trying to keep \n     asylum seekers behind bars, although they acknowledge that \n     long incarcerations occur. They say they are reviewing their \n     practices in responses to the report and are tallying \n     statistics on how many asylum seekers have been detained, \n     refused parole or seen their cases appealed.\n       ``Even a well-balanced policy can get out of kilter on an \n     individual case because someone\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\n     has exercised poor judgment,'' said Asa Hutchinson, the \n     Homeland Security Department's undersecretary for border and \n     transportation security.\n       At the same time, he and others say their is concern that a \n     terrorist could slip into the country under the guise of an \n     asylum request.\n       ``People who come here may have no legitimate [reason]. \n     They are here for economic reasons or for criminal reasons \n     and have been trained to assert asylum,'' Hutchinson said.\n       ``That requires us to be careful and . . . sometimes it \n     makes people more skeptical of asylum cases than they should \n     be.''\n       Last week, during an interview at the Riverside Regional \n     Jail, Sonam spoke of her journey to the United States that \n     began with a desperate, eight-day walk to Nepal across snow-\n     capped mountains and ended with her first ride on an \n     airplane, which frightened her so much she couldn't look out \n     the window.\n       Sonam Singeri, a Tibetan working for Radio Free Asia who \n     has befriended Sonam, was at the interview to translate. As \n     soon as Sonam walked into the visitors' room and saw Singeri, \n     she collapsed into her arms and sobbed uncontrollably.\n       ``It's so lonely. It's so hard. Why is this happening?'' \n     she cried out, Singeri said.\n       Sonam told a story of flight and fear. She said her father \n     has been jailed in Tibet and tortured with electric shock. \n     She described hiding from police patrols as she made her way \n     across the Himalaya Mountains to Nepal, where she lived for \n     three years.\n       But even there, she said, she worried about her safety. In \n     May, the Nepalese government began to round up Tibetan \n     refugees and send them back to China, where they were sure to \n     face prison and torture, she said.\n       Even after asylum seekers such as Sonam have convinced \n     immigration judges that they are bona fide and pose no \n     threat, Homeland Security lawyers continue to press appeals \n     in many cases, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights report \n     says.\n       ``They are indefinitely detaining asylum seekers who have \n     already been granted relief, who present no risk, who have \n     often been tortured in their home countries,'' said Archi \n     Pyati, who works in the lawyers committee's asylum program.\n       ``We are sending a message that in the United States . . . \n     we don't hope that asylum seekers find their way here because \n     if they do they will find themselves in a very difficult \n     situation and in prolonged detention.''\n       Immigrants seeking asylum in this country must prove not \n     only their identities but also that they are in danger in \n     their native countries.\n       Sonam's case was appealed because she did not have enough \n     documentation to back up her story, according to a brief \n     filed by Homeland Security attorney Deborah Todd. The fact \n     that Sonam lived in Nepal for three years indicated that she \n     could have safely stayed there and did not need to come to \n     the United States, Todd argued in her appeal.\n       Asked to comment, a spokesman for Homeland Security said \n     the department does not talk about ongoing cases.\n       Sonam said she had no way to get identity documents in \n     Nepal because the government does not recognize refugees from \n     China. She feared that she would be deported to China along \n     with other Tibetans who were being sent back at the time. So \n     she sought a way to get to the United States.\n       Using the money she had made as a seamstress before she \n     joined her monastery in Nepal, Sonam booked a flight through \n     Calcutta to Dulles.\n       After she was jailed in Virginia, her attorney, who has \n     taken the case pro bono, twice asked the Department of \n     Homeland Security to release her from detention, arguing that \n     Sonam poses no danger. But immigration officials denied both \n     requests without much explanation, according to Sonam's \n     attorney.\n       The hardest part of Sonam's life these days is that she \n     cannot speak or understand the language of the inmates or \n     guards. (She is also illiterate in her native Tibetan \n     tongue.) She has not been able to have a conversation with \n     anyone since her hearing in November and wept as she \n     recounted her seemingly endless days of silence and isolation \n     in jail.\n       ``I live in a prison but always in my mind, I hold onto a \n     picture of His Holiness [the Dalai Lama] in my heart,'' she \n     said. ``This prison has become my monastery.''\n       An hour into the interview, a guard tapped the window of \n     the visitors' room. It was time to go.\n       Sonam shed a few more tears. It might be months before her \n     next conversation. She hugged Singeri again and then followed \n     the guard back to her part of the jail where she does not \n     speak, cannot understand anyone and where she waits in her \n     prison within a prison.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S315-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S315-S316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DAVID KAY INTERVIEW\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, during the past several days, there has \nbeen a great deal of discussion regarding comments made by David Kay, \nwho until just recently led our search for weapons of mass destruction \nin Iraq.\n  There are some who have said that statements made by Mr. Kay indicate \nthat there was no reason to take military action to address the threat \nposed by Saddam Hussein. I believe this is, at best, a misunderstanding \nof his statements. Mr. Kay clearly believes that removing Saddam \nHussein from power was the right thing to do.\n  It is in this context that I would like to take this opportunity to \nshare with my colleagues an interview that Mr. Kay gave yesterday \nmorning, in which he outlines his thoughts on the dangers presented by \nSaddam Hussein.\n  When asked whether it was prudent to go to war, Mr. Kay responded:\n\n       I think it was absolutely prudent. In fact, I think at the \n     end of the inspection process we'll paint a picture of Iraq \n     that was far more dangerous than even we thought it was \n     before the war. It was of a system collapsing. It was a \n     country that had the capability in weapons of mass \n     destruction areas and in which terrorists, like ants to \n     honey, were going after it.\n\n  I believe it is helpful to review his comments in their entirety, and \nas such, I ask unanimous consent that the following interview be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the NBC Today Show, Jan. 27, 2004]\n\n       Anchor: Matt Lauer\n       David Kay, former head of Iraq survey group, discusses \n     searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\n\n       MATT LAUER, co-host. The Bush administration now says it \n     needs more to determine if Iraq had weapons of mass \n     destruction; this after retired U.S. weapons inspector David \n     Kay concluded that Saddam Hussein had no such weapons.\n       David Kay, good morning. Good to have you here.\n       Mr. DAVID KAY (Former Head Of Iraq Survey Group). Good \n     morning, Matt.\n       LAUER. There are some people who say you spent eight months \n     scouring the country of Iraq for stockpiles of weapons of \n     mass destruction, chemical, biological, nuclear, and because \n     you didn't find them, they make a blanket statement. And that \n     is there US administration misled the American people \n     building a case for war. Is that a fair statement?\n       Mr. KAY. I think it's not fair, and it also trivializes \n     what we did find and the problem we face. The problem we face \n     is that before the war not only the US administration and US \n     intelligence, but the French, British, Germans, the UN, all \n     thought Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. Not \n     discovering them tells us we've got a more fundamental \n     problem.\n       LAUER. But if you didn't find stockpiles of chemical, \n     biological or nucear weapons, does that mean they never \n     existed, or does it mean they may have been moved out of Iraq \n     prior to the war?\n       Mr. KAY. Well, we've certainly dealt with the possibility \n     of moving, and we did that by trying to look to see if there \n     was any signs of their actual production in the period after \n     '98. And we really haven't found that. I think they were--\n     there's a little evidence that large weapon stockpiles were \n     moved. A lot of other stuff may well have been moved.\n       LAUER. So when you heard reports leading up to the war, and \n     it's a--unclear where the--where the source of these reports \n     came from, but that Iraqi troops had been given chemical and \n     biological weapons. And they were prepared to use them \n     against advancing US forces. And they could deploy them \n     within 45 minutes, untrue in your opinion?\n       Mr. KAY. There's no evidence that they are true at this \n     point in time.\n       LAUER. Let me play you a clip from the president's State of \n     the Union address a year ago.\n       President George W. Bush (from file footage): ``Year after \n     year, Saddam Hussein has gone to elaborate lengths, spent \n     enormous sums, taken great risks to build and keep weapons of \n     mass destruction.''\n       LAUER. In technical terms, was that an inaccurate \n     statement?\n       Mr. KAY. Inaccurate in terms of the reality we found on the \n     ground now. I think it was an accurate statement, given the \n     intelligence the president and others were begin given then.\n       LAUER. But also accurate in your opinion because in truth \n     Saddam Hussein did spend enormous amounts of money to develop \n     chemical and biological weapons, but according to your report \n     he just didn't get what he paid for.\n       Mr. KAY. Well, that was in part the--true. There are a \n     tremendous amount of con--corruption there and lying that \n     went on there. Saddam spent huge efforts at these weapons \n     programs, no doubt about that.\n       LAUER. So when you say lying, his scientists, or people \n     were coming to him saying, ``I can develop chemical and \n     biological weapons for you for the right amount of money.'' \n     They were taking the money, in your opinion, and not \n     delivering?\n       Mr. KAY. And not delivering, and reporting back successes \n     that they were not having. That was quite common down there.\n       LAUER. So when you spoke to Iraqi scientists, what did they \n     tell you about the active weapons program in the year leading \n     up to the war?\n       Mr. KAY. They describe from 1998 on a Iraq that was \n     descending into the utter inability to do anything organized. \n     Corruption was there. They couldn't get the equipment. Money \n     was wasted. People weren't really concerned about working, \n     they were concerned about money.\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\n       LAUER. But the intent was there?\n       Mr. KAY. Absolutely. And the intent at the top, of Saddam \n     to acquire those weapons and to continue to attempt to \n     acquire those was absolutely there.\n       LAUER. Almost a year ago Secretary of State Colin Powell \n     addressed the United Nations. Here's what he had to say.\n       Secretary of State Colin Powell (from file footage): \n     ``Conservative estimate is that Iraq today has a stockpile of \n     between 100 and 500 tons of chemical weapons agent.''\n       LAUER. Conservative, or just plain wrong?\n       Mr. KAY. No, I think that was the estimate based on \n     information and intelligence before the war. It turns out to \n     be wrong.\n       LAUER. So what--what was the problem with the intelligence? \n     Why were we so wrong?\n       Mr. KAY. Well, Matt, I think that is the challenge now. And \n     I think the tendency to say, ``Well, it must have been \n     pressure from the White House is absolutely wrong.'' In some \n     ways I wish it had been pressure. It would be easier to solve \n     the problem. We now have to look--and people forget, Iraq is \n     not the only place we've been wrong recently. We've been \n     wrong about Iran, and we've been wrong about Libya's program \n     there. We clearly need a renovation of our ability to collect \n     intelligence.\n       LAUER. Here's what you said to Tom Brokaw. ``Clearly the \n     intelligence that we went to war on was inaccurate, wrong. We \n     need to understand why that was.'' But you went on to say, \n     ``I think if anyone was abused by the intelligence, it was \n     the president of the United States, rather than the other way \n     around.''\n       Mr. KAY. That's abso--absolutely my belief. I think, in \n     fact, the president and all of us were reacting on the basis \n     of an intelligence product that painted a picture of Iraq \n     that turned out not to be accurate once we got on the ground.\n       LAUER. You find--you found that in--in 2000 and 2001 Saddam \n     Hussein did actively try to develop and start a nuclear \n     program?\n       Mr. KAY. He was putting more money into his nuclear \n     program. He was pushing ahead his long-range missile program \n     as hard as he could. Look, the man had the intent to acquire \n     these weapons. He invested huge amounts of money in them. The \n     fact is, he wasn't successful.\n       LAUER. In terms of the missile program alone, you feel that \n     it's obvious and--and undisputable that he violated UN \n     resolutions by developing weapons, missiles, that had a range \n     outside of those UN resolutions?\n       Mr. KAY. Absolutely, Matt. We--we have collected dozens of \n     examples of where he lied to the UN, violated Resolution \n     1441, and was in material breach.\n       LAUER. So based on the information that you have, David, \n     not what we had prior to the war, but you have, in your \n     opinion, was it prudent to go to war? Was there an imminent \n     threat?\n       Mr. KAY. I think it was absolutely prudent. In fact, I \n     think at the end of the inspection process we'll paint a \n     picture of Iraq that was far more dangerous than even we \n     thought it was before the war. It was of a system collapsing. \n     It was a country that had the capability in weapons of mass \n     destruction areas and in which terrorists, like ants to \n     honey, were going after it.\n       LAUER. Do--do you feel that--you know, you've come out and \n     started saying these things in the last couple of days, do \n     you feel your words are being misused and misinterpreted in \n     the political atmosphere that exists today?\n       Mr. KAY. I think there is a tendency, at this time to say, \n     ``Got you!'' and try to do politics. It think this is \n     national security, and far more important than momentary \n     political gain. I hope that's now what's happening.\n       LAUER. If you spend eight months looking and didn't find \n     anything, Dick Cheney says, ``In time we could probably find \n     it.'' You still think we should continue to search?\n       Mr. KAY. Absolutely. I think the inspection should continue \n     because among things we don't know enough about are the \n     foreign countries that helped the Iraqis throughout this \n     period to acquire the missiles, to develop the nukes, to \n     develop the chemical and biological. We need that for no \n     other reason. And sure, we should keep looking.\n       LAUER. And as we move forward and we look at countries like \n     Iran, which you brought up, and North Korea, how well suited \n     do you think we are by our intelligence in those areas at \n     this date?\n       Mr. KAY. I think based on the evidence we have now, we are \n     not as suited as well as we need to be. And I think that is \n     the challenge, not the political `Gotcha!' contest.\n       LAUER. David Kay.\n       David, good to have you here.\n       Mr. KAY. Good to be here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S316-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S316-S317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SUSAN BOARDMAN RUSS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I often come to this floor to thank various \nstaff for their long, tireless and often anonymous work on behalf of \nthe U.S. Senate and the 100 Senators who serve here. But it is not \noften that I come down here to acknowledge a public servant who has \nmade such an incredible contribution to this institution and our shared \nState of Vermont.\n  Today, I would like to honor the 25 years of service of Susan \nBoardman Russ, who has served Senator Jeffords and the people of \nVermont with extraordinary distinction.\n  Vermont is a small place. I have known Susan most of her life. Her \nfather delivered two of my three children.\n  Over the years, I have watched her grow with a mixture of awe and \nadmiration. Susan is brilliant, articulate, and has always kept her \neyes focused on what is best for Vermont.\n  Senator Jeffords is to be commended for recognizing her talent early \non and for keeping her in the fold this long. While Susan has moved \nwith her husband and beautiful daughter to Houston, TX, I know she will \nalways be a Vermonter at heart.\n  Recently, one of Vermont's finest journalists, Christopher Graff, \nwrote a beautiful tribute to Susan. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Susan Russ Steps Down as Jeffords' Chief of Staff\n\n                         (By Christopher Graff)\n\n       Montpelier, VT. (AP)--Susan Boardman Russ was 14 years old, \n     handing out campaign literature at the old Seaway Shopping \n     Center in South Burlington for her Uncle Bob Boardman, who \n     was running for the state Senate from Chittenden County.\n       The year was 1968.\n       Her school friend, Kathleen McGreevy, was handing out \n     flyers for her uncle, Jim Jeffords, who was running for \n     attorney general.\n       ``My uncle was Democrat and hers was a Republican, but that \n     did not matter much to two 14-year-olds,'' says Russ.\n       ``Soon, we were efficiently sharing the load. To everyone I \n     handed a Democratic Bob Boardman flyer I also handed a \n     Republican Jim Jeffords flyer and she did the same.''\n       Both Boardman and Jeffords were winners that year, their \n     two nieces began a lifelong friendship and Russ' life became \n     intertwined with Jeffords' political career.\n       In 1972 she worked during the summer on Jeffords' \n     unsuccessful bid for governor and on ``the night of his \n     primary defeat I swore I would NEVER participate in another \n     election,'' she says. ``I was 18 and heartbroken.''\n       That loss, though, was a minor setback for Jeffords, who \n     went on to win the state's lone seat in the U.S. House in \n     1974 and moved to the U.S. Senate in 1988. Every step of the \n     way Susan Russ has been there, starting as his front office \n     manager in 1978, then four years later as his administrative \n     assistant in the House office and finally as chief of staff \n     of his Senate office.\n       Now, 35 years after she handed out her first Jeffords' \n     flyer and 25 years after she went to work in Washington, Russ \n     is leaving.\n       ``It's been a perfect relationship,'' says Jeffords, adding \n     that the two of them were a ``great combination.''\n       ``Her ability to understand me, her common sense and her \n     instincts to keep us out of trouble have been remarkable,'' \n     he says.\n       The accolades come from all corners: Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-\n     Vt., calls Russ ``a Vermont treasure. For 25 years she has \n     devoted her life to working for Senator Jeffords to make the \n     lives of Vermonters better.'' In the small world department, \n     Leahy noted that Russ' father delivered two of Leahy's \n     children.\n       Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the No. 2 Senate Democratic \n     leader, also has high praise for Russ, whom he first met \n     through Russ' husband, Jack, who served as sergeant at arms \n     in the House when Reid and Jeffords served there. Reid says \n     Susan Russ was especially ``politically savvy'' in a job \n     that required it.\n       ``Chief of staff is a unique position because you need to \n     have that political savvy, plus you have to a good manager of \n     people, you have to recognize talent, and you can't be afraid \n     to tell the senator when you think he or she is wrong,'' says \n     Reid.\n       ``I believe I have been blessed with having the best job \n     imaginable and the most interesting job tolerable,'' says \n     Russ. ``I have had a front row seat to some of the most \n     challenging moments in Washington for the past two and a half \n     decades.''\n       When Jeffords first went to Washington he was a little-\n     known congressman from a tiny state who was a member of the \n     minority party. Today he is one of the best-known senators in \n     the world, achieving celebrity status with his decision in \n     2001 to abandon the GOP and become an independent, a decision \n     prompted by opposition to the politicies of President George \n     W. Bush.\n       Russ says at the time she opposed Jeffords' decision \n     although she knew that ``Jim was clearly miserable.\n       ``It was not because of any long held political or \n     philosophical beliefs that I resisted Jim switching,'' she \n     says, but that Jeffords had a long history with the \n     Republican members and leadership. ``We knew the GOP family--\n     who to trust--who not to trust.\n       ``It is my nature to try to keep things smooth, no rocking \n     the boat. This would surely rock the boat.\n       ``With nearly three years since the decision behind me, I \n     do realize that for Jim, it was the only decision he could \n     have made.''\n       Asked to pick her favorite legislative experiences, she \n     says there have been too many to do so, but mentions the 1985 \n     Farm Bill with its whole herd buyout from among the\n\n[[Page S317]]\n\n     House experiences and the several victories with the dairy \n     compact from among the Senate years.\n       ``Each time, no one really believed it was possible but Jim \n     refused to throw in the towel,'' she says.\n       Luke Albee, Leahy's chief of staff, gives Russ credit for \n     extension of the compact. ``She was focused and tenacious and \n     she said to us every day when we were exhausted and \n     dispirited, `This is going to happen because it has to \n     happen.' ''\n       Russ has no hesitation in what she treasures the most from \n     her decades in Washington: How Jeffords stood by her and her \n     husband when Jack Russ, then the House sergeant at arms, was \n     swept up in a federal probe into how congressmen misused the \n     House bank.\n       ``It would have been understandable for Jim the politician \n     to try and distance himself from the House Bank Scandal,'' \n     she says. ``By 1994, when Jim was facing a difficult re-\n     election race, Jack had come to represent the `scandal' in a \n     very public way. Jim never hestitated in his support.'' Russ \n     says the tone of Washington and the intensity of the battle \n     have changed dramatically since 1978.\n       ``Members of different parties used to have intense battles \n     over issues on the floor of the House or Senate and when it \n     was over go out and have dinner together. They never went \n     into each other's districts to help challengers. There was a \n     general sense of camaraderie that does not exist anymore \n     between members of the two parties.''\n       Russ is moving to Texas to be closer to her husband's \n     family. She has formed her own firm to advise businesses and \n     non profits on the ways of government. She hopes the move \n     will allow her to keep a hand in government but allow her \n     more time to spend with her family.\n       Russ leaves Washington painfully aware that ``politics is \n     not a game for the meek,'' but more importantly, ``I learned \n     when all is said and done, you have to live with yourself and \n     your decisions, so you better do what you think is right and \n     let the chips fall where they may.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S317-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SAUDI ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on S. 1888, the Saudi \nArabia Accountability Act of 2003, introduced by Senator Specter. I \ncommend my colleague for his leadership on this issue. Combating \nterrorism is our highest national security priority at this time, and I \nhave long had concerns regarding Saudi support for terrorist groups. \nWhile the administration has stated that the Government of Saudi Arabia \nhas recently increased its cooperation with the United States, and \nwhile I do believe that last week's joint U.S.-Saudi announcement \nregarding Al-Haramain branches in Pakistan, Indonesia, Kenya and \nTanzania is a positive step, it remains evident that the Saudi \nGovernment has often turned a blind eye to many activities that foster \nterrorism and, in some cases, Saudi leadership appears to have \nsupported terrorism directly. This bill serves to exert pressure on \nSaudi Arabia to increase its counterterrorism efforts or to face \nlimited sanctions. Cutting the links between terrorist organizations \nand their sponsoring governments is one of the most crucial tasks in \nthe fight against terrorism, and I support the goals of this \nlegislation.\n  However, the legislation raises other concerns that must be carefully \nconsidered by Congress. I am concerned that the legislation \ndemonstrates the degree to which we, as policymakers, wear blinders in \nour relationship with Saudi Arabia. The legislation expresses \ndissatisfaction with the Government of Saudi Arabia solely for their \nlack of cooperation on the global war on terrorism. But Congress must \nnot fail to mention the government's repression of women, grand-scale \ncorruption, widescale detentions, and restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and assembly. I fear that these omissions risk sending the \nwrong message about U.S. foreign policy priorities to the Middle East \nand other areas of the world. U.S. foreign policy objectives of \npromoting human rights and democracy must not be neglected while \ncombating terrorism. These do not have to be contradictory goals. Even \nas we urge the Saudi Government to act more decisively and consistently \nagainst terrorism, we must ensure that the U.S. does not inadvertently \nencourage repression of desperately needed reforms in Saudi Arabia. \nOnly by addressing both sets of issues can we achieve a future in which \nthe U.S. relationship with Saudi Arabia stands on a firm footing.\n  The national security implications of failing to speak out bluntly \nabout Saudi support for terrorism prompted me to cosponsor S. 1888. \nHowever, I hope that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will take \nthe opportunity to address some of these issues I have raised.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S317-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR IRELAND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

IGASAKI, FORMER VICE CHAIR, U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT \n                         OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I recognize Paul Igasaki, a Chicago \nnative, for his contributions to the important work of advancing our \ncivil rights. Mr. Igasaki has dedicated his entire professional career \nto ensuring justice for the powerless in our society who are often \nneglected and ignored.\n  In his most recent years of public service as a commissioner, vice \nchair, and acting chair of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission, EEOC, Mr. Igasaki not only enforced laws that helped \nprevent employment discrimination practices, he himself broke the glass \nceiling as the first Asian American appointed to the high office.\n  Mr. Igasaki was successful in reducing overwhelming case backlog that \nwas impairing the effective functioning of the agency. His \nrecommendations led to the development of the National Enforcement Plan \nand the Priority Charge Handling Program, which have reduced the EEOC \ncase inventory by over 70 percent. These structural changes have \nallowed the agency to focus on more serious cases where the EEOC's \ninvolvement can make a difference to the lives of American workers.\n  Similarly, Mr. Igasaki cochaired an EEOC task force that recommended \nfocused litigation strategy, placement of attorneys in area offices, \nand greater cooperation between attorneys and investigators in agency, \nwhich have led to increased law enforcement effectiveness of the \nagency.\n  One of his most notable accomplishments during his term on the EEOC \nwas his role in guiding the settlement of the Mitsubishi Motors of \nAmerica case--the largest case involving sexual harassment at the \nworkplace. His success with this case was influential in moving the \nJapanese government to implement gender discrimination and sexual \nharassment enforcement laws for their own country.\n  In the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, Mr. Igasaki \nbrought valuable perspectives from his personal experiences as a \nJapanese American to the EEOC's efforts to combat unfair backlash and \nscapegoating of Arab Americans, South Asian Americans, Muslim or Sikh \nAmericans and others who were wrongly targeted by hate and \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. Igasaki mother's family owned a small truck farm near San Diego. \nLike thousands of other Japanese Americans, Mr. Igasaki's grandparents \nhad been in the United States for almost a half century, and like most \nimmigrants\n\n[[Page S318]]\n\nthey were proud and loyal Americans. Yet, following the devastating \nattacks at Pearl Harbor, Mr. Igasaki's family was subject to harassment \naround town and at school. One day, the FBI showed up at their home, \nand without warning, warrant or explanation, they took his grandfather \ninto custody. His family would not know where he was, what his \ncondition was or why he had been taken for several months. They relied \non community rumor, knowing that other Japanese Americans had been \narrested for no apparent reason.\n  When our government issued the relocation orders for Japanese \nAmericans, Mr. Igasaki's family had two weeks to give up the farm and \nnearly all of their property. Only in the horse stall that the family \nshared in the relocation center at Santa Anita Racetrack did they find \nout that Mr. Igasaki's grandfather was arrested because he was the \nsecretary of the local Celery Growers Association and because he had \ntaken some notes of their meetings in Japanese. Their family eventually \nreunited when they were sent to a more permanent camp in Arizona where \nthey were held for the duration of World War II.\n  Having experienced the pain and injustice of such treatment based on \nno reason other than their ethnic ancestry, Mr. Igasaki's became a \npassionate voice of conscience in the months following the September \n11th attacks. His voice comforted all Americans who faced \ndiscrimination at the workplace because of their ancestry or \nappearance, and the work of the EEOC was that much more important \nbecause of Mr. Igasaki's presence.\n  His voice has also been an important one in the development of the \nnational Asian American civil rights movement. Mr. Igasaki has served \nas the Washington, DC, representative of the Japanese American Citizens \nLeague, executive director of the Asian Law Caucus, and executive \ndirector of the City of Chicago's Commission on Asian American Affairs.\n  A more detailed list of Mr. Igasaki's accomplishments is described in \na resolution that the national board of the Japanese American Citizens \nLeague recently adopted. I ask unanimous consent that this resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Resolution in Appreciation of and Commending Paul M. Igasaki for His \n         Service on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\n       Whereas, Paul M. Igasaki served our nation on the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) with distinction for \n     eight years from 1994 to 2002;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki was initially nominated by President \n     Clinton and confirmed by the United States Senate in 1994, \n     served as Acting Chairman from January to October 1998 and \n     was confirmed for a second term as Vice Chair on October 21, \n     1998;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki was the first Asian Pacific American \n     to serve in these positions at the EEOC;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki was the architect of the EEOC's \n     strategy for handling job discrimination charges more \n     efficiently which resulted in the prosecution of egregious \n     cases of discrimination and a reduction in charge inventory \n     by more than 50%;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki sought support for and the approval of \n     the EEOC's historic FY 1999 budget increase for this \n     important but under-funded agency;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki endeavored to ensure equal employment \n     opportunities through his work as a Commissioner at the EEOC \n     as well as by promoting diversity in hiring at all levels of \n     the agency--in the Washington, DC headquarters and in the \n     regional offices;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki's outreach to historically underserved \n     communities and his understanding of the harm of ethnic \n     profiling made him an invaluable resource at the EEOC, \n     promoting an environment which allowed those affected by \n     employment discrimination in the aftermath of the horrific \n     attacks on 9/11 to report their cases;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki was recommended for another term at \n     the EEOC by Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle in May 2002;\n       Whereas, despite Mr. Igasaki's notable achievements and \n     years of dedicated service as a committed and competent \n     public servant at the EEOC, the White House declined to \n     nominate him for another term;\n       Whereas, failing to be renominated, Mr. Igasaki's term \n     expired, and he left the EEOC at the end of 2002;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki has a long and distinguished track-\n     record of working on important civil rights issues through \n     such organizations as the Asian Law Caucus, the City of \n     Chicago's Human Relations Commission, the Chicago Commission \n     on Asian American Affairs and the American Bar Association;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki has also been a long-time member of \n     the JACL, having served as the President of the Chicago \n     chapter and as the Washington, DC Representative where he \n     worked on the Civil Rights Act, immigration reform and was a \n     crucial voice in implementing the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 \n     and the Office of Redress Administration;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki has always maintained a staunch \n     commitment to and involvement in the Asian Pacific American \n     community and the issues facing our community;\n       Whereas, Mr. Igasaki has received numerous professional and \n     personal accolades for his achievements;\n       Therefore be it resolved that the National Board of the \n     Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) on behalf of the \n     entire organization highly commends Paul M. Igasaki for his \n     years of dedicated service at the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission and extends our deepest gratitude to \n     him for his work on behalf of all Americans to combat \n     discrimination in the workplace;\n       Be it further resolved that the Japanese American Citizens \n     League recognizes and appreciates the considerable \n     contributions made by Paul M. Igasaki as an advocate for \n     civil rights and role model for the Asian Pacific American \n     community;\n       Be it further resolved that the Japanese American Citizens \n     League thanks Paul M. Igasaki for his tireless efforts to \n     promote and defend civil rights, civil liberties and equality \n     before the law.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the \nimportant achievements of Mr. Paul Igasaki, and wishing him well in his \nfuture efforts to advance civil rights of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S318-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S318-S319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nHAROLD ``TUBBY'' RAYMOND'S INDUCTION INTO COLLEGE FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nHarold Raymond upon his induction into the College Football Hall of \nFame. After 36 seasons as the University of Delaware's head football \ncoach and 48 years in the Blue Hen program, he has earned a reputation \nfor talent, dedication, and loyalty. Known to friends and colleagues as \n``Tubby,'' he is a man with a kind heart, diverse interests and great \nabilities. Tubby embodies the best of the State of Delaware, the \nUniversity of Delaware, and the institution of coaching.\n  In a coaching career that has spanned 10 United States presidencies, \nTubby led the Blue Hens to three national championships, 16 NCAA \nplayoffs and 14 Lambert Cups. He is one of nine college football \nathletes to win 300 games and one of just four who accomplished that \nfeat at one institution. He also led his team to three national \nchampionships. In his charge, the Blue Hens won more than 50 percent of \nDelaware's 575 all-time victories in 100 seasons of intercollegiate \ncompetition. He retired with a breathtaking record of 300-118-3.\n  Raymond, a native of Flint, MI, was a quarterback and linebacker at \nthe University of Michigan. It was there, playing for Coach Fritz \nCrisler, that Raymond learned the Wing-T offense, which he later \nimplemented at Delaware. He has written five books on the subject, as \nwell as producing several instructional videos.\n  Tubby began coaching in 1949 as an assistant football coach at \nUniversity High in Ann Arbor, MI. In 1950, he earned a degree in \neducation from the University of Michigan and became head coach at \nUniversity High.\n  In 1954, Tubby arrived in the First State, serving as both football \nbackfield coach and head baseball coach for the University of Delaware. \nIn 1966, he took the reins from Dave Nelson as UD's head football \ncoach. Since then, his teams have produced 32 winning seasons.\n  Over the years, Raymond had offers to coach at Syracuse, Maryland, \nArizona, Iowa and Army. Marv Levy twice tried to hire him, once when \nLevy was coaching at the University of California and again when he was \nwith the Kansas City Chiefs. But Raymond was content to stay with what \nhe calls his ``family'' at Delaware.\n  On August 29, 2002, his ``family'' paid tribute to him when they \ncelebrated Tubby Raymond Day. Completing the eventful night game in \nstyle, the Fightin' Blue Hens, under the direction of new head coach \nK.C. Keeler, defeated NCAA Division I-AA powerhouse Georgia Southern \n22-19 before an electrified crown of over 19,000. At halftime in the \ngame, with the Hens holding a 14-6\n\n[[Page S319]]\n\nlead, the Delaware Stadium playing field was formally named Tubby \nRaymond Field. Less than 16 months later, the Blue Hen team that Tubby \nhelped to recruit and then turned over to his successor K.C. Keeler \nwent on to defeat Colgate 40-0 in the finals of the NCAA's Division I-\nAA football playoffs, making the Blue Hens national champions for 2003.\n  Tubby epitomizes the University's emphasis on developing student-\nathletes, too. Throughout his tenure, he encouraged his players to \nsucceed in the classroom as well as on the football field. He will tell \nyou that he is as fiercely proud of those who succeed in careers off \nthe gridiron as he is in those who succeed in the NFL.\n  Tubby's legacy will never be forgotten by those he touched, the \nplayers he coached, and the students he inspired. On behalf of all of \nthem and those of us who call Delaware home, I want to thank him for \nhis leadership, congratulate him on a remarkable coaching career and \nwish him and his family only the very best in all that lies ahead for \nhim and for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S319-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM WOLFE\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a true \nbusiness leader and long-time friend in my State of Delaware, Jim \nWolfe. Many of us in public office talk about creating good-paying jobs \nand fighting for the middle class, Jim Wolfe has lived those goals \nthroughout his professional career.\n  For the past 11 years, Jim Wolfe has led the Chrysler, now the \nDiamlerChrysler Automobile Assembly Plant in Newark, DE. Tomorrow, he \nis hanging up his hat as plant manager to take the helm as president \nand CEO of the 2,800-member Delaware State Chamber of Commerce.\n  As plant manager of Delaware's DiamlerChrysler plant, which is home \nto the popular, award-winning Dodge Durango, Jim orchestrated a dozen \noverhauls of the facility to retool it for new car models. More \nsignificantly, he oversaw the re-training of thousands of workers to \nupgrade their skills.\n  The DiamlerChrysler plant in Delaware is one of only a few U.S. auto \nfacilities remaining on the East Coast. It is an economic engine in \nDelaware, employing more than 2,300 people and contributing $363 \nmillion annually to our State's economy. The financial domino effect \ngoes even further: one auto worker creates another 1.6 jobs in other \nindustries, such as transportation, retail services, and labor.\n  Jim Wolfe is no stranger to the Delaware State Chamber of Commerce. \nFor the past year he has served as Chairman of the Chamber's \nindependent Board of Directors. He is a long-time member of the \nChamber's Board of Directors and Executive Committee, as well as \nserving as Chairman of the Delaware Manufacturing Association.\n  On a personal note, Jim has been a great and trusted friend and \nadvisor to me for many years. I have visited with him and his workers \nat the Newark DiamlerChrysler Plant more times than I can count, and he \nalways gave it to me straight. When the facility was in jeopardy of \nclosing in the early 1990s, he counseled me on how to help save this \nmanufacturing gem for our State, which we accomplished.\n  Jim is a 40-year employee of Chrysler. We stole him from his native \nMichigan, but he and his wife Laura are now part of the Delaware \nfamily.\n  Jim's stature in the business community has been earned and is well-\ndeserved. He will bring a hands-on knowledge of the business world to \nhis new position directing the Chamber's many affiliates, including the \nManufacturing Association, the Delaware Retail Council, The Public \nPolicy Institute, and the Small Business Alliance.\n  DiamlerChrysler's loss is truly the Delaware State Chamber of \nCommerce's gain. But we all win because we'll continue to benefit from \nJim's affable personality, skilled business acumen and foresight as a \ncommunity leader in Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S319-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S319-3", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S319-4", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT OF PRESIDENTIAL DETERMINATION 2003-39 RELATIVE TO CLASSIFIED \n INFORMATION CONCERNING THE AIR FORCE'S OPERATING LOCATION NEAR GROOM \n                          LAKE, NEVADA--PM 60\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 6001(a) of the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act (RCRA) (the ``Act''), as amended, 42 U.S.C. 6961(a) \nnotification is hereby given that on September 16, 2003, I issued \nPresidential Determination 2003-39 (copy enclosed) and thereby \nexercised the authority to grant certain exemptions under section \n6001(a) of the Act.\n  Presidential Determination 2003-39 exempted the United States Air \nForce's operating location near Groom Lake, Nevada, from any Federal, \nState, interstate, or local hazardous or solid waste laws that might \nrequire the disclosure of classified information concerning that \noperating location to unauthorized persons.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Cornyn):\n  S. 2034. To establish 3 memorials to the Space Shuttle Columbia in \nthe State of Texas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today in honor of the memory and \nsacrifice of seven astronauts whose lives were tragically cut short one \nyear ago in the destruction of the Space Shuttle Columbia, I bring to \nthe floor a bill to authorize the construction of several memorials in \ncommunities that were severely effected by the event.\n  This bill authorizes $5 million to be used in communities along the \nSpace Shuttle Columbia Recovery Corridor: specifically, Lufkin, \nHemphill, and Nacogdoches, TX. Each of these communities have started \nwork with NASA to memorialize the disaster and the indomitable spirit \nof adventure and courage, the spirit that defies complacency and \naccepts challenge, the spirit that each of these astronauts, and each \nof these communities showed.\n  This spirit of adventure turned space travel from dreams to a \nreality. It is this spirit of challenge which fueled the courage and \nambition of seven men and women into the sky on January 6, 2003. It is \nalso this same spirit that drives these communities to permanently \ncommemorate the high price we sometimes pay for reaching new horizons.\n  Hemphill, TX, where the nose cone of the Shuttle was found, is also \nwhere the remains of the crew were recovered. The VFW post in Hemphill \nfed thousands of volunteers for weeks without so much as a complaint or \na dime. The men and women of Hemphill did not take their task lightly, \nbut rather with a solemn grace and dignity.\n\n[[Page S322]]\n\n  The greatest amount of debris came down in the populated areas of \nNacogdoches, TX. Backyards and streets were littered with debris, \npermanently altering the community. The citizens of Nacogdoches pulled \ntogether and focused on the recovery, working day and night with NASA \nuntil the job was complete. A spirit of courage overran the community \nof Nacogdoches and their sacrifice should never be forgotten.\n  The population of Lufkin, TX doubled overnight as the retrieval \neffort started. The people of Lufkin opened their doors and hearts to \nthousands and made their civic center NASA's Columbia retrival command \ncenter. From combing the streets and fields for debris to making home \ncooked meals for the recovery workers, the people of Lufkin mustered \naround the Columbia tragedy.\n  In recent years, America has borne too much tragedy and experienced \ntoo much grief, but our collective loss still sears our souls and the \npain is never easy to bear. Today, just one year after they vanished \ninto the deep blue skies of Texas, we pause to remember and honor Rick \nHusband, Kalpana Chawla, Laurel Clark, Ilan Roman, William McCool, \nDavid Brown, and Michael Anderson.\n  And though the families' losses cannot be diminished, their pain and \ngrief is shared around the world and our prayers are with them. This \nbill will memorialize their sacrifice and will honor the courageous \nspirit of the communities effected. Their sacrifices will never be \nforgotten.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2034\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to revise the \nage and service requirements for eligibility to receive retired pay for \nnon-regular service; to expand certain authorities to provide health \ncare benefits for Reserves and their families, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncosponsoring the National Guard and Reserves Reform Act for the 21st \nCentury.\n  I am proud of Oregon's citizen-soldiers, and I firmly believe we need \nthe Guard and Reserves more today than we have in decades. Forces of \nthe United States National Guard and Reserves make essential and \neffective contributions to Operation Iraqi Freedom and other ongoing \nmilitary operations. Oregon units have been on the vanguard of these \noperations.\n  While our dependence on the reserves has increased, their basic pay \nand benefits structure remained largely unchanged until last year. \nThrough a strong bipartisan effort Congress passed a bill to extend \nTRICARE benefits to National Guard and Reservists. We need to assure \nour military that as we continue to support their readiness \ncapabilities, we remember the personal well-being of Oregonians in \nuniform as well as that of their families.\n  This bill will improve the medical readiness of our Reserve and Guard \nforces, increase recruiting and retention, and offer faster and less \ncumbersome mobilizations. Healthier citizen-soldiers make our military \nmore effective. As we continue the war on terror, we need a healthy and \nmotivated fighting force. This legislation will work toward that end.\n  The Guard and Reserves in my State have selflessly responded to the \ncall of our country, and we cannot forget that part-time soldiers have \nfull-time health needs. In order to ensure our citizen-soldiers are \nhealthy when they are needed, I urge my Congressional colleagues to \npass this bill to continue health care coverage to our Reservists and \nGuardsmen.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2036. A bill for the relief of Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia \nAranda De Buendia, and Ana Laura Buendia Aranda; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation to \nprovide lawful permanent residence status to Jose Buendia Balderas, \nAlicia Aranda De Buendia and Ana Laura Buendia Aranda, Mexican \nnationals who live in the Fresno area of California.\n  I have decided to introduce legislation on their behalf because I \nbelieve this family is deserving of an exception.\n  Firstly, an immigration judge has granted the family relief, only to \nhave that decision overturned by the Board of Immigration Appeals. \nImmigration Judge Polly A. Webber heard that Jose Buendia and his wife, \nAlicia Aranda de Buendia, should be granted cancellations of removal \nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act. In her decision, Immigration \nJudge Webber stated that she felt that the Buendias 9-year-old son \nwould face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if the family was \ndeported from the United States.\n  The immigration judge's decision was based on testimony taken from \nJose and Alicia Buendia, as well as Alicia Buendia's sister, who is a \nlawful permanent resident. The immigration judge found that if the \nBuendia's son ``wanted to go to school in Mexico past sixth grade, he \nwould have major obstacles in being able to do so, which the Court can \nonly take as extreme hardship in terms of 2-hour transportation that \nmay or may not be available, separation from parents, perhaps having to \nlive in a strange environment with strange people, moving away from his \nrelatives in the United States . . . being subjected to substandard \nhealth care, economic instability, and poor living conditions.''\n  Unfortunately, the Board of Immigration Appeals overturned the \nimmigration judge's decision. In a one paragraph decision the Board of \nImmigration Appeals concluded ``that the respondent failed to establish \nthe required hardship to his United States citizen son, who was age 9 \nat the time of the hearing.'' That one sentence was the basis for \noverturning an immigration judge's decision.\n  Secondly, Mr. Buendia attempted to legalize his immigration status \nbut was not successful due to an unscrupulous lawyer and a \nmisinterpretation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service \nconcerning applicants eligibility to apply for legalization under the \n19876 amnesty law.\n\n[[Page S323]]\n\n  Because Mr. Buendia has been in this country for so long, he \nqualified for legalization pursuant to the Immigration and Reform \nControl Act of 1986. Unfortunately his legalization application was \nnever acted upon.\n  One reason it was not acted upon is because his attorney, Jose Velez, \nwas convicted of fraudulently submitting legalization and Special \nAgricultural Worker applications. Because of the criminal conviction, \nall of Mr. Velez's applications were suspect. Although Mr Buendia's \napplication under the legalization program was found not to contain any \nfraudulent documentation associated, here began his problems.\n  Mr. Buendia's legalization application was flagged under Operation \nDesert Deception, a large-scale investigation which targeted providers \nof fraudulent applicants and documentation under the legalization and \nSpecial Agricultural Workers program. Dozens of people, including INS \nofficers, were convicted of legalization fraud, bribery or tax evasion. \nAt the time of filing Mr. Buendia's application with the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service the attorney, Jose Velez, was under \ninvestigation.\n  Although Mr. Buendia qualified for legalization because he arrived in \nthe United States prior to January 1, 1982 he was not able to attend \nhis interview in 1990 due to the investigation into his attorney.\n  Thirdly, it took the Immigration and Naturalization Service nearly 7 \nyears to make a finding concerning his case. He was originally \nscheduled to be interviewed in June of 1990 on his application for \nlegalization. The official Memo to File by the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service determining Mr. Buendia's application contained \nno fraudulent information was not posted until January 1997.\n  Fourthly, in the intervening years another problem arose. An \ninterpretation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as to the \napplication of the law to legalization cases such as Mr. Buendia's. \nBecause Mr. Buendia departed the United States in 1987 to marry his \nwife in Mexico, the Immigration and Naturalization Service stated he \nwas no longer eligible for legalization when it again reviewed his \napplication in 1997. This issue was litigated in CSS v. Meese and Mr. \nBuendia was a class member in this lawsuit. Unfortunately this lawsuit \nprovide unhelpful to Mr. Buendia because the end result of the \nlitigation was a much more limited class of eligible applicants.\n  Finally, and of substantial importance, this family has been here for \n17 years and built a life here. The Buendias own property, are hard \nworkers, are community minded and have two children in school--one of \nwhom is a U.S. citizen.\n  Mr. Buendia is a valued employee of Bone Construction. He has been \nemployed by this cement company for the past 5 years. He has proven \nhimself, rising to become a lead foreman. His employer, Timothy Bone, \nsays Mr. Buendia is a ``reliable, hardworking and conscientious'' \nemployee.\n  Mr. Buendia has an exemplary work history. From 1981 to 1989 he \nworked for Ascension Hernandez as a landscaper in League City, TX. \nThereafter he moved to Las Vegas, NV where he continued to work in \nlandscaping. In 1990 he and his family settled in Reedly, CA where he \nbegan working in construction. Knowing nothing about construction, \nhaving a background in landscaping, Mr. Buendia was disciplined and \npersistent in his training and is now a lead foreman for a cement \nconstruction company. Mr. Buendia is such a hard worker that he even \nhas his own cement company, which he works on weekends.\n  Alicia Buendia, Jose Buendia's wife, works as a seasonal fruit \npacker. Cliff Peters, the owner of Wildwood Orchards where Alicia \nBuendia worked during the 2003 season, says she is ``a hard worker, \ndependable, and consistently did a good job.'' He added that work would \nbe available to her on an ongoing seasonal basis. Mrs. Buendia has \nworked as a seasonal fruit packer for several years.\n  Their daughter, Ana Laura, is in the 10th grade at Reedley High \nSchool where she has earned a 4.0 GPA which shows she is a highly \nmotivated student. An important consideration in this case is that Ana \nLaura was brought to the United States by her parents when she was only \n2 years old. Ana Laura, who will be 16 years old this year, has known \nno other country than the United States. She believes she is an \nAmerican. But now she is told she must return to Mexico, a country she \nhas never lived in.\n  The Buendia's son, Jose, who was born in the United States, is in 8th \ngrade. Like his sister, this is the only country he knows.\n  Ana Laura and Jose's elementary school principal speaks highly of not \nonly the children but the Buendias. This even though the children are \nnow in high school. Mary Ann Carousso, principal, says in an e-mail to \nmy office, ``I can tell you that I have rarely met 2 more active, \nconcerned, supportive parents than Alica [sic] and Jose Buendia! . . . \nI don't think they ever missed a parent club meeting.'' Principal \nCarousso also says that ``Both Jose and Alicia continued to help at our \nschool for several years after their youngest child had graduated . . . \nJose, Sr. frequently hauled chairs across a dark parking lot at 9:00 \np.m. at night following a parent club meeting . . . He often talked \nabout what parents should be doing to help the school out so that \nexcess money didn't have to be spent on simple construction projects. \nAlicia is a mom who just never says no to requests for help.'' With \nthat type of endorsement it seems to me we should be thankful to have \nsuch involved parents in our communities.\n  This family has embraced the American dream, and I believe they \nshould be allowed to continue to live in this country. If this \nlegislation is approved, the Buendias will be able to continue to make \nsignificant contributions to their community and the United States. It \nis my hope that Congress passes this private legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent numerous letters of support our office has \nreceived from members of the Reedley community be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      Bone Construction, Inc.,\n\n                                    Fresno, CA, December 16, 2003.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Thank you for responding to Jose and Alicia Buenda's tragic \n     story. Simply, in my judgment the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service has run amok in regards to Jose's \n     persistent effort to properly be granted citizenship. And, \n     consequently, he and Alicia are being treated outrageously \n     unjust and ordered to be deported from Bakersfield on \n     December 31, 2003 for no legitimate reason, leaving behind \n     their two children without parental guidance and financial \n     support. Personally, I am embarrassed by ``the system's'' \n     total disregard for the Buenda family and failure to \n     recognize their ``rights'' and exemplary citizenship. The \n     Buenda's story is a tragedy and someone should be held \n     responsible.\n       Jose has been employed with Bone Construction Inc., for the \n     past four years. He is a gentleman and model employee who has \n     earned the position of lead foreman. He and his family enjoy \n     our benefit package of health insurance and a retirement \n     plan. He possesses a valid social security number, work visa \n     and driver's license. And he has requested the appropriate \n     withholding taxes. Simply, he is self directed and a leader \n     in our organization with a very promising future.\n       Your response is urgently being anticipated. Jose has \n     turned to me for counsel. He is obviously terrified by the \n     order of deportation and does not know what to do in regards \n     to compliance.

She \n     earned approximately $10.00 per hour packing fresh fruit on a \n     piecework basis.\n       She was a hard worker, dependable, and consistently did a \n     good job. Work would be available to her on an ongoing \n     seasonal basis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Cliff Peters,\n     Owner.\n                                  ____\n\n     From: Mary Ann Carousso \n     To: \n     Date: Tuesday, January 6, 2004\n     Subject: Jose & Alicia Buendia\n       Good morning, Shelly.\n       First, here is the information you wanted on the children.\n\n       (1) Ana ``Laura'' Buendia, Grade 10, Reedley High School \n     (John Campbell, principal).\n\n\n[[Page S324]]\n\n\n     Biology with Tony Rocella\n     Drama 2 with Erin Bray\n     French 2 with Gail Hutchinson\n     PE with Pablo Saenz\n     Tutorial with Pablo Saenz\n     Video Prod. with Noe Camacho\n     English with Jennifer Moore\n     Geometry with James Rudometkin\n\n     Jose ``Alex'' Buendia, Grade 8, Grant Middle School, (Bill \n     Wachtel, principal).\n\n     Homeroom with Lynn Mann\n     Science with Eric Thiessen\n     Algebra with Lee Bull\n     Reading/Writing with Jean Crawford\n     PE with Rick Furlong\n     Computer with Kristie Bartlett\n     Academic Skills with Monica Benner\n\n       Secondly, I promised to give you some notes on the \n     conversation we had last night. Both Laura and Alex attended \n     elementary school here at Jefferson School, where I am the \n     principal. I can tell you that I have rarely met 2 more \n     active, concerned, supportive parents than Alicia and Jose \n     Buendia! As a new principal, I appreciated the eagerness that \n     Jose and Alicia demonstrated in stepping up to any matter of \n     parental involvement! Neither of them let the language \n     barrier stand in the way of their VERY ACTIVE involvement at \n     our school. I don't think they ever missed a parent club \n     meeting. Alicia was at school several days a week \n     volunteering for whatever project I needed help on. She \n     attended district level meetings as our parent representative \n     for several years. Both Jose and Alicia continued to help at \n     our school for several years after their youngest child had \n     graduated. (I used to tease them about having more children \n     so I could keep them at Jefferson forever!) Jose, Sr. \n     frequently hauled chairs across a dark parking lot at 9:00 \n     p.m. at night following a parent club meeting that had to be \n     held at our neighboring school. He often talked about what \n     parents should be doing to help the school out so that excess \n     money didn't have to be spent on simple construction \n     projects. Alicia is a mom who just never says no to requests \n     for her help. Both Ana (Laura) and Jose, Jr. (Alex) were good \n     students at Jefferson, whose teachers were always delighted \n     to see their names on their rosters at the beginning of the \n     year. I can't help but feel that, if anything, these 2 \n     extraordinary parents are being punished for simply being too \n     honest. I want VERY MUCH to help them. I have appreciated \n     TREMENDOUSLY the work of Senator Feinstein's office in \n     assisting these great folks. My letter of support is included \n     in the Buendia packet. Please let me know how I can rally \n     support for these amazing people. I owe them that at the very \n     least, for their extraordinary friendship to Jefferson \n     Elementary School.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary Ann Carousso.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2036\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator Smith \nin introducing a bill to waive all statutory time limitations so that \nColonel Rex T. Barber, of Terrebonne, OR may be posthumously awarded a \nMedal of Honor.\n  Colonel Rex T. Barber was a World War II fighter pilot who risked his \nlife to shoot down Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the Commander in Chief of \nthe Combined Japanese Fleet and architect of the attack on Pearl \nHarbor.\n  Our bill not only waives the statutory time limitations applying to \nthe Medal of Honor, but also requests that the President posthumously \naward the medal to this deserving man.\n  On April 18, 1943, Barber, then a first lieutenant in the 399th \nFighter Squadron of the South Pacific Air Forces, Army Air Corps, \nundertook a top secret mission to shoot down Yamamoto. Barber \nsuccessfully attacked a bomber transporting Yamamoto despite heavy \ncounterattacks by Japanese fighters escorting the admiral. Upon return \nto base, Barber found more than 100 holes in his aircraft. Admiral \nYamamoto's plane crashed in flames, killing Yamamoto and his crew.\n  This brave exploit of Colonel Barber is well-documented, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Oregon delegation, the \nCongress, and ultimately the President, to see that his bravery is \nformally recognized.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2039\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, \nWisconsin's dairy industry is one of the largest industries in the \nState, generating billions of dollars for the State's economy. With an \nestimated impact of $18.5 billion, milk sustains over 16,000 farm \nfamilies and nearly 200,000 jobs in the State. With thousands of dairy \nfarms and hundreds of dairy processors, the industry is vital to \ncreating and sustaining good jobs in Wisconsin. These numbers do not \ncapture the full import of the dairy industry, however. In Wisconsin, \ndairy is more than an issue of dollars and cents--it is part of our \nheritage that every Wisconsinite takes pride in.\n  America's Dairyland is already threatened by bad trade agreements, \nbut one of the worst for dairy farmers is currently in the works. U.S. \nnegotiators are trying to wrap up a trade agreement with Australia, \nwhich is expected to include new terms of trade for agricultural \ncommodities. Any agreement with Australia, and any subsequent agreement \nwith New Zealand, could have a very negative impact on Wisconsin's \ndairy industry.\n  The administration has contemplated changes to our trade laws that \nwould lay open our markets to dairy and other farm products from \nAustralia and possibly New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand milk \nproducers are among the many who have been using a trade loophole on \nmilk protein concentrates to undercut our domestic dairy prices, a \nloophole that I am working to close. Further imports from Australia can \nonly push U.S. milk prices lower.\n  This proposal comes at a time when dairy farmers are just beginning \nto think about a recovery from the low milk prices of the past few \nyears. The impact of this agreement on the Nation's dairy industry, and \nWisconsin in particular, will be significant. According to the National \nMilk Producers Federation, the flood of imports from Australia that \nwould follow from a trade agreement could cost this country nearly one-\nquarter of our dairy farms. Wisconsin has been losing dairy farms at an \nalarming rate, and we certainly cannot afford a trade agreement that \nhastens that change.\n  I have opposed the efforts of the U.S. Trade Representative to pursue \nthis agreement given its negative consequences for Wisconsin. I have \nclearly stated my position, and the position reiterated to me by dairy \nfarmers across the State, to Ambassador Zoellick. Joined by 30 of my \nState colleagues, I have called upon President Bush to respond to the \nconcerns of Americans regarding the negotiations on a free trade \nagreement with Australia. Today, along with several of my of my \ncolleagues--Senators Kohl, Craig, Stabenow, Schumer, Jeffords, Specter, \nClinton, Boxer, Collins, Dayton, Crapo, Domenici, and Snowe. I am \nsubmitting a resolution reiterating the fact that we must ensure that \nour dairy industry, especially dairy producers, will not suffer undue \nhardships if this agreement is put in place.\n  If the U.S. gives Australia significantly increased access to our \ndairy market, this will greatly undermine milk prices, thwarting \nfederal efforts to support dairy producers and their families. \nEstimates suggest that an agreement with Australia would cost this \ncountry more than 150,000 jobs that depend on a healthy U.S. dairy \nsector. Wisconsin's communities area at great risk, and I call on all \nmy colleagues to join me in working to protect the country's dairy \nindustry from an unfair trade agreement with Australia.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Wisconsin in \nsupport of this resolution. I remain deeply concerned about the \ndirection the President's negotiators are headed in the U.S.-Australia \nFree Trade negotiations.\n  I know there are lots of moving parts to this or any trade \nnegotiation. But if recent reports are correct the U.S./Australia \nnegotiations seem to be boiling down to a handful of critical issues--\namong them are dairy and drugs. Australia is angling for more access to \nour dairy markets. The Bush Administration, on behalf of pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers, is pushing for greater access to Australia's \nPharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.\n  I suspect I know who wins if the Bush administration has to make a \ntrade-off between the interests of dairy farmers and huge \npharmaceutical corporations. The Bush administration demonstrated \nremarkable loyalty to pharmaceutical manufacturers during debate on the \nMedicare bill. I suspect those loyalties are alive and well and fear \nthey may trump the interests of thousands of dairy producers and \nprocessors across the country.\n  Out of an abundance of caution, I will reserve judgment on the final \npackage until we have something more concrete to review. But the \nPresident's negotiators should be on notice that we will be closely \nfollowing these negotiations to assure that dairymen's concerns are \ngiven every consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S325-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S325-S326]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 294--DESIGNATING JANUARY 2004 AS ``NATIONAL MENTORING \n                                MONTH''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Allen, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nPryor, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dayton, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Cochran) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Kennedy \nin introducing a resolution designating January 2004 as ``National \nMentoring Month.''\n  We all agree that young people need a supportive environment based on \nstructured and trusting relationships with adults. Mentors play a \nsignificant role in many young peoples' lives by sharing their \nexperiences and providing the support and encouragement that children \nneed in order to grow into responsible, caring adults. Mentors often \nare the key to helping a young person achieve the type of future they \nmight never have thought possible.\n  A growing body of research has shown the tremendous benefits of \nmentoring. Children with mentors are shown to improve in school \nperformance and attendance; they are more self-confident; they have \ngood social skills; and above all else, they're motivated to reach \ntheir full potential. Mentoring works. Unfortunately, a severe shortage \nof volunteers has left over 15 million young people without mentors.\n  National Mentoring Month highlights the needs and goals of mentoring \nin this country. This month, non-profit organizations, schools, \nbusinesses, faith communities, and government agencies will join \ntogether to encourage adults to serve as mentors for our young people. \nPrograms must be expanded to recruit more volunteers to help fill the \nmentoring gap.

Res. 87\n\n       Whereas for more than 50 years a strategic partnership has \n     existed between the United States and Turkey that has been of \n     enormous political, economic, cultural, and strategic benefit \n     to both countries;\n       Whereas the United States and Turkey share common ideals \n     and a clear vision for the 21st century, where freedom and \n     democracy are the foundations for peace, prosperity, and \n     progress;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey has demonstrated its \n     unequivocal support for the war against terrorism throughout \n     the world, and has called for the international community to \n     unite against this threat;\n       Whereas Turkey commanded the International Security \n     Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan from June 2002 to \n     February 2003 and provided humanitarian and medical \n     assistance in Afghanistan and in Iraq;\n       Whereas in October 2003 Turkey became the first \n     predominantly Muslim state to authorize sending peacekeepers \n     to Iraq when the Turkish Parliament voted to approve a \n     deployment of 10,000 troops;\n       Whereas the people of Turkey also have been victims of \n     international attacks on November 15, 2003, and November 20, \n     2003;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey immediately condemned the \n     terrorist attacks in the strongest possible terms, detained \n     the perpetrators, and quickly brought them to justice.\n       Whereas the terrorist attacks in Turkey brought the United \n     States and Turkey closer together, in spite of the \n     terrorists' motive of driving the two countries apart;\n       Whereas the Government of Turkey has made its bases in \n     Incirlik available as a transit point for United States \n     troops returning to the United States from Iraq;\n       Whereas Prime Minister Erdogan supports a renewed effort by \n     the United Nations to reunify the divided country of Cyprus;\n       Whereas the United States supports Turkey's bid for \n     membership in the European Union;\n       Whereas Turkey and Israel, the only democracies in the \n     Middle East, established diplomatic relations in 1949, and \n     have a multi-faceted and thriving relationship; and\n       Whereas Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan brings a strong \n     message from the Turkish people that Turkey will continue to \n     support the United States campaign against international \n     terrorism as well as United States efforts to rebuild and \n     bring democracy and stability to Afghanistan and Iraq: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) offers its warmest welcome to Prime Minister Recep \n     Tayyip Erdogan upon his visit to the United States from \n     January 26 through 31, 2004;\n       (2) asks Prime Minister Erdogan to communicate the \n     continuing support of Congress and of the people of the \n     United States to the people of Turkey;\n       (3) recognizes that the visit of Prime Minister Erdogan to \n     the United States is a significant step toward broadening and \n     deepening the strategic partnership, friendship and \n     cooperation between the United States and Turkey;\n       (4) acknowledges Prime Minister Erdogan's support for \n     renewed negotiations in Cyprus; and\n       (5) thanks Prime Minister Erdogan and the people and \n     government of Turkey for--\n       (A) assuming command of the International Security \n     Assistance Force in Kabul, Afghanistan from June 2002 to \n     February 2003;\n       (B) providing humanitarian and medical assistance in \n     Afghanistan and in Iraq; and\n       (C) their willingness to contribute to international peace, \n     stability, and prosperity, especially in the greater Middle \n     East region.\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nwelcoming the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the United \nStates. Prime Minister Erdogan is visiting this week for important \nmeetings with President Bush and other senior Administration officials \nto discuss significant issues that affect both of our countries. I am \npleased that my colleagues Senator Biden and Senator Allen have joined \nme in offering this resolution at this time.\n  Prime Minister Erdogan represents a country of great importance to \nthe United States, one with whom we have a shared history of fighting \nSoviet aggression as partners in NATO, and one with whom we are joined \nin fighting terrorism today. Turkey has shown its willingness to \nsupport American objectives in Afghanistan--where it commanded the \nInternational Security Assistance Force for seven months, and where its \nsoldiers continue to serve side-by-side with American troops--and in \npost-war Iraq, where it has authorized sending peacekeeping troops and \nhas contributed humanitarian supplies for the Iraqi people.\n  Furthermore, Turkey shares our democratic values and love of freedom. \nThese ideals have brought enormous benefits to its people and serve as \nan excellent example for its neighbors that secular Islam and democracy \ncan coexist peacefully and constructively.\n  I am confident that the visit of Prime Minister Erdogan will further \ncement the strategic partnership between Turkey and the United States. \nI welcome him to the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S326-2", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S326-S327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                subcommittee on public lands and forests\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Voinovich, Ted Stevens, Lamar \n           Alexander, Lindsey O. Graham.\n  Mr. FRIST. I now ask consent that the mandatory quorum be waived and \nthat the vote on the motion to invoke cloture occur at 5:45 on Monday, \nFebruary 2.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me just \nsay that I am disappointed we are not going to move forward on the bill \nMonday. That is very valuable time. We are not going to have a lot of \ntime to finish this bill. This is a bipartisan bill. This is my fourth \nhighway bill, third or fourth highway bill, and this is a most fair \nbill. We have every State that will get at least 95 percent of the \nmoney they pay in. Every State gets an increase of what they have \ngotten in the last bill. It is fair.\n  In the past, some States did extremely well and some States did \npoorly. Take the States of California and Texas, for example. At the \nend of this bill they will get 95 percent of the money they pay in. \nThat is very costly. Therefore, that being the case, and it certainly \nseems fair to me that they should get 95 percent of what they pay in, \ntheir 5 percent that they are not getting pays for a lot of the States \nthat do not have many people. These are bridge States. They still have \nthe interstate going through them and there is a lot for maintenance.\n  The bill is far from perfect. We have done the best we can to try to \nmake it a better bill than those in the past. We need to get to it. \nThis is an extremely important bill. This is not a bill for the \nDemocrats or a bill for the Republicans. It is a bill that will allow \nthe construction to go forward on highways and transit for the next 5 \nor 6 years.\n  The reason that is important, we can come back and do a 1-year bill \nlike we did last year. But there is no way--and the Presiding Officer \nwas a Governor of a very large and important State--there is no ability \nto plan with a 1-year program.\n  I hope we can get this done. It is important to every State in the \nUnion. I know some people are not happy with what is in the bill. We \nhave done the best we can; if everyone wants their dollars back, we \ncannot. We will find a lot of States that will not be very happy. If we \nwant everyone to get the average, there is no average.\n  We are happy to work with every State and are doing better than we \nhad done in the bill. But the allocation will not be changed. It was \ndone with a computer. The information was fed into the computer. It \nwould be extremely difficult to start all over again and come up with a \nnew allocation, especially in a timeframe when we will have to work on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments by the \nassistant Democratic leader. It is absolutely critical we get to this \nbill. I suspect this cloture vote on Monday will be overwhelming, \nprobably 95 to 5 or 98 to 2 or 99 to 1. Maybe everybody will vote for \nit. But what it does, from a scheduling standpoint, on a bill that \ndeserves debate, as good a bill as it is--and it is the most fair bill \nit could possibly be, as we have just heard it described--there is \ngoing to be debate. I think both the assistant Democratic leader and \nmyself, and the leadership on both sides of the aisle, have agreed to \nbring this bill to the floor at the earliest possible date.\n  I am disappointed because I literally said 3 months ago we were going \nto go\n\n[[Page S329]]\n\nto the highway bill on Monday, and that we were going to spend the \nappropriate amount of time on it, that people would be able to debate \nand amend it as necessary. A few people, for whatever reason--maybe \nsome good reasons--are going to set us back. It sets the overall agenda \nof the Senate back. And what, in effect, it does is it causes us to \nlose a day when we were going to have debate only. We were not going to \nhave amendments on Monday but, in effect, we lose the opportunity to \nstart on a very important bill.\n  I mention that now because it is early in the second session of this \nCongress, and we have to have cooperation. I plead with our Members to \nhave cooperation so we can do what this body does best, and that is to \ndebate, bring bills to the floor and debate them, and vote them up, \nvote them down, defeat them, pass them. It is inevitable we will get \nthere.\n  People are going to watch what the vote is going to be Monday night. \nIt will be overwhelming. And I am not pointing just my finger at the \nperson who objected because he is really speaking for, probably, a \ncouple other people as well, but we have to proceed with this bill. It \nis an important bill.\n  Leadership on both sides of the aisle has said that we are going to \nspend an appropriate amount of time on this bill. So people have some \nidea, it could be a week, and it could be as long as 2 weeks, but we \nhave to get to the bill. Then we can bring amendments up and debate \nthem.\n  Mr. REID. Will the distinguished leader yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I will make a suggestion. After the vote is completed, it \nwill be approximately--let's see, what time are we going to vote?\n  Mr. FRIST. At 5:45.\n  Mr. REID. So starting at 6:15 on Monday maybe the two subcommittee \nleaders and the two full committee leaders could begin their \nstatements, and then we could go right to the meat of the bill on \nTuesday. I would certainly recommend we try to get Senators Inhofe, \nJeffords, Bond, and Reid to get their statements out of the way Monday \nnight, and then go to the bill Tuesday. That way we will not have lost \nany time except a little time of the staff.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think we should encourage that proposal. \nAgain, the whole purpose is to get the bill to the floor, and to debate \nit and appropriately amend it and do what we all want to do to support \nappropriately the infrastructure that is very much the foundation upon \nwhich our economy works day in and day out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/01/28/senate-section/article/S329-1", "month": "01", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S329]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JANUARY 29, 2004 AND MONDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 2004\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
