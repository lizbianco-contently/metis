Mr. President, following my remarks and the remarks of the \nDemocratic leader, we will proceed to a period for morning business for \n90 minutes. The first 45 minutes will be under the control of the \nmajority and the second half under the control of the minority. \nFollowing that time, the Senate will proceed to executive session for \nthe consideration of Porter Goss to be Director of Central \nIntelligence. The agreement we reached last night allows for up to 6 \nhours equally divided for debate on the Goss nomination. The discussion \nthe leaders were just having was that we want to make as much time \navailable to everyone who would like to speak, but in the event we do \nnot need all of that time, that would be yielded back and we would be \nable to proceed to a vote on that nomination. Again, we have up to 6 \nhours, but I expect time will be yielded back.\n  Today we do have a briefing for Senators regarding Iraq this \nafternoon from 3 to 4. Before that briefing, we will be able to set the \nvote. I am sure even later this morning we will be able to announce the \ntime we will be voting later today.\n  We are also continuing to negotiate agreements on some of the \nremaining appropriation bills. I hope we can agree to a consent to \nallow us to consider the spending bills with a reasonable time \nlimitation. If so, we will be able to follow the Goss nomination with \nthat. I suspect that will be tomorrow morning.\n  We have the expiring family-friendly tax items and we want to \nconsider that legislation as soon as it becomes available. I understand \nthat progress is being made. It will be important for us to vote on \nthat this week. In the event that is Friday morning, that will have to \nbe Friday morning, but I do want to encourage the conferees, who I \nthink are very close to reporting out that legislation, so that the \nHouse of Representatives can consider it and we can consider it. We \nwill be voting on that this week, either Friday or, if it is available, \nThursday night. Obviously, I encourage the latter.\n  I remind my colleagues of the joint meeting tomorrow morning at 10 \nwith Prime Minister Allawi of Iraq. He will be addressing both Houses \non Thursday. Members should be in the Senate Chamber no later than 9:30 \nin order to proceed to that joint meeting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9471-7", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9471-S9472]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NOMINATION OF PORTER GOSS TO BE CIA DIRECTOR\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes to comment on \nRepresentative Porter Goss' nomination to the post of Director of the \nCIA, as well as to comment on the real progress the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee is making as we address the issues of the 9/11 \nrecommendations.\n  With regard to the former, I congratulate the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. One of the reasons I do not think there will be as much \ndebate on the floor today is that they very thoroughly addressed the \nnomination with\n\n[[Page S9472]]\n\nvery good debate in committee and reported him out of that committee \nwith an overwhelmingly positive vote.\n  Mr. Goss is a highly capable manager and leader, with a strong \nbackground and extensive experience in intelligence matters. As we all \nknow, he served in the Congress representing the people of southwest \nFlorida for the past 15 years. He has a long history of public service, \nwhich I am sure will be outlined on the floor later. He served as mayor \nof Sanibel Island. In 1983, he was appointed to the Lee County Board of \nCommissioners by then Governor Bob Graham. Porter Goss has a long \ncareer that has, of course, extended these last 15 years as a House \nMember where he held the chairmanship of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  As chairman, he led one of the key investigations into possible \nintelligence failures regarding 9/11. He was thorough. He demonstrated \na thoughtful and fair approach in these hearings and investigations. \nHis committee's findings did add critical insights into how we can and \nshould move forward to strengthen our defenses against terrorist \nattack.\n  So far, his committee, including the subcommittees, has held over \n60--I think it was 62--oversight hearings on various aspects of the \nintelligence community. That number is more than the committee has held \nin any other calendar year. I use that as an example to show that Mr. \nGoss takes his duty to investigate and reform the intelligence \ncommunity very seriously.\n  Despite this, he did come under some harsh criticism from the other \nside. It has been charged that he has been too partisan in his career \nas a Congressman to take over this very important post. I do believe, \nhowever, that if one looks at his record of service to this country, \nthat that criticism falls by the wayside.\n  Porter Goss has specific experience working for the Agency he is now \nnominated to run. During the Cold War, Mr. Goss was a clandestine \nservices case officer. He served as director of operations. In his own \nwords, the CIA's mission ``is to obtain the plans and intentions of our \nenemies, adversaries and their associates before they could attack the \nUnited States.''\n  Mr. Goss articulated so clearly and succinctly how this has occurred \nand will occur, and states very clearly indeed this mission has not \nchanged and will not change.\n  Mr. Goss understands the criticism now being leveled at him. As he \ntold the Senate Intelligence Committee, he is sensitive to it; he \nunderstands the grave responsibility of leading the CIA and effecting \nthe necessary reforms to strengthen our Nation's security. As he \nhimself explains, being the Director of the CIA is a capabilities job, \nnot a policy job.\n  There is no doubt that Porter Goss--former CIA agent, former U.S. \nArmy intelligence agent, Congressman, and public servant--is totally \ncommitted to the safety and security of America. He is committed to \nmaking the CIA run effectively. He has both the inside and the outside \nperspective we need. Clearly, Mr. Goss is the man for the job. I urge \nmy colleagues to give him their overwhelming support when we vote on \nthis nomination today. He is an outstanding choice to lead this agency.\n  I do hope we do not have a shift in conversation, which should be \nabout his eminent qualifications, to distracting other issues. I do \nhope we focus on the man and the job for which he is being nominated.\n\n\n                          Intelligence Reform\n\n  Let me also close in saying we made real progress on the intelligence \nreform front. I know there are a lot of people who say slow down or \ndon't have knee-jerk reactions or don't go too fast or it is a huge \nissue. I think the leadership is very sensitive to that. I wish to \nreassure our colleagues and the American people and the other House--\nreally everyone--that we are addressing this as a huge issue, as big as \nany issue we have had to address in recent times, because it does focus \non the safety and security of the American people.\n  There is a sense of urgency that this body has a responsibility to \nreflect. If there is a better system, if there is a better way to \nguarantee the safety and security of Americans, and we know it--and we \ndo know it--then it is our responsibility to act and to do it \nthoughtfully and deliberately, and that is the process that the \nDemocratic leader and I set up in which to address the two important \nissues.\n  Senator Susan Collins and Senator Joe Lieberman, who are managing the \ninitial legislation through the Governmental Affairs Committee, have \nvery carefully, and are very carefully, considering all the \ninformation. They have been doing so for a long period of time, most \nacutely since the day the 9/11 Commission report and recommendations \ncame out. They made great progress in marking up this legislation \nyesterday and will continue on that over the course of the day. That is \nexactly the task Senator Daschle and I set out for them in late July, \nto have the vehicle through which all the ideas, thoughts, and \ndeliberations can be collected, understanding there are lots of very \ngood ideas out there. But it is an important vehicle, an important \nbill, and one we will be addressing on the floor of the Senate next \nweek.\n  The committee's baseline legislation does create a national \nintelligence director. It does establish a national counterterrorism \ncenter, which has the responsibilities which have been well defined in \nthe legislation. It does implement a whole range of initiatives to \nimprove the quality and effectiveness of the intelligence community. It \ndoes track closely with the plans and decisions put forward by many \nbodies, including proposals put forth by the White House, which has \nembraced the major conclusions of the 9/11 Commission.\n\n  I do hope, once this bill is completed in the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, people take the time to look at it very quickly and look at \npossible amendments over the course of the end of this week so they \nwill be prepared for next week in terms of amendments they might put \nforward, so we, over the course of the deliberations, can improve that \nbill appropriately where people think it needs to be improved.\n  Just one final comment: Senator Daschle and I established a \nbipartisan task force to address the issues that look at how we need to \nreorganize in this body, so that our responsibility of oversight can be \nappropriately carried out. That task force has met on a number of \noccasions, at the Member level and at the staff level. Senators \nMcConnell and Reid, the managers of this effort who represent the \nleadership on that task force, have been discussing this matter, as I \nunderstand it, daily.\n  There are a number of issues on which we can come to agreement \nrelatively quickly. Others will have to be resolved through floor \ndebate and votes. That just remains to be determined, once we see what \nthose recommendations are. Either way these reforms will be implemented \nthrough Senate resolution or through modification of the Senate's \nrules. My goal remains to get these reforms in motion before the Senate \nadjourns next month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks made by the majority leader with regard to the progress we have \nmade on both fronts, both the reorganization of the executive branch as \nwell as the reorganization of the legislative branch with regard to the \n9/11 recommendations. I think both efforts have been laudable, they \nhave been bipartisan, and they have been cooperative.\n  I don't think that being deliberate and being expeditious is a \nmutually exclusive proposition. We have to be deliberate but I don't \nsee any reason why we can't also be expeditious.\n  Three very important commissions have analyzed and advised over the \ncourse of the last 3 years. It is not as if this came up within the \nlast couple of weeks. It has been under consideration and very \nthoughtfully and carefully considered. I found it somewhat remarkable \nthat all three commissions had many of the same recommendations to the \nCongress.\n  So this is in keeping with those experts who have very thoughtfully \nand carefully deliberated about this matter. We are simply continuing \nin that deliberative fashion, first in the committee and then on the \ntask force. I am hopeful we can continue to be both deliberate as well \nas expeditious as we\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nconsider our responsibilities before the end of this session of \nCongress.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  During the Democratic period this morning, I ask unanimous consent \nthat Senator Kennedy be given 10 minutes; Senator Murray, 5 minutes; \nSenator Conrad, 25 minutes; and Senator Reid, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, recently, a new study confirmed a trend \nthat most American families and businesses have known and felt for the \npast 3 years. Health care costs are rising at unsustainable rates, \nstraining family budgets, weakening our economy, hampering job growth \nand forcing millions more Americans every year to go without insurance.\n  According to the annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, \nhealth premiums increased 11.2 percent last year, more than five times \nthe rate of wages. This is the fourth consecutive year of double-digit \nincreases. Since 2000, health care premiums have increased by 59 \npercent and 5 million fewer Americans have access to employer health \ncare coverage.\n  Last month the Census Bureau also reported that in 2003 alone, the \nnumber of uninsured Americans jumped by 1.4 million. Seniors are among \nthe hardest hit. In addition to facing record increases in the price of \nprescription drugs, Medicare recipients recently learned they will be \nforced to pay a 17.5 percent increase in premiums, the steepest \nincrease in Medicare's history.\n  The true costs of this crisis can't be depicted by statistics. There \nis no way to measure the stress caused by exorbitant health care bills. \nThere is no way to measure the cost of the fear of families who worry \nthat they are one layoff, one bad crop, one accident, or one illness \naway from being totally vulnerable, and they fell helpless to protect \nthemselves.\n  Not long ago, I heard from the Imm family of Turton, SD. A few months \nback, their 24-year-old son, Monte, came down with a case of Crohn's \ndisease.\n  As his disease grew worse, he couldn't work and he had to quit his \njob. After his insurance lapsed, he tried to buy coverage for himself, \nbut with his condition, no insurer would offer him a policy.\n  Monte's monthly prescription bill is $500, and that is on top of the \ntests and emergency room visits that have become all too routine.\n  Doctors in Sioux Falls have recommended a trip to the Mayo Clinic, \nbut the clinic requires a $1,500 deposit just to see Monte. The total \ncost will be much, much higher. Monte's parents are trying to help and \nare reaching into their retirement savings to do so. But Monte's health \ncare costs will surpass $10,000 this year alone, and without good \ninsurance, eventually the medical bills will eat up all they have \nworked for.\n  Millions of American families are in the same position as the Imm \nfamily, and the implications of this crisis are rippling outward \nthroughout our country.\n  There is new evidence that as the cost of health care goes up, it is \neating away at America's economy, holding back job creation, and \nstifling growth. A recent article in the New York Times showed that the \ncost of health insurance is preventing businesses, large and small, \nfrom hiring new workers, even if the workload demands it.\n\n  One small business owner said:\n\n       Before, we hired based on workload. Now it's a question of \n     affordability.\n\n  Economists are finding that high health care costs are a major reason \nour economy has been unable to create jobs. Not long ago, when I asked \na businessman why he outsources his jobs overseas, he said the reason \nwas health care. He did not have to pay it in India. He did not have to \npay it in countries abroad. He pays it here at home.\n  Small businesses, which employ 50 percent of the Nation's workforce, \nface the greatest pressure of all. Because they are not big enough to \nbargain with insurers for better rates, and they cannot spread risk \namong larger pools of employees, small businesses too often are forced \nto pay for the nationwide increase in health care costs.\n  In the past year, in the midst of the toughest business environment \nin a generation, the total cost for insuring employees of small \nbusinesses alone rose 18 percent. Those small businesses that try to do \nthe right thing and offer their employees health benefits are finding \nit more difficult to do so with each passing year.\n  I was recently contacted by Skip VanDerhule, who runs VanDerhule \nMoving and Storage, in Yankton. Even after raising employee premiums \nand copays, Skip's monthly premiums have risen 252 percent in 6 years. \nSkip has tried to look for better coverage, but recently an employee \nneeded a kidney transplant, and he requires $30,000 per year in \nmedicine alone just to keep his body from rejecting the new kidney. \n``As soon as the insurer sees that,'' Skip said, ``they don't want us. \nAnd they'll quote us a price to make sure that we don't want them.'' So \nSkip is stuck with the prospect of higher health care costs with \nabsolutely no end in sight.\n  In most businesses, the costs are passed along to their employees. \nJana Schroeder, a medical professional from Sioux Falls, wrote me to \nsay that even with good, dependable health insurance, her family pays \n$10,000 a year in health care costs.\n  A recent, routine mammogram cost $2,700, of which she was asked to \npay $850. She said:\n\n       I guess I should feel lucky I have insurance, but $848 is a \n     full paycheck [for me]. So, do you pay that medical bill or \n     the house payment? I surely can't pay it all at once.\n\n  Even with 100,000 Americans losing their health insurance every month \nsince January of 2001, the White House has not provided any real \noptions, no leadership in stopping the growth of this crisis.\n  Some of the most promising possibilities for bringing down the cost \nof health care, such as drug reimportation, the administration has \nopposed. Yet this crisis will not solve itself. Unless we act, health \ncare premiums will continue to rise, driving more people into the ranks \nof the uninsured, and holding back more businesses from earning profits \nand creating jobs.\n  We have to do better. This is a national problem, and fixing it \ndemands national leadership. Medical research is producing miracles \nquite often. Yet we are not solving a problem that is dragging tens of \nmillions of Americans into poverty and poor health. This is not a \nquestion of ability or capacity; it is a question of will and \nleadership. It is time we seek out new ideas to help bring down the \ncost of health care.\n\n  One promising new initiative would create a reinsurance system to \nhelp blunt the cost of catastrophic medical illness. Some researchers \nhave suggested that such a program could save South Dakota employers \ntens of millions of dollars each year and billions nationwide.\n  We need to debate these issues in Washington, but, regrettably, we \nhave not had the opportunity to do so. In the past 2 years, we have \nspent 30 days discussing ways to limit access to the courtroom, but not \n1 day to debate real ways to bring down the cost of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  It is time for real action. We have an obligation to focus on the \ntroubles of our economy and the Americans who are struggling to work \nand raise families. Our citizens are asking for leadership, and we have \nan obligation to answer that call.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9473-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the failure of the \nUnited Nations. The U.N. is failing to promote liberty, democracy, and \nhuman rights for all citizens.\n  The world has changed a great deal since the United Nations was \nformed some 59 years ago. The dangers of Nazism and communism have been \nreplaced by an ever-evolving, ever-increasing threat of terrorism.\n  The United Nations is not up to the challenges of this new century. \nThe U.N. now has sponsors of terrorism and repression overseeing the \nprotection of human rights around the world. The countries of Sudan, \nChina, and Cuba currently serve as members of the United Nations \nCommission on Human Rights.\n  Yesterday, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, lectured \nthe world body that the rule of law in Iraq is being disrupted as much \nby the United States as by the terrorists who ravage the country \nthrough bombings and beheadings.\n  Any person or group who cannot decipher the moral difference in this \nstruggle against terror and repression cannot and should not be trusted \nto lead. In a BBC interview last week, the Secretary General stated \nthat the liberation of Iraq by the United States and its coalition \npartners was illegal and a violation of the U.N. Charter. This \ndeclaration comes on the heels of his earlier statement that ``there \nshould have been a second resolution'' authorizing the invasion.\n  Today, Mr. Annan seems to be saying that the only way force can be \nused legitimately in the modern world is to first obtain the unanimous \npermission of the U.N. Security Council.\n  I am pleased President Bush does not adhere to this line of thinking. \nAnd I am proud every time I hear him say that he will never wait for \npermission to defend the United States.\n  The Secretary General's latest posturing is far from harmless. The \nU.N. has been given the lead role in organizing the elections in Iraq \nin January. But Mr. Annan's comments that we have acted illegally in \nIraq, comments which have been replayed across the Arab world, have \ngiven an added feeling of legitimacy to every jihadist hoping to \ndisrupt the vote.\n  I believe the U.N. has lost its way. It has ceased to be able to \njudge the difference between right and wrong. The Secretary General's \nspeech to the General Assembly yesterday illustrated his belief that \nthere is a moral equivalence between the terrorists and those who are \nfighting them. That is disturbing, and that is wrong.\n  However, the Secretary General is not alone in expressing it. It is \nextremely disturbing that a former United Nations official, Anna Di \nLellio, has been named as the Director of Communications for the \nVolcker panel, a supposedly independent panel investigating the Oil For \nFood scandal. Why is this so disturbing? Because Ms. Di Lellio has \ncompared President Bush and key U.S. ally, Prime Minister Silvio \nBerlusconi, to Osama bin Laden. This shows, again, how the United \nNations is failing in the essential tasks for which it is responsible.\n  There is a difference between right and wrong. And words do have \nconsequences.\n  I also want to read a quote the Democratic nominee made yesterday. It \nis in the Washington Post today. It says:\n\n       Kerry did not directly answer a question about whether he \n     agrees with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who called the \n     Iraq war illegal. ``I don't know what the law or legalities \n     are,'' Kerry said.\n\n  The U.N. Secretary General says the Iraq war is illegal because the \nUnited States didn't have United Nations' Security Council approval.\n  And John Kerry can't give a clear answer that the United Nations \nSecretary General is wrong? This is a person running for the President \nof the United States.\n  Increasingly, the United Nations does not advocate the interests of \nthose pursuing peace, freedom, and democracy in the world. If the \nUnited Nations spent more time working for liberty and less time \ncoddling dictators, the world would be a better place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to help frame the issue in \nIraq. The American people deserve straight forward answers on issues of \nwar and national security; especially when their lives are directly \nthreatened and our military forces are engaged around the world in the \nwar on terrorism. And it is not just our military forces that are at \nrisk; our diplomats, intelligence professionals, and ordinary civilians \nworking in war zones all face enormous danger from a very treacherous \nand barbaric enemy.\n  The recent, brutally grotesque beheadings of innocent Americans \nEugene Armstrong on Monday and Jack Hensley yesterday are just two of \nmany examples of the kind of evil that we face and why it must be \neradicated.\n  Ambiguity is something we probably should expect in a heated \npolitical campaign, but anything less than total candor on national \nsecurity issues is not acceptable.\n  The junior senator form Massachusetts has accused President Bush of \n``colossal failures of judgment'' on his plan for Iraq. He then went on \nto lay out his own four-point plan for handling the conflict in Iraq. \nHis four points were, No. 1, to get more help from other nations; No. \n2, provide better training for Iraqi security forces; No. 3, provide \nbenefits to the Iraqi people; and No. 4, ensure democratic elections \ncan be held next year as promised.\n  I have no problem with this plan, because it is the short term and \nlong term plan now in place by the Bush administration. Our President \nhas consistently and assiduously worked with our allies to get more \nhelp in Iraq.\n  Sure, we would like to get more countries on board with us, but this \nis tough business and it takes bold, visionary leadership--like we see \nin Great Britain, Italy, Poland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Australia, \nand dozens of our closest allies. To imply, as some of my colleagues \nhave, that the United States is not getting help from our international \nfriends is simply untrue. As terrorism spreads to other countries, as \nit did recently in Russia, we should expect--and provide--even more \nhelp.\n  And let me point out the obvious about some allies, like France, who \nhave not been supportive of our policies in Iraq. Their foreign policy \ndecisions are based on internal political considerations and not on the \npersonality of the President of the United States. For some of my \ncolleagues to imply that some countries will change their policies \ntoward Iraq if we change our President is ludicrous and misleading. The \nFrench will change their foreign policy when they change their \nPresident, not when we change ours. I have a great deal of trust and \nconfidence in the common sense of the American people and I am sure \nthey will understand exactly what I am saying.\n  The junior Senator from Massachusetts has also called for better \ntraining for Iraqi security forces. I am glad that he also agrees with \nPresident Bush on this point. Training Iraqi security forces is a high \npriority of this administration.\n  Let us look at the facts. The Iraqi Army has more than 62,000 \nmembers. Of these, almost 46,000 have been trained and another 16,000 \nare currently in training. All 27 battalions of the Iraqi Army will be \noperational by January 2005.\n  Speaking at New York University recently, the Democratic Presidential \ncandidate said, ``Of the 35,000 police now in uniform, not one, not \none, has completed a 24-week field training program.'' Just yesterday, \nhowever, The Washington Post reported that the head of strategic plans \nand policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Lt. Gen. Walter Sharp, said \nthat Kerry's accusation was just not accurate. According to Gen. Sharp, \nwho is in a position to know, basic training for new Iraqi police \nofficers is eight weeks, followed by 26 weeks of ``on-the-job'' field \ntraining. The Post article went on to say that Gen. Casey, the top U.S. \ncommander in Iraq, estimates that Iraqi security forces will be in \n`local control' of the majority of Iraq by the end of December, which \nis just 3 months away. Gen. Casey defined `local control' as a \ncombination of having Iraqi security forces in place, plus an \nassessment of the ability of local political leaders to govern\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\nand to manage economic reconstruction efforts.\n  Others have criticized the President for not getting NATO involved in \nIraq. Too bad they didn't read yesterday's London Financial Times. If \nthey had, they would have read that, ``NATO is close to a deal to \nestablish a military training academy in Iraq. The academy, which would \nhave a staff of about 300, is intended to give substance to a decision \nby a NATO summit in June to provide training to the war-torn country as \nit seeks to build up its institutions.'' I hasten to add, that this \nNATO initiative was put forward by our President. So getting NATO \ninvolved is another area where the Democratic Presidential candidate \nagrees with the administration's policy in Iraq. Let me also add that \n15 of 26 NATO member states are sharing the military burden on the \nground with us in Iraq.\n  Charles Colton's famous quotation, ``Imitation is the sincerest of \nflattery,'' certainly applies to my colleague, Mr. Kerry. His four-\npoint plan is not new and it certainly is not original. A careful \nreview of President Bush's policies in Iraq clearly shows that the \nadministration has been implementing all the points addressed by \nSenator Kerry well before he even articulated them.\n  We need to judge the President's policy in Iraq, not by the rhetoric \nof his detractors, but by those who know the facts. Tomorrow, the \nCongress will welcome, in Joint-Session, the interim Prime Minister of \nIraq, Dr. Allawi. Let us hear from him how things are going in Iraq. \nLet us listen to him to find out what the Iraqi people think of our \npolicies and programs for restoring security and getting the Iraqi \neconomy going.\n  Let me close by quoting from President Bush's speech, which he gave \nat the UN yesterday. I believe it clearly shows why we are in Iraq, \nsomething that others do not seem to grasp. The President said:\n\n       Our security is not merely found in spheres of influence, \n     or some balance of power. The security of our world is found \n     in the advancing rights of mankind. These rights are \n     advancing across the world--and across the world, the enemies \n     of human rights are responding with violence. Terrorists and \n     their allies believe the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights and the American Bill of Rights, and every charter of \n     liberty ever written, are lies, to be burned and destroyed \n     and forgotten.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We are determined to destroy terror networks wherever they \n     operate, and the United States is grateful to every nation \n     that is helping to seize terrorist assets, track down their \n     operatives, and disrupt their plans.\n\n  The Acting Secretary of the Army, Les Brownlee, has eloquently framed \nwhy Iraq is important in the war on terrorism when he said:\n\n       This is not simply a fight against terror--terror is a \n     tactic. This is not simply a fight against al Qaeda, its \n     affiliates and adherents--they are foot soldiers. This is not \n     simply a fight to bring democracy to the Middle East--that is \n     a strategic objective. This is a fight for the very ideas at \n     the foundation of our society, the way of life those ideas \n     enable, and the freedoms we enjoy.\n\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is said that politics is the art of \nthe possible. And while certain things are simply not possible, it is \nour duty to try all the same.\n  So today, I will try to explain the unexplainable. The distinguished \njunior Senator from Massachusetts has made so many statements on this \ncountry's involvement in Iraq that he has taken every conceivable \nposition possible, and many that are simply not possible. The result is \na record of ``dizzying contradictions,'' as Charles Krauthammer \nrecently wrote, so confusing that the more he speaks, the less we \nunderstand.\n  Mr. President, John Kerry has spoken on so many aspects of the \nliberation of Iraq. He has been on both sides of just about every coin \nin this entire debate. I want to address just four different positions \nhe has taken.\n  What is more disturbing is that he has taken these four positions on \nthe most basic question of the liberation of that country. The question \nis not nearly as difficult as the multiple answers we continue to get.\n  The question is: Would you have used force to remove Saddam Hussein?\n  Back in 2002, the answer was clear enough. Citing Saddam Hussein's \nuse of weapons of mass destruction, his terrorist-like actions, and the \nfact that he was part of a global scourge of terrorism, Senator Kerry \nsaid he completely agreed with the President to effect regime change in \nIraq, unilaterally if necessary. So he voted for the Iraq war \nresolution in October of 2002. Support in October of 2002.\n  Nine months later, Senator Kerry started to use another answer. He \nnow claimed that the war resolution he supported in October 2002 did \nnot empower the President to engage in regime change.\n  By January of 2004, around the time of the Iowa caucuses, Senator \nKerry had a new position. He was now the ``antiwar candidate.'' In \nJanuary of 2004, he was now the antiwar candidate, campaigning in the \nIowa caucuses, having been, in October 2002, entirely supportive of the \nwar.\n  He then went on to lock up the Democratic nomination for President. \nSo we are into the general election season, Mr. President. When \nchallenged by the President to answer whether he would have gone into \nIraq and removed Saddam Hussein based on what we now know, Kerry stood \non the edge of the Grand Canyon--a dramatic pose facing the Grand \nCanyon--and said on August 11:\n\n       Yes, I would have voted for that authority.\n\n  In August of 2004, in the general election, he seems to be back where \nhe was in October of 2002. He has gone from support to oppose and back \nto support.\n  But that was last month. A week ago, on the ``Imus in the Morning'' \nshow, Senator Kerry was asked:\n\n       Do you think there are any circumstances we should have \n     gone to war in Iraq?\n\n  That is a pretty simple question. Here was Senator Kerry's response:\n\n       Not under the current circumstances, no. There are none \n     that I see.\n\n  This was last week. A month ago, he was in support of the war, but \nlast week he was back in opposition to the war. He says:\n\n       I voted based on weapons of mass destruction. The President \n     distorted that, and I've said that. I mean, look, I can't be \n     clearer. But I think it was the right vote based on what \n     Saddam Hussein had done, and I think it was the right thing \n     to do to hold him accountable. I've said a hundred times, \n     there was a right way to do it and a wrong way to do it. The \n     President chose the wrong way. Can't be more direct than \n     that.\n\n  Let's try this one more time. Senator Kerry, on the ``Imus'' show \nlast week, said, in answer to the question:\n\n       Do you think there are any circumstances we should have \n     gone to war in Iraq?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Not under the current circumstances, no. There are none \n     that I see. I voted based on weapons of mass destruction. The \n     President distorted that, and I've said that. I mean, look, I \n     can't be clearer. But I think it was the right vote based on \n     what Saddam Hussein had done, and I think it was the right \n     thing to do to hold him accountable. I've said a hundred \n     times, there was a right way to do it and a wrong way to do \n     it. The President chose the wrong way. Can't be more direct \n     than that.\n\n  When Kerry finished his interview with Imus, here is what Imus had to \nsay about it. Don Imus said:\n\n       I asked him a number of questions about Iraq and I can't \n     tell you what he said.\n\n  That was Don Imus' summary of John Kerry's position on Iraq on his \nprogram last week.\n  Well, Mr. Imus, you are not alone. The top ranking Democrat on the \nForeign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, recently stated:\n\n       I don't think John should go back and try to explain \n     accurate statements that are unexplainable.\n\n  That is our colleague in the Senate, an enthusiastic supporter of \nSenator Kerry. He said why try to explain the unexplainable, referring \nto Senator Kerry's various positions on Iraq.\n  We could all use clarity from John Kerry with regard to Iraq's \nliberation, but none more than Prime Minister Ayad Allawi, who will be \nhere among us addressing Congress tomorrow morning. Dealing with the \nterrorists and Baathist insurgents, he needs, more than anyone, to know \nthat the U.S. position of supporting the liberty of Iraq is clear, \nunequivocal, and steadfast. He would not get that from reading John \nKerry's numerous positions.\n  Mr. President, a Senator's position on Iraq should not be all that \nhard to explain because it is not a complicated question. It is, \nhowever, a tough question, representative of the sort of tough issue \nany Commander in Chief\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\nfrequently gets. In trying to answer and re-answer the most important \nissue of this election, central to the struggle for freedom today and \ntomorrow, we have a Presidential candidate who constantly changes his \nmind. This is not some little issue; this is the biggest issue \nconfronting the country today. We are 6 weeks from the election, and \nthis is a man who flip-flops like a fish on the deck of a boat, back \nand forth, back and forth, who doesn't know where he stands on the most \nimportant issue we are confronting in our era.\n  For example, when asked if he would have gone into Iraq to remove \nSaddam Hussein, Kerry recently answered:\n\n       You bet, we might have.\n\n  Let me read that one more time. When asked if he would have gone into \nIraq to remove Saddam Hussein, Kerry recently said:\n\n       You bet, we might have.\n\n  Not exactly Winston Churchill. Perhaps there is some nuance here, \nsuch as an exclamation point or a question mark, that tells whether \nthis is a declaration or a question, but the answer to the most \ncritical issue in this election should not leave the world wondering \nand more confused than before.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, so many States have been devastated this \nhurricane season. My own home State of North Carolina has been ravaged \nby the effects of not one, but four hurricanes in the last few weeks.\n  Most recently, western North Carolina suffered extensive damage \ncaused by the torrential wind and rain of Hurricane Ivan. Initial \nestimates from the storm's destruction in Buncombe County alone are \nalready topping $100 million. Sadly, this same county had already \nprojected that exact amount in damages following Hurricane Frances.\n  Counties in western North Carolina had barely begun to recover from \nthe flooding of Frances before Ivan roared through town late last week. \nThe death toll from the storm, so far, is 10 people. In the town of \nHenderson, a man and his wife were sleeping soundly when a huge tree \ncrashed through their house into their bedroom. The husband was pinned \nbeneath the fallen tree, which ultimately took his life as the home had \nto be stabilized before the tree could be removed. In the Peeks Creek \ncommunity in southern Macon County, a landslide sent homes crashing \nagainst each other, killing at least four people, including an unborn \nchild whose mother was forced to have a leg amputated and remains in \ncritical condition.\n  Houses have literally been washed away, and some left standing have \nbeen split in two by fallen trees. Main roads and neighborhood streets \nhave been shut down from landslides and pavements giving way. Well over \n200,000 residents were left without power over the weekend. Needless to \nsay, it will take time before western North Carolina can return to a \nsense of normalcy.\n  I have been down to the devastated areas twice over the past two \nweeks. While my heart broke at the sight of destroyed homes and washed \nout roadways, my hopes were buoyed by the goodness of neighbor helping \nneighbor. It was an image played out all over the towns I visited. \nLocal officials and first responders, some from as far as Raleigh and \nCharlotte, have done--and continue to do--a phenomenal job in the midst \nof challenging circumstances.\n  I think of the heroic efforts of families like Aileen and Glenn \nHolland. They are not strangers to offering aide after a natural \ndisaster. Long time volunteers through the North Carolina Baptists Men \nDisaster Relief, they have traveled all over the United States. But \nlast weekend, they didn't have to travel anywhere. The destruction came \nright to their front door. Fifteen homes were annihilated in Macon \nCounty, but the Holland's was left standing. When they heard the \nscreams of neighbors, Aileen and Glenn began taking people in. They \neven found a toddler covered in mud crying from fear. The Hollands \nremained in their home, providing shelter for friends and family until \nfellow volunteers from the Baptist Men Disaster Relief arrived on the \nscene.\n  I also applaud the efforts of local churches, nonprofits, and groups \nsuch as the Red Cross for the helping hands they're extending all over \nwestern North Carolina. I had the chance to stop in and thank the \nvolunteers at the Red Cross Shelter in Henderson County. I was touched \nto see the families finding refuge and reassurance there.\n  These are the memories I will keep with me as I think back on the \nfar-reaching effects from this hurricane season. Yes, there is \ndestruction. Yes, there is great pain. But I find encouragement in the \nselfless hearts of North Carolinians who are going to great lengths to \nhelp those struggling through the wreckage left behind.\n  It is my desire that we, too, can add to that goodwill and deliver \nthe financial aide these areas need to get back on their feet. Fifteen \nWestern North Carolina counties have been declared federal disaster \nareas, including Buncombe, Haywood, Henderson and Macon. This \ndesignation means that homeowners and businesses are eligible for \nassistance in the form of loans or grants from the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA or the Small Business Administration. There is \na $60 million request for North Carolina included in the President's \nemergency budget. We're obviously going to need much more. I would \nencourage Congress to expedite this aid to those who need it most.\n  I can only hope the end of this devastating hurricane season comes \nquickly. The autumn season makes western North Carolina one of the most \nbeautiful places on earth--and the good folks from the mountains are \nwell suited to give some southern hospitality to visitors from around \nthe country. It is important that we get the word out that this \nmagnificent part of the country is open for business during its prime \ntourism season. My thoughts and my prayers are with every person \ntouched by these hurricanes, not only North Carolina but throughout the \nsoutheast and east coast. May God bless each and every one of them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe it is appropriate, as we move \ntoward the end of our session, to take a look at those issues that are \nbefore us that are most important. Certainly, we have had a difficult 4 \nyears. Unusual and difficult events have happened which have been very \nhard to deal with, and they have made this a challenging and difficult \ntime for all of us.\n  We had an economic downturn starting before the beginning of this 4 \nyears. So we have taken steps to develop and strengthen the economy, \nwhich is still a job before us. However, we are making good progress, I \nbelieve, with respect to that issue.\n  We had September 11, which is a tragedy we will all always remember. \nAnd then, as a part of and following that tragedy, we have had the war \non terrorism.\n  Certainly one has to understand that we have had a tough time. I \nthink we have done rather well moving through this kind of a background \nand dealing with this situation that is very unusual.\n  We continue to face tough decisions and the followup on those \ndecisions. We have made an excellent start in the economy. We have made \nan excellent start in the war on terrorism and, indeed, are moving \nforward in that regard. We are faced with responsibilities and issues \nthat have an impact on the movement we are seeking. It is up to us to \ndeal with those issues.\n  In the short term, we are dealing with the budget, appropriations--\nthose items having to do with spending. One of the impacts of what has \nhappened is a spending deficit. All of us, I think, would agree that \nunder the circumstances, it was a reasonable and necessary thing to do. \nMost of us understand it is time we begin to do away with that deficit \nand get back to a balanced budget, about which I certainly feel \nstrongly.\n  We are going to be faced as well with the reorganization of our \nintelligence-gathering situation. Today, we will be faced with a new \nDirector of the CIA, which is a place to begin. Obviously, there need \nto be some changes there.\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\n  Along with that, during the next several weeks, we will be involved \nin the reorganization of the entire intelligence operation which, \nagain, is very important. Of course, the most important aspect of our \nfuture is winning the war on terror and support for what we are doing \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  We will take up the reform of our intelligence services. All of us \nrecognize the hard work the Commission has done in putting together a \nplan, 41 suggestions and recommendations. We will look at those \nrecommendations. They have done it under tough circumstances. We need \nto do our best to put into place the best program we can. This is not a \npolitical issue. This is an issue we ought to take a look at and say: \nHow do we best avoid the kinds of problems we had in the past in \ncollecting and putting to good use information and intelligence?\n  I do not think we should rush to complete this job. Obviously, it is \nsomething we need to do, and there is interest in getting it done as \nquickly as possible. I hope our target is to do it in the best way we \nknow how as opposed to the fastest way we know how. Perhaps we need to \ndo both.\n\n  We all agree there are weaknesses. Our Government institutions have \nnot adapted to the growing threat of terrorism over more than a decade. \nWe need to understand again, in terms of war, that the situation has \nchanged so much. Not long ago, we fought a war with 17 divisions, \nlanding boats on shores. That is not the case anymore. That is not the \ncase at all. That is not the challenge. The challenge is not often \nknowing who the enemy is or where the enemy is. We have a totally \ndifferent circumstance surrounding the need for intelligence.\n  We have to deal with the fact that terrorists are there to exploit \nthe weaknesses in our defenses and in our knowledge of what needs to be \ndone. Fortunately, this election year has focused some on that point. \nWe have seen fingerpointing attempts to lay blame partly to political \nadvantage, but that is not what it is about.\n  As we move forward with the debate in the Senate, I am hopeful we \nwill never forget that the blame for the attacks on 9/11 rests solely \non the al-Qaida terrorists and Osama bin Laden and the people involved \nin the Middle East for a long time working at these kinds of things. We \nneed to understand also that the threat is not over, and we need to \ncontinue to deal with it.\n  So our focus is trying to figure out ways to improve the situation \nand correct the problem so the events of September 11 will not happen \nagain.\n  So this obviously involves increasing both the quality and quantity \nof human intelligence, and we need to take a look at our overall \nsituation, intelligence as well as military, because things, indeed, \nhave to change. We need to have coordination certainly among all the \nintelligence agencies throughout the country, in different agencies \nthan they have been in the past. Whether they put them all into one is \none of the questions before us, but whether we do or not there has to \nbe coordination and conversation and information exchange among them. \nThere has to be sharing. We have to define the goals we are seeking so \nwe understand what it is we are putting forth and that each of these \nvarious units within our intelligence agencies know what their \nresponsibilities are and their goals are and we can put them together \nto equal what our totals are. We need, obviously, to invest more in the \ntechnical intelligence capabilities. Those things change constantly.\n  So more importantly, I suppose most importantly, we need to ensure \nthe coordinated use of these resources and the personnel and improve \ncommunications. It sounds like an easy thing, but apparently it is not. \nIn the end, this type of reform and reform of our intelligence \ngathering process is necessary. I look forward to the debate we will \nhave soon and I suppose some starting today, as a matter of fact, with \nthe recommendation before us for Director of the CIA.\n  Again, I hope that we can aim toward fixing the problems, aim toward \nmoving to solutions rather than again finding ourselves in the 40-some \ndays from elections where nearly everything is talked about having to \ndo with the elections.\n  Of course, overall, the most important challenge we have before us \nnow is to win the war on terrorism in places such as Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  The problems and the failures in prewar intelligence gathering are \ntroubling, and I am pleased we are doing something about it so our \nleaders will have the best accurate information on which to make \ndecisions.\n  And we acknowledge errors in the past. However, the coming debate \nshould not draw from the central fact that operations in Iraq are and \nalways have been a critical part of the war on terrorism. The war being \nfought in Afghanistan and Iraq is one that is designed fundamentally to \nchange the environment that has given rise and power to Islamic \nextremism.\n  The introduction of a stable democracy in that oppressed region of \nthe world will create an environment in which freedom and liberty and \npeace have the potential to grow and to thrive. I am persuaded that is \nreally the goal of most of Iraqis. When I visited there some months \nago, I was very much impressed with the feeling of most people. You \nwould go out to schools, to powerplants, into the streets of Baghdad, \nand generally there were all kinds of cars and activity, kids standing \non the street waving as we went by in military cars.\n  I understand how difficult it is with the relatively small group of \nprotesters and persons who do not care about the future and are willing \nto blow you up with a car bomb. But the fact is most people see the \nmerit of having the kind of government, the kind of country where they \ncan enjoy freedom and the prosperity of freedom. So if we can continue \nto provide an opportunity for these folks to take care of themselves, \nform their own government, which is our plan, of course, that is our \ngoal.\n  Now, it is difficult and I understand politically advantageous to \ncomplain about the speed at which or the slowness at which it is taking \nplace. The fact is it is going to be slow. It is going to be difficult. \nIt is a difficult thing to accomplish. We hear complaints about not \nhaving a plan. We do have a plan. Is everything perfect? Of course not. \nBut there is a plan. We know what we are doing. I was out to the \ntraining facility for the Iraqi police and army, and they are making an \neffort. It is slower than we thought, of course, but that is the case.\n  We are going to have the fanatics and the insurgents and they are \ngoing to be fighting us and the Iraqis and they will be acting out of \ndesperation, and that is difficult. This is not the kind of war where \nsomebody puts up a white flag and suddenly it is all over. This is not \nthat kind of arrangement. This is much different. People will do it. \nThis will, of course, eventually deny the terrorists and extremists the \nhavens they need. So it is a very important issue. It is a victory that \nwill be long and difficult. I believe we have to acknowledge that.\n  Again I understand the politics of saying it is too long, we need to \nget out, and we do and everyone agrees with that. But there is a \nsequence in completing our task. There is the first sequence. It will \ntake a long time and there will be casualties and it will be difficult. \nBut there are happy things to talk about. There are more than 400,000 \nsecurity forces conducting stability operations there. The Government \nis in close consultation, training commanders; 99,000 Iraqis have been \ntrained in various security forces. There is a lot going on there. Have \nwe accomplished what we want yet? Of course not. Or else we would be \nsaying that we have accomplished everything. But it is so important \nthat we focus not only on that but on those things that now are \nimportant to us.\n  We are focused on our budget. We are focused on holding down spending \nin the nonessential areas so we can make up this deficit. We need to \nfocus on creating jobs so that we can continue to get strength in the \neconomy. We need to focus on having the kind of intelligence that can \navoid these things happening in the future. We need to focus on \ncompleting the task we have undertaken.\n  So we will have an opportunity in the next couple of weeks to do some \nthings, and then certainly we will come back later. I guess my only \nhope is that we can continue to see the tasks clearly before us, seek \nto complete the task successfully as opposed to trying to make a \npolitical issue out of wherever the controversies lie. That is the \nchallenge for us and a challenge I believe we can accomplish.\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, John Edwards was in Cleveland, \nOH, and gave a powerful speech on the economy. He pointed out the \nstruggles of the middle class and asked why President Bush made the \nchoices he has to boost the wealthiest Americans and abandon hard \nworking men and women. I urge my colleagues to take a look at this \ngreat speech.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Remarks of Senator John Edwards\n\n       It is an honor to be with you.\n       When I was in school, I remember coming down the stairs at \n     night. I would see the glow of the television, hear the \n     volume on low, and see my Dad working at the kitchen table. \n     He wasn't going over the family bills or paper work from his \n     job at the mill. He was learning math on TV.\n       After a long day at work, he would come home and turn on a \n     local TV station to learn. Every year, he'd see another young \n     person with no experience and a college degree move past him. \n     And he knew that if he didn't try something his chances of \n     moving up would disappear.\n       So my Dad--like millions of Americans--did what he could \n     for himself so that he could better provide for his family. I \n     was proud of what he was trying to do. I was sad because he \n     couldn't get a college degree. And I realized that I lived in \n     a country where I could.\n       Standing in that house, I always had hope. At that time, \n     America was a place where hard work and determination could \n     take you anywhere. My mother ran her own small business, \n     refinishing furniture to help pay for my tuition. Thanks to \n     my mother and father's hard work in that mill, in that \n     business, and at that kitchen table, they were able to buy a \n     house. Later on, they were able to help me become the first \n     person in my family to go to college. And I stand here today \n     because I have lived in the bright light and the blessing of \n     America.\n       What I saw in that house in Robbins, North Carolina was \n     very American. It was two parents working hard, meeting their \n     responsibilities, and living in an economy that made the \n     American Dream possible. It was a time when you knew that \n     faith, responsibility and hard work would lift your family \n     up. They would give you and your children the future they \n     deserve. And this is the great promise of America.\n       But I fear today, that that light is flickering and that \n     blessing is no longer there for any but a few. And this great \n     shift away from the power and the promise of our middle class \n     means that the gifts and the graces of too many young people \n     never have a chance to shine.\n       Today, I fear that a young boy in Athens who goes \n     downstairs and sees his parents at the kitchen table doesn't \n     sense hope in his house. He sees his parents trying to get \n     through the month. He sees them divide up their bills into \n     piles that say ``pay now'' and ``pay later.'' And he sees his \n     mother and father work hard and they can't even break even.\n       That boy thinks, ``This is what life will be like.'' He \n     looks on with resignation and the false belief that this is \n     as good as it gets.\n       Two people are responsible for causing this great shift in \n     America: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney. Their policies have \n     decimated the economy of Ohio and the American values we \n     believe in.\n       This campaign is about different leaders and different \n     economic plans. It's about different visions for America. And \n     it's about what's holding our economy down--the callous view \n     of a few at the top who believe that the values that got us \n     here can now be left behind.\n       It is because George Bush and Dick Cheney abandoned our \n     values that Ohio has lost 237,000 jobs; family incomes have \n     dropped by more than $1,500; health care costs have gone up \n     more than $3,600; tuition at Cleveland State and Ohio State \n     is up $3000; and once every five minutes an Ohio family files \n     for bankruptcy.\n       The struggles people face in Ohio and the weakness in our \n     economy are a direct result of decisions made by George Bush \n     and Dick Cheney. And those decisions are the direct result of \n     a vision that honors wealth and privilege rather than work \n     and responsibility.\n       When our economy suffered after September 11, this \n     President made a choice. He fought for tax cuts for the \n     wealthiest Americans. And he did nothing to put more money \n     into the pockets of working families.\n       When our country went 7 straight months of losing jobs, \n     this President made a choice. He proposed $25 billion in \n     backward-looking tax cuts for big corporations like Enron. \n     But he did nothing to pass tax cuts that would encourage \n     businesses to create jobs.\n       When the incomes of working families began to fall after 7 \n     years of strong growth, this President made a choice. He \n     slashed the overtime for six million workers. But he did \n     nothing to raise the minimum wage.\n       When health care costs skyrocketed out of control, this \n     President made a choice. He gave away $140 billion to the big \n     drug companies and fought to lift the responsibilities of \n     HMOs and insurance companies while taking away the rights of \n     families. But he did nothing to lower health care costs so \n     Americans could keep more of their hard-earned money.\n       When Ohio schools raised college tuition because of state \n     budget deficits, this President made a choice. He stood up \n     for subsidies to big banks and tried to cut off Pell Grants \n     for 84,000 students. But he did nothing to relieve the burden \n     on our state budgets and increase student aid.\n       Every choice he made did something to harm our middle class \n     and weaken our economy. So when it comes to what working \n     people need, this really is a Do-Nothing Presidency: Do \n     Nothing to create jobs, do nothing to relieve the pressure on \n     the middle class, do nothing to bring down health care costs, \n     and do nothing to help more young people go to college.\n       You can count on George Bush and Dick Cheney to do one \n     thing: look out for their friends at the top. It is very \n     simple: they honor wealth, not work.\n       Make no mistake. This idea is the most radical and \n     dangerous economic agenda to hit our shores since socialism a \n     century ago. Like socialism, it corrupts the very nature of \n     our democracy and our free enterprise tradition. It is not a \n     plan to grow the American economy. It is a plan to corrupt \n     the American economy and shrink the winners' circle.\n       John Kerry and I believe that the hard work and \n     responsibility of the middle class are the engine of our \n     economy. We believe our government should honor those values \n     and give everyone who works hard and takes responsibility a \n     chance to do well. We believe in expanding the winner's \n     circle. We believe in one America.\n       History shows us that our approach works better for \n     America. To have real economic growth in this country, we \n     have to strengthen and expand the middle class.\n       We saw it with the G.I. Bill. Young men had fought for \n     America, and America invested in them. Millions of young \n     people went to college and triggered the greatest expansion \n     of the middle class the world has ever seen.\n       We saw it in the 1990s. Government lived within a budget \n     just like our families do. A tight labor market drove up \n     wages. The average family made $7000 more, and we lifted 6 \n     million Americans out of poverty.\n       And look where we are today. George Bush and Dick Cheney \n     have replaced that virtuous path with a vicious circle when \n     it comes to our economy.\n       We have a labor market that cannot keep up with our growing \n     population. We see declining wages even as health care costs \n     go through the roof. And the gap between the Two Americas is \n     growing. Corporate profits are up. Our most expensive stores' \n     sales are up. But average wages are down over the last year, \n     and the Targets and Gaps are seeing their sales stall. \n     Instead of creating good middle-class jobs, we're creating \n     more temporary positions, part-time jobs, and jobs in fast \n     food restaurants.\n       When you have a government that does nothing to reward \n     work, our economy doesn't pick up and this vicious circle \n     continues. The people at the top do just fine. The people who \n     make this country work struggle to get through the month, and \n     our economy never picks up steam.\n       John Kerry and I will break this vicious circle. And we \n     will put America back on a virtuous path where work is \n     rewarded, the middle class expands, and the American Dream is \n     there for all who are willing to work for it.\n       It is time to build one America with one economy that works \n     for everyone. Where no child ever looks on at his parents and \n     thinks, ``I can't hope for something better.'' But dreams \n     only of building something better. And this is the season for \n     change. It is time to build an economy that honors our values \n     and rewards work.\n       I know personally what it's like when the factory or the \n     plant closes down. The whole town suffers, and that's what \n     happened when the textile mill my father worked in closed \n     down.\n       We can prevent some of these jobs from leaving America. And \n     there are real steps we can take that will stem the loss of \n     manufacturing jobs in Ohio. But that alone won't be enough.\n\n[[Page S9479]]\n\n       One constant of our new global economy is that there will \n     always be change--one sector will be growing while another \n     lags. It is the responsibility of our leaders to anticipate \n     these changes, do what they can to save the old jobs and \n     create new ones, and give our workforce the tools it needs to \n     adapt to the new economy.\n       What I will present today is our plan to help Ohio and \n     America build one economy. This plan will attract new \n     business to Ohio and create more manufacturing jobs. And it \n     will strengthen and expand the middle class so that the \n     American dream of building something better is never replaced \n     with the dream of just getting by.\n       First, we are going to create and keep good paying jobs \n     right here in America.\n       Today, if one company wants to move its factory to China \n     and another company wants to keep its plant open outside of \n     Marietta, the company that ships its jobs overseas is \n     rewarded. They get the tax break while our middle class \n     watches more and more good paying jobs leave this country. \n     They get the tax break while our middle class loses its \n     muscle. And they get the tax break while your friends and \n     neighbors have to figure out how to live on $12,000 less in \n     their new job.\n       This administration values America's work so little that \n     they actually proposed to offer new tax breaks for companies \n     to go overseas. We should be exporting American products, not \n     American jobs.\n       When John Kerry is President, we will end the tax deferral \n     rules that encourage companies to ship jobs overseas. \n     Instead, we will cut taxes for businesses that create jobs \n     here. In fact we will cut taxes for 99% of American companies \n     that pay taxes and create jobs.\n       For those small businesses and manufacturers that want to \n     hire new employees we will create a new jobs tax credit to \n     pay your share of the payroll tax for every person you hire. \n     And for those small business owners who want to hire more \n     employees but cannot afford to insure them, we will give you \n     up to a 50% tax cut on your health care to cover your \n     employees.\n       You see, we believe government should cut taxes on American \n     business. But it shouldn't cut and run from America's values \n     when it does.\n       Another way to honor work is to enforce our trade \n     agreements and trade laws so we secure a more level playing \n     field for our workers. We need to trade for our businesses, \n     our consumers, and our economy. But we need to make sure that \n     our trading partners honor their part of the bargain.\n       Your own Senator, George Voinovich called America's \n     enforcement of trade laws, ``nothing short of abysmal.'' \n     Right now, this administration is using our trade policy to \n     compensate for their own failed foreign policy, by cutting \n     deals with small countries willing to support us. And in \n     the meantime, our major trading partners are cleaning our \n     clock, bringing two or three trade cases against us for \n     every one we bring against them.\n       Today we are running the biggest trade deficit in history. \n     Exports are down for the first time in history. And no place \n     feels the downside of an Administration that fails to look \n     out for our businesses and our workers more than Ohio.\n       Ohio has lost 173,000 manufacturing jobs under this \n     President. Here in Cleveland, CHC Industries shut down its \n     plant because of Chinese dumping.\n       And I heard a similar story from the workers from \n     Techneglas in Columbus. They were part of the television \n     glass and components manufacturer that closed three plants \n     and sent 1,100 workers home. And one of the reasons they \n     closed is China's continued manipulation of its currency. \n     They are able to sell products for up to 40 percent less--not \n     because they're more efficient or cheaper, but because they \n     play games in the currency markets. This president won't even \n     say it's against the rules.\n       John Kerry will. He will fight China's currency \n     manipulation. And he will stand up and defend the federal \n     trade enforcement law that that has delivered over $200 \n     million to Ohio manufacturers over the last four years.\n       These trade policies aren't abstract ideas or some things \n     that happen over there. They impact our lives. While we must \n     always trade and open our markets, we must do so in a way \n     that is right for our workers and the world's workers.\n       We all have to do well if this economy is going to break \n     this vicious circle and start to grow. And that means making \n     sure businesses across America can compete with businesses \n     around the world. Today, health care costs add $400 to the \n     cost of a Japanese car, but $1400 to the cost of an American \n     car. American manufacturers that have always done the right \n     thing and offered health care are at a growing disadvantage \n     compared to our international competition.\n       We can change that. We can change it by lifting the burden \n     of catastrophic costs from businesses and by offering tax \n     credits to make health care more affordable. We can change it \n     by allowing the reimportation of prescription drugs and the \n     government to negotiate a fair price. And we can change it by \n     passing a new three-strikes-and-you're out rule that targets \n     the lawyers who clog our court systems with meritless cases \n     that should never be filed-not the victims whose injuries are \n     all too real.\n       John and I also understand that a strong economy isn't just \n     about Wall Street doing well. It's about the strength and \n     livelihoods of our Main Streets and back streets in our small \n     towns and rural areas.\n       That's why we'll create a venture capital fund to support \n     small businesses and entrepreneurs in small towns that are \n     hurting. We will make sure we have broadband everywhere in \n     America and help small manufacturers upgrade their \n     technology. And we can invest in the new technologies and \n     renewable energies so that America can become independent of \n     Middle East oil.\n       Here in Ohio, your leading universities, research \n     institutes, and advanced manufacturing industries will spark \n     new growth and innovation. They are critical for \n     strengthening our high tech economy and key to Ohio's \n     economic future.\n       Since the Second World War, technology has accounted for \n     nearly 50 percent of the state's economic growth. There are \n     167,000 Ohio workers employed in high tech jobs.\n       If we expand investment in technology, we can create an \n     economic environment where these kinds of good paying jobs \n     are created every day. And by investing in education, we can \n     use our best and our brightest to solve our countries \n     greatest challenges. The strength and knowledge of our \n     working men and women will launch the next wave of economic \n     expansion. And Ohio can and will lead the way.\n       Once we take these steps, our walk is not done. When we put \n     America back to work, we also need to make sure that work is \n     honored and rewarded.\n       George Bush is talking about building an ownership society, \n     but he has spent four years building a debt society for \n     everyone except those at the top. His economic vision has one \n     goal: to get rid of taxes on unearned income and shift the \n     tax burden onto people who work. And he has moved toward that \n     goal with the tax cuts he has passed already.\n       The President's new ``tax reform'' is the ultimate \n     expression of his values. We don't know all of the details, \n     but we know a lot of them because of a memo released by his \n     former Treasury Secretary.\n       We know people who inherit hundreds of millions will pay \n     nothing; firemen and waitresses and working people will pay \n     everything. And we know his plan will take away the most \n     important incentive for the single most important form of \n     ownership: it will eliminate entirely the tax deduction for \n     home mortgage interest.\n       According to the Treasury Department, the effects of this \n     project on the economy as a whole are ``uncertain.'' But the \n     effects on the middle class are clear. It means that they \n     will bear more of the tax burden in America.\n       It's time to return to the idea that made this country \n     great: Instead of helping wealthy people protect their \n     wealth, we should reward the work of America's middle class.\n       That is why John Kerry and I have a plan to cut taxes on \n     work and expand our middle class. To help middle class \n     families pay for health care, health care reform and a tax \n     credit to help lower premiums up to $1,000 a year. To help \n     them cover the rising costs of child care, a tax credit up to \n     $1,000 so children have a safe place to go while their \n     parents work. To help middle-class families keep more of \n     their hard-earned money, we will stop the deceptive and \n     unfair credit card deals that cost families billions each \n     year.\n       And to give more young Americans the chance I had to be the \n     first member of their family to go to college, a plan to make \n     college affordable. We will provide $10 billion in aid for \n     states, including $340 million for Ohio, as long as the state \n     holds tuition in line with inflation. We will provide every \n     person with a tax credit on $4,000 of college tuition. And if \n     young people are willing to give two years of service to \n     their community, state or country, then we'll give them four \n     years of college tuition.\n       When we say that we want to cut taxes for the middle class, \n     these are more than words. It's what John and I have fought \n     for over and over again. They want more tax cuts for \n     millionaires. We want more tax cuts for the middle class \n     because we know that a strong and growing middle class means \n     a stronger America.\n       Just as families live within a budget, Washington should \n     too. And we will restore fiscal discipline in Washington. We \n     will roll back tax cuts on multimillionaires, restore real \n     budget rules, and we will cut corporate loopholes, corporate \n     welfare, and the federal bureaucracy that is growing again \n     under George W. Bush. Our plan will cut the deficit in half \n     and this will restore confidence in our markets. It will free \n     up new capital for new businesses and encourage them to start \n     hiring again.\n       There is a fundamental American principle we all believe \n     in--creating wealth for those who'll work for it and \n     expanding the middle class. But the very idea of the \n     ``working poor'' has no place in our America.\n       Cleveland is a proud city, a great city. And it belongs at \n     the top of many lists. But not the one we heard about last \n     month--having the highest poverty rate in the nation. We need \n     to see these numbers as a call to action.\n       Poverty isn't something we can live with. It's something we \n     must strive to end. Based not on handouts, but based on hard \n     work. We will encourage the job creation in Cleveland by \n     fixing our tax policies and our trade policies and investing \n     in our small businesses. We will honor hard work by raising \n     the minimum wage. That will help 396,000 people in Ohio. And \n     we will honor hard work by expanding tax credits for those \n     who work.\n       In Cleveland, thousands of working families who are \n     eligible for those tax credits\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\n     don't collect them. Thousands get advance ``tax refunds'' \n     that are actually loans at interest rates of 100 percent or \n     higher. And often these families see their earnings eroded \n     even more by predatory lending at rates no one should have to \n     bear. Ohio has the highest foreclosure rate in the country, \n     and in Cleveland, 1 in 66 homes were in foreclosure in 2003.\n       We can do something about it. First, we'll work with \n     Cleveland to lead an outreach campaign, expand voluntary help \n     with taxes, speed up tax refunds, and get the IRS out of the \n     business of encouraging high-interest loans. We will crack \n     down on predatory lending to save Ohio families $300 million \n     a year, and use our laws to prompt banks to offer more loans \n     and services to low income families. And we can make sure \n     fathers honor their responsibilities by paying child support \n     and helping them work.\n       We can lead a rebirth right here in Cleveland. This city \n     has 350 brownfields covering 6,000 acres. We can clean them \n     up and replace hollowed out buildings with good new homes. \n     And we can strengthen the public schools in Cleveland so that \n     families stay in the city. You just laid off more than 800 \n     teachers because the schools are underfunded. How are we \n     going to educate the best minds of tomorrow without a good \n     teacher at the head of every classroom?\n       One thing that you understand here in Cleveland is that \n     poverty isn't ``their'' problem. Nobody is more eager than \n     you to fight poverty because you understand that the fate of \n     your city depends on the success of all of your residents. \n     And that is exactly the same thing for America. Creating \n     opportunity for all is not an expression of compassion. It is \n     an expression of our commitment to do what is best for \n     America.\n       At the heart of this campaign, we want to make sure that \n     everyone has those same opportunities that I had growing up--\n     no matter where you live, who your family is, and what the \n     color of your skin is. This is the America we believe in.\n       You honor work and inspire confidence by building one \n     economy that honors our values and strengthens our great \n     middle class. With this simple and enduring principle serving \n     as our moral compass, we can break this current vicious \n     circle and put our economy back on a virtuous path.\n       This is what the politics of what's possible can build and \n     John and I need your support to make this happen in America.\n       For in the end, this election comes down to a simple \n     choice. If you believe that our economy--Ohio's economy--is \n     strong when month after month jobs are lost and family \n     incomes decline, then you can vote for George Bush and Dick \n     Cheney. But if you want an economy that honors work and lifts \n     up our middle class, then your choice is clear and it is time \n     to make John Kerry our next president.\n       Many of us are angry at what George Bush and Dick Cheney \n     have done to our great country and the values we cherish. But \n     anger never changed America; our actions do. And this is what \n     we will do create good paying jobs, invest in the jobs of the \n     future, and lift up and expand our great middle class.\n       We will do this for America.\n       So that once again, we can live in the bright light and the \n     blessing of America.\n       Where a child no longer sees despair when his parents sort \n     bills at the kitchen table, but believes in the promise of \n     America. That hard work, responsibility and the love of his \n     family can create a future filled with hope and grace.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few issues are more important to a strong \nAmerica than strong schools. Education can open the doors of \nopportunity to our people. It helps the next generation realize their \npotential and fulfill their dreams. A good education strengthens our \neconomy as it prepares young Americans to get good jobs and compete in \ntoday's world. Parents want their children to succeed, but over the \npast 4 years we have seen a President and an administration with an \nincompetent education policy and incompetent education budget.\n  President Bush can find more than $1 trillion to give away in tax \nbreaks for the elite but he cuts funding for his own education reforms. \nHe can waste billions of dollars in contracts to Halliburton but cannot \nfind a dime to increase Pell grants. When it comes to the education of \nour children and helping the middle-class families afford college for \ntheir children, and helping workers get retrained for new jobs, this \nadministration has been AWOL.\n  On issue after issue, the administration has misled the country with \nthe long trail of broken promises and unmet commitments. Incompetence \nis hurting our families and our communities. On Iraq, the \nadministration manipulated and distorted intelligence in a rush to war. \nWe have had incompetent leadership in trying to find a way of peace, \nand America is less safe today.\n  We have had incompetency in the management of our economy with the \nloss of 1,700,000 jobs. Wages are down. Expenses are up. Health \npremiums are going through the roof. Gasoline prices are up. College \npremiums are up. In health care, we have a double-digit increase in \npremiums. Drug costs are going through the ceiling. There is a rising \nnumber of uninsured. Iraq, the economy, health care, and now education.\n  I have a statement the President made January 23, 2001:\n\n       My focus will be on making sure that every child is \n     educated.\n\n  These are the K-12. This is the college education. These are the \nchildren who need the training programs and yet we see that under the \nadministration's budget 4.6 million of these children are being left \nbehind.\n  College tuition has gone up 38 percent in the new calculations since \nthis President took office, which makes payment of the premiums for a \ncollege education out of the reach of middle-income families.\n  We have had an actual $600 million cut in job training programs.\n  This is what the President said:\n\n       Funding is important and so is reform. So we must tie \n     funding to higher standards and accountability--\n\n  We agreed with that--\n\n     for results. Schools will be given a reasonable chance to \n     improve and the support to do so.\n\n  Money is not the answer to everything but it is a clear indication of \na nation's priorities. This is a commitment of the President to provide \nthe support so we can have higher standards so that we can have higher \nresults and academic achievement for our children. Yet we find that \nBush underfunded the reforms of No Child Left Behind this year by $9.4 \nbillion.\n  There are 6,500 schools identified as in need of improvement and \nPresident Bush has never once proposed funding to turn around schools \nthat need improvement.\n\n  Here it is. The President said on January 23, 2001:\n\n       Many of our schools, particularly low-income schools, will \n     need help in the transition to higher standards.\n\n  Higher standards mean better trained teachers who are teaching in \nunderserved areas. It means support services for those children who are \nnot being able to keep up with the rest of the class. It means help and \nassistance for limited-English-speaking children, those who are \nspeaking a foreign language who need the extra help and assistance in \norder to be able to perform at standard, and also reforms for \nstruggling schools in many of our urban areas and some in our rural \nareas.\n  There was a guarantee in the No Child Left Behind funding for \nqualified teachers, funding for afterschool programs, funding for \nlimited-English-speaking children, funding for struggling schools, and \nyet that has been a failed promise.\n  This chart indicates where the Bush budget is with regard to the No \nChild Left Behind Act, all the way out to fiscal year 2012, and that \nleaves over 4 million children left out and left behind.\n  This was the commitment in the No Child Left Behind Act that this \nPresident signed to say that no child would be left behind, and that \nevery child could reach proficiency.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, in the last MCAS test, which is \ngenerally recognized nationwide, 62 percent of the children were able \nto get proficiency in reading and 57 percent in math. We are not giving \nup on those children but evidently the administration has.\n  Next, in higher education, this is what the President said on August \n30, 2000:\n\n       A child eligible for a Pell grant future will be affected \n     by the size of the Pell grant. I am going to ask Congress to \n     bolster the first year aid . . . to $5,100 per recipient of \n     the Pell grant. . . .\n\n  That was on August 30, 2000. When was that? Just before the election.\n  I have the budget of this administration on the Pell grants for the \nlast 4 years: Zero, zero, zero in terms of the increase of the Pell \ngrants at a time when we have increases in higher education going up 38 \npercent.\n  This is an abdication of responsibility to the children of this \ncountry. We have had an abdication of responsibility in health care, in \nthe economy, and in education.\n  What we do not have with this administration is attention to special \ninterests. We saw over the passage of the Medicare debate where this \nadministration gave $139 billion in windfall\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\nprofits to the drug industry, $46 billion to the HMO industry. Now what \ndo we have, the student loan scandal.\n  My friend from the State of Washington will speak to this issue, but \nI wish to point out what was printed today in the New York Times that \nsays it all.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the whole article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 22, 2004]\n\n                  Banks and the College Loan Loophole\n\n       The Bush administration has studiously looked the other way \n     while well-connected lenders have exploited a loophole in the \n     student loan program that will reap them nearly a billion \n     dollars in undeserved subsidies this year alone. Congress, \n     which rakes in contributions from banks and other lenders, \n     was reluctant to even discuss this problem until a public \n     outcry recently made it impossible to avoid. The Education \n     Department has claimed that it lacks the authority to close \n     the loophole unilaterally. But that position was blown away \n     this week in an unusually caustic report by the Government \n     Accountability Office, which outlined the scope of the \n     problem and urged the Education Department to solve it \n     quickly.\n       At issue is a special category of student loans for which \n     the government guarantees the lenders a whopping return of \n     9.5 percent, even though the prevailing rate charged to \n     students is now less than 3.5 percent. The 9.5 percent loans, \n     backed by tax-exempt bonds, were established when interest \n     rates were high in the 1980's to keep lenders in the college \n     laon business, Congress tried to phase out the high-interest \n     loans in 1993, when it rightly concluded that they were no \n     longer needed, but they have not gone away.\n       As interest rates declined, the lenders, abetted by the \n     Education Department, developed a series of accounting tricks \n     that create new 9.5 percent loans essentially out of thin \n     air. This process, sometimes described as cloning, has made \n     the number of 9.5 percent loans balloon and ratcheted up the \n     subsidies that the government must pay. Worse still, recent \n     press accounts suggest that higher-ups in the department may \n     have overruled auditors who tried to put an end to this \n     process.\n       The House voted to end the unfair subsidies temporarily--\n     and is likely to settle on a permanent solution soon. But the \n     Senate Appropriations Committee ducked the issue last week \n     when it rejected a measure that would have driven a stake \n     through the wasteful program and redirected some of the \n     savings to student aid. By one estimate, even six months' \n     delay in dealing with this problem would cost the taxpayers \n     nearly $3 billion in interest payments. That money should be \n     going to poor and working-class college students--not to \n     banks.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. By one estimate, even 6 months' delay in dealing with \nthis problem will cost the taxpayers nearly $3 billion in interest \npayments. That money should be going to poor and working class college \nstudents, not to the banks.\n  We have an administration that takes care of the special interests, \nand now we find they are taking care of the banks as well. They take \ncare of the drug companies, the HMOs, and the banks. All one has to do \nis read the newspaper. Look at this morning's newspaper on the Federal \npage, September 22, ``EPA Wording Found To Mirror Industry's.''\n\n       For the third time, environmental advocates have discovered \n     passages in the Bush administration's proposal for regulating \n     mercury pollution from power plants that mirror almost word \n     for word portions of memos written by a law firm representing \n     the coal-fired power plants.\n\n  There it is again, taking care of the banks, taking care of the \npowerplants, taking care of the drug industry, but not taking care of \nworking class Americans, not taking care of middle-income Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 22, 2004]\n\n                 EPA Wording Found to Mirror Industry's\n\n                          (By Juliet Eilperin)\n\n       For the third time, environmental advocates have discovered \n     passages in the Bush administration's proposal for regulating \n     mercury pollution from power plants that mirror almost word \n     for word portions of memos written by a law firm representing \n     coal-fired power plants.\n       The passages state that the Environmental Protection Agency \n     is not required to regulate other hazardous toxins emitted by \n     power plants, such as lead and arsenic. Several attorneys \n     general, as well as some environmental groups, have argued \n     that the Clean Air Act compels the EPA to regulate these \n     emissions as well as mercury.\n       The revelations concerning language written by Latham & \n     Watkins could broaden an ongoing probe by the EPA's inspector \n     general into whether the industry had an undue influence on \n     the agency's proposed mercury rule, legislative critics of \n     the proposed rule said.\n       Sen. James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), ranking member of the \n     Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and one of the \n     senators who called for the probe last spring, said the \n     revelation that the EPA adopted the same wording as an \n     industry source ``no longer comes as much of a surprise.''\n       ``The Bush administration continues to let industry write \n     the rules on pollution, and this is just one more example of \n     how they abuse the public trust,'' he said.\n       EPA spokeswoman Cynthia Bergman would not comment on the \n     connection between the law firm memo and the agency's \n     proposal beyond saying that it is ``a public document. It was \n     publicly debated as part of the rulemaking process.''\n       She added that pollutants such as lead and arsenic are not \n     the central issue: ``EPA continues to be most concerned with \n     mercury. We will be regulating mercury emissions from power \n     plants for the first time, and we will concentrate on the \n     need to protect children and pregnant women.''\n       Environmentalists have assailed the EPA for months arguing \n     that the mercury rule, slated to be finalized next March, \n     would not adequately curb a toxin that can enter the food \n     chain through fish and cause development damage in infants \n     and young children.\n       The rule, they said, does nothing to limit chromium, lead \n     and arsenic pollution from utilities, all of which exceed \n     mercury emissions and could pose a health threat.\n       ``The big story here is the public health story; things \n     like arsenic, lead and chromium are being released in very \n     large quantities and pose a very serious health threat,'' \n     said John Stanton, a senior lawyer for Clear the Air, an \n     environmental coalition that spotted the similarities between \n     the regulation's language and the industry memo.\n       The proposed regulation concludes that although the EPA \n     determined in 2000 that arsenic, chromium and other metals \n     are potential carcinogens, there is too much uncertainty to \n     justify regulating them.\n       That conclusion is backed by two sections of the proposed \n     rule that address whether the EPA is compelled to regulate \n     non-mercury pollutants, an issue that first arose in 1990 \n     when Congress rewrote sections of the Clean Air Act. At the \n     time, Congress made an exemption for the utilities, saying \n     the EPA should study whether it was both ``appropriate and \n     necessary'' to regulate them. In 2000, in the waning months \n     of the Clinton administration, the EPA concluded that \n     utilities should be listed as a source of toxic emissions and \n     regulated accordingly.\n       In light of the 2000 decision and past studies, EPA \n     officials said they are obligated to regulate only mercury in \n     coal-fired power plants and nickel in oil-fired plants. The \n     nine attorneys general and two state environmental \n     secretaries wrote the agency on June 28 saving the EPA is \n     legally required to address other pollutants as well, citing \n     a 2000 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit.\n       The Aug. 5, 2002, memo from Latham & Watkins, submitted \n     during the public comment period on the rule, said hazardous \n     air pollutants other than mercury did not need to be \n     regulated. It made multiple references to statements by Rep. \n     Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio) that ``Congress provided a distinct \n     regulatory mandate for utility [hazardous emissions] because \n     of the logic of basing any decisions to regulate on the \n     results of scientific study and because of the emission \n     reductions that will be achieved and the extremely high costs \n     that electric utilities will face under other provisions of \n     the new Clean Air Act amendments.''\n       The EPA used nearly identical language in its rule, \n     changing just eight words. In a separate section, the agency \n     used the same italics Latham lawyers used in their memo, \n     saying the EPA is required to regulate only the pollutants \n     under Section 112 of the Clean Air Act ``after considering \n     the results of the study required by this paragraph.'' The \n     memo uses the world ``subparagraph'' instead of paragraph but \n     is otherwise identical.\n       Latham lawyer Robert A. Wyman Jr., who authored the memo, \n     declined to comment last week on grounds that the firm does \n     not discuss client matters unless directed to do so.\n       The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times reported \n     earlier this year on instances in which industry-written \n     language had surfaced in the mercury proposal. A spokesman \n     for the inspector general's office said its investigation of \n     the issue should be done by early next year.\n\nThat, I believe, is what this whole election is about.\n  Finally, the President of the United States is out today in \nPennsylvania and also in Wisconsin. I hope he will explain to the \npeople in Pennsylvania why he is leaving out 65,800 schoolchildren, who \nare being left behind in the funding of the No Child Left Behind Act in \nPennsylvania. And when he travels to Wisconsin on Friday, I hope he \nwill explain to the parents out there in Wisconsin why he is leaving \nbehind 26,300 children, who are left behind in the State of Wisconsin.\n  The parents of the children in Pennsylvania, the parents of the \nchildren in\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\nWisconsin, are entitled to answers. They are tired of rhetoric. They \nare tired of cliches. They are tired of misrepresentations. They want \nthe facts. They want the truth.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthis scandal to which the Senator from Massachusetts alluded. It is \nmentioned in the New York Times today, ``Banks and the College Loan \nLoophole.''\n  I talk to families all over the State of Washington, and they are \nstruggling to pay for college for their kids. They all agree college \neducation is far too expensive for many families. You would think the \nFederal Government would be doing everything possible today to make \ncollege more accessible for all of our families. Sadly, that is not the \ncase.\n  Last week in the Senate we had a chance to help students to get to \nand get through college. Unfortunately, the majority on the \nAppropriations Committee blocked my commonsense, student-friendly \nproposal. Instead of standing up for students, unfortunately the \ncommittee stood up for banks and other special interests that have been \ngaming the system for years, at taxpayer expense.\n  I am on the Senate floor today to say that students should come \nbefore special interests. Student loan programs were started to help \nour students. They were not started to line the pockets of lenders. It \nis time to end the taxpayer ripoff that is occurring today and do more \nto help our students afford college.\n  Back in the 1980s, interest rates were high. Many people were \nconcerned that our lenders would stop making student loans, so Congress \ncreated a temporary--and I emphasize ``temporary''--measure to keep \ncollege loans affordable for our students.\n  At the time, it worked. Lenders kept making loans, and students were \nable to afford college loans. This was supposed to be, as I said, a \ntemporary measure. In fact, it was supposed to be phased out in 1993, \nwhen interest rates started coming back down. Interest rates came down; \nthis subsidy lived on. For the past 11 years, taxpayers have paid these \nlenders far more than they should have. Taxpayers are actually \nsubsidizing profitable companies to make loans that are far above \ntoday's interest rates. Clearly, taxpayers are paying a huge bill while \nspecial interests are taking the money to the bank.\n\n  Who is paying the price? Our college students. This year we are \nthrowing away $1 billion that we could be using to help more students \ngo to college. So in the Appropriations Committee last week, I offered \nan amendment to finally stop this taxpayer ripoff. My amendment would \nhave used the savings from this ripoff to help 700,000 students get \nanother $3,000 for college. It would have helped the parents of 25,000 \nlow-income students get child care on campus. It would have helped \nanother 200,000 students get $800 in grants. It would have helped \n180,000 low-income and first-generation students prepare for college \nthrough TRIO and GEAR UP. And it would have helped thousands of migrant \nstudents attend college.\n  When I offered my amendment, everybody on the committee seemed to \nagree that this subsidy should end. But when it came time to vote, \nevery Republican member voted against my amendment. They voted against \ntaxpayers, they voted against students, and they voted against our \nfamilies. They said they wanted to deal with it later. I am here today \nto say that taxpayers are getting ripped off every day we delay. If we \nwait 6 months, as was suggested, taxpayers will lose billions of \ndollars, and students will not get the help they need. The time to do \nthis is now.\n  I am not willing to waste another dollar that could be in the pockets \nof our students today, and that is why the Senate needs to act now. The \nGovernment is paying 30 times more than it should for these special \ninterest subsidies--30 times more. That is a ripoff.\n  This is as if you walk into a college book store and a textbook on \nthe shelf costs $100. If that textbook had the same outrageous markup \nas these loans, that student would be paying $3,000 for the same \ntextbook. Taxpayers are paying $3,000 for something that only costs \n$100 because of this runaway subsidy, and that is outrageous. There is \nno reason for taxpayers to be paying a markup of 30 times the real \ncost.\n  We were all outraged when Halliburton charged taxpayers $45 for a \ncase of soda that sells for $7 at the supermarket. Halliburton marked \nthose prices up 6 times. Today, lenders are marking up student loans at \na price 30 times higher than they should. No wonder the Washington Post \ncalled this a scandal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post editorial on this \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 10, 2004]\n\n                          Student Loan Scandal\n\n       There are bureaucratic errors, there is congressional \n     negligence--and then there are bureaucratic errors and \n     congressional negligence on a scale so vast that it is hard \n     to believe they can be accidental. The hundreds of millions \n     of dollars in unnecessary government payments to the student \n     loan industry in the past 18 months amount to such a scandal. \n     The loans in question, established in 1980, are guaranteed by \n     the government at 9.5 percent. Yet most students are paying \n     interest rates of 3.5 percent or less. The difference--all \n     taxpayers' money--is pure profit for the companies that have \n     taken advantage of a loophole in the law.\n       According to a recent report by the Institute for College \n     Access and Success, a nonprofit education think tank, \n     Congress had actually intended to end in 1993 the 9.5 percent \n     loan guarantee, one of many programs that provide incentives \n     for institutions to lend to students. In May 2003, one \n     company, Nelnet Inc., wrote to the Education Department to \n     confirm its intention to expand its holdings of old loans \n     with the 9.5 percent interest rate. Nelnet received no answer \n     from the department for a year, during which time the \n     department continued paying the company. In June of this \n     year, the department replied inconclusively--at which point \n     the company's stock price climbed 20 percent. Although Nelnet \n     is the largest holder of loans guaranteed at 9.5 percent--and \n     its holdings of such loans have increased by 818 percent \n     since January 2003--it is only one of many such lenders. \n     According to a preliminary Government Accountability Office \n     report, commissioned by Reps. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and \n     Dale E. Kildee (D-Mich.), 37 lenders receive payments for \n     loans with guaranteed interest rates of 9.5 percent, at a \n     government cost of $1 billion annually, and the volume of \n     such loans is rising.\n       Why wasn't the loophole shut long ago? Education Department \n     officials argue strenuously that only a two-year regulatory \n     process could have done so, and they didn't initiate one, \n     they say, because they thought Congress would deal with it. \n     Congressional Republicans say they expected to deal with the \n     problem in a comprehensive higher education bill, but that \n     has failed to pass (and in any case the proposed language \n     would not have ended all the payments). Yet, other solutions \n     could have been found: In the wake of revelations about the \n     scale of the payments, the House yesterday passed an \n     amendment to an appropriations bill, offered by Mr. Van \n     Hollen and Mr. Kildee, that would close the loophole \n     completely, albeit temporarily. (Of course, there is no \n     guarantee it will become law.) And one former Education \n     Department general counsel has written to the secretary of \n     education, Roderick R. Paige, arguing that the loophole could \n     have been closed immediately if officials had wished to do \n     so.\n       There could be other explanations for their reluctance. One \n     is that the president of Nelnet, Don R. Bouc--who has called \n     for the loophole to be shut and the money to be better used--\n     is well-connected enough to have been appointed to Mr. \n     Paige's advisory committee on student financial assistance. \n     Here is another: According to a report in the Chronicle of \n     Higher Education, Nelnet is the second-largest contributor to \n     congressional campaigns in the student loan history, beaten \n     only by industry giant Sallie Mae. Over the past 18 months, \n     the student loan industry has contributed about $750,000 to \n     the 49 members of the House Committee on Education and the \n     Workforce, of which $136,000 has gone to the committee \n     chairman, Rep. John A. Boehner (R-Ohio), and $175,000 to Rep. \n     Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon (R-Calif.), chairman of the \n     subcommittee on higher education. Mr. Boehner's spokesman \n     vehemently denies any connection between the contributions \n     and the issue and maintains that the committee's bill would \n     have fixed the problem, which was mentioned in the \n     president's latest budget. Still, it is difficult to \n     understand, given the sums involved, why neither Mr. Paige \n     nor Congress made this a higher priority.\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\n       For nearly a decade we have argued that Congress should \n     reduce subsidies for banks that lend to students, and instead \n     expand the direct-loan program, which provides about a \n     quarter of student aid--or else reform the system to make it \n     harder to manipulate. This scandal provides an excellent \n     reason to look again at these questions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for an 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts asked \nunanimous consent to have the New York Times editorial from today \nprinted in the Record. It clearly laid out the case for what is \nhappening today to taxpayers who are paying a tremendous price. And who \nis losing? It is our students.\n  We have to stop overcharging the American people. We still have time \nto do it this year and help students get to college at a time when we \nall know tuition rates are rising. We need to give more to get more \nstudents there.\n  I warn the Senate, the clock is ticking. Every Member of the Senate \nhas to decide if they stand with students and families and taxpayers, \nor if they are going to stand with the special interests. Millions of \nstudents and millions of families are waiting for this answer. We have \nto stop the special interest subsidy today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have a colleague who is \non her way to the floor. I ask unanimous consent she be entitled to 5 \nminutes and that we have 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask the Chair to remind me when I have 1 minute left.\n  I ask the Senator from the State of Washington, does she not agree \nwith me that this administration has the power to do something about \nthis, and could do something about it today, this giveaway that is \nwritten about in the prominent national newspapers as a giveaway to the \nbanks? Does she agree with me that the Department of Education has said \nwe don't have the authority, we don't have the power, we don't have the \nlegal ability to do something about it? Yet we have the General \nAccounting Office report:\n\n       Family education loan program, statutory and regulatory \n     changes could avert billions--\n\n  Hear that? Billions--\n\n     . . . in unnecessary Federal subsidy payments.\n\n  On page 8:\n\n       We disagree with the department's characterization of their \n     authority.\n\n  It seems to me, if this President were interested in protecting \nmiddle-income families, in avoiding the kind of continued wasteful \nsubsidy and giveaway to the banks, that the President, the Department \nof Education, this administration, could do something and do something \ntoday.\n  Would the Senator be willing to express an opinion on that?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely correct. The Department of Education could end this today \nwith a simple rulemaking procedure. Instead they are pointing fingers, \nsaying Congress has to do it. Congress had the opportunity in the \nAppropriations Committee last week. They said, no, we have to wait for \nan authorization 6 months from now. Every month that goes by we lose \nbillions of dollars in taxpayers' money and thousands of students don't \nget access to college. We don't need any more fingerpointing on this.\n\n  I think the Senator would agree that we don't need the Department of \nEducation pointing to Congress and Congress pointing to the Department \nof Education. We need to stop this now. The Department of Education can \ndo it by rulemaking and we can do it on any bill that comes before us. \nBut we need to do it and we need to do it quickly.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for her comments.\n  On August 27, Sally Stroup, Assistant Secretary for Education, said, \n``I don't think we have the legal authority to stop them.''\n  They made no effort to try to stop them. Senator Murray is leading \nthe fight in the Appropriations Committee to try to save the taxpayers \nand save middle-income families who are stretched with their tuition. \nNow we have the General Accounting Office saying they do have the \npower.\n  I wonder if the Senator would agree with me that we see a whole \npattern from this morning's newspapers about how the administration is \neffectively right in the tank for the powerplants with regard to \nmercury, coal-fired powerplants, and is now with the bank on student \nloans. We have seen it with regard to the HMOs. I am wondering who is \ngoing to stand up for working families and who is going to stand up for \nmiddle America.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Massachusetts is \nabsolutely right. This is outrageous. We have the Department of \nEducation pointing fingers at Congress when they can make a ruling and \nstop this practice today. According to all accounts, the delay of this \nis costing billions of dollars. If we wait for Congress to act on \nreauthorization of the act 6 months or longer from now, taxpayers are \ngoing to lose $2.8 billion in interest payments. We are in the Senate \nwhere we know that access to Head Start is critical, we know access to \ncollege is critical, and we know that $2.8 billion sent to the bank \ntoday means students are not getting higher education.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, when we made the commitment of No Child \nLeft Behind, we thought we were including all children. When this body \ncommitted to Medicare, we didn't say we are going to leave some senior \ncitizens out; we said all seniors. When we made a commitment to voting \nrights, we said voting rights for all Americans. When we made our \ncommitment to all children in this country, we meant all children.\n  There it is. This is not disputed. We are failing more than 4 million \nchildren. That is unacceptable, particularly when we find that this \nadministration is looking out for their special interests.\n  I think we have an opportunity to change that on election day, and \nhopefully will.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9483-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9483-S9486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, yesterday we heard a number of my \ncolleagues talk about their view of the economy and their view of the \nfiscal affairs of the country and their view that things are on a \npositive track. Today, I would like to respectfully offer the other \nside of the story and what I view as a very dangerous course the Nation \nis pursuing under the leadership of President Bush.\n  Earlier this year, on August 30, the President was on the NBC \n``Today'' show and the host asked him this question:\n\n       Let me ask you about deficits. This year, $445 billion. \n     Ballpark, do you think that's pretty good?\n\n  President Bush:\n\n       Yes. I do, I do.\n\n  That is an odd sense of accomplishment because that is the biggest \ndeficit in the history of the United States. The deficit that is now \nestimated to be some $422 billion we know is going to be larger because \nwe are funding some of next year's defense money this year because of \nmounting costs in Iraq. But even at the $422 billion figure, that is \nthe largest deficit in the Nation's history, and by a big margin.\n  Last year, under President Bush's fiscal plan, we had what was then a \nrecord deficit of $375 billion. Now it has increased to $422 billion. \nBut frankly, that understates how serious the situation is.\n  By contrast, if you go back to the Clinton years, each and every year \nof the Clinton administration the deficits were reduced and held for a \n3-year period. We actually ran budget surpluses. This President has \npunched us back into deficit, and by a country mile.\n  The Bush administration now claims that the deficits are coming down. \nThis is the budget director, OMB, chosen by President Bush. He says:\n\n       We continue to have deficits, even though they are coming \n     down dramatically.\n\n  I don't know what his notion of coming down is, but here is the \nrecord. The\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\ndeficits are not coming down. The deficits are getting bigger.\n  The last year of the Clinton administration, the first year of the \nBush administration, which is a budget that the President inherited, \nthe budget was in surplus by $127 billion. The next year, 2002, it went \nto $158 billion of deficit. That was the first year under the Bush \nadministration. The next year, $375 billion of deficits, then the \nlargest dollar deficit in our history. This year, it is $422 billion, \nand the President's budget director says the deficits are going down \ndramatically. What is he talking about? The deficits are not going \ndown. The deficits are going up.\n  The truth is the official deficit, what is called the deficit by the \npress, what is called the deficit by this administration, badly \nunderstates how serious the fiscal condition is of the United States. \nThe debt of our country is not going to increase by the advertised \ndeficit of $422 billion. This may come as a great surprise and shock to \nmany to find that the debt is going to increase by much more than the \ndeficit. But the truth is the debt of the country is going to increase \nby over $633 billion this year. The reason for the difference is they \nare not counting the $150 billion--roughly $150 billion--they are \nborrowing from Social Security, every penny of which they have to pay \nback. It does not get counted in the deficit calculation. If you add in \nthe money they are borrowing from Social Security, which they have to \npay back, the money they are borrowing from Medicare, which they have \nto pay back, the money they are borrowing from every other trust fund, \nwhich they have to pay back, the debt of the United States is going to \nincrease this year by over $630 billion. That is a staggering sum.\n  The Bush administration promised that deficits will be reduced in the \nfuture. President Bush in Annandale, VA, on August 9 of this year said:\n\n       So I can say to you that the deficit will be cut in half \n     over the next 5 years.\n\n  This is the same President who said, by the way, in his first year \nthere would be no deficits. In his second year, reporting to Congress, \nhe said the deficits would be small and short term. Both of those \nstatements were wrong and wrong by a country mile. Then he said they \nwould be small by historical standards. Wrong again; biggest deficits \nwe have ever had. Now he says don't worry, I am going to cut the \ndeficit in half over the next 5 years; wrong again.\n  Don't believe it because it is not going happen. The only way the \nPresident comes up with the claim that he is going to cut the deficit \nin half over the next 5 years is he leaves out whole areas of spending. \nHe leaves out finance costs for the war. In his previous budget, he \nleft out any war costs past September 30 of this year. He didn't put \nmoney in his budget; none.\n  Does anybody believe there is no war cost past September 30 of this \nyear? That is what the President said in the budget he sent up here.\n  He said there is no money needed to fix the alternative minimum tax \npast this year. Yet we know the alternative minimum tax, that affects 3 \nmillion people now and will affect 30 million people by 2010. That is \nthe old millionaire's tax that has now become a middle-class tax. My \nfriends, we all know Congress is not going to allow the alternative \nminimum tax to affect 30 million taxpayers. Yet the President provides \nnothing in his budget past next year--nothing.\n  In fact, if you go back and you put back the items the President has \nleft out--the money he is borrowing from Social Security that he has to \npay back; it is not in his budget; if you put in the money needed to \nfix the alternative minimum tax or the money for the ongoing war \ncosts--this is what emerges as a realistic analysis of what is going to \nget added to the debt and what the deficits are going to look like over \nthe next decade. Actually, this is conservative because we have left \nout a lot of things that are also being done by this administration \nthat will add to the debt. So this, too, understates how serious the \nsituation will become.\n  But even with this look, on just a limited number of items--the \nPresident's request for additional tax cuts, the President's need for \nadditional funding for defense, the President leaving out the cost of \nthe alternative minimum tax--you can see we are not going to see a \nreduction in the deficit in the coming years under the President's \nplan. No. The amount being added to the debt is going to increase, and \nincrease, and increase. What we see is an ocean of red ink over the \nnext decade.\n  Let me show you some of the things the President has left out as he \nhas structured his budget. As I have indicated, on the tax cut, he only \nshows now in his budget the first 5 years of the effect of the tax cut. \nBefore he submitted 10-year budgets; this year, just a 5-year budget. \nWhy? Because he did not want to disclose to the American people what \nall of us know is the pattern of his tax cuts.\n  Past the 5-year budget window, the cost of these tax cuts explode. \nThe President is hiding that from the American people with a 5-year \nbudget. He is doing the same thing with the alternative minimum tax, \nthe same pattern. The cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax \nexplodes. He only provided for 1 year of addressing the alternative \nminimum tax in his budget.\n  The war cost, it is the same pattern. The President has $25 billion \nhe supported in a reserve fund for next year, money, by the way, he is \nnot waiting to spend next year. He is spending it now. He is spending \nnext year's money this year. Even that dramatically understates what \nthe Congressional Budget Office says the cost of the ongoing wars will \nbe. He has $25 billion reserved in his budget. It was not in his \nbudget, by the way. The budget he sent up had nothing in it. But when \nCongress said that is not realistic, he supported Congress's move to \nput in a $25 billion reserve fund. But look what the Congressional \nBudget Office says the real cost is going to be: over $300 billion. It \nis not in the President's budget.\n  Of course, the President has left out the money he is borrowing from \nSocial Security. Mr. President, $2.4 trillion is being borrowed from \nSocial Security over the next 10 years, every penny of which has to be \npaid back. He has no plan to do so. In fact, he has a plan to add even \nmore costs by having a privatization of Social Security, or at least a \npartial privatization that would cost trillions of dollars more. From \nwhere is the money coming? From where is the money coming? It is all \nbeing borrowed.\n  Is anybody paying attention to what this administration is doing to \nthe fiscal policy of this country? Is anybody paying attention to what \nthis means to our economic future? Is anybody paying attention to what \nit means to our future military strength? You cannot be strong \nmilitarily if you are weak financially. This administration is digging \na deeper and deeper hole for this country on the financial front.\n\n  You remember, when the President unveiled his tax cuts, 3 years ago, \nhe said he was going to have maximum paydown of the Federal debt. Do \nyou remember that? He said he was going to pay off all of the Federal \ndebt that was available to pay off. But look what has really happened. \nThe debt is not being paid off. The debt is exploding. The debt that \nwas $5.8 trillion in 2001 we now anticipate will approach $15 trillion \nby 2014, and, of course, all of this is happening at the worst possible \ntime, right before the baby boomers retire.\n  Not only is the President borrowing every penny available to be \nborrowed from Social Security--and, by the way, he is doing the same \nthing with Medicare--he is also now borrowing from countries all over \nthe world. It may surprise people to find out that, under this \nadministration, the borrowing from Japan has risen to almost $700 \nbillion. We borrowed $167 billion from China; $130 billion from the \nUnited Kingdom. We have even borrowed over $90 billion from the \nCaribbean banking centers. The Caribbean banking centers, we are in \nhock to them for over $90 billion. South Korea--who would have believed \nit, who would have believed we have borrowed over $60 billion from \nSouth Korea? That is the reality. That is the hole that this President \nis digging.\n  Just in the last 3 years, this is the increase in foreign holdings of \nour debt. When the President came in in January of 2001, we owed $1 \ntrillion abroad. Now we are up over $1.8 trillion in indebtedness to \nforeign countries, an 80-percent increase in our foreign indebtedness \nin just 3 years.\n  If it was just what has happened so far I would not be so concerned, \nbut it is the direction this President is taking\n\n[[Page S9485]]\n\nus that has to be of foremost concern because the President's plan for \nthe future is more of the same and a whole lot more--a whole lot more \ndebt, a whole lot more in deficits. This fundamentally threatens the \neconomic security of the country.\n  This chart I show you is not a chart made by me or my staff; this is \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office. It is their analysis, assuming an \nextension of the President's tax cuts, the need for alternative minimum \ntax reform, maintaining current spending policies. Look where we are \nheaded. This is what CBO says will happen to the deficits and the debt \nof the country if, roughly, the President's budget policy is pursued.\n  In fact, this is just the deficit. I misspoke when I said debt. The \ndebt chart would be much worse than this chart. This is just the \ndeficit. This leaves out the money being borrowed from Social Security, \nthis leaves out the money being borrowed from Medicare--trillions of \ndollars that are not in the President's calculations at all.\n  This is a course that makes no sense. This is what the CBO Director \nsaid, because some around this town say we will just grow out of this \nproblem. This is what the Director of the Congressional Budget Office \nsays. By the way, this man came from the Bush administration. He came \ndirectly from the President's Council of Economic Advisers. This is \nwhat he said:\n\n       [T]his is a fiscal situation in which we cannot rely on \n     economic growth to cause deficits to disappear.\n\n  He is telling the truth. This is what the Federal Reserve Chairman \nsaid, Chairman Greenspan, who opposes deficit-financed tax cuts. \nEverybody knows Chairman Greenspan is a big fan of tax cuts but not \ndeficit-financed tax cuts. This is what he says:\n\n       If you're going to lower taxes, you shouldn't be borrowing \n     essentially the tax cut. And that over the long run is not a \n     stable fiscal situation.\n\n  But that is exactly what this President is advocating, not just for \nthis year, for every year for the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, what is the outcome of this set of policies? I think \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve is warning us of where this is all \nheaded. Back in February, he urged a cut in Social Security. Future \nbenefits must be curtailed. Now he has said, not only cut Social \nSecurity but cut Medicare, too.\n  I hope people are listening. I hope people are paying attention \nbecause that is exactly where the Bush fiscal plan is leading. It is \nleading to cuts--dramatic cuts--in Social Security and Medicare. That \nis where this is all headed. Why? In part, it is because the tax cuts \nthe President has gotten passed overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest \namong us; 68.7 percent of the benefits went to the top 20 percent. What \nis most startling is over a third of the benefits--right at a third, \n33.1 percent of the benefits--went to the top 1 percent, or the people \nearning over $337,000 a year. The people in the bottom 20 percent got \nvirtually nothing. Those in the middle class got pretty modest relief. \nThose in the middle 20 percent got 10 percent of the benefits. The top \n20 percent got 68 percent of the benefits. The top 1 percent, over 33 \npercent of the benefits.\n  Mr. President, when our colleagues say everything is going well in \nthe economy, they are living in a different economy than the one I am \nwatching. Look at the difference on this chart. This is what has \nhappened in the last nine recessions. The dotted red line is what has \nhappened to job growth as an average of the last nine recessions since \nWorld War II. This black line is what is happening this time. Do you \nnotice the difference? Something dramatically different is occurring \nbetween recoveries in the last nine recessions and this one. At this \nstage of the recovery, we would expect to have, based on what has \nhappened in the nine previous recoveries since World War II, 5.5 \nmillion more private sector jobs than we have this time.\n  Something is wrong. We have already seen 1.6 million jobs lost since \nJanuary 2001. These are the job loss numbers. We are still 1.6 million \njobs below where we were in 2001. The Chairman of the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers said we expect, sort of on average jobs in \n2004 to be 2.6 million more than jobs in 2003. For that to happen, we \nwould have to have monthly job growth of 1.725 million. But what we are \ngetting is 141,000. That is a jobs gap of enormous proportion. The hard \nreality is that the President's record on jobs shows a loss of private \nsector jobs for the first time since back to the administration of \nHerbert Hoover.\n  The President hates that comparison. In some ways, it is unfair \nbecause Hoover presided over the Great Depression. That is certainly \nnot the case now. We are not in a depression. We are not in a \nrecession. But the fact is that every administration since Hoover has \nseen private sector job growth--every single administration, except \nthis one.\n  The President's record on jobs, the President's record on the \neconomy, the President's record on deficits and debt is the worst \nrecord of any President we have had, certainly in my memory, because he \nhas taken a reckless fiscal course. We all know the story on \nmanufacturing jobs: 2.1 million manufacturing jobs were lost since \nJanuary of 2001. Now we get an economic report of the President in \nFebruary of this year saying they ought to consider changing the \ndefinition of manufacturing jobs. The way out of this is not to create \nmore manufacturing jobs, it is to change the definition of what is a \nmanufacturing job. Here is what the President's economic report said:\n\n       The definition of a manufactured product is not \n     straightforward. When a fast food restaurant sells a \n     hamburger, for example, is it providing a service or is it \n     combining inputs to manufacture a product?\n\n  Now, there are all kinds of ways to deal with a bad jobs record, but \nto try to redefine manufacturing as McDonald's manufacturing hamburgers \nis not going to sell.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't want to interrupt the flow. The \nSenator is going through a lot of numbers and statistics, and we owe a \ndebt of gratitude to Senator Conrad for this analysis. I would like to \ncome back to this deficit picture. I think these other numbers on jobs \nand so forth are in direct relation to our fiscal policies. There is a \ncorrelation because of our inability--and I am posing a question to the \nSenator--or unwillingness to make the kind of important investments \nthat any period of economic growth requires, which are obviously being \nadversely affected by the amount of debt we are accumulating.\n  I don't know if my colleague from North Dakota saw the same article I \ndid yesterday, which was the lead story in the World Business section \nof the New York Times in which the IMF chief sees potential hazard in \nU.S. fiscal policies. I quote:\n\n       ``We believe that such a large imbalance''\n\n  Talking about debt and deficit.\n\n       ``is a risk not only to the United States economy, but for \n     the world economy'' as well.\n\n  There are implications of allowing this fiscal situation to get so \nout of hand so quickly. As I recall it, in January 2001, we were \nlooking at 10 years of surplus of $5.6 trillion. We are told now that \nthe projections over the next 10 years of debt is somewhere around $3.5 \ntrillion.\n  My question is, what are the implications for the younger generation? \nWe have heard debate about death taxes. What about a birth tax here? \nWhat are the obligations of the children being born who are \naccumulating the debt that is occurring here? I wonder if he might \ncomment on the IMF story and what it means for a child born in the 21st \ncentury with this kind of debt, what sort of price tag have they been \nsaddled with as a result of the mismanagement of our fiscal economy?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is interesting. This is the second warning the IMF has \nissued this year about the U.S. deficits and debt. This is the second \ntime the International Monetary Fund has warned us and warned the world \nthat growing U.S. deficits and debt threaten not only our own economic \nsecurity but the world's economic security. Why? Because as the United \nStates accumulates more and more debt, at some point those dollars that \nwe are sending--that are being borrowed by us, money that is coming \nfrom China and Japan and, amazingly enough, South Korea--can you \nimagine that we have borrowed $60 billion from South Korea. At some \npoint, that money has to be repaid. How is it repaid? How can it be \nrepaid? Well, we have to reduce\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\nour standard of living in order to produce the funds to pay back the \nrest of the world.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I was stunned by those numbers. As I recall, \nI think you said that we have borrowed around $600 billion from Japan, \nabout $150 billion from China, and billions more from other countries. \nTo make the picture clear, that is like a bank holding a mortgage on \nyour home. They hold the paper on America. They can call due those \nnotes at any time, I presume, or within a reasonable time, and could \ninsist upon us paying back those obligations. So, in other words, our \neconomic well-being is in no small measure tied to the desires of \nnations that may not have the same goals as we do, either in economic \nor foreign policy. They hold the mortgage, in a sense, on our future; \nis that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is exactly correct. The foreign debt of the United \nStates under this administration has gone from $1 trillion to 1.8 \ntrillion, an 80-percent increase in our foreign indebtedness.\n  Mr. DODD. In 40 months.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In 42 months. I was teaching back home in North Dakota at \none of the universities, and I asked the students there: Does it make a \ndifference, should you care, does it matter to you that we owe Japan \nalmost $700 billion? Does it matter we owe China over $160 billion? \nDoes it matter that we have borrowed over $60 billion from South Korea? \nThey said it matters.\n  I said: How do you think it matters?\n  They said: If there is a military confrontation of some kind, maybe \nthat affects our ability to do things we might think is in the national \ninterest because we owe them so much money.\n  On trade, can we really call their hand when they are treating us \nunfairly in trade relationships when we owe them hundreds of billions \nof dollars? And what are the consequences here if all of a sudden we do \nreturn to economic growth and we have borrowed all this money and we \nhave to start paying it back, what is the effect on interest rates \nhere?\n  That is what frightens the International Monetary Fund. That is what \nconcerns people such as Chairman Greenspan. That as we see rising \ninterest rates because of this enormous indebtedness, and we have to \nstart paying more interest to keep getting people to loan us money, \nthat all of a sudden, the cost of servicing this debt will go up \ndramatically, it makes it much worse, and, more importantly, for the \neconomy--because we have millions of people who have variable interest \nrates on their homes, on their cars, on their student loans--these \ninterest rates will start going up dramatically because countries are \nless willing to continue to loan us money, and all of a sudden the \neconomic strength of America is weakened.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if I may further add, that is just the exact \npoint I wanted to raise with my colleague from North Dakota. We talk \nabout rising interest rates, and we are talking about some tax cuts. As \nI understand it, when we begin to talk about an interest rate hike, \nwhich we invariably are going to see, the actual cost of a college \nloan, a home mortgage, a car payment, or any other obligation which \nmost middle-income families have to borrow to meet these obligations--\nwe have watched higher education costs go up more than 30 percent; we \nhave watched health care premiums go up 45 percent; we have watched the \nprice of gasoline go up 20 percent; all under this President's watch. \nTo make those payments, it will actually exceed whatever tax cut we may \nbe providing to that middle-income family because of our inability or \nthe unwillingness of this administration to actually be more \nresponsible in managing the fiscal picture of this country, and average \nconsumers are going to see interest rate hikes that are going to dwarf \nany tax cut they may get; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. None of us can predict with clarity what is going to \nhappen with interest rates, although we know under this fiscal \ncondition, interest rates are going to go up. Clearly, that is going to \noffset, if not completely eliminate, the advantage of some of the tax \nreductions we get.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I know we are out of time. I ask for an additional 30 \nseconds to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am going to go right to the end of my \ncharts. Real median household income has gone down under this \nPresident. That is a serious problem for this country, a serious \nproblem for the middle class, and wages are falling behind inflation. \nThis is something which should concern all of us because we see wage \nincreases falling behind inflation. That is why people feel squeezed, \nand we have not seen anything yet if the fiscal policies of the country \nare not altered, if we do not begin to get back to fiscal balance to \nreduce the threat to the long-term economic security of our country.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to \nconclude my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues. Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for taking a little time to go over this issue. These \nare our choices. There are those who may think the path we are on is a \nreasonable and sound one, that these numbers really do not make any \ndifference. We hear that all the time: Deficits don't matter. My \ncolleague from North Dakota has laid out exactly why they do matter and \nwhy we are going to have to pay for these things and get our fiscal \npicture in shape, or we are going to pay an awful price.\n  When we think of the IMF warning countries about their economic \npolicies or fiscal policies, we are normally talking about third and \nfourth world nations. Here is the head of the IMF now telling the \ngreatest economy in the history of the world: You better get your act \ntogether; not only are you going to hurt yourself, but you are going to \nhurt the world economy.\n  In a few days, Americans have a choice to make, and the choice the \nSenator from North Dakota laid out is a clear one. Politics is about \nthe future. What the Senator is talking about is the future. I am tired \nhearing about debates 40 years ago. Americans want to know what is \ngoing to happen to their kids and grandchildren, and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota laid out the scenario that if we do not make the right \nchoices, it will cost us dearly.\n  I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9486-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9486-S9487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE TAX BILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are shortly going to have before us a tax \nbill that will increase the debt of this country by, in some estimates, \nmore than $1 trillion. This year's deficit that the President \nacknowledges is $430 billion. Of course, as we have learned here today \nin the presentation of Senator Conrad, the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, that doesn't take into consideration the cost of the war, \nnor does it take into consideration the fact that he is borrowing money \nfrom the Social Security trust fund. So the debt, of course, is closer \nto $600 billion, this year.\n  Today we learn from any newspaper we pick up that one way the \nPresident is going to try to save a few bucks is by going after the \npoorest of the poor. He is doing this by changing housing subsidies. I \nquote: ``The Bush administration is changing the fair market rent to \nsection 8 tenants. The Government pays tenants about 7 percent of this \namount. Here's a sampling in metropolitan areas.''\n  This sampling will cause the hair on the back of your head to come \nup. What has happened is, to help the President pay for all the things \nto help the rich of this country, corporate America, he is going after \nthe poorest of the poor. The poor in Boston, section 8 tenants, in a \none-bedroom apartment will lose 5 percent; in a four-bedroom apartment, \n27 percent. In Detroit, they will lose, in a one-bedroom apartment, 6 \npercent; a four-bedroom apartment, 21 percent. In New Haven, they will \nlose 4 percent on a one-bedroom, 21 percent on a four-bedroom; in \nTrenton, 18 percent on a four-bedroom; in Atlanta, 16 percent; in New \nYork City, 14 percent; in Philadelphia, 13 percent. On and on with \nthese slashes that affect the poorest of the poor.\n  I hope the people around this country are seeing what has happened to \nthe fiber of our country. We used to talk\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\nabout a safety net. There is no safety net anymore. It has been \neradicated in the last 4 years. Section 8 tenants in the major cities \nof America are going to really suffer. It is too bad. It is too bad \nthat the poor are getting poorer, the rich are getting richer, the \nmiddle class is becoming smaller and smaller. That is what this \nadministration has done to America.\n  I yield the floor, and any time I have left in morning business, I \nyield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9487-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LOBBYING ABOUT MEDICARE\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I felt compelled to come to the Senate \nfloor today to respond to something I read today that was in the \nnewspaper, the Hill, that relates to another effort to confuse people \nabout what happened with the Medicare prescription drug bill, the \nMedicare cards that I hate to even call discount cards because they are \nnot discounts. In fact, we are now seeing an effort to pay people to \nreach out and say something nice about the Medicare prescription drug \nbill and to get seniors to do it. Let me read to you some of this \narticle.\n\n       A Republican lobbying firm is offering healthcare \n     consultants almost $4,000 each to find senior citizens who \n     are willing to speak out in favor of the Medicare drug \n     discount card and write letters to Congress thanking members \n     for saving them money on pharmaceuticals.\n\n  Obviously, it is difficult to find people to do that, so now they are \npaying people to go out in the form of headhunters, if you will, to \nfind people who are willing to say something nice about the new \nMedicare prescription drug bill.\n\n       The DCI Group, a Washington, DC-based lobbying shop that \n     advertises to potential clients that it can treat ``corporate \n     issues like campaigns,'' is offering healthcare consultants \n     $3,750 plus expenses over six weeks [between now and the \n     election] to generate positive news stories about the drug \n     card and offer support to Congress for voting for the \n     Medicare drug law . . .\n       A recent e-mail sent from the DCI Group's Starlee Rhoades \n     to healthcare consultants says that the campaign will run \n     from September 15 to October 31 and that the client is \n     RetireSafe, which has sponsored the hiring of healthcare \n     consultants . . .\n\nto go out and say good things about the Medicare prescription drug \nbill.\n\n       The DCI Group represents the Pharmaceutical Research and \n     Manufacturers of America--PhRMA.\n\n  That is not surprising.\n\n       Tony Feather, who helped found the DCI Group, has close \n     ties to President Bush's top political adviser, Karl Rove.\n\n  Also not a surprise.\n\n       The DCI Group e-mail to healthcare consultants, obtained by \n     The Hill, stipulates a number of ``minimum deliverables'' \n     that come with the job of touting the drug card.\n\n  Or duties, if you will.\n\n       The e-mail says that RetireSafe wants seniors, families of \n     seniors and healthcare community leaders ``to send letters to \n     their congressmen and senators thanking them for supporting \n     the Medicare benefit, or asking for that support in the \n     future.'' [And by the way] ``We have help available to write \n     letters if the signer is not comfortable drafting the letter \n     entirely on their own.''\n\n  For $3,750 plus expenses, health care officials must be available as \nan expert source of information to the media and that community and \npersonally stop by the offices of their Congressman and Senators and \nthank them.\n  This is also very important as part of the deliverability. They must \nbring at least one senior or health care community leader to stand up \nat a townhall meeting and thank the lawmaker. I look forward to that.\n  The DCI group also asked the health care consultant to speak out on \ntheir own in support of the drug card.\n  Finally, every Wednesday from now until the 31st they are expected to \nsend a report to the DCI that answers many questions, including how \nmany events they attended. Did you speak in favor of the card and \nbenefit? How many health care leaders did you ask to stop by the office \nof their Congressman or Senators? And how many actually did.\n  Then it says you will be responsible for acting as a local \nspokesperson at community events and media to get health care \nprofessionals' opinions, which goes a long way in making the story seem \ncredible to the general public.\n  Reached yesterday, the lady involved initially denied she was \ninvolved in this campaign. But when told that her e-mail had been \ndistributed widely, she said, ``I can't talk about it.''\n  I feel compelled to talk about this and to take a moment and say that \n$3,750 will buy a lot of Medicare for seniors. In fact, I am tempted to \nactually encourage seniors in my State and around the country to offer \nto say something nice between now and the election because they can buy \na lot of medicine with this. That would be a better way to put it if, \nin fact, we were giving it directly to seniors.\n  The truth is, this was a good bill. If the discount cards were really \na discount, if the Medicare prescription drug bill was really good for \nseniors, you would not have to pay consultants $3,750 plus expenses for \n6 weeks. And the truth is, it doesn't matter how much you pay. Seniors \nknow. They are the ones who have to write the checks. They are the ones \nwho have to go to the counter every day and every month to look at what \nthe bill is and decide if they walk away with their medicine or leave \nit there at the counter. They are the ones who decide whether they take \nthem every other day, cut them in half, share them with their spouse, \nmaybe don't get the medicine, pick it up today or get their medicine \nanother day.\n  This is real for people. No matter how many consultants are paid \n$3,750 plus expenses, people know. It is unfortunate that there are \nthose who underestimate the intelligence of older people in our \ncountry, their families, or the disabled. They know.\n  I hear stories every day of people who have gone to the Web site for \nMedicare and tried to wade through all of the cards--up to 70-some \ndifferent cards--to figure out how to get some kind of discount. Then \nthey look at prices continuing to go up.\n  I had a lady the other day tell me she bought the card, paid $25, and \na couple of weeks later the medicine she was taking no longer had the \ndiscount, and she didn't get her money back.\n  People know. That is the great thing about our country. It doesn't \nmatter what you have or how much you spend. People know whether they \nare better off. People know what is really happening.\n  We need to get about the business of getting this Medicare \nprescription drug bill right. We need to go back and do it over again, \nand do it right. Pharmacists need to have the ability of doing business \nwith pharmacists in Canada who can really cut prices in half. Then we \ndon't have to pay consultants $3,750 plus expenses to go find the \nsenior citizen who would say something nice about a Medicare bill. \nPeople would say it because it would be true and it would be real.\n  But in the meantime, I say to folks who are today trying to figure \nout who to pay for their medicine, you might want to try offering, \nduring the next 6 weeks, to say something nice about the Medicare bill \nfor $3,750 plus expenses. I know it would buy my mom a lot of medicine. \nIt would buy a lot of folks a lot of medicine, and it would be a better \nway to spend it than have more lobbyists trying to tell folks something \nthat is not true.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GOSS TO BE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to begin consideration of Calendar No. \n815, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Porter J. Goss, of \nFlorida, to be Director of Central Intelligence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 6 hours of \ndebate on the nomination equally divided between the chairman and vice\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\nchairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any quorum \ncalls that take place during the consideration of the Goss nomination \nbe charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to confirm Mr. Porter J. Goss, of Florida, to be the next \nDirector of Intelligence.\n  On August 10, 2004, President Bush nominated Porter Goss to be the \nnext Director of Central Intelligence, or the DCI. In doing so, the \nPresident stated that Mr. Goss ``is a leader with strong experience in \nintelligence and in the fight against terrorism. He knows the CIA \ninside and out. He is the right man to lead this important agency at \nthis critical moment in our Nation's history.''\n  The Goss nomination was received in the Senate on September 7. On \nSeptember 14 and September 20, the Select Committee on Intelligence \nheld extraordinary open hearings on this nomination that were televised \nand widely covered in the press.\n  At the September 14 hearing, Mr. Goss was introduced to the committee \nby both of Florida's distinguished Senators, Bob Graham, former \nchairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, and Bill Nelson, who \nis well known to the Intelligence Committee as an interested and \ninformed supporter of our efforts.\n  That both Florida Senators reached across the aisle to support this \nnomination is a testament to the wide bipartisan support that it does \nenjoy.\n  After 2 days of thorough and wide-ranging public hearings, the Goss \nnomination was placed before the Intelligence Committee membership for \na vote yesterday morning.\n  In yet another impressive display of bipartisanship, the committee \napproved the Goss nomination and ordered it reported in a vote of 12 to \n4. At this time, I would like to congratulate the Intelligence \nCommittee members of both parties for their sober, penetrating, and \nthorough consideration of this nomination. The committee's handling of \nthis nomination is very much in keeping with the bipartisan spirit that \nhas animated its work during a very difficult year of challenges in the \nglobal war on terrorism in Iraq and in other areas around the world.\n\n  This bipartisan spirit did produce important steps forward, such as \nthe committee's report on Iraq WMD, in understanding intelligence \nproblems and gaps and also making recommendations in that regard.\n  As such, the committee's work will certainly help Mr. Goss as he \nstrives to make the intelligence community better and to produce the \nbest possible intelligence product. I want to say I also appreciate Mr. \nGoss's efforts during his 2 days of public hearings to respond to \nmembers' concerns and questions. He took these hearings very seriously \nand with attention to detail demanded by consideration for a position \nthat has in the past been part of the Cabinet.\n  In my opinion, during his confirmation hearings Mr. Goss showed the \nqualities we want to see in a good DCI. They are coolness under \npressure, a willingness to look at alternative views and, very \nimportantly, a willingness to ``take a few licks'' for past judgments.\n  Most important of all, he demonstrated his ability to put the \nlawmaker's so-called partisan hat aside and take up the strictly \nnonpartisan duties of this critical executive branch office.\n  As I noted at Mr. Goss's first public hearing on September 14, the \nrole of the Director of Central Intelligence is of paramount importance \nto the security of this Nation. It is also one of the most challenging \njobs in the executive branch today.\n  Obviously, this Nation is currently engaged in a war not only in \nIraq, not only in Afghanistan, but elsewhere around the globe. In this \nwar, for the most part there are no trenches. There is no barbed wire. \nThere is no well-defined no man's land. On the contrary, in this war of \nshadows and darkness, intelligence defines the front line and indicates \nits weak points and gaps.\n  Recently, a distinguished former National Security Adviser remarked \nto Senators that during the last 3 years our world has changed \ndramatically. In the old world, the threats were posed by nation states \nand organized military forces. In our new world, the greatest threats \nmay be domestic. These threats may come from nation states and their \nagents and terrorist groups such as al-Qaida. Organized military \nconflict is only one of many threats.\n  In our new world, we are not fighting against nation states but \nagainst a network of disparate terrorist groups that operate not only \nin the shadows but at times right in our own midst. Whether Afghanistan \nor Iraq or here at home, defeating this enemy depends primarily upon \nthe ability of our intelligence services to locate, to penetrate and, \nyes, to destroy the terrorist cells. We are involved in a world war \nwhich requires timely and actionable intelligence to ensure victory and \nthe safety of the American people.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence is personally responsible for \nproducing this intelligence. As we fight Islamic terror, other global \nthreats continue to menace our Nation, and among them are these: The \ndevelopment of nuclear programs by adversary regimes such as those in \nIran and also North Korea; the steady transformation of the People's \nRepublic of China into a power capable of challenging our interests \nbroadly and exercising influence over the region; and the continuing \nworldwide expansion of WMD technology.\n\n  The Director of Central Intelligence is also responsible for \nproducing intelligence to keep the President and policymakers informed \nabout these threats.\n  And if that were not daunting enough, Mr. Goss has been nominated for \na position which in all probability may not exist for much longer. As \nSenators know, the President and many in the Congress now support the \ncreation of a new national intelligence director. There has been a \ngreat deal of discussion among my colleagues about reform. Above all, \nwe must ensure that a national intelligence director is something more \nthan a weak and ineffective figurehead.\n  Most of the debate outside the Intelligence Committee has centered on \nhow to grant increased authority to the new national intelligence \ndirector while leaving the structural status quo undisturbed.\n  Many on the Intelligence Committee believe this is simply unworkable. \nIn other words, significant structural change is vital to real reform. \nI believe strongly that we must create a new structure. This new \nstructure must accommodate the diverse activities of our intelligence \nagency by giving direct responsibility and control of primary \nintelligence disciplines and the corresponding agencies to a truly \nempowered national intelligence director and his assistants. And true \nempowerment includes both budget authority and line authority to direct \nand control the activities of the intelligence activities. One without \nthe other may leave us with an intelligence head who can neither \nsucceed nor be held accountable, and that would be a most unfortunate \noutcome.\n  We don't know how or when reform will finally be enacted. Until then, \nhowever, we need a strong Director of Central Intelligence with the \nnecessary skills to manage a community which needs reform. Porter Goss \nunderstands these issues. As chairman of the House Intelligence \nCommittee he helped create momentum for reform.\n  Porter Goss will be a good man to have in the intelligence community \ndriver's seat as Congress, in cooperation with the executive branch, \ngoes through the consideration of major reform. His unique background \nwill serve him well as he meets these and other challenges while \ndirecting our intelligence community.\n  For over 40 years, Porter Goss has been serving his Nation, his \nState, and his community. As an Army intelligence officer, a \nclandestine CIA case officer, a newspaper man, a county commissioner, a \nU.S. Representative, and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, \nPorter Goss has done his duty with skill, with honor, and with \nintegrity. I believe, and Members on both sides agree, that his \nexperience makes him uniquely suited to serve as the Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  I have known Mr. Goss personally for 16 years. I served with him in \nthe other body, the House of Representatives. I have worked with him on \na weekly\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\nbasis since I joined the Intelligence Committee. I have formed a strong \nopinion about his fitness to lead the intelligence community.\n  One of Porter Goss's most important characteristics is that he does \nnot ride in a partisan posse. In that sense and in many others, the \nPresident has selected an outstanding public servant to be his \nprincipal adviser on intelligence.\n  In concluding my opening statement on the Goss nomination, I would \nlike to underscore an important point. If, as I earnestly hope, the \nSenate approves this nomination today, this body will not simply have \nperformed a routine pro forma duty. On the contrary, Porter Goss's \nconfirmation as the DCI represents perhaps the most important changing \nof the guard for our intelligence community since 1947. This \nconfirmation represents a fresh start for our Nation's intelligence \ncommunity. He will be the first Director of Central Intelligence in a \nnew and hopefully better intelligence community. It is not the same \nentity that George Tenet inherited when he was confirmed by this body 7 \nyears ago.\n  It is not the same entity that existed on September 10, 2001. The \nintelligence community has undergone vitally important changes since \nthe terrorist attacks of 2001. These changes are the result of many \nfactors: statutory requirements, Executive orders, and other major \nchanges in policy. That snapshot that we took of the intelligence \ncommunity back on September 10, 2001, and the snapshot today is much \nbetter in terms of improvement. A key factor is the vigilance and \ndedication of the intelligence community rank and file, to include \nthose men and women who, today, as I speak, are putting their lives at \nrisk in remote and dangerous places to protect our Nation.\n  Still other changes are on the immediate horizon as Congress \nconsiders major intelligence reform. So let us understand clearly what \nwe do here today. Porter Goss, as the new DCI, will lead a new \nintelligence community into a new chapter. Senate confirmation of \nPorter Goss does not mean simply painting a new name on the mailbox at \nLangley. It represents the opening of a new era for the intelligence \ncommunity. The errors and omissions of Iraq are well known. They must \nbe corrected.\n  Steps have been taken and will be taken to ensure that. The errors \nand the omissions of 9/11 are very clearly and thoroughly described in \nboth the joint inquiry that was conducted by the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, the House Intelligence Committee, and the 9/11 Commission \nReport.\n  These errors and omissions must and will be corrected. Porter Goss's \ntask will be to build, inspire, and open a new chapter in our \nintelligence activities. We must never forget the errors of the past or \ntheir human cost. Likewise, we should not dwell on them or allow them \nto paralyze us. We must grapple with them and overcome them. That is \nwhat is happening now, with structural intelligence community reform. \nPorter Goss's task will be to open the new chapter and lead the \nintelligence community into that fresh start.\n  Today, perhaps our highest legislative priority is to repair what is \nbroken in the intelligence community. We must not let this laudable \ndesire immobilize us.\n  John McLaughlin, the Acting Director, has done a professional and \ncommendable job as the Acting DCI. He, no less than the rank and file \nof the intelligence community, needs long-term, permanent leadership, \nand we need it now.\n  One of the concerns voiced by the 9/11 Commission was that it takes \ntoo long to put key intelligence community officials into place. In the \ncase of this nomination, I believe the Senate definitely got the \nmessage. The watch word for this nomination since the beginning has \nbeen goodwill and bipartisanship. As I stated at the beginning, \nSenators Graham and Nelson of Florida introduced and strongly endorsed \nthis nominee at his first confirmation hearing. We had an impressive \nbipartisan vote on this nomination in the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, the \nHonorable Ms. Jane Harman, has pointed with pride to her committee's \ninvolvement in intelligence reform under Mr. Goss's chairmanship. \nExpressions of support for this nomination have come from both sides of \nthe aisle and both sides of Capitol Hill.\n  This nominee is ready to go to work and he is needed. I urge the \nSenate to confirm him as soon as possible. I, personally, and I think I \nspeak for the members of the Intelligence Committee, look forward to \nworking with Porter Goss, the next and possibly last DCI.\n  I understand the vice chair is waiting to speak, but I ask his \nindulgence to permit Senator Chambliss to speak first.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. How much time does the Senator request?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I request 7 minutes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield him such time as he would consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from West \nVirginia allowing me to go before him. The leadership that the chairman \nand the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee have \nprovided has been unparalleled in this difficult time in the history of \nour country. Both Senators have conducted themselves in a very \nprofessional way and have brought continued honor and dignity to the \nSenate Intelligence Committee in a bipartisan way, and I want to \npublicly commend both of them for their leadership.\n  I rise today in support of the nomination of Porter Goss to be the \nDirector of Central Intelligence. There is no more important time in \nthe history of our country, from an intelligence perspective, than we \nare in today. Porter Goss has been nominated by the President to be the \nchief intelligence officer for the United States. Porter Goss brings to \nthe office an unparalleled wealth of experience and knowledge relative \nto intelligence matters. Porter Goss has been a friend of mine for 10 \nyears, and I bring to this argument and this debate a little bit \ndifferent perspective than any other Member of this body because I \nserved in the House of Representatives for 8 years with Porter Goss, \nthe last 2 as a member of the House Intelligence Committee under the \nchairmanship of Porter Goss.\n  During the last 2 years as a Member of the Senate and as a member of \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have continued a \nrelationship with Porter Goss in the intelligence community. Both \nbefore September 11 and subsequent to September 11, I have seen Porter \nGoss in the trenches doing the kind of work that lawmakers have to do \nrelative to their day-to-day jobs. Nobody has provided stronger \nleadership on the issue of intelligence than Porter Goss has, both \nbefore September 11 as well as after September 11, and more \nsignificantly after.\n  As I think about the arguments that have been brought forth in the \npublic hearings over the last couple of weeks regarding Mr. Goss, the \nprimary thrust of the negative arguments have been that he is too \npartisan and too political to carry out the job of the DCI.\n  Well, I will say this about this man for whom I have so much respect: \nI have seen him in an atmosphere of committee work. I have seen him in \nan atmosphere of social work. I have seen him in an atmosphere of \noperating on the floor of the House of Representatives. Certainly, \nthere is nobody who is a stronger advocate for his position on any \nissue than Porter Goss. He is very direct. He is very plain spoken, and \nit is pretty obvious which side of the issue he is on. But he always \ndoes his arguing in a very respectful way, and in a way which advocates \nhis position but does not get into personalities. Unfortunately, that \nis where the partisanship occurs in both this body and the body across \nthe U.S. Capitol.\n  Porter Goss has conducted himself in a professional and nonpartisan \nway as chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, as well \nas a member of the Rules Committee and otherwise in the U.S. House. He \nis a strong advocate for his positions but he is not a partisan person.\n  I will discuss very quickly why I feel so strongly about his \nbackground and what it brings to the table relative to his \nconfirmation. Porter Goss started out early in his career as a military \nintelligence officer in the U.S. Army. He then moved into the realm of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency and was a\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\nclandestine officer for the CIA in two different overseas posts. He \nknows the people within the CIA. A number of individuals who he served \nwith during his CIA years are still employees at the CIA. He knows not \nonly the organization, but he knows the personalities, and he knows the \nkinds of people who are led, and the kinds of people who need to lead \nat the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Porter Goss followed his time as an Intelligence Officer in the field \nwith 8 years as chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence. \nHe has covered the spectrum from an intelligence perspective. He has \nbeen on the ground as an Army intelligence officer, and the Department \nof Defense is the largest customer of the CIA. He has been at the \nground level of the CIA, where the real work is done and where the real \nintelligence is gathered, by being a clandestine officer within the \nCIA. Then in his years as chairman of the House Select Committee on \nIntelligence he has been in a position to provide oversight for the \nwork that not only he did as an active member of the intelligence \ncommunity but following, particularly, post-September 11 he has \nprovided the oversight and been critical where he needed to be \ncritical, and yet complimentary where he needed to compliment the \nintelligence community relative to the work they were doing.\n  I don't know of anyone else who has the same diversified background \nas a soldier, a clandestine case officer, and a legislator as does \nPorter. It is pretty obvious that his background and vast experience \nare two of the main reasons why the President selected Mr. Goss to be \nthe next Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Porter Goss is a personal friend and he is somebody for whom I have \ngreat respect. I know what kind of family man he is, I know the \nstrength of his character, and I know his dedication to duty, which is \nwhy he accepted the nomination to become our next DCI. I also know the \nwealth of intelligence background he will bring to the table as our \nnext DCI.\n  The main point I want to conclude with is the fact that we are in a \nvery complex world. We are in a world where intelligence matters. We \nare in a world where we need to have the cooperation of our allies \naround the world to collect intelligence against common enemies and \ncommon threats.\n  I have been with Porter Goss when he has had meetings with numerous--\ntoo many to detail--heads of the intelligence communities of our \nallies, both abroad as well as here in Washington. I have seen the \nrapport and the relationship he enjoys with these individuals. I have \nbeen to other countries around the world to meet with the heads of \ntheir intelligence agencies, and the first question they will ask is \nnot how am I doing but, ``How is my friend Porter Goss doing?'' He has \nan unparalleled relationship with the intelligence community around the \nworld--not because he is just a good guy but because they respect him \nfor the work he has done and they respect him for the knowledge and the \nexperience he brings to the table relative to the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  I strongly support the nomination of Porter Goss to be the next \nDirector of Central Intelligence. I ask my colleagues to review the \nrecord on Mr. Goss, listen to the debates, but at the end of the day I \nhope we will send a resounding message to the President, and that is: \nYou have picked the right man. Let's confirm Porter Goss as Director of \nCentral Intelligence and move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may use to the \ndistinguished Senator from Missouri, a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished chairman.\n  It is a pleasure today to rise in support of Porter Goss to be \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency. The Senate Intelligence \nCommittee has done its due diligence. It has done its duty with regard \nto examining the nominee's fitness and qualification for the post of \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency. His nomination should be \napproved without delay.\n  Much of the work that goes on in the Intelligence Committee is \nconducted in confidence because of the need to maintain \nconfidentiality. But I will say that the thorough hearings we had on \nCongressman Goss were similar to the thorough hearings we have had on \nall of the subjects brought under the jurisdiction and supervision of \nour distinguished chairman from Kansas, along with the ranking \nDemocratic member from West Virginia.\n  There is no question that there is a lot of important work awaiting \nthe new Director of Central Intelligence. Somebody has to be in charge. \nWe are at war with those who seek to destroy us and all freedom-loving \npeople's way of life.\n  Whether we have a new national Director of Intelligence, whether we \nhave a CIA Director with expanded powers or limited powers, the fact \nremains that we need to move forward with the nomination of Porter \nGoss.\n  We have a long way to go to hash out what kinds of changes we are \ngoing to make to the organization of the intelligence committee. The \nmore I hear, the more I watch other committees working, the more \ndivergence of opinions I see. Whatever structure we have, we need \nsomebody to control intelligence and make sure we put it on the right \npath.\n  A cornerstone of our fight in the war against terrorists, as well as \nother challenges that confront us, is the paramount need for timely and \nactionable intelligence to ensure good policy decisions, to ensure \nadequate preparation for actions that we may take, and to ensure \nvictory for our forces that are deployed in the real-life battles \nagainst those who threaten us or threaten national security. Our \nnational security depends on the ability of intelligence services to \nlocate, penetrate, identify targets, and/or destroy terrorist cells.\n  In addition, we need a Director of Central Intelligence who will keep \npolicymakers informed about other global threats facing our Nation. \nAnd, yes, while we are looking at the war on terrorism, we need to be \nconcerned about and following developments about the possible nuclear \nprogram advances or missile advances in Iran and North Korea, the \nsteady growth of troubling developments in other major world powers, \nand the continuing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \ntechnology.\n  The intelligence community needs a leader right now, the support of \nthe President, and the support of this body who has the experience \ncoupled with a commitment to reform. I am convinced that Porter Goss \npossesses these qualities. He was a former intelligence officer, a \nformer CIA clandestine officer, and as chairman of the House \nIntelligence Committee, where he probably also went in harm's way to \nhandle that post, Porter Goss clearly knows the intelligence business \nand has the experience.\n  As cochairman of the joint House-Senate inquiry into the 9/11 \nintelligence failures, he is intimately aware of the problems currently \nexisting within the intelligence community's ability to counter \nterrorists. He is someone who will work with the Congress and the \nadministration to implement needed reforms.\n  Mr. Goss has also earned the respect of his colleagues and fellow \npolicymakers on both sides of the aisle. One of the most, if not the \nmost important principles that applies to our intelligence community \nand our oversight should be our nonpartisanship.\n  Porter Goss has been praised by his Democratic colleagues year after \nyear for being nonpartisan on national security.\n  Senator Graham of Florida said of Porter Goss, in our hearing:\n\n       He is uniquely qualified to be here today as the \n     President's nominee to serve as the Director of Central \n     Intelligence. . . . He is a man of great character, unusual \n     intelligence, a tremendous work ethic and an outstanding \n     personal and professional standard of integrity.\n\n  Senator Graham also went on to say:\n\n       In addition to those personal qualities, when it comes to \n     the intelligence community, Congressman Goss has, in my \n     judgment, a balanced perspective, a perspective gained both \n     as an insider and then as an outsider. For a decade, early in \n     his career, Congressman Goss served our Nation in both the \n     Army and the CIA. He knows firsthand the value and the risk \n     of clandestine operations.\n\n  I could cite many other statements by leaders in both bodies. Senator \nBill Nelson of Florida, last month, said of Representative Goss:\n\n\n[[Page S9491]]\n\n\n       He's a class act. Goss combines all of those \n     characteristics, which are kind of somebody I like.\n\n  My colleague and friend from Missouri, Representative Ike Skelton, \nthe minority leader on the Armed Services Committee, said, in 1997, \ntalking about the work on the intelligence authorization bill:\n\n       I salute both the chairman, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. \n     Goss], and the ranking Democrat, the gentleman from \n     Washington [Mr. Dicks] for their dedicated and bipartisan \n     work.\n\n  I believe he can work on a bipartisan basis. In addition, Porter Goss \nunderstands the endemic deficiencies within the intelligence community. \nThere can only be true, meaningful changes if there is a solid \nunderstanding of why change is necessary. Porter Goss understands what \nis broken and is determined to work with us to fix what needs to be \nfixed and not to mess with what does not need to be fixed.\n  There are some glaring problems we identified in our report on the \nprewar intelligence on Iraq. One of them was the poor state of human \nintelligence. That is spies on the ground, HUMINT as it is called in \nintel-speak. We did not have any. What a disaster. We also have \nproblems in collection in general, analysis, and the consistent \nproblems with information sharing. These are problems that Porter Goss \nhas, during his tenure as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, \ndevoted himself to improving.\n  As Chairman Roberts mentioned in yesterday's open session, Porter \nGoss held over 62 hearings on intelligence community reform issues this \nyear.\n  Under Chairman Goss's leadership, the House Intelligence Committee \nadvocated changes and added resources annually to address the \nintelligence community's most pressing problems, especially those \nrelated to HUMINT and analysis.\n  His commitment to reform forced the CIA to repeal its restrictive \ninternal guidelines that had a ``chilling effect'' on HUMINT \noperations. He attempted to refocus CIA analytic resources toward \nlonger term, predictive, strategic intelligence, and directed that more \nattention be paid to language training, breaking down stovepipes, and \nenhancing information sharing.\n\n  I can tell you, the stovepipes still exist. We still have \nbureaucracies that only want to share information up and down within \ntheir little fiefdoms, and we need somebody in charge who is willing to \nbreak down those barriers and make sure sensitive information is shared \non a need-to-know basis.\n  Porter Goss was a member of the Aspin-Brown commission which was \nformed to assess the future direction, priorities, and structure of the \nintelligence community in the post-Cold-War world. The commission made \na number of recommendations, including looking how to streamline the \nDCI's responsibilities and give him more flexibility in managing the \nintelligence community.\n  Those who question Porter Goss's commitment to change must remember \nthat his leadership and dedication to intelligence community reform is \napparent in his work on the ``Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community \nActivities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, \n2001.'' This report contained 19 recommendations. It laid the \nfoundation for the 9/11 Commission recommendations--the changes that \nhave been the subject of much discussion in the press over the last \nseveral months.\n  Those who question Representative Goss's commitment to reform as well \nas his commitment to operate independent of the current administration \nshould recall that Mr. Goss took the initiative to introduce his \nintelligence reform legislation on June 16 of this year, H.R. 4584, \nwhich called for significant changes in the intelligence community \nstructure in addition to providing a DCI or DNI the much needed \npersonnel and budgetary authority required to be a truly effective \nleader. It should be noted that Porter Goss's legislation did not fall \nin lockstep with the recent Executive order issued by the President, \nthus proving that Mr. Goss will take the necessary bold steps to do \nwhat is right for the community.\n  I quoted Senator Nelson of Florida earlier, but he also said of \nPorter Goss:\n\n     . . . Congressman Goss is someone whose public life has been \n     illustrative of being nonpartisan, fair and independent.\n\n  When Porter Goss was pressed to defend past partisan statements \nbefore our committee, he acknowledged there are times on Capitol Hill \nwhen partisanship will rear its head. That is, unfortunately, part of \nthe job. However, he told our committee the following:\n\n       I well understand that I am leaving one arena and, if \n     confirmed, heading to another arena that operates completely \n     differently where partisan politics are not part of the job.\n\n  A considerable record has been created, embracing both substantial \ncomment on Porter Goss on his nomination and several commitments by him \non intelligence matters involving counterterrorism and other important \nactivities. I stress again the importance of approving Mr. Goss's \nnomination at this time of paramount importance in the intelligence \ncommunity. I hope my colleagues will join with the chairman, with me, \nand other members of the committee in extending him our support.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, the nomination of Representative Porter Goss to be the \nnext Director of the Central Intelligence Agency comes, obviously, at \nan absolutely critical time in our Nation's history.\n  The documented intelligence failures prior to the terrorist attacks \nof September 11 and leading up to the war in Iraq have left the \nintelligence community's credibility bruised and their image tarnished, \nwhich none of us wants.\n  The community's objectivity, their independence, and their competency \nhave been called into question. That is fair in some cases. As a \nresult, a bipartisan call for reform has steadily grown to the point \nwhere the Congress is on the threshold of passing landmark legislation, \nI believe and I hope, to create a stronger, better managed intelligence \ncommunity before we adjourn this year. I do not think we should stretch \nit out and wait. I think we should do it, and do it now.\n  The next Director of Central Intelligence will be the most important \nperson for that position ever confirmed by the Senate. Our decision on \nwho should lead the Central Intelligence Agency, and the other 14 \nintelligence agencies, according to the law, should not be a \nrubberstamp job.\n  The importance of this position requires a thorough examination of \nthe nominee's record and his ability to carry out the weighty \nresponsibilities of the job.\n  As I have indicated, never before in the 57-year history of the \nintelligence community has there been such a need for a Director of \nCentral Intelligence with unimpeachable character, proven leadership \nand management experience, and strong national security credentials.\n  The new Director will face, in my judgment, no fewer than four major \nchallenges: waging an unrelenting offensive clandestine campaign \nagainst al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations around the world; \nsupporting ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq; \nmanaging an intelligence community in a state of transition; and, \nrestoring the intelligence community's lost credibility.\n  The next Director of Central Intelligence must be extraordinarily \nqualified in order to successfully carry out these and other national \nsecurity tasks.\n  I simply say all of this to say the stakes are enormous. Perhaps most \nimportantly, the next Director of Central Intelligence must be \nnonpartisan, independent, and objective. This standard is not simply \nthis Senator's; it is what the law, the National Security Act law, \nrequires specifically in language.\n  I know of no other position of importance in Government requiring \nthat independence, objectivity, and non-partisanship as a requirement \nfor confirmation. The very first responsibility of the Director of \nCentral Intelligence under the National Security Act--and these are the \nwords--says that his advice to the President, the executive branch, the \nmilitary, and the Congress must be timely, must be objective, and must \nbe independent of political considerations, and based upon all sources \navailable to the intelligence community. That is the law.\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\n  I have reviewed Representative Goss's record closely. I have gone \nover his writings and his speeches of the past 10 years. We have just \ncompleted two open hearings, which I thought were good hearings, in the \nIntelligence Committee, where Representative Goss was asked questions \nabout his past record, his commitment to reform the intelligence \ncommunity, and his ability to be forthright, objective, and \nindependent.\n  Representative Goss is, without question, qualified in many respects. \nHe is a fine person. I have been able to work with him well over the \npast few years--that is not one of the requirements, but it happens to \nbe true--both in the joint congressional inquiry into 9/11, and also in \nHouse-Senate conferences. His past employment with the Central \nIntelligence Agency, doing extremely dangerous work, and his 7-year \ntenure as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, have given him \nboth an insider's and outsider's perspective of the intelligence \ncommunity. There is no doubt that he is an extremely knowledgeable \nperson with respect to the inner workings of the Central Intelligence \nAgency and the other agencies he is nominated to manage.\n  But Representative Goss's record is troubling in other regards. I \nwish to speak about them. He has made a number of statements relative \nto intelligence matters--many in the past year--that are, in fact, \nhighly partisan and displayed a willingness on his part to use \nintelligence issues as a political broadsword against members of the \nDemocratic Party. Again, ordinarily, that is kind of routine around \nhere, but with respect to the Director of Central Intelligence, that \nshould not be and cannot be according to the law. When taken \ncollectively, this list of partisan statements and actions on \nintelligence matters raise a serious doubt in my mind as to whether \nPorter Goss can be the type of nonpartisan, independent, and objective \nnational intelligence adviser our country needs.\n  What is the public record of the person the President has nominated \nto be the next director of the CIA? Has he been independent, objective, \nand nonpartisan on intelligence issues, again, as required by law?\n  In March of this year, Representative Goss coauthored an intelligence \nop-ed piece entitled ``Need Intelligence? Don't ask John Kerry.'' In \nthis political attack piece, he made a number of highly charged \npolitical allegations relating to intelligence spending. These are \nquotes from the Congressman:\n\n     . . . when Democrats controlled the Congress, the cuts were \n     deep, far-reaching, and devastating to the ability of the CIA \n     to do its job to keep America safe.\n       . . . during the Clinton years, the Intelligence Community \n     was given a clear message that if they failed in politically \n     risky operations . . . there would be no backing from the \n     Clinton White House or the Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\n  And then Representative Goss targeted Senator Kerry, who he claims \n``was leading the way to make deep and devastating cuts in the \nintelligence community's budget'' and ``was leading efforts in Congress \nto dismantle the Nation's intelligence capabilities.'' Severe \ncriticism. A few months later, in a June 23, 2004 statement on the \nfloor of the House, Representative Goss claimed that ``the Democratic \nParty did not support the Intelligence Community.'' And in the same \nJune floor debate, he offered the following justification for his \nclaim:\n\n       My comment is that when there was opposition to \n     intelligence and, year after year, efforts to cut the \n     intelligence budget, they did come from the Democratic side \n     through the period of the 1990s.\n\n  I have gone back over the record and determined that Representative \nGoss's election year claims mischaracterize the intelligence record of \nboth the Democratic Party and Senator Kerry, in my judgment. He also \nfailed to point out his own record as a member, and eventual chairman, \nof the House Intelligence Committee during this time. Had he stated the \nintelligence record factually, it would have taken the sting out of his \npolitical attacks and created an entirely different picture than the \none he painted.\n  It is true that during the first two years of the Clinton \nadministration, the intelligence budgets declined. That is true. This \nwas a period of deep cuts in almost all areas of Government, as we \ntried to grapple with the legacy of the previous 12 years of \nuncontrolled deficits. Over the next 6 years, however, the Clinton \nadministration's budget increased every single year for intelligence. \nDuring that 6-year period, fiscal years 1996 to 2001, Republicans \ncontrolled both Houses of Congress, and the Congress cut the \nPresident's request in 1996, 1997, 1998, and 2001. In 1999, the \nRepublican-controlled Congress initially cut the intelligence budget, \nbut then passed a large one-time supplemental appropriation.\n  In fiscal year 2001, the Republican-controlled Congress returned to \nits pattern of cutting intelligence funding. After the 9/11 attacks, \nCongress once again passed emergency supplemental funding. By that \npoint, the Democrats had a majority of the Senate--briefly.\n  Representative Goss voted for every Intelligence authorization bill \nand every Defense appropriation bill during this period. So he must \nhave thought that the so-called underfunding President Clinton was \nrequesting was acceptable.\n  Now, I want to look at exactly what Senator Kerry proposed in 1994, \nand I want to contrast that with a bill, H.R. 1923, introduced by \nRepresentative Solomon that had as its first cosponsor Congressman \nGoss.\n  In 1994, Senator Kerry introduced a bill to cut the deficit by $45 \nbillion over 5 years--at a time when Congress was searching for ways to \nundo the 12 years of uncontrolled deficits under the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations. Senator Kerry's proposal would have rescinded $1 \nbillion from the 1994 Intelligence appropriations and then increased \nintelligence spending over the next 4 years by the inflation rate. \nRepresentative Goss's proposal in 1995 would have cut not less than 4 \npercent of the personnel from all intelligence agencies in each of the \nfollowing 5 years. After the initial cut in 1994, Senator Kerry's \nproposal would have provided significantly more funding for \nintelligence than was appropriated by the Congress controlled by the \nRepublicans, beginning with the fiscal year 1996 budget.\n  Representative Goss's proposal, on the other hand, would have \nresulted in dramatically lower intelligence funding and, in fact John \nKerry's proposal would have resulted in $8.8 billion more for \nintelligence than Congressman Goss's lead-cosponsored bill.\n  And worse, all of the cuts Representative Goss proposed in 1995 would \nhave been achieved by firing 20 percent, by law, of America's \nintelligence officers at the very time the terrorist threat from al-\nQaida was growing. In fact, had the Congress followed the Goss plan, \nthe intelligence community would have had tens of thousands fewer \nintelligence officers in the year 2000: fewer intelligence collectors \nin the CIA, NSA, and elsewhere; fewer intelligence analysts across the \ncommunity; fewer intelligence officers in the military service; and \nfewer counterterrorism officers in the FBI.\n  The Goss plan would have made, using his own words, in fact, ``deep \nand devastating cuts in the intelligence community budget.'' But this \nyear, an election year, Representative Goss chose to level that charge \nagainst the Democratic Party as a whole and Senator John Kerry by name. \nWhy? When asked at the nomination hearing to reconcile these facts with \nhis charge that it was the Democrats who did not support intelligence, \nRepresentative Goss simply said, ``The record is the record,'' about \nfour or five times. He also refused to admit that his accusations might \nhave been in error.\n  When asked whether anyone from the White House or the President's \nreelection campaign asked him to write the March editorial and to give \nthe June floor statement against John Kerry, he said he couldn't \nrecall.\n  Representative Goss's unwillingness to be forthright in his answers \non this matter were troubling to me and a number of my colleagues on \nthe committee. His dismissive answers to tough, but as I said \nrepeatedly, I thought fair questions lacked candor.\n  I was left with doubt that as Director of Central Intelligence, he \nwould have a forceful and independent voice on intelligence assessments \nthat do not necessarily support a political agenda, if there is one, of \nthe current President.\n  There are other instances where Representative Goss, as chairman of \nthe House Intelligence Committee, played the partisan blame game. It is \nagainst the law for the Director of the CIA to\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\nbe involved in such. That was then. He is being confirmed now. Does \nthis man's life change completely after 15 years from partisanship to \ntotal nonpartisanship?\n  In 1999, when it was disclosed that the Chinese espionage efforts \nagainst our Department of Energy weapons laboratories may have resulted \nin loss of sensitive nuclear weapons design information, a counter-\ninvestigation was begun, eventually resulting in charges being brought \nagainst Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee.\n  Representative Goss repeatedly laid the blame for this espionage \nactivity on the Clinton administration's failure to protect national \nsecurity. In the final days of the 2000 Presidential election campaign, \nRepresentative Goss took to the House floor and stated:\n\n       We have in the Clinton-Gore administration seen a cultural \n     disdain for security.\n\n  Again, Representative Goss's statements on important intelligence \nissues mischaracterized the record in the attempt to score political \npoints.\n  The Cox Commission, which Porter Goss served on as vice chairman, \nfound that the security problems at the Department of Energy weapons \nlaboratories predated the Clinton administration and that the Chinese \nespionage collection program against the weapons lab began in the \n1970s.\n  The Cox Commission report also noted it was the Clinton \nadministration that issued Presidential Decision Directive 61 requiring \nthe Department of Energy to improve counterintelligence programs.\n  Evidently, mentioning these points was not helpful to Representative \nGoss when he was making sweeping statements about ``a cultural disdain \nfor security,'' which is highly offensive to me as a Democrat who is \nvice chairman of the Intelligence Committee, and I think all \nRepublicans and all Democrats care desperately, seriously about what \nhappens in intelligence.\n\n  In the rush to assign partisan blame, Representative Goss ignored the \nrecord. In a number of other statements, Representative Goss \nerroneously singled out the Clinton administration and congressional \nDemocrats for cutting human intelligence programs in the 1990s that, in \nturn, he said, limited the intelligence community's ability to carry \nout its mission.\n  Yet it was Representative Goss himself who said in 1998 that human \nintelligence collection programs needed to be cut by the time the 1990s \nbegan. His comment specifically was:\n\n       I am convinced that the U.S. clandestine service, the CIA \n     Directorate of Operations was in the mid to late 1980s too \n     large.\n\n  When the identity of Valerie Plame, an intelligence officer with the \nCIA whose clandestine identity is protected by law from unauthorized \ndisclosure, was leaked and published by columnist Robert Novak, \nRepresentative Goss was asked whether the disclosure warranted \ninvestigation. His response was stunning. He said:\n\n       Someone sends me a blue dress and some DNA, I'll have an \n     investigation.\n\n  The whole basis for the law protecting the identity of covered \nintelligence community employees from being disclosed is to protect the \nlives of American intelligence officials that are endangered if their \ntrue identity is known to our adversaries.\n  As a former CIA case officer and chairman of the House Intelligence \nCommittee, Representative Goss knows this. For him to make such a \nstatement, with its clearly implied shot at President Clinton, was \nwrong, inappropriate, and insensitive to the gravity of the matter. I \nhope Representative Goss, if confirmed by the Senate to lead the CIA, \nwill have a more serious attitude toward the outing of CIA employees \nundercover.\n  When Richard Clarke, the coordinator for counterterrorism for the \nNational Security Council from 1993 to October 2001, provided testimony \nto the 9/11 Commission that was clearly damaging to Bush administration \nclaims, Representative Goss, and others, questioned his integrity and \nclaimed he may have lied before the joint congressional inquiry in \nclosed session, vowing to declassify his testimony to prove it.\n  These claims were never substantiated, and when the National Security \nCouncil forwarded to Chairman Goss, as requested, a declassified \nversion of Richard Clarke's testimony on June 25, nearly 3 months ago, \nhe took no action to publicly release it so that allegations of perjury \nand the like could be laid to rest.\n  While the Senate voted to support the creation of the independent \nNational 9/11 Commission, which eventually became the Commission led by \nGovernor Tom Kean and Representative Lee Hamilton, Representative Goss \nopposed the measure on the House floor.\n  When the Senate and House Intelligence Committees met in the fall of \n2002 to conference this issue, he continued to oppose the creation of \nan independent 9/11 Commission stating that the issue would be decided \n``above my pay grade.''\n  When the Senate Intelligence Committee undertook an investigation \ninto the use of intelligence--not the collection, analysis, and \nproduction of intelligence, but when you hand it to policymakers--the \nuse of intelligence by the administration officials prior to the war as \npart of our broader Iraq intelligence inquiry, Representative Goss made \ndisparaging comments about two Democratic Senators in particular who, \nlike many others in this body, are profoundly concerned about the \nveracity of public statements made about the U.S. intelligence agency, \ncalling them ``two old attack dogs gumming their way through artificial \noutrage about something they should know a lot more about and be more \nresponsible about.''\n  What makes this particular criticism curious is Representative Goss's \nlack of action on the issue of pre-war intelligence. Despite assurances \nover a year ago that the House Intelligence Committee was evaluating \nthe intelligence community's performance on Iraq since the end of the \ngulf war, Chairman Goss failed to issue the promised report on the \nfailures and mistakes leading up to the war.\n  Chairman Roberts and I, in a thoroughly bipartisan fashion, did so in \na 17-to-0 vote. I think we are both proud of that, and justifiably so, \nalong with our colleagues on the committee. The House produced nothing. \nThey produced press releases, but nothing else.\n  When both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, as committees with shared jurisdiction, began \nholding difficult but necessary oversight hearings into the improper \ntreatment and interrogation of prisoners in Iraq, Representative Goss \nviewed our actions with disdain, saying:\n\n       I am not comfortable with what the Senate is doing . . . I \n     do honestly question whether or not they have balance over \n     there on this issue . . . We've got a circus in the Senate, \n     which is always the likely place to look for this circus.\n\n  Porter Goss chose to denigrate the Senate's investigation, while the \nHouse chose to largely ignore the matter and not ask the tough \nquestions about what happened inside Abu Ghraib prison and at other \ndetention facilities in Iraq or elsewhere.\n  All too often, Representative Goss's statements and actions as \nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee seemed designed to protect \nthe administration by avoiding contentious issues which could be \nembarrassing to the administration and placing blame on Democrats for \nshortcomings in the intelligence community.\n  Not surprisingly, one thing missing from Representative Goss's \nrecords is any public statements on intelligence critical of Members of \nhis own party or the administration. During his nomination hearing, \nRepresentative Goss assured the committee that these partisan \ninclinations of the past would not prevent him from carrying out his \nduties as Director of Central Intelligence. He said he understood the \nDirector must be an independent adviser to the President and the \nCongress, beyond reproach and beyond the reach of politics.\n  While I appreciate his testimony and commitment to being a \nnonpartisan Director of Intelligence, I cannot say with absolute \ncertainty that he will be exactly that. I must vote on his record. I \ncannot vote on his promise, and I do not think the Senate should. His \nrecord is his record. He said it.\n  The truth is, Chairman Goss and I have a very good working \nrelationship, one that I expect will continue and improve in the \nfuture. We had a good exchange in recent days, even during difficult \nnomination hearings. In contrast to those who wish to gloss over this \nissue, Porter Goss himself understands exactly the dilemma that I and\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\nmany of my colleagues face with this nomination. He knows this is one \nof only a handful of positions in the entire U.S. Government that \nrequires by law nonpartisanship and objectivity, and in this case the \ndemand is all the greater because it is about our national security.\n  Porter Goss openly acknowledged in his testimony before the committee \nthis week that he has at times approached national security issues with \nexcessive partisanship, and he expressed regret about that. And I \nrespect that. I believe Porter Goss knows that in essence, on this \nwhole question of independence, he is asking us to take it on faith, so \nto speak, that he can make a clean break from the last 10 to 20 years \nof his political career.\n  I hope he is right. I very much want him to be right about that, but \nat end of the day I do not think taking it on faith is enough for this \nvice chairman of the Intelligence Committee when it comes to such a \ncritical position of Director of Central Intelligence. It does not meet \nthe legal standard, and it does not meet my obligation, in my judgment, \nas vice chairman.\n  These are troubled times for the intelligence community in our \ncountry. In so many ways, we are still recovering from the tragedy of \n9/11. We are grappling with the tragic impact of flawed and exaggerated \nintelligence leading up to the war in Iraq, and we are struggling still \nto understand the truth about what is happening in the world.\n  Just yesterday, our President surprised and shocked many of us by \ndismissing outright the highest level of consensus view of the \nintelligence community when he said they were ``just guessing'' about \nthe gravity of the situation in Iraq.\n  In light of all of this, I believe I owe it to the men and women of \nthe intelligence community to send a clear and strong signal about the \nparamount importance of independence and objectivity. It needs to be \nsaid not only in words but in action. So I will vote against the \nnomination of Porter Goss to be the next DCI.\n  I sincerely hope Porter Goss will prove my vote wrong, and I told him \nthat. In fact, I intend to work with him in order to help him prove me \nwrong. But based on his record of partisanship, based on the dictates \nof the law, and based on my own strong conviction against mixing \npolitics and intelligence at the CIA, I must vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in beginning my comments, I first want to \ncommend the chairman, Senator Roberts, for the way in which he \nconducted the hearing. He was eminently fair. I believe I had five \nrounds of questions myself for the nominee, and I want to express my \nappreciation to the chairman for the way he conducted the hearings, and \nalso express my thanks to Senator Rockefeller. His leadership on the \ncommittee has been invaluable to me.\n  I also want to commend the vice chairman for an excellent statement \nthis afternoon, much of which I agree with, as he knows.\n  Porter Goss is a good man and a good Congressman, but his long record \nof supporting business-as-usual intelligence policies is not good \nenough to warrant his appointment as CIA Director at this dangerous \nhour. Mr. Goss showed that on his watch, as chairman of the House \nIntelligence Committee, he passed on virtually every opportunity to \nmove aggressively for reform. His commitment to public service is \nunquestioned, but his unwillingness to displease the powerful to force \nchange in our intelligence community is unfortunate.\n  In the committee, there were three major areas that came up as we \nsought to evaluate the nominee. The first, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia has talked about today, has been the issue of \npartisanship. The second area at which the senior Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, looked at some length, was the question of the \nnominee's ability to objectively analyze intelligence. The third was \nthe area that I focused on, which was why the nominee has been so slow \nto push aggressively for intelligence reform.\n  I have come to the conclusion that it is possible--and we have all \ntried, as the Senator from West Virginia has said, to give one the \nbenefit of the doubt in these various areas. I have come to the \nconclusion that I can give the nominee the benefit of the doubt on the \nissue of partisanship. I can give the nominee the benefit of the doubt \nwith respect to his pledge to be objective in analyzing intelligence. \nBut I just cannot get over the answers we were given during almost 9 \nhours of hearings with respect to why the nominee was so slow to be an \nagent for change in the intelligence community.\n  It is really that leadership that I find so central. I have tried, as \na member of the committee, to be as bipartisan as I possibly can. We \nunderstand politics should stop at our borders. We all stand ready to \nput in place the policies necessary to protect America's security, but \nto do that we need leadership.\n  I and others try to be bipartisan. Senator Lott, Senator Snowe, \nSenator Graham, and others sought, for example, to change the way \nGovernment documents are classified. I think that is an important \nissue, to make the right structural changes in intelligence. But if we \ndo not get the right information, information consistent with national \nsecurity and not classified for political purposes, we are still going \nto have problems making reforms in the intelligence area.\n  I want to be bipartisan. I listened carefully to the questions that \nwere asked in the committee, good questions by Senator Rockefeller, and \nI am willing to give the nominee the benefit of the doubt with respect \nto the partisanship issue.\n  But I will tell you, the answers that we were given with respect to \nwhy it took the nominee so long to push for changes in the intelligence \ncommunity still leave me unconvinced. For example, at one point in our \nhearings the nominee told me it was difficult to get attention to the \nissues of intelligence on his watch. He said the reason he had not \nintroduced legislation is that people were not focused on it; it was \nhard to get people's attention.\n  Let's think about what happened in those years when we evaluate the \nnominee's response on that question. Porter Goss was chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee in 1998 when al-Qaida bombed our embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania. He was chairman of the Intelligence Committee in \n1999 when the United States was investigating allegations of Chinese \ntheft of our nuclear materials. He was chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee when the USS Cole was bombed by al-Qaida in October of 2000. \nAnd, of course, he was chairman of the House Intelligence Committee \nwhen we faced 9/11.\n  It took him nearly 3 years to introduce reform legislation after 9/\n11. I believe that is not good enough. I believe a chairman of a key \ncommittee can get attention when that chairman wants to use that \nchairmanship as a bully pulpit to be an agent for change. I believe a \nchairman who is committed to intelligence reform has the chance, when \nhe bangs his gavel, to speak out for why changes are needed.\n  A leader must lead. We all get election certificates, in the U.S. \nCongress, to try to tackle problems, important problems, but chairmen \nhave a special opportunity. If you look at the long record--and he said \nthe record is the record--the nominee passed on virtually every \nopportunity to use his bully pulpit, to use his gavel, and to work for \nthe kind of changes that would make this country as safe as necessary.\n  We, all of us, understand it takes courage to rock the boat. It takes \ncourage to be an agent for bold change. But if you want an example of \nan individual who did it, an individual who is a prominent Republican, \nyou need look no further than former New Jersey Governor Tom Kean and \nhis performance as the Chair of the 9/11 Commission. This stalwart \nRepublican made truth his only goal. He pressed Republicans and \nDemocrats alike to do the same. He was more successful and has already \nbegun to engineer more change than hardly anybody thought possible in \nthis fractured political climate. What a boon it would have been, had \nwe had the same commitment to change on the issue of intelligence, \nintelligence reform, by the current nominee to head the CIA.\n  The current nominee had a front row seat during all those years, the \nyears I\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\noutlined when those terrible acts of terrorism occurred, when he could \nhave pushed for reform. Yet after weeks of going through the nominee's \nrecord and 2 full days of questioning, I am hard pressed to find \nanywhere--in a bill, a vote, or an inquiry--anything that demonstrates \nthe nominee will hold people accountable, for example, rather than just \ngoing along with the status quo.\n  The record shows, to me, again and again, the nominee chose to play \nit safe rather than take the risks necessary to bring about change in \nthe intelligence community. When I looked at Mr. Goss's record, the \nfirst question that occurred to me was could he give us some examples, \nsome concrete examples of when he was willing to stand up, to go \nagainst the popular wisdom and even his own party to bring about \nchange; whether he was willing to take the far less dangerous risks \nthat we take as Congressmen and elected officials than lots of other \npeople do, certainly those wearing the uniform.\n  Right now, we need somebody to head the CIA who is willing to stand \nup, who is willing to help this country come up with policies that \nleave the Cold War mentality behind--those are fit for a very different \nkind of threat--and to hold himself and others accountable.\n\n  Mr. Goss has a long, distinguished career as a Member of Congress. I \nknow him personally. I served with him in the other body. It would be \nhard to find a more decent individual. I will say there are very few \njobs in the Government of our country at which I don't think Porter \nGoss would do a good job. But being effective here on Capitol Hill and \nin other parts of the Government is not where I set the bar for this \nkey appointment. The bar ought to be set very high because we know we \nhave great challenges ahead of us.\n  For example, I have come to the conclusion that on the intelligence \nreform legislation we, hopefully, will be dealing with on the floor of \nthe Senate shortly, it may not be the structural problems that are our \ngreatest challenge in improving intelligence and making our country \nsafer. I think there is more to it than moving the boxes around on an \norganizational chart with respect to intelligence. I think this is as \nmuch a people problem as a structural problem. If you are going to \nsolve those problems, in the area of people, human interaction, you \nhave to have leadership, you have to have somebody who is willing to \nstick his or her neck out.\n  That is where I set the bar. I think the long record and the \nquestions I asked established beyond a doubt that Porter Goss is a good \nman. He has been a good legislator. But there simply is no evidence \nthat he is willing to rock the boat in the intelligence community, \nwhich I think is necessary to make this country as safe as it needs to \nbe.\n  For that reason I join the distinguished vice chairman of our \ncommittee in opposing the nomination. Like the vice chairman, I am very \nhopeful I will be proved wrong. As I said, on the issue of \npartisanship, on the issue of objectivity of analysis, I give the \nnominee the benefit of the doubt. With respect to his willingness to \nfight aggressively for bold change, I remain unconvinced. For that \nreason I will oppose the nominee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The distinguished Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield as much time as he may need to a valued member \nof the Intelligence Committee, the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I believe Porter Goss is the right \nman certainly in this crucial time in the history of our intelligence \ncommunity.\n\n  Porter Goss spent over a decade at the CIA. He had the opportunity to \nsee it from the inside, to work there in a distinguished career. For \nthe last few years, he has had the opportunity to serve in the \nCongress, to serve on the Intelligence Committee in the House, and then \nfor the last few years as the chairman. I think it is significant that \nhe has been the chairman for the last few years at the same time many \nof us have served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, when the force \nof history has compelled all of us to examine as we have never done \nbefore the role of the intelligence community in the world we live in \ntoday, a world confronted by the failures of the intelligence \ncommunity, where we have taken a magnifying glass for the last several \nyears as Members of the House and Members of the Senate to see exactly \nwhat is wrong with the intelligence community. There has only been a \nhandful of people who have had that experience. Some of them are in \nthis room today.\n  Porter Goss has distinguished himself in that exercise as chairman of \nthe House Intelligence Committee, as the leader in the House when we \nwent through the joint Senate-House investigation. I had the chance to \nwatch him through that endeavor. I had the chance to watch him learn, \nas all of us did, about the tragedy of September 11 and how the \nintelligence community did not function the way we want it to function.\n  In Porter Goss we will have someone who knows the community from the \ninside, but also has stood back, been on the other side, been on the \noutside, and has looked at it to see what is wrong, and has looked at \nit in a critical time in our history. I think that is so very important \nas we begin the task as a country and he begins the task as the new \nDirector of the CIA to bring about needed reform.\n  This is a tough job, but I believe Porter Goss is a tough man. I \nbelieve he is the right man. Some people might say this is an \nimpossible job. I do not know if it is an impossible job, but it is a \nvery difficult job. Let us think about it for a moment.\n  This is the man who walks in to see the President every morning, \nwalks in to the Oval Office and greets him, gives him the intelligence \nreport. I think we all understand there has to be a chemistry between \nthe President and the Director; that if there isn't, that \nrelationship--and we have seen that in the past with Presidents and \nDirectors, sometimes there isn't that relationship--if there isn't that \nrelationship, they do not talk and the country suffers.\n  There has to be a relationship of trust, of confidence. Yet that same \nman who comes in to see the President every morning where there has to \nbe that relationship, that trust, that rapport, is also a man who has \nto tell the President what the President does not want to hear; a man \nwho has to have the guts to do it; a man who has to look the President \nin the eye and have the guts to tell the President of the United \nStates, the most powerful man in the world, Mr. President, that is not \nthe way it is; or maybe a more difficult thing to say, Mr. President, \nwe messed up, we were wrong 6 months ago or 3 months ago, what we told \nyou was not right; or maybe this is the toughest thing of all to say to \nthe President, Mr. President, we don't know.\n\n  And when we look at some of the problems, some hypothetical, some \nfactual, some of the things that occurred, those have been some of the \nproblems. That man has to also be able to look at the President of the \nUnited States and say, Well, here is what we think it is, but also \nthere are people in the intelligence community who have a minority \nview. That man has to have the guts to tell the President that as well. \nThat is a difficult job.\n  This man also is the person who protects us every day in this world \nbecause he is the one who has to be in charge of putting together all \nof the intelligence. And today it is the intelligence that protects us \njust as much as our national defense. The facts he comes up with, our \nintelligence community comes up with, are our first line of defense \ntoday. Yet we are telling this man today, if you get this job, at the \nsame time you are carrying on this war on terrorism and you are \nproviding these facts, we expect you to go as fast as you can to carry \nout reform.\n  Further, we tell this man that he has to deal with whatever today's \ncrisis is. What we are focused on, of course, is terrorism today. But \nhe has to deal with the long-term crises--nuclear proliferation, what \nis going on in China, you pick the challenge. He has to be 5 years out, \nor 10 or 15 years out, and he had better not get it wrong.\n  This is a new era for the CIA, a new era for the intelligence \ncommunity which came to maturity in the Cold War, the Soviet Union \nversus the United States. We sort of understood in those decades when \nwe developed that\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\nintelligence community. Official cover worked pretty well. The new head \nof the intelligence community has to continue that change, continue to \nchange away from that. We have to move out from the official cover to a \nnonofficial cover. That is just one of the changes that has to take \nplace. It is a tough job.\n  I think when you vote on someone's confirmation, a lot of this is \nkind of a gut check. You don't know what the exact issues are going to \nbe in the future. This is an intensely personal job, as I have pointed \nout. The person who runs the agency, I suspect we are going to end up \ngiving a lot more power. If Porter Goss is confirmed, he may end up \nwith an entirely different job later on. He is going to run a big \nintelligence community, but it is also an intensely personal job in \nthat relationship with the Congress and that relationship with all of \nthe consumers. And the ultimate consumer, of course, being the \nCommander in Chief, the President of the United States.\n  I think it gets down to a lot of the person. What do you think of \nthis guy, or woman if that be the case? Can they handle it?\n  I think it is helpful to talk to some of the persons who know this \nperson best. I was struck by the testimony of the two Senators from \nFlorida, Senator Bob Graham, of course, the senior Senator, but also \nsignificantly the chairman of the Select Intelligence Committee of the \nSenate, and a pretty harsh critic of the intelligence community and of \nthe administration. This is what he had to say:\n\n       Let me say at the beginning that I am not unbiased. I \n     believe that Porter Goss is an exceptional human being and \n     will be an exceptional head of our Central Intelligence.\n\n  Senator Graham also said:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I have known Porter Goss for well over two \n     decades, and I can tell you from personal experience that he \n     is uniquely qualified to be here today as the President's \n     nominee to serve as the Director of Central Intelligence. He \n     is a man of great character, unusual intelligence, a \n     tremendous work ethic, and an outstanding personal and \n     professional standard of integrity.\n\n  Senator Graham added that as Governor of Florida, when he first met \nthe nominee:\n\n       Party affiliation did not matter then. What was necessary, \n     good men and women who could carry out a difficult task.\n\n  My colleagues, I believe party affiliation does not matter today. The \nchallenge that Porter Goss, on a much magnified scale, will face as \nDirector of Central Intelligence is very analogous to the challenge he \nfaced 20 years ago in restoring integrity to his local community and \ncompleting a very complex project.\n  As to Porter Goss's fitness to serve as an independent, unbiased DCI, \nthis is what Senator Graham of Florida said.\n\n       . . . when it comes to the intelligence community, \n     Congressman Goss has, in my judgment, a balanced perspective, \n     a perspective gained both as an insider and then as an \n     outsider. For a decade, early in his career, Congressman Goss \n     served our Nation in both the Army and the CIA. He knows \n     firsthand the value and the risk of clandestine operations. \n     Since he has been in Congress, especially as a member and \n     chair of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, he came to know the agencies from an oversight \n     capacity.\n\n  Senator Graham continued:\n\n       Some have said he is too close to the intelligence \n     agencies, that he would be too protective of the status quo. \n     Well, most of you served with Porter and myself on the joint \n     inquiry into the events of 9/11. I believe you would join me \n     in saying from that experience Porter is a man who will be \n     independent in his judgments and unflinching in his criticism \n     where he believes they are necessary.\n\n  Senator Graham concluded with these words:\n\n       I am confident he will not be a part of the problem but \n     rather a leader in taking us toward principled, thoughtful \n     solutions when it comes to reforming the intelligence \n     community. I strongly recommend the confirmation of Porter \n     Goss.\n\n  Senator Bill Nelson also participated in the September 14 Goss \nconfirmation hearing. These are some of the things Senator Nelson had \nto say:\n\n       I think we need intelligence reform. I think we need it \n     now. And I think Porter Goss is the man to lead the effort.\n\n  Senator Nelson also called Porter Goss:\n\n       . . . a uniquely gifted individual whose public life has \n     been illustrative of being nonpartisan, fair, and \n     independent.\n\n  The Senator further pointed out that:\n\n       Those characteristics in this town that is so highly \n     charged with partisanship are sorely needed in a Director of \n     Central Intelligence.\n\n  Those statements are from his two colleagues on the other side of the \naisle from Florida.\n  I think sometimes it is good to know and talk to people who know \nsomeone best.\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, let me conclude by saying I \nhave known Porter Goss for a long time. I have dealt with him on issues \nnot just in the area of intelligence. Sometimes you get to know people \nin the Senate and the House working in Congress on a variety of issues.\n  Porter Goss and I had shared a tragic situation when we had \nconstituents, hemophiliacs who acquired AIDS because they had to take \nmassive amounts of blood because of their condition. The blood was \ntainted. It is a long story. I will not go into it now. But the blood \nwas tainted because we thought there was an error made by the Federal \nGovernment, that the Federal Government did not become involved early \nenough, that the Federal Government made mistakes.\n  I had constituents. I listened to their tragic story. Porter Goss \nlistened to some constituents of his. So we both moved in our \nrespective bodies to try to bring about some help for these folks. I \nsaw how compassionate he was and how strongly he felt about the issue \nand what he did about it and how he took that passion and feeling he \nfelt for those folks in wanting to do something about it. I worked with \nhim. I traveled with him to Haiti, the poorest country in this \nhemisphere. I have seen his compassion for the people of Haiti.\n  I have worked with him on the Intelligence Committee. I will be \nhonest with you, I have had the occasion, many times, to pick up the \nphone and call across the Capitol and ask Porter: What is really going \non in the intelligence community? What is really going on at the CIA? I \nwill tell you, each time he had an insight that was unrivaled, or \nrivaled by very few people I have talked to, of what was really going \non inside the intelligence community. That is an insight that came \nabout from his years of experience inside the community and his years \nof experience of watching the community in the oversight capacity while \nbeing on the committee and of being the chairman.\n  He has a passion and an understanding of the intelligence community \nand of what needs to be done to change it. He understands the \nimportance of human intelligence. Long before it was fashionable in \nthis town to be saying, oh, we have to have more human intelligence, \nPorter Goss was pushing, pushing, and pushing the intelligence \ncommunity for more human intelligence.\n  It may not have been flashy, it may not have been with a lot of big \nspeeches, but he was there. He understood it. He understood what the \nneeds were. This man gets it. If you want someone to lead the reform of \nthis community, if you want someone who understands what the problems \nare, who can do it from the inside, if you want someone who will have \nthe guts to report to the President of the United States and tell it \nlike it is, Porter Goss is your man.\n  So, Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor today to recommend \nto my colleagues, based on my personal experience with this man, what I \nhave seen over the years, that we vote for his confirmation. He has a \ntough job and, yes, it may be almost an impossible job, but I think he \nis the right man at the right time at this point in our history.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining on \neach side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 124 minutes remaining; the \nminority has 128 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe the chairman of the committee had \nindicated a desire to yield 5 minutes, or what time the Senator may \nconsume, to Senator Allard of Colorado. It would be my intent to follow \nSenator Allard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S9497]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the acting chairman for yielding 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the comments of \nthe distinguished Senator from Ohio. I, too, proudly claim Porter Goss \nas a friend and somebody who I think will do a great job.\n  There is no doubt that the intelligence community right now is in \nsomewhat disarray, concerned about their jobs and the job they are \ndoing and the public perception.\n  I say, first, there are a lot of good people at the Central \nIntelligence Agency. I think Congressman Goss recognizes that. I think \nthere are some bureaucratic problems over there, too.\n  I think he has the temperament to deal with some of those problems. \nPorter Goss is a strong leader. He is a quiet individual. He doesn't \ngrandstand. He is a hard worker. He is intelligent and he understands \nthe intelligence community.\n  I have had an opportunity to serve on the Intelligence Committee in \nthe Senate for 4 years, and I even developed a greater appreciation for \nthe job Mr. Goss did on the House side in his service on the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  For those reasons, I rise to support the President's nomination to \nhead the Central Intelligence Agency. That nominee is Representative \nPorter Goss. I believe he is the right man at the right time for the \njob. That has been stated a couple of times already. I truly think that \nis the case. I am glad to see other colleagues recognize that fact. I \nam asking my colleagues to join me in voting for his confirmation.\n  The intelligence community is at a critical juncture. It is clear \nthat after the horrific attacks of September 11, and the problems \ninvolved with uncovering weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, the \nintelligence community needs firm leadership during a time when reforms \nare needed. The President has heeded that call.\n  President Bush has put into motion, through executive order, most of \nthe recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and he is committed to \nstrengthening the budget authority given to the intelligence community \nhead administrator. The next step in intelligence reform is to bring in \nsomeone who is committed to reforming the Central Intelligence Agency \nfrom the inside out. That man is Porter Goss.\n  I have had the pleasure of knowing Representative Goss personally and \nprofessionally. I was lucky enough to serve with him in the House of \nRepresentatives, and I value his knowledge of national security issues. \nEven then, when I served with him in the House, he was a voice both \nDemocrats and Republicans turned to when debating important \nintelligence issues, and he continues to be a leader in the House \ntoday. More importantly, I got to know Porter Goss on a personal level. \nHe is someone I trust and have come to call my friend. There is no one \nI would rather see as director of the agency.\n  I am convinced Representative Goss is ready for this challenging \ntask. Representative Goss will bring a unique perspective to the \nDirector's office in the Central Intelligence Agency. His perspective \nwill not only drive the much-needed changes in the CIA, but will also \nbring our concerns as a Congress to the agency.\n  Porter Goss has been an Army intelligence officer. He has served as a \nclandestine agent in the CIA and has chaired the House Intelligence \nCommittee. There is no one better prepared or qualified to be the \nDirector of the Central Intelligence Agency. There should be no doubt \nthat the combination of experience Representative Goss has will serve \nthe American people well.\n  I have heard concerns raised that Mr. Goss is too partisan. I simply \nhave to discount those concerns. This is a man who has served as an \nofficer in the Army and understands very well his duty to the United \nStates and to the citizens he will soon swear to defend.\n  I am pleased to see the bipartisan support Representative Goss has \nalready received. His nomination was approved by the Senate \nIntelligence Committee by a 12-to-4 vote. His colleague from Florida, \nBob Graham, has come out strongly in favor of Mr. Goss.\n\n  It is time for the Senate to act on this nomination so we can \ncontinue the reforms to the intelligence community that are badly \nneeded. Representative Goss is prepared to take the agency in a \ndirection that will strengthen our collection and analytical \nintelligence activities and provide the information we need to keep \nAmerica safe. He is a man who is truly interested in the needs of our \ncountry. He is somebody that I feel I can work with on the Armed \nServices Committee. I have some of the intelligence programs under my \njurisdiction in the subcommittee which I chair, and they are extremely \nimportant programs. They are programs that are badly needed, they are \nexpensive programs, and they do have some problems. We need somebody \nwho has the background in intelligence to tackle those, and somebody I \nthink I can work with.\n  I ask my colleagues to support his nomination because I personally \nthink he is the best man for the job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I will be happy to soon yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Mississippi, a valued member of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  On the issue of the HPSCI activity, the House intelligence activity, \nin regard to reform and other intelligence challenges during the last 3 \nCongresses, which has been brought up, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the Survey of Activities of the Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence During the 107th Congress. I also commend to \nmy colleagues the Survey of Activities of the Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence during the 106th Congress and the 105th \nCongress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSurvey of Activities of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \n                       During the 107th Congress\n\n       Mr. Goss, from the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence submitted the following report.\n       This report covers the activities of the House Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence during the One Hundred \n     Seventh Congress. Porter J. Goss (Republican, Florida) served \n     as Chairman; Nancy Pelosi (Democrat, California) served as \n     the Ranking Minority Member.\n       The stated purpose of H. Res. 658 of the 95th Congress, \n     which created the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, was to establish a committee ``to oversee and \n     make continuing studies of the intelligence and intelligence-\n     related activities and programs of the United States \n     Government and to submit to the House appropriate proposals \n     for legislation and report to the House concerning such \n     intelligence and intelligence-related activities and \n     programs.''\n       H. Res. 658 also indicated that the Committee ``shall make \n     every effort to assure that the appropriate departments and \n     agencies of the United States provide informed and timely \n     intelligence necessary for the executive and legislative \n     branches to make sound decisions affecting the security and \n     vital interests of the Nation. It is further the purpose of \n     this resolution to provide vigilant legislative oversight \n     over the intelligence and intelligence-related activities of \n     the United States to assure that such activities are in \n     conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the United \n     States.''\n       In carrying out its mandate from the House regarding \n     oversight of U.S. intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities, the Committee created four subcommittees:\n\n\n Subcommittee on human intelligence, analysis, and counterintelligence\n\n       Jim Gibbons (R-NV), Chairman,\n       Leonard L.

Included \n     within the JMIP are aggregations created for management \n     efficiency and characterized by similarity, either in \n     intelligence discipline (e.g., Signals Intelligence and \n     Imagery Intelligence) or function (e.g., satellite support \n     and aerial reconnaissance). The programs comprising the JMIP \n     also fall within the jurisdiction of the House Armed Services \n     Committee.\n       The TIARA are a diverse array of reconnaissance and target \n     acquisition programs that are a functional part of the basic \n     military force structure and provide direct information \n     support to military operations. TIARA, as defined by the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense, include \n     those military intelligence activities outside the defense \n     intelligence programs that respond to requirements of \n     military commanders for operational support information, as \n     well as to national command, control, and intelligence \n     requirements. The programs comprising TIARA also fall within \n     the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee.\n\n\n                          oversight activities\n\n       During the 107th Congress, the House Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), under the leadership of \n     Chairman Porter Goss--\n       -- Responded effectively to the catastrophic attacks on \n     September 11, 2001, by the al Qai'da terrorists by conducting \n     investigations jointly with its sister committee in the \n     Senate, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, to \n     determine whether the IC should have been more adept, better \n     resourced and more capable of thwarting the attacks;\n       -- Promoted a bipartisan effort to continue rebuilding and \n     refining the nation's intelligence capabilities to meet \n     increasingly complex geopolitical and technological \n     challenges to national security; and\n       -- Advanced the education of Members of Congress and the \n     public on matters of vital interest to national security and \n     the distinct role intelligence plays in its defense.\n       Although the end of the Cold War warranted a reordering of \n     national priorities, the steady decline in intelligence \n     funding since the mid-1990s left the nation with a diminished \n     ability to address emerging threats--such as global \n     terrorism--and the technical challenges of the 21st Century. \n     Further, the IC's lack of a corporate approach to addressing \n     enduring intelligence problems helped to create a culture \n     that hindered data collection (especially human \n     intelligence collection), data sharing, and collaborative \n     analysis.\n       The revitalization of the National Security Agency (NSA) \n     was the Committee's top priority during the 107th Congress. \n     Although this continues to be one of the Committee's priority \n     concerns, the focus has turned to information sharing and \n     cross community analysis. The Committee notes that the \n     individual intelligence agencies and, moreover, their \n     extremely talented and dedicated people, labor continuously \n     to provide the absolute best intelligence products possible \n     in defense of the Nation. These efforts are, however, \n     generally conducted in isolation from one another, and, most \n     disturbingly, existing rules and procedures often restrict \n     information from the community's depth and breadth of \n     analytic talent. Therefore, those individual efforts can \n     usually only piece together fragments of the overall \n     intelligence puzzle. Crucial in the post-9/11 era is having a \n     community that is, to the maximum extent possible, liberated \n     from information sharing restrictions and one that fosters a \n     culture focused on greater collaborative analysis. The \n     Authorizations for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 included \n     detailed language on the need for the IC to breakdown \n     barriers to information sharing and the need to cease the \n     practice of allowing agencies to routinely restrict ``their \n     data'' from other agencies, including law enforcement.\n       In order to maximize further the IC's analytic \n     effectiveness and output, we must ensure that the dedicated \n     professionals of the IC are properly trained and provided the \n     skills necessary for the tasks that are required to fight the \n     global war on terrorism and other daunting threats. For a \n     number of years, the Committee has articulated its specific \n     concerns about the dearth of language skills throughout the \n     IC. The lack of depth in the so-called ``low-density' \n     languages was acutely experienced during operations in \n     Afghanistan The Committee finds this situation unacceptable \n     and has emphasized the critical need for a robust effort to \n     improve foreign language capabilities throughout the \n     Intelligence Community.\n       The Committee remains concerned about the viability and \n     effectiveness of a future overhead architecture, given the \n     apparent lack of a comprehensive architectural plan for the \n     overhead system of systems, specifically in the area of \n     imagery. For example, the Committee believes the \n     Administration is facing a major challenge in addressing \n     technical and funding problems with the Future Imagery \n     Architecture (FIA) program that could force untenable trades \n     between critical future capabilities and legacy systems. In \n     the Authorization for fiscal year 2003, the Committee has \n     addressed the known FIA problems as well as the need to \n     develop imagery alternatives if developmental problems exist \n     or persist. The Committee noted, however, that the \n     Intelligence Community has engaged in a continuing pattern by \n     which many individual programs have been provided resources \n     with little or no regard to the entire set of IC collection \n     capabilities, including space-based and airborne. The \n     Committee believes that, although individual systems \n     certainly have specific merit, it would be wiser for the \n     Intelligence Community to consider whether the overall \n     collective mix brings the appropriate assets to bear against \n     the range of threats to U.S. national security. Moreover, the \n     ability to fund all legacy, developmental, and desired \n     systems has a finite limit. Therefore, there is a critical \n     need to review each program mindful of the strategic needs so \n     that and necessary tradeoffs are made based on substantive \n     requirements.\n       Finally, the Committee continued its focus on a number of \n     enduring IC challenges--the need to improve NSA acquisition \n     efforts, the need to improve the depth and breadth of Human \n     Intelligence (HUMINT), and improving research and development \n     (R). With respect to NSA, the Committee has been pleased \n     with the Director's attempts to baseline current capabilities \n     so that future needs can be properly identified and resulting \n     acquisition decisions can be appropriately made. To assist \n     the Director in completing these efforts, the Committee \n     included incentives in the Authorization Act for fiscal year \n     2003. Regarding, HUMINT, the Committee focused on \n     improvements in training, enhancing technical resources to \n     operations, and properly funding analytic efforts. All of \n     these capabilities are supported by R efforts. Therefore, \n     the Committee has supported the Administration's increases in \n     basic R programs. The Committee believes that the IC must \n     continuously renew itself in this ever-changing world. \n     Intelligence is the first line of defense against elusive and \n     unstructured threats and enemies that use asymmetric means to \n     harm America and her people. Only through providing these \n     much needed resources and a long-term commitment can the IC \n     be prepared for the global challenges that confront us.\n\n\n       intelligence authorizations for fiscal years 2002 and 2003\n\n       During the 107th Congress, particularly in the aftermath of \n     the September 11th attacks, the Committee continued to pursue \n     its objective of rebuilding and revitalizing our national \n     intelligence capabilities to better meet the threats of the \n     21st century. Finally, after eight years of congressional \n     admonition to the executive branch to develop a long term \n     funding program to correct serious and critical Intelligence \n     Community (IC) deficiencies, the President's budget requests \n     provided a down payment on the resources necessary to ensure \n     that our policymakers and military commanders have timely and \n     reliable intelligence support that is crucial to our nation's \n     security.\n       The Committee reviewed extensively the President's budget \n     submissions for Fiscal Years 2002 and 2003, fulfilling its \n     responsibility to closely examine the nation's intelligence \n     programs and proposed expenditures. These reviews included \n     substantive and programmatic hearings, Member briefings, and \n     numerous staff briefings. Testimony on the President's budget \n     submissions was taken from the Director of Central \n     Intelligence (DCI); the Assistant Secretary of Defense for \n     Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C31); the \n     Directors of DIA, NSA, NIMA, NRO, and the FBI; and other \n     major intelligence program managers.\n\n[[Page S9499]]\n\n       The Committee's examination of the President's Fiscal Years \n     2002 and 2003 intelligence budgets included 13 committee \n     budget-related hearings principally on a program level. \n     Additional hearings were held addressing the DCI's overall \n     budget submission, the state of health of the IC, and the \n     DCI's views and plans for the future of intelligence and the \n     IC.\n       In reviewing the President's budget requests, the Committee \n     found that the President has begun to aggressively address \n     the lack of investment and years of neglect that has harmed \n     our nation's intelligence capabilities. The fiscal year 2002 \n     budget request, submitted before the tragic events of \n     September 11, 2001, reflected no major improvements or \n     investment in intelligence capabilities. The fiscal year 2003 \n     budget submitted by the President included the most \n     substantial increase for programs funded in the National \n     Foreign Intelligence Program in history, however, the \n     intelligence authorizations for both fiscal years 2002 and \n     2003 reiterated the need for renewed investment by focusing \n     on enhancing programs and information sharing across the \n     various IC agencies.\n       In addition to budget-related hearings, the Committee held \n     over 58 committee hearings and briefings on various issues \n     vital to our IC and national security. Among the subjects \n     examined by the Committee were: terrorism, HUMINT, and \n     developments in Colombia, Southeast Asia, and rogue states.\n       Given the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the \n     Committee's immediate priority was, and continues to be, the \n     effectiveness of our counterterrorism efforts and the \n     security of our nation. In the last two budget authorization \n     bills, the Committee addressed critical and immediate \n     counterterrorism needs as well as long-term intelligence \n     issues facing the United States.\n       The ``Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2002'', \n     (P.L. 107-108), in addition to authorizing generally the \n     activities of the U.S. IC, directly addressed IC shortfalls \n     in domestic counterterrorism efforts, intelligence collection \n     and analysis, threat reporting, aggressive recruitment of \n     human assets, foreign language capabilities, and sharing of \n     intelligence information and analysis across the government. \n     For example, the Congress specifically enacted legislation \n     that repealed restrictions on human intelligence sources. In \n     the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks on America, the \n     House and Senate significantly increased spending \n     authorizations for intelligence activities well beyond that \n     level requested by the President. The committee also directed \n     significant resource allocation to countering terrorism.\n       The ``Intelligence Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2003'', \n     (P L. 107-306), in addition to authorizing the intelligence \n     activities of the U.S. IC highlighted five priority areas \n     that must receive significant, sustained attention if \n     intelligence is to fulfill its role in our national security \n     strategy. Those areas are: (1) improving information sharing \n     and all-source analysis; (2) improving IC professional \n     training with a major emphasis on developing language skills; \n     (3) ensuring national imagery collection program viability \n     and effectiveness; (4) correcting enduring systemic problems, \n     deficiencies in HUMINT, and rebuilding a robust research and \n     development program; and (5) establishing a budgeting process \n     that no longer relies so heavily on supplemental \n     appropriations. For example, the fiscal year 2003 legislation \n     provided very clear policy direction to the Administration to \n     improve the cross-community sharing of information from \n     material seized as part of the global war on terrorism. This \n     resulted in new processes and procedures being implemented to \n     improve the access that community analysts have to this \n     material. Further, the fiscal year 2003 authorization \n     legislation provided significantly enhanced funding for \n     skills training in areas such as foreign languages, \n     analyst-to-analyst technical exchanges and in-area \n     familiarization travel. And finally, the Committee's \n     legislation also provided critically needed direction and \n     funding to ensure the nation's imagery architecture will \n     be capable of supporting customer needs long into the \n     future.\n\n\n                        committee investigations\n\n     Terrorism Review\n       The Committee, through its THLS Subcommittee at the behest \n     of the Speaker and Minority Leader as the focal point and \n     coordinating mechanism in the House of Representatives for \n     post-9-11 counterterrorism and homeland security oversight \n     activities.''\n       Prior to the 9-11 terrorist attacks, the Committee's \n     Working Group on Terrorism and Homeland Security held \n     numerous classified hearings and briefings on the terrorist \n     threat, gaps in the IC's counterterrorism capabilities, the \n     need for a more focused and better coordinated national \n     effort on homeland security, and a variety of related \n     matters.\n       Following 9-11, the Working Group was converted into a full \n     subcommittee with expanded powers of jurisdiction to act as \n     the lead entity in formulating the House's response to the \n     attacks. The new Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland \n     Security held what for the Committee was an unprecedented \n     series of televised hearings culminating in a field hearing \n     with then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani in New York City. A significant \n     number of closed hearings and briefings on all aspects of the \n     attacks followed; along with a report to the Speaker and \n     Minority Leader on the gaps in counterterrorism capabilities \n     at CIA, NSA, and the FBI leading up to 9-11. Following \n     publication of this report, the Committee, in conjunction \n     with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, established \n     a Joint Investigative Staff on 9-11 that conducted a thorough \n     investigation of the Intelligence Community's inability to \n     prevent the 9-11 attacks. The work of the JIS included a \n     series of open and closed hearings, and the publication of a \n     classified report.''\n     Committee Investigations\n       At the behest of the Speaker and Minority Leader, the \n     Committee's Subcommittee on Terrorism and Homeland Security \n     was directed in the immediate aftermath of 9-11 to evaluate \n     the performance of the CIA, and FBI against the terrorist \n     target. To this end, the Subcommittee issued a report in July \n     2002 that offered the fo11owing conclusions:\n       America's intelligence capability shortfalls prior to 9-11 \n     were significantly affected by resource constraints imposed \n     during much of the 1990s, but also by a series of \n     questionable Intelligence Community management decisions on \n     funding priorities.\n       As a first step, the USG should adopt a single definition \n     of terrorism, which it currently does not have at a cost of \n     significant inefficiencies.\n       CIA: The availability and allocation of resources, \n     including the redirection by CIA managers of funds for core \n     field collection and analysis to headquarters bureaucracy, \n     hurt CIA's counterterrorism (CT) capabilities prior to 9-11. \n     Internal human rights guidelines issued in 1995 also had a \n     ``chilling effect'' on CT operations, and these guidelines \n     were only repealed after the Subcommittee's report was \n     released in July 2002. CIA chronically lacks foreign language \n     skills and core CT-specific training, and has become overly \n     reliant on foreign liaison at a cost to its unilateral \n     capability.\n       FBI: Preventing terrorism was less important than solving \n     crimes prior to 9-11, when FBI decentralized CT information \n     and investigations. FBI also had insufficient linguists and \n     analytic capability and an outdated IT infrastructure. It \n     paid little attention to financial tracking, and did not \n     share information.\n       NSA: The CT mission was not given a high enough priority in \n     the competition for limited resources prior to 9-11, and NSA \n     must reform program management, systems engineering and \n     integration, and budget management for new investments to \n     have a lasting impact. NSA has been chronically short of \n     linguists, and must better leverage industry for technical \n     solutions to collection problems.\n       Congressional oversight of counterterrorism is highly \n     duplicative and inefficient. A leadership staff mechanism \n     should be created to streamline the oversight process on both \n     counterterrorism and homeland security matters.''\n\n\n                      joint inquiry investigations\n\n       In February, 2002, the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence \n     authorized an investigation, to be conducted as a Joint \n     Inquiry, into the Intelligence Community's activities before \n     and after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against \n     the United States. This bicameral investigation, supported by \n     a separate, unified, professional staff, sought to identify \n     what the Community knew or should have known regarding those \n     attacks prior to September 11th, the nature of any systemic \n     problems that may have impeded the Community's ability to \n     prevent those attacks, and recommendations for reform to \n     improve the Community's ability to uncover and prevent \n     similar attacks in the future.\n       In the months that followed, the Inquiry's investigative \n     staff reviewed massive amounts of information within the \n     Intelligence Community. This included the review of almost \n     500,000 pages of relevant documents, 300 interviews, and \n     participation in numerous briefings and panel discussions, \n     involving about 600 individuals. Although the inquiry was \n     primarily focused on the Intelligence Community, the \n     investigation also considered relevant information from \n     federal agencies outside the Intelligence Community; from \n     state and local authorities; from foreign government \n     authorities; and from private sector individuals and \n     organizations. Building on the extensive investigative work, \n     the Committees held nine joint public hearings and, given the \n     highly classified nature of much of this information, \n     thirteen joint closed sessions. In December, 2002, both \n     Committees approved, by separate votes, the classified Final \n     Report of the Joint Inquiry. The Committees are currently \n     working with the Intelligence Community in an effort to \n     declassify, consistent with national security interests, as \n     much as possible of the Final Report for public release.\n       The work of the Joint Inquiry confirmed that although the \n     Intelligence Community had relevant information that was, in \n     retrospect, significant regarding the September 11th attacks, \n     the Community too often failed to focus on the information \n     and to appreciate its collective significance in terms of a \n     probable terrorist attack. The Inquiry's factual record \n     identified not only the information that was overlooked but \n     also a number of systemic weaknesses that contributed to the \n     Community's inability to detect and prevent the attacks. \n     These included a lack of sufficient focus on the potential \n     for a domestic attack, a lack of a comprehensive \n     counterterrorist strategy, insufficient analytic focus and \n     quality, a reluctance to develop and implement new technical \n     capabilities aggressively, and inadequate sharing of\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\n     relevant counterterrorism information. To correct such \n     deficiencies, the Final Report includes nineteen \n     recommendations for reform, including such things as the \n     creation of a Cabinet-level Director of National Intelligence \n     and prompt consideration of whether the FBI, or a new agency, \n     should perform the domestic intelligence functions of the \n     U.S. Government.\n\n\n                             open hearings\n\n       During the 107th Congress, the Committee held 13 open \n     hearings on issues of concern to the Intelligence Community \n     and the American people. While committed to the protection of \n     sources and methods and ensuring the security of our nation's \n     secrets, it is the intention of the Committee, whenever \n     possible, to hold open hearings in an unclassified setting on \n     issues of vital importance and concern to the public.\n       The Committee held four open hearings: Defining Terrorism--\n     September 26, 2001; Asymmetric Threats to Homeland--October \n     3, 2001; Role of NSC in Current Crisis--October 11, 2001; \n     Domestic Preparedness & Emergency Response--October 29, 2001.\n       The Joint Inquiry Committee held nine open hearings: Family \n     Advocates for September 11 Victims--September 18, 2002 and \n     September 19, 2002; Intelligence Community Knowledge of \n     September 11 Hijackers--September 20, 2002; Phoenix Memo--\n     September 24, 2002 and September 26, 2002; Counterterrorism \n     Information Sharing--October 1, 2002; Intelligence Community \n     Reform Proposals--October 3, 2002; Past Terrorist Attacks--\n     October 8, 2002; Factual Finding of Inquiry--October 17, \n     2002.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I also commend the \nchairman and the vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee for the \nvery difficult job they have been performing, leading the Intelligence \nCommittee. It has to be one of the toughest jobs that I have witnessed \nin the Senate. It takes time, it takes experience, and it takes \nintellect to be able to deal with the issues that come before this \ncommittee.\n  I also commend them for the way they have handled this particular \nnomination. They were patient. They gave every Senator ample time to \nmake their points and ask questions, and they have been commended by \nMembers of both sides of the aisle for the way they handled the \nnomination. That is why I think the nomination was approved by the \nIntelligence Committee, and why I believe this nomination will be \nconfirmed by a wide margin.\n  Before I get into a little more discussion about why I support Porter \nGoss to be head of the CIA and director of intelligence, I will talk \nabout my overall concerns regarding the intelligence area.\n  As a member of the leadership over the years, I was able to have \nbriefings and meet with Director Tenet. There are specific requirements \nin the law that certain Members have to be notified when particular \nactions are taken. I always took those matters very seriously and spent \nthe time that was necessary to get those briefings. For the last year \nand a half, I have been on the Intelligence Committee. I must confess \nthat when I went on the committee, I thought I would be a big defender \nand big supporter of our intelligence community, because I think that \nwhat they do is so important. I do support the men and women who work \nin that community.\n  But I must say, over the last year and a half, I have developed many \nconcerns about how that job is being done, how the Congress does its \njob. I didn't appreciate how important oversight is regarding \nintelligence matters, how important it is that a Senator develop \nexpertise to be able to ask the right questions, do the oversight, and \nunderstand what is going on.\n  I have come to the conclusion that our intelligence community is not \nset up properly and we are not doing our job in the Congress. We can \npoint fingers and blame somebody else, but a lot of the problem resides \nhere in this body and in the Congress--not because we don't try to do \nour job, but we are not organized properly to do it. We have this \nmultifaceted process of so many committees claiming jurisdiction, and \nwith good reason. Armed Services needs to be aware of what's going on, \nas do Foreign Relations, Appropriations, and Governmental Affairs. Is \nthere anybody who doesn't have their finger in this intelligence pie a \nlittle bit? Basically, nobody is doing the oversight job properly, \nbecause the members of the Intelligence Committee are not there \npermanently; they come and go and are on the Committee maybe 2 years, 4 \nyears, or 8 years. Once you get to where you know what to ask and what \nis going on, you leave the Committee.\n  Frankly, I think the CIA and the intelligence community's attitude \nis: Don't give them anything; give them a little bit of a courtesy, a \nbrush-off, and we will get what we want from the appropriators in the \nend.\n  I think we have real problems in the intelligence community and in \nthe Congress, and we need to fix them. I don't have a magic design. I \nwant to hear what the experts have to say and see what legislation is \nproposed. I know this: Something has to be done in the way the \nintelligence community operates. You cannot operate under a construct \nwhere you have 15 different agencies and 80 percent of the money going \nto the Defense Department, with the director of intelligence having \nlittle or no control over the money or many of those intelligence \nagencies.\n  We need major changes, and we need them now. I am concerned about \nconcerns that were raised yesterday that if we do not do this right, if \nwe rush to reorganize the intelligence community, we could do damage \nbecause the job of gathering intelligence has to go on every day. Men \nand women are putting their lives on the line to gather intelligence. \nWe need to be careful, but we need to press forward with change.\n  I know this body is loath to change anything. Any kind of reform is \nlooked at suspiciously: Oh, we can't do that; it has always been done \nthis way. I have taken the time over the years to look at a lot of \nthese issues, and it has not always been done this way. A lot of what \nwe do and say around here, which some say is sacrosanct and cannot be \nchanged, is relatively new. It evolved over the years.\n  At some point, you have to say there is a higher priority, that there \nis something more important than turf or jurisdiction or the way it was \nor is being done.\n  What is most important is how we are going to do the best job for the \nmen and women in uniform, men and women in intelligence, and for the \nAmerican people. So I think we need to make necessary changes.\n  The important point is that we have to have somebody in charge. We \nhave good people in the CIA doing the job. We have an Acting Director \nwho is a good man doing a good job. But we do not need an Acting \nDirector forever. We need a man or woman in charge making decisions, \nmaking changes that need to be carried out even without legislation \nthat overhauls the whole operation, and we need it now.\n  This is a dangerous time we are in. We need to not only confirm this \nnominee right away, but we need to do it overwhelmingly. We need to \nshow him, we need to show the agencies, and we need to show the \ndepartments that he has the confidence of the American people through \ntheir representatives in the Senate. We are dealing with very important \nissues, and it is so important that we have leadership at the top. We \nneed to do it right away.\n  We have a good man who has been nominated. A lot of thought went into \nhis selection. I know the President sought out the counsel, advice, and \nthe thinking of a number of Members of Congress on both sides of the \naisle, in the House and Senate, before he went forward with this \nnomination. He has nominated a man who is uniquely qualified to be the \nDirector of Intelligence.\n  Porter Goss is the right age. He is in his mid-sixties, still young \nenough to do the job, and old enough to know what needs to be done. He \nhas a background of military experience, where he was in Army \nintelligence for 2 years. He worked in the Directorate of Operations of \nthe CIA for many years. Most of this is in the Record, but I think it \nis worth repeating so that my statement will make sense, hopefully, in \nits entirety.\n  When he left the CIA, he continued to be involved in trying to serve \nhis fellow man and his community. He was a leader in his hometown in \nFlorida. He served on the city council, was mayor, was a member of the \nboard of commissioners, and has served in Congress since 1988, which is \na pretty good period of time. He eventually became chairman of the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence where I know he did a \ngood job.\n\n[[Page S9501]]\n\n  I have watched him. I have watched him deal with difficult issues. I \nhave watched him take a leadership role, and I have watched him work \nwith the ranking member of that committee and with Democrats, and I \nhave been impressed with the job he has done on the Intelligence \nCommittee in the House.\n  So he knows the CIA. He knows it from having been in Army \nintelligence, he knows it from having been in the CIA, and he knows it \nfrom the position he held as chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He \nknows where the problems are because he was there, and he knows how to \nstrengthen the intelligence community and make it better. He is no \nstranger to the difficulty and the complexity of foreign intelligence.\n  When I look back on some of the former heads of the CIA, frankly, \nsome of them did not have much of a background in that area. But here \nis a man who is uniquely qualified. He has been in the intelligence \ncommunity. I know that some people say that if you are in the \ninstitution, you are part of the problem. But, my experience leads me \nto ask, how can you solve a problem if you do not really understand an \ninstitution? There are some in Washington that say, if you know the \nsubject, whether it is transportation or oil or intelligence, you \nshould not be in government because you have been coopted.\n  I think absolutely the opposite is the case. Practical experience is \ninvaluable. You have to understand the culture, you have to understand \nthe people, and anybody who has paid close attention to the \nintelligence community in recent months and years knows what changes \nshould be made and have to be made.\n  Porter Goss, a Member of Congress, has been critical of the \nintelligence community. He does not sugar-coat it. He has called the \nhuman intelligence program dysfunctional. He has spoken the truth about \nthe way we have funded the CIA, which he says has not been adequate, it \nhas not been done in the right way, and we have not put enough emphasis \non human intelligence. In fact, Congress stopped this nation from \nhaving the human intelligence we needed, if we go back and look at the \nresults of the Church Commission some 30 years ago. Once again, we are \npart of the problem.\n  He knows we need to do more in linguistic training, and he has raised \nthese questions as chairman of the committee and in his communications \nwith the DCI.\n  His confirmation would bring stability and experience to the \nintelligence community. One thing that worries me, as I have talked to \nsome of our intelligence personnel, is a certain concern about whether \nthey are really appreciated, and are the old experienced hands going to \nstay, or are they going to leave. I have noticed some of the \nintelligence people I see are getting younger, younger, and younger. \nThey need a firm and experienced leader. They need a person who has \nbeen there with them, understands their needs, and appreciates the job \nthey do, and Porter Goss would do that.\n  He does support what Congress is about to do. We are going to create \na national intelligence director position, and we are going to pass \nlegislation that is going to reorganize the intelligence community at \nsome point, maybe sooner than later.\n  Again, he has the right attitude and supports the position I believe \nthat Congress is going to be taking.\n  There are those who have questioned his independence. Is he a \npartisan? Is he a politician? Whatever happened to congressional \ncourtesy? Over the years, I have supported Members of the other party \nfrom this body and the other body, even though they have sometimes been \nvery partisan politicians, very aggressive in their speeches on the \nfloor of the House and Senate, but I knew them to be good men and \nwomen, and I knew when they took on a different role. When you are in \nCongress, when you are in politics, you are a politician. That is not a \ndamnation. That is somebody involved in the art of government. When you \nare a member of a party, sometimes members of the other party get under \nyour skin, and you speak out.\n  I noticed over the years, Porter Goss has not been one of those rabid \npartisans. He has been very calm and very stable. Sometimes he gets a \nlittle upset. Maybe he thought perhaps the Senate was getting carried \naway with some of our hearings recently. On occasion, I have thought we \ndid a little grandstanding in the Senate, and I said so even though it \nwas sometimes directed at my own party.\n  I know he is an independent thinker, and I know he will put his job \nas head of the CIA, uppermost. He will put his political past and his \npartisanship behind him. He also will be a man, I believe, who can go \nin and meet with the President at those early morning meetings and say: \nMr. President, this is what we know, this is the truth about the \nsituation, and if you go this way, you are going to have certain \nproblems.\n  He has that stature, he has that credibility, and he will have the \nindependence to do that.\n  I think having served so many years, having been on the Intelligence \nCommittee, and having the record he built at the Intelligence \nCommittee, is proof that he will be independent to do that job for the \nAmerican people. I believe he will be more candid with the Congress.\n  Quite often when we had testimony before the Intelligence Committee, \nI felt as if I did not get a complete story. Frequently, testimony was \nless than fully satisfactory or sufficient. Porter Goss is going to be \nable to speak to us on a level basis, not from the perspective of a \nformer staff member. He was one of us, and he will not try to fool us. \nI think he will tell us the truth.\n  By the way, I think we will be very comfortable telling him: Mr. \nDirector, we don't believe that. We will be able to be very candid with \nhim. I believe he will show flexibility as we move from where we are to \nwhere we need to be.\n  He has been questioned about the positions he has taken, but he \nsatisfied the members of the Intelligence Committee by a vote of 12 to \n4 with several Democrats voting for his confirmation. They asked him \nthe tough questions. They had their reservations, and those \nreservations have been satisfied.\n  I cite one point of how he dealt with the former Director. On \nSeptember of 2003, he wrote a letter to DCI Tenet pointing out concerns \nhe had with intelligence. He joined with the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee in the House, Congresswoman Harman, and \nindicated there were significant deficiencies with respect to the \nintelligence community's collection activities concerning Iraq's WMD \nprograms and ties to al-Qaida prior to the commencement of hostilities \nthere.\n  So he did not wait until after the fact; he raised concerns when they \nneeded to be raised. If my colleagues have taken a look at that letter, \nit certainly shows independence and it was the kind of thing that the \nDCI needed to hear at that particular time.\n  So I can attest from experience, from observation, and from a written \nrecord that this Congressman will be an independent, thoughtful, strong \nvoice at the CIA.\n  I urge my colleagues, let us have our discussion but let us have a \nvote and let us make it overwhelming. Let us do it now because we need \nstrong leadership and we have the right man to do this job. Porter Goss \nwill provide leadership for the intelligence community. He will be able \nto work with Congress and he will help give the intelligence community \nthe ability to do an even better job.\n  I thank the chairman for yielding me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished \nSenator from Utah and thank him for his service on the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Also, I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his excellent \ncommentary, more especially highlighting Mr. Goss's independence and \nthe fact he will be a nonpartisan DCI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and I certainly \nappreciate the leadership Senators on the Intelligence Committee, in \nparticular the Senator from Kansas. He has done a great job. I think \nSenator Rockefeller has worked with him very well for the most part.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from \nMississippi. There are very few people around here who have had to deal \nwith\n\n[[Page S9502]]\n\nthe personalities of so many people as Senator Lott has. He has done a \nterrific job throughout both his House and Senate career, and I think \nwe ought to listen to the wise people like that with regard to whether \nwe should vote for Porter Goss.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that Porter Goss is worthy of this \nposition and, in my mind, he will do it in an effective way. I \ncompliment the distinguished Senator from Mississippi for his cogent \nremarks and his very practical remarks to which we ought to all be \npaying attention.\n  I remember when George Tenet was nominated, and George Tenet was a \nDemocrat. He was a staffer to Senator Boren. Senator Boren, George \nTenet, and I traveled all over the world together. There was not any \nquestion that we were going to support George Tenet when he came up for \nCIA Director, and I think he did a much better job than all of his \ncritics are saying. A lot of that was because he worked very hard for \nSenator Boren and for the committee and knew an awful lot about \nintelligence to begin with. This is a tough job. It is almost an \nimpossible job to do. In fact, I think it is an impossible job to do in \nevery way, in every respect, totally right.\n\n  The fact is, we supported Mr. Tenet and he was a member of our \nfamily. I believe Porter Goss is a member of our family, too, and a \nperson who is worthy of this position. We should not politicize this \nappointment.\n  The next person to head the Central Intelligence Agency will lead the \norganization at its most demanding time in history. The next Director \nof Central Intelligence will have to provide leadership in shepherding \nthat organization through a much needed reform while continuing to play \na major role on the ongoing global war on terror. The next person to \nhold this post will require much more than a passing experience with \nthe workings of the intelligence community. He will need to understand \nthe role of the executive in conducting our foreign policy at war, and \nthe essential role of congressional oversight and support in ensuring \nthat our intelligence community is flexible enough to address threats \nthat have never before been the primary focus of our foreign policy.\n  President Bush made the right call when he chose Porter Goss to fill \nthis role. I am happy to note that an overwhelming majority of my \ncolleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence have also \nrecognized this, having approved his nomination yesterday. I commend \nChairman Roberts for his leadership and I thank our majority and \nminority leaders for bringing this nomination to the floor today. It is \nimportant.\n  I have had the opportunity to work closely with the chairman of the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. In the months of \ncollaboration between our two committees which produced the joint \ninquiry, I had the opportunity to take the measure of Porter Goss's \nmind, as well as his experience and his commitment to the intelligence \ncommunity. I totally support this nomination.\n  As we all recognize, the intelligence community will be undergoing a \nmajor reform, a process that can only succeed if there is close \ncooperation between the White House and all the relevant executive \nagencies, the Congress--and that includes Democrats and Republicans--\nand especially this committee, and the intelligence community.\n  The reform that will be promoted should not be a mere bureaucratic \nreshuffling; it should be a reform of our intelligence community that \nenhances and strengthens our ability to understand, penetrate, co-opt, \nand neutralize the threat of armed groups to our national security. The \nsuccess of the next Director of the Central Intelligence Agency must \nunderstand this to be successful.\n  The next Director of Central Intelligence must understand that the \nnew initiatives we are debating in draft legislation this month, \nlegislation we are referring to as an intelligence community reform, \nwill be the beginning, not the end, of reform. In fact, I fear that \nonce we pass a reform package some of us will believe we will have \naccomplished reform. In fact, we will have only begun.\n  Everyone agrees that we need better results from our intelligence \ncommunity. I suppose that is always going to be the case. Most of us, I \nhope, also agree that the efforts of the intelligence community, from \nthe Director on down, have been admirable, brave, selfless, and \nintense. I believe former Director Tenet worked hard to revitalize \ncapabilities that devolved after the end of the Cold War. I know he \nworked hard. He inherited an agency that needed a lot of improvement, \nand to the extent that he could, he did his best to do so.\n\n  The next Director of Central Intelligence must recognize that our \ngoal should not be to rebuild a capability but to build a new \ncapability. We need better results and we need a strategy for achieving \nthem.\n  Director Tenet was candid in speaking before the 9/11 Commission in \nsaying that our human intelligence capabilities would take at least 5 \nyears to rebuild. Porter Goss, when confirmed, must recognize that this \nwill be the issue I will address in our first closed hearing. I will \nask: How do you intend to rebuild the capability? What is your \nstrategy? To what standards of measurement will you hold yourself?\n  The American intelligence community of the 21st century will face \ntraditional geopolitical threats, as we did in the past. We will need \nintelligence to address the question of rising powers, such as China, \nand remilitarizing states, such as Russia. We will need intelligence to \ndeal with the failing States of North Korea and Cuba.\n  As we all know, we will also need to develop intelligence \ncapabilities to gain a strategic advantage against the threat we face \nnow and will face for some time to come: the threat of armed groups--\nterrorists, if you will.\n  I strongly believe al-Qaida will be defeated in the coming years. It \nis not going to be easy, but we will defeat them. On the other hand, I \nthink a somber analysis of the world we live in today should remind us \nthat, even when al-Qaida is defeated, we will face the threat of other \narmed groups. Nations that have developed a strategic advantage to \nunderstand, penetrate, co-opt and, when necessary, destroy armed groups \nwill enhance their national security.\n  We rely on our intelligence community for that strategic advantage. \nPorter Goss understands these requirements. He has worked within the \nintelligence community, and he has performed years of congressional \noversight over that community. He respects the community and he knows \nwhat is expected of it. If we do our jobs, I can assure Porter Goss, \nwhen he is confirmed, he will be the Director made most accountable to \nCongress in the history of intelligence community oversight.\n  As I said, when the next director comes before our committee, we \nshould not settle for reports. We must demand strategy for achieving \nreform and measurement standards. Our legislative initiatives can only \ndo so much. Our oversight, and the stewardship of a responsible and \nexperienced director, will be what advances reform.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that this man can do the job and can do \nit well. There is no doubt in my mind that as a Member of Congress he \nhas occasionally made statements that have irritated the other side of \nthis aisle. That is probably true of everyone on both sides of the \nfloor. I have to admit I have been irritated from time to time by \nstatements made by my colleagues on the other side--and even by some of \nmy colleagues on our side--and I am sure I have made statements from \ntime to time that have irritated colleagues on the other side as well. \nI have not wanted to, but I am sure I have. It is just the nature of \nbeing in this political arena. But to then presume a person is an \nindecent partisan because occasionally they find fault with the other \nside, I think shows a degree of immaturity, of political and \nprofessional immaturity that is unworthy of the nomination process.\n  Nobody is going to come before us who is perfect in every way. But I \nhave to say, there are very few people who have served as much as \nPorter Goss has and who have as much knowledge of the intelligence \ncommunity as he has, who have ever been members of the top echelon of \nthe CIA.\n  I have every confidence in him. I am going to support him. I hope all \nmy colleagues also will support him. He is worthy of it. He is a Member \nof Congress. He is a person who deserves our support. I hope we all get \ntogether and\n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\nsupport him and continue to support him as he serves in this job which \nalmost nobody can completely fulfill. This is a job that takes immense \ncapabilities and, I might add, commitment. He has both and we should \nsupport him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I yield such time as the Senator from New Jersey \nwishes to express his views. I yield him that amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are discussing the nomination of \nRepresentative Porter Goss to be Director of Central Intelligence. This \nnomination comes to the floor at a critical time for our Nation's \nintelligence community. With Chairman Collins's leadership and Senator \nLieberman's ranking membership, the Governmental Affairs Committee is \nin the process this very day of marking up legislation to reform the \nintelligence community. It is a task that all of us on the committee \nare taking very seriously. After all, it was the failures of \nintelligence that led to the horrors of 9/11 and the loss of almost \n3,000 lives. Seven hundred of them came from my home State of New \nJersey. It was a painful moment in American history.\n  It was failures of intelligence that led to our false premises for \ninvading Iraq. I thought everyone from the President on down had agreed \nthat we needed to take intelligence data more seriously. That is why it \nwas so shocking to hear President Bush's odd statement yesterday about \nour Nation's intelligence data on Iraq. A few hours after the President \nspoke at the United Nations about why we went it alone in Iraq, \nPresident Bush was asked by a reporter about the CIA report that he had \nreceived in July, regarding the deteriorating situation in Iraq, which \ncould even lead to a full-blown civil war.\n  The President at that moment dismissed the CIA report by saying that \nthe CIA might have been ``just guessing.'' Just guessing? The Central \nIntelligence Agency just guessing? That is quite a way to describe \ntheir activities.\n  On this placard we see what President Bush actually said.\n\n       The CIA laid out a--several scenarios that said, life could \n     be lousy, life could be OK, life could be better. And they \n     were just guessing as to what the conditions might be like.\n\n  That is quite a description, on September 21, yesterday, at the \nWaldorf-Astoria in New York. If the President thinks our Nation's \nintelligence system is just guessing, then we are really in trouble. \nCasual statements.\n  I remind President Bush that when you pronounced ``mission \naccomplished'' on the deck of that aircraft carrier, we had lost 138 \nAmerican citizens. But since then, since the mission was accomplished--\n``mission accomplished'' means job done--almost 900 people, 900 \nAmericans have perished.\n  How do we treat subjects so casually, statements like this? Does \nPresident Bush believe Congressman Goss will simply direct the guessing \ngame at the CIA? Is that all he expects from our main intelligence \nagency?\n  As we now know, in July the CIA sent the President a report that laid \nout three scenarios for Iraq, with the rosiest scenario being the \ncontinuation of the disastrous status quo. Under this scenario, we see \nan average of 87 attacks a day against our troops, and 1,037 dead to \ndate. That is a horrible situation.\n  The CIA report to the President identified the worst scenario as an \nall-out civil war, with our troops in the crossfire. This is not what \nthe President wanted to hear. So what did he do? He ignored it. And now \nwhen asked how the information came to him, he said: The CIA--just \nguessing.\n  President Bush's comments are a frightening sign he is not dealing \nwith reality, in that he continues to ignore the truth about what is \nhappening on the ground in Iraq. That is why I am so concerned about \nthe nomination of Porter Goss to head the CIA.\n  I know Mr. Goss only casually. Certainly he seems like a nice enough, \nintelligent fellow. But what the President needs more than ever is an \nintelligence chief who will tell it like it is, and not revamp \nintelligence to meet the President's expectations.\n  Congressman Goss has not shown himself to be a person who will \ndeliver nonpartisan, objective information to the President.\n  At a time when the independence and the objectivity of the CIA is \nmore crucial than ever before, President Bush has nominated a \npolitician who has been particularly partisan. In a PBS ``Frontline'' \ninterview after 9/11, Representative Goss refused to characterize what \nhappened as an intelligence failure. How could one argue that 9/11 was \nnot an intelligence failure? He also opposed the creation of the 9/11 \nCommission.\n  Congressman Goss attacked Senator Kerry claiming that Senator Kerry \ntried to cut the Nation's intelligence budget during the Clinton \nadministration. But Congressman Goss made the attack against Senator \nKerry while not revealing that he cosponsored a bill during the same \nperiod that would have made even deeper budget cuts.\n  Here is what Mr. Goss called the Senate Armed Services Committee in \nrecent hearings on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. I quote him. He said:\n\n       We've got a circus in the Senate which is always a likely \n     place to look for the circus.\n\n  Quite a commentary about what Mr. Goss thinks of our Government. \nFirst of all, the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib--he thinks the \nSenate is a circus in hearings, and then he describes this place as a \nbig circus tent. Is that what he thinks of us? I hardly think that is \nthe kind of person who ought to be taking this serious job.\n  When asked whether he would investigate the disclosure of covert CIA \nagent Valerie Plame's identity, he dismissed the scandal, saying, \n``There's a much larger dose of partisan politics going on right now \nthan there is worry about national security.''\n  Then he added flippantly, ``Somebody sends me a blue dress and some \nDNA and I will have an investigation.''\n  What kind of an insulting comment is that intended to be? Do you want \nto trust this individual with a bipartisan responsibility to the entire \nNation who can be so casual, so insulting, so sarcastic in his view of \nwhat takes place here? Do we honestly expect someone who has been a \npartisan attack dog for President Bush's reelection efforts to be \nindependent and nonpartisan? It is just not realistic.\n  It is time for the President and this administration to return to \nreality--the reality of Iraq, the sadness of the loss of life, the \nruination of families, the emotional disturbances that occur. We have \nsome reservists from the State of New Jersey on active duty in Iraq. We \njust had our 33rd death of service people from New Jersey in Iraq. The \ndisturbances that go to normal life, the daddies missing, mommies \nmissing in the household--it is terrible. We have to get back to \nreality, the reality of Iraq, the reality that our Nation's \nintelligence is not just guessing, and the reality is that we need an \nobjective, nonpartisan intelligence chief in this Nation.\n  I say with regret that we cannot accept turning responsibility over \nfor managing this Nation's intelligence gathering to someone who first \nlooks at which side of the political aisle someone is on before he \nmakes decisions about the responsibility for the CIA.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I now yield as much time as the distinguished Senator from Maryland \nmay use. I thank the distinguished Senator for her service on this \ncommittee as she always provides the committee with very candid, \nindependent, and right-on views. I am delighted to yield time to her at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman of the Intelligence Committee for \nhis words. I also thank him for the process he provided for us to \nevaluate the suitability of Porter Goss to be the Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency. He gave us a lot of time to be able to \ninterview Mr. Goss directly. His staff has been quite collegial and \nquite cooperative, and we want to thank him for providing us with that \ntype of environment in which to make a wise and prudent decision.\n  Indeed, deciding on this nomination is vitally important. The \nDirector of the CIA needs to be up to the job.\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\nThese are very dangerous times, and it is vitally important that we \nmake the right choice. Now more than ever, the security of our Nation \ndepends on timely, reliable intelligence to detect, disrupt, and deter \nterrorist attacks on the United States of America and to also make sure \nattacks don't happen to treasured allies, and to help policymakers, \nfrom the President and his Cabinet to Members of Congress, to make the \nright decisions about what we need to do related to diplomacy and the \ndeployment of our troops.\n  The next Director of the CIA will have to do all of this and even \nmore. The next Director will also have to push through the much needed \nreform at the CIA and to cooperate in the reforming of other \nintelligence agencies. We want to make sure there are no more 9/11's \nand no more wars based on dated and dubious evidence.\n  The constitutional duty of the Senate is to review the nominations of \nthe President. I take that very seriously. When a nominee comes, \nregardless for what position or from whatever party is in power, for an \nimportant position like this, I ask four questions: Is that person \ncompetent? Do they bring integrity to the job? Are they committed to \nthe core mission of the agency? And will they function in an \nindependent way?\n  As I said at our hearings, I know Porter Goss, and I have worked with \nhim over the years. I have no doubt that Congressman Goss is competent \nbased on his years of service, both as an agent at the CIA as well as \nin the House of Representatives chairing the House Intelligence \nCommittee. From my knowledge, he has been a man of integrity. And yes, \nhe is committed to the mission of the CIA and the importance of \nintelligence to help protect the United States of America. The great \nbig caution yellow light I have is the one about independence--the \nwillingness to speak truth to power, committed to reform, to be \nnonpartisan, and also never to sugarcoat, dilute, or twist the \ninformation going to the President of the United States and top \npolicymakers.\n  During the last year, I have become very concerned about Mr. Goss's \npartisan activities. He has unfairly attacked Democrats. He has been \nstrident in other statements in terms of the political campaign for the \nPresidency.\n  My questions are, Who is this Porter Goss? Is he the one I served \nwith in the House who was a moderate conservative, straightforward, and \nalso someone who said we have to think out of the box so we don't end \nup in a box? Or is he a rather an aggressively partisan person? My \nquestion about Porter Goss is, Would he be an independent voice in the \nadministration as well as a strong advocate for real and deep reform? \nWould he present the President with the best information based on facts \nand sound analysis without regard to ideology or conventional wisdom? \nWould he tell the President what he should hear, not what the President \nwould like to hear? That is what speaking truth to power means.\n  Speaking truth to power is not easy. It is very difficult. Yet for \nthe Director of the CIA it is important that he speak the whole truth \nand nothing but the truth, without sugarcoating, no matter how \ndifficult. The President must receive the best judgment and \ninformation. That is what I am looking at.\n  Now, having had those questions when Mr. Goss was before the \ncommittee, in my usual way I asked very direct questions. I raised \nthose issues. I even raised the issue the previous Senator, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg raised. What about this investigation, \nthe blue dress, and the DNA? Well, I put it to him. And his answer back \nwas, yes, he would be nonpartisan. That he understood the role of the \nDirector of the CIA is different from being a Congressman. That it is \nnot a political job, it is a job that is both policy and operational.\n  He said he would speak truth to power to both the President and to \nthe Congress. And if anyone knows the importance of congressional \noversight, it is Porter Goss. He agreed to work with the Congress to \nreform our intelligence agencies.\n  As you can see, at the hearing, in response to both my questioning \nand questioning by the chairman and other members, particularly on this \nindependence issue, he said he would raise these issues.\n  So when I have to think about, is this the Porter Goss who is \nmoderate, straightforward, willing to work across the aisle, or is this \nthe aggressively partisan and even intemperate person, I take him at \nhis word. However, in the words of Ronald Reagan, who said ``trust but \nverify,'' that is the way I feel about the Porter Goss nomination. I \naccept him at his word, which he not only gave to me but he gave to the \nentire committee in a public format, that he would be nonpartisan, \ncommitted to the truth, a leader for independence and reform, and would \nalways speak truth to power. So I accept him at his word, but I also \nbelieve we must engage in vigorous congressional oversight to make sure \nPorter Goss does the job he is to do, and to make sure he does what he \nhas committed to do.\n  So when my name is called, I will vote for Porter Goss. But I want to \nmake it very clear that in voting for Porter Goss to be the Director of \nthe CIA, I am not voting for him to be the future NID. As you know, we \nare not clear on what is the framework for reform we will adopt. There \nare ideas coming forth that I know we will be debating and voting on \nnext week and in the weeks ahead. So we want to be sure whatever \nframework we create, and if we do create the National Intelligence \nDirector, a position I have supported for many months, that person's \nnomination come to us separately. In voting for Porter Goss, I am \nvoting for him to be the head of CIA, but I am not using this vote for \nhim to be the NID by proxy.\n  Again, let me conclude by thanking the chairman and the vice chairman \nfor their hard work on this committee. It is a committee with great \nresponsibility. We take it seriously. But at the end of the day, my \nanalysis concludes that I will vote for Porter Goss. I will trust, but \nI will use congressional oversight to verify.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski for her very \nforthright statement. Like the Senator, I understand the point raised \nby Senator Lautenberg and would only make two points about the notion \nof Porter Goss's alleged lack of independence from the administration.\n  First, Mr. Goss sent a very candid letter to DCI Tenet, along with \nCongresswoman Jane Harman, who is the ranking member of the House \nIntelligence Committee, expressing deep concern about our intelligence \non Iraq. That letter is not the work of a shrinking violet, I can \nassure you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was orderd to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S, House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee \n           on Intelligence,\n                               Washington, DC, September 25, 2003.\n     Hon. George J. Tenet,\n     Director of Central Intelligence,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Tenet: At the outset, we reaffirm our support for \n     the dedicated men and women working in the Intelligence \n     Community (IC). Their deep commitment to our country and to \n     their profession is evident. The nation owes these \n     professional men and women its gratitude for their tireless \n     efforts to provide policymakers with the intelligence they \n     need to make informed decisions about the security of \n     Americans at home and in places like Iraq.\n       Thank you, again, for promptly responding to the \n     Committee's request for all intelligence information related \n     to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities, as \n     well as any ties to terrorist organizations, including al \n     Qa'ida. The Committee has reviewed all 9 volumes of material \n     that you provided, Additionally, it has held several closed \n     hearings and an open hearing, conducted a number of \n     interviews, made several oversight trips to Iraq, and \n     reviewed additional materials over the last four months. \n     Although the Committee's work continues, we have some \n     preliminary views that we offer so that the IC can begin to \n     consider necessary improvements. In addition, we offer these \n     views to provide you a chance to answer questions or clarify \n     any issues that will assist us in concluding our review.\n       At this point, several months into our review, we believe \n     there were significant deficiencies with respect to the IC's \n     intelligence collection activides concerning Iraq's WMD \n     programs and ties to al-Qa'ida prior to the commencement of \n     hostilities there.\n       We have a fundamental disagreement generally on whether the \n     National Intelligence\n\n[[Page S9505]]\n\n     Estimate on Iraq's WMD programs and the intelligence on \n     Iraq's ties to al-Qa'ida were deficient with regard to the \n     analysis and presentation, especially in the certainty of the \n     IC's judgments. The Ranking Member believes it was. The \n     Chairman believes it was not.\n       Additionally, the Committee is also reviewing the \n     intelligence assessments that existed pre-March 2003 \n     regarding the nature and level of resistance that U.S. troops \n     could expect in Iraq and the health of Iraq's civilian \n     infrastructure.\n\n\n                               iraq's wmd\n\n       In October 2002, the Intelligence Community produced a \n     National Intelligence Estimate that included statements that \n     ``We judge that Iraq has continued its weapons of mass \n     destruction (WMD) programs in defiance of UN resolutions and \n     restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons . . \n     .'' and ``in the view of most agencies, Baghdad is \n     reconstituting its nuclear weapons programs.'' (Iraq's \n     Continuing Programs of Weapons of Mass Destruction at p. 5 \n     (hereafter ``NIE'')). The Committee thoroughly reviewed the \n     underlying intelligence supporting these conclusions, that \n     you have provided, as well as the reporting from the early \n     efforts to locate WMD after the cessation of major military \n     action in Iraq. Thus far, it appears that these judgments \n     were based on too many uncertainties.\n\n\n          iraq's possession of chemical and biological weapons\n\n       The U.S. and the U.K. took limited air strikes in 1998 \n     (Operation Desert Fox), based on Iraq's lack of cooperation \n     and violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions \n     regarding weapons of mass destruction. In early 1998, while \n     the UN inspectors were still in Iraq and providing some \n     amount of solid information about the WMD programs, the IC's \n     judgments were based, in substantial part, on circumstantial \n     information. Such information--among other things--\n     identified: gaps and inconsistencies in Iraq's WMD \n     declarations to the UN; Iraq's obstruction of United Nations \n     Special Commission (UNSCOM) inspections and monitoring \n     activities; Saddam's efforts to declare certain sites exempt \n     from inspections; and Saddam's efforts to end inspections \n     entirely.\n       After the departure of UN weapons inspectors and Operation \n     Desert Fox, in 1998, some new information continued to be \n     developed on Iraq's capabilities, but access to ``ground \n     truth'' corroboration was lost. The IC was also faced with \n     the daunting challenge of trying to interpret snippets of \n     information in an environment where the regime was engaged in \n     massive denial and deception efforts. Based on past \n     assessments and some new ``piecemeal'' intelligence, which \n     was otherwise seemingly valid, the Community's analysis of \n     Iraq's WMD programs and capabilities reflected an assumption \n     that these long-standing judgments on the issue were still \n     valid. The absence of proof that chemical and biological \n     weapons and their related development programs had been \n     destroyed was considered as proof that they continued to \n     exist.\n       The dearth of post-1998 underlying intelligence reflects a \n     weakness in intelligence collection, The Committee on a \n     number of occasions in the past expressed its concern that \n     the IC was facing serious shortfalls in specific areas of \n     intelligence collection--to include intelligence from human \n     sources (HUMINT) and from technologies designed to tell us \n     about weapons development (Measurement and Signatures \n     Intelligence, or MASINT). The issues presented with respect \n     to Iraq's WMD programs and capabilities appear to be a case \n     in point. Lack of specific intelligence on regime plans and \n     intentions, WMD, and Iraq's support to terrorist groups \n     appears to have hampered the IC's ability to provide a better \n     assessment to the policymakers from 1998 through 2003.\n       Iraq has held a place of priority in U.S. foreign policy \n     and national security during successive Administrations. For \n     instance, in 1998 U.S. policy toward Iraq was clarified by \n     Congress and the President to reflect an unequivocal policy \n     to seek regime change, See Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 (P.L. \n     105-338 Oct. 31, 1998). Given the high priority placed on \n     Iraq policy, we believe greater efforts should have been made \n     to acquire more and better sources of information--\n     particularly well-targeted, close-in HUMINT.\n\n\n            reconstitution of iraq's nuclear weapons program\n\n       In October 2002, the NIE on Iraq's WMD programs made a \n     statement about Iraq's nuclear program, ``. . . in the view \n     of most agencies, Baghdad is reconstituting its nuclear \n     weapons program.'' (NIE at page 5.) The NIE cited six factors \n     in making this judgment:\n       Iraq's aggressive pursuit of high-strength aluminum tubes;\n       Iraq's attempts to obtain permanent magnet production \n     capability;\n       Iraq's attempts to obtain high-speed balancing machines;\n       Iraq's attempts to obtain computer-controlled machine \n     tools;\n       Iraq's efforts to re-establish and enhance its cadre of \n     weapons personnel, which included appearances by Saddam on \n     Iraqi TV exhorting his nuclear scientists; and\n       Activities at suspected nuclear sites.\n       Our examination has identified the relatively fragile \n     nature of this information. With respect to the aluminum \n     tubes, as was stated in the NIE, the Bureau of Intelligence \n     and Research (INR), citing the Department of Energy (DoE) \n     analysis, disagreed with the view that these tubes were \n     intended for Iraq's nuclear program. The other items that \n     Iraq was seeking (permanent magnet production capability, \n     high-speed balancing machines, and computer-controlled \n     machine tools), in addition to having utility in a nuclear \n     weapons program, also have civilian uses. Other elements of \n     information available to the IC on the topic of nuclear \n     reconstitution may have been susceptible to Iraqi denial and \n     deception efforts. These included trying to determine the \n     nature of Iraqi activities at suspected nuclear sites or the \n     purpose of Saddam's TV appearances exhorting his nuclear \n     scientists. We have not found any information in the \n     assessments that are still classified that was any more \n     definitive.\n\n\n             iraq's ties to terrorists including al-qa'ida\n\n       The Committee has reviewed the three volumes of information \n     provided by you on Iraq's ties to terrorism, most of which \n     remains classified. We have found no reason to question the \n     State Department's decision to designate Iraq as a state \n     sponsor of terrorism for at least a decade.\n       On the issue of Iraq's ties to al-Qa'ida, however, we \n     believe substantial gaps in collection--particularly HUMINT--\n     contributed to the Intelligence Community's inability to give \n     policymakers a clear understanding of the nature of the \n     relationship.\n       In place of an assessment characterizing the relationship \n     between Saddam and al-Qa'ida, the Intelligence Community \n     reported on possible contacts between al-Qa'ida associates \n     and Iraq. As in other cases of IC reporting on terrorism \n     generally, we believe that there was either a ``low \n     threshold'' or ``no threshold'' for disseminating information \n     on ties between Iraq and al-Qa'ida. As a result, intelligence \n     reports that might have been screened out by a more rigorous \n     vetting process made their way to the analysts' desks, \n     providing ample room for vagary to intrude. Although the \n     Intelligence Community often noted that the reports were \n     ``from sources of varying reliability,'' these reports did \n     not make clear which of them were from sources that were \n     credible and which were from sources that would otherwise be \n     dismissed in the absence of any other corroborating \n     intelligence.\n\n\n   nature of iraqi resistance and the state of iraq's infrastructure\n\n       In addition to these two issues, we are concerned whether \n     the policymakers were warned adequately about the nature and \n     level of resistance our troops would face in Iraq, or about \n     the dilapidated state of Iraq's civilian infrastructure. The \n     Committee will be reviewing the intelligence available to \n     policymakers prior to the commencement of hostilities to \n     determine if there were shortcomings in the support provided \n     on these issues. The Committee will seek to understand what \n     requirements were levied on the IC prior to the invasion, \n     what assessments were made, whether the assessments were \n     completed in a timely manner, and, with the benefit of \n     hindsight, how well the assessments match what has been found \n     in Iraq since the cessation of major hostilities.\n\n\n                    policymakers statements on iraq\n\n       The Committee has reviewed extensively allegations that \n     there was a disconnect between public statements by \n     Administration officials and the underlying intelligence, The \n     Committee's purview does not extend to the formulation or \n     articulation of foreign policy. We do believe, however, that \n     if public officials cite intelligence incorrectly, the IC has \n     a responsibility to go back to that policymaker and make \n     clear that the public statement mischaracterized the \n     available intelligence. The IC exists to inform policymakers \n     on matters of foreign intelligence. It does not make policy. \n     The IC is one of many sources of information available to \n     policymakers. Policymakers are under no obligation to believe \n     or adhere to the IC's judgments. Nor should the IC dictate \n     U.S. foreign policy.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The assessment that Iraq continued to pursue chemical and \n     biological, weapons remained constant and static over the \n     past ten years. The U.S. understanding of Iraq's ties to \n     terror groups was also longstanding. We note, however, that \n     there was insufficient specific information regarding the \n     following:\n       Saddam's plans and intentions,\n       the status of Iraq's WMD programs and capabilities, and\n       Iraq's links to al-Qa'ida, specifically.\n       The intelligence available to the U.S. on Iraq's possession \n     of WMD and its programs and capabilities relating to such \n     weapons after 1998, and its links to al-Qa'ida, was \n     fragmentary and sporadic. These assessments and longstanding \n     judgments were not challenged as a routine matter within the \n     IC. Saddam Hussein, for his part, apparently made no effort \n     to dispel the conclusions that he possessed weapons of mass \n     destruction, had programs in place to produce them and had \n     the capabilities to deliver them, or that he had links to \n     terrorist groups.\n       Underlying these problem areas were serious deficiencies in \n     our HUMINT collection capabilities against this target. HPSCI \n     has consistently recommended greater management attention and \n     allocation of resources to core intelligence mission areas--\n     such as HUMINT and analysis. We believe Iraq is, in many \n     ways, a case study for improvements in these areas.\n       We would appreciate your response to the issues raised in \n     this letter. In addition, we\n\n[[Page S9506]]\n\n     seek your assurance that the shortcomings identified will be \n     promptly addressed. Finally, we intend to have additional \n     hearings, open and closed, as appropriate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Porter J. Goss,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                                      Jane Harman,\n                                                 Ranking Democrat.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Second, the independence issue was thoroughly explored \nat Mr. Goss's confirmation hearing as of this week. Mr. Goss has \nassured the committee--and I do believe him, knowing him for 16 years \nin the Congress--that he has the integrity, as Senator Mikulski put it, \nto look the President in the eye and say no.\n  Mr. President, at present, it does not appear either side has a \nMember requesting time, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield such time to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida as he might consume and thank him for his \ncontributions, not only with his strong interest in the Intelligence \nCommittee and the leading intelligence issues and challenges we face \ntoday, but for his service on the Armed Services Committee as well, for \nworking with me with regard to Captain Spiker and other issues. I look \nforward to his comments.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are at ``no fooling time'' \nwith regard to our intelligence activities. Because the only thing that \nis going to prevent another terrorist attack, of which there are many \nattempts, is the accuracy and quality and the timeliness of the \nintelligence information we get. In dealing with a secretive nation \nsuch as North Korea, which in this Senator's opinion is one of the \ngravest threats to the interests of the United States because of their \noutspoken attempt to acquire nuclear capability, we simply have to \npenetrate a secret society such as that with our intelligence apparatus \nmore than we have been doing.\n  Therefore, who is going to lead this administrative apparatus on \nintelligence gathering and intelligence analysis and intelligence \ncoordination, with the multitude of agencies all dealing with \nintelligence, is extremely important. That is why I am standing here \nspeaking on behalf of my fellow Floridian and my friend Porter Goss.\n  This Congress will have a monumental task before it very shortly on \nthe reorganization of the intelligence apparatus as well as the \nreorganization of putting our own house in order as we exercise that \noversight or give direction to the executive branch of government. And \nthat needs to be done better than we have in the past.\n  But the task before us right now is to exercise our constitutional \nduty in confirming or rejecting an appointment by the President to lead \nthe intelligence apparatus, right now as symbolized by the Director of \nthe Central Intelligence. That is why I am here to speak on behalf of \nPorter Goss.\n  It has already been said before many times that he started in 1960 as \nan Army intelligence officer, right out of school. Having gone into the \nCIA from that, with a distinguished career, he ended up back being a \ncity councilman and a mayor in a little town on the southwest coast of \nFlorida. Then-Governor Graham, now my senior colleague in the Senate, \nwhen three vacancies occurred on the Lee County Commission--they had \noccurred for whatever reason, but they were there--then--Governor \nGraham chose Porter Goss to fill one of those vacancies. Then his \npublic service expanded, and he later ran and won a seat in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. We have known of his public service through \nhis capacity as the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.\n  Now, has Porter said some things he probably wishes he would not have \nsaid? Yes. But who among us has not made those kinds of mistakes? This \nSenator knows him to be, in this political cauldron of highly charged \npartisan politics, one of the most bipartisan of all Members of \nCongress that I have had the pleasure of knowing. It is my \nunderstanding that he made a commitment to the Intelligence Committee, \nand specifically to questions propounded by the vice chairman of that \ncommittee, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. \nRockefeller, that he would not engage in a partisan manner, which is \nthe least that can be expected of the Director of the CIA. The stakes \nare too high for this country for any of that kind of nonsense.\n  I believe Porter is a man of his word to the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. I believe, given the circumstances of where we are now, with \nso much at stake and having to have the right kind of leader, this is \nthe leader the President has nominated. We are now in the process of \nadvising and probably consenting, and with the admonitions he has \nreceived, with the exceptional educational background he has had, with \nthe breadth of his experience, not only as an agent but as the chairman \nof the committee, I think it is the constitutional duty of the Senate \nto render a verdict. I think that verdict ought to be for the approval \nof Porter Goss as Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Mr. President, that is my effort to lend to this debate. It is short \nand sweet. This Senator, as well as my senior colleague from Florida, \nwill be voting in favor of Porter Goss.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, seeing no other Senators requesting time \nnow, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following Senator Dorgan's remarks, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess until 4 o'clock, and \nthat the time during the 4 o'clock period be equally charged against \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nit is my understanding, or I can ask the distinguished Senator--\n  Mr. REID. He said he has a short statement.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. He would be able to finish his remarks at 3, in time for \nthe meeting?\n  Mr. REID. Especially if we didn't talk more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I do not have a long presentation. My \nguess is the 3 o'clock briefing is one most Senators want to attend. I \ndo want to, however, visit a bit about this issue of the Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency.\n  We have been through pretty tough times with respect to intelligence \nin this country, and this is a critically important position. The \nPresident's choice is an important choice, especially given what we \nhave been through. Let me make a couple of comments.\n  First of all, I am going to vote for this nomination, but I do so \nwithout great enthusiasm, and I would like to explain why.\n  Porter Goss, I think, is qualified to assume this role. There is \nlittle in his record that suggests he is a reformer, and there is some \npiece of that record that suggests there is some partisanship, which \nbothers me. But I know Porter Goss. I have known him for a long while. \nWhen I served in the House of Representatives, I knew him.\n  While I would not have made this choice had I been President, the \nPresident has the opportunity to make the selection and deserves, in \nthis case, his own team. My hope is the questions asked of Mr. Goss at \nhis hearings will make certain he will run the CIA with a reformist \nattitude, with an understanding that things need to change, with an \nunderstanding that this cannot, under any circumstance, be a position \nfrom which partisanship flows, and that we have to get straight \nanswers, as does the President, from the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\n[[Page S9507]]\n\n  Over the years, we have had many, many failures in intelligence. For \nthose of us who have been through top secret briefings in room 407 of \nthe Capitol Building, it is nearly unbelievable what they told us they \nknew from all their different kinds of intelligence-gathering devices \nand their analysis, and what we subsequently learned were the facts or \nthe truth of the matter.\n  I am telling you because we need a good intelligence system to \nprotect our country and protect our homeland. I worry about all of \nthis, knowing that the intelligence system was deeply flawed. In candid \nmoments, most Members of the Senate would tell you that which was told \nthem as top secret intelligence information has often turned out to be \nfundamentally wrong.\n  We now read, for example--and I am not now discussing that which \ncomes from top secret briefings; I am discussing things that come from \nthe periodicals--we read, for example, that the intelligence we were \ngiven in briefings about the issue of mobile chemical weapons \nlaboratories, it turns out came from one source, a source they call \n``Curve Ball.'' I am describing this from Newsweek and Time magazine, \nnot from top secret briefings. One source turns out to apparently have \nbeen a drunk and a fabricator and, as a result of that source, we \nget top secret briefings and the Secretary of State makes a \npresentation at the United Nations about something that apparently we \nnow know was untrue. What kind of intelligence system is that?\n\n  We learned that Germans provide the name and information of a \nterrorist to the CIA here in the United States and the telephone number \nand nobody checks on him, nobody follows up at all. Our intelligence \nfolks cannot find a couple of alleged terrorists living in San Diego \nwhen their names and telephone numbers are in the phonebook? What on \nearth is this? I suppose it is Keystone Kops, except this is about the \nsecurity of the United States of America.\n  I want the CIA and the Intelligence Community to succeed. Our country \ndepends on it being able to succeed in gathering good intelligence and \nprotecting this country.\n  There is so much that is wrong here. Hans Blix, the U.N. weapons \ninspector, said he was ``not impressed'' by the intelligence presented \nby the administration regarding Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. The \nBlix team checked every site where U.S. intelligence indicated weapons \nof mass destruction would be found in Iraq, and there was nothing.\n  It goes on and on.\n  David Kay, the CIA chief weapons hunter, said the intelligence \ncommunity failed.\n  On the 9/11 issue, the intelligence community failed to connect the \ndots. I am not talking here just about the CIA; I am talking about the \nFBI. The list goes on.\n\n  When we are talking about 9/11, we also ought to talk about a report \nthat was done by the Joint Intelligence Committee in December of 2002 \nthat was published with 28 pages missing. Those 28 pages are about the \nSaudis. Fifteen of the 19 who attacked this country were Saudi \ncitizens. But when the report was published for the public to read, the \nWhite House redacted or eliminated the 28 pages that dealt with Saudi \nArabia.\n  On October 29 of last year, I offered an amendment to the Foreign \nOperations appropriations bill, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, \ncalling on the administration to declassify those 28 pages. If one is \ntalking about 9/11, and talking about intelligence, I believe the \nAmerican people and every Member of this Senate and the Congress need \nto understand what is in those 28 pages dealing with Saudi Arabia.\n  It is interesting, even the Saudi Ambassador and the Saudi Foreign \nMinister, publicly insisted that this information be declassified. \nSenator Shelby, the top Republican Senator on the 9/11 inquiry, said \nthat 95 percent of the classified pages of these 28 pages could be \nreleased without jeopardizing our national security.\n  I say once again to the administration and to my colleagues that the \n28 pages dealing with Saudi Arabia and 9/11 needs to be released to the \nAmerican people. This Congress and the American people should not be \nevaluating 9/11 and our intelligence without releasing those 28 pages, \nso that the American people see what was deemed required to be \nclassified. It should not have been classified.\n  Whether we are talking about Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria, or \nback even further, Libya or the old Soviet Union, there have been \nintelligence failures. We spend a great deal of money on U.S. \nintelligence. We want it to work. I do not want our intelligence system \nto fail our country, because our country requires a good intelligence \nsystem to prevent the next terrorist attack and to attack terrorists \nwhere they live.\n  The attack on Iraq was a preemptive strike that the President said \nwas necessary to protect our country. Well, it is very important when \ntalking about preemption, which is a doctrine that has been foreign to \nthis country's interests in the past, to have good intelligence. \nPreemption can never occur based on what one thinks. Preemption could \nonly occur based on what one knows. What one knows must come from good \nintelligence.\n  We have discovered, since the time preemption was discussed by this \nadministration, that the intelligence was just plain horrible on major \npoints delivered in top secret briefings to Members of this Congress. \nOur intelligence community was just flat wrong. So we all need to fix \nit.\n  There is no Republican or Democratic way to deal with intelligence. \nWe need to fix this system in the interests of this country. Our safety \ndepends on it.\n  I am going to vote for Mr. Goss. I think he is qualified to do this \njob. As I indicated, I am concerned about some things he has done in \nthe past. I hope that is over. I am concerned about the intelligence \nagencies themselves. I believe they are in desperate need of reform. I \nhope Mr. Goss will be a reformer. Most importantly, our country, all of \nus, each of us, needs to work together to create an intelligence system \nthat works for the safety of this country and works in a way that a \nPresident, a Congress, a Director of the CIA can rely on good \nintelligence from all around the world.\n  My understanding is that we will be in recess for 1 hour until the \nhour of 4 p.m.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9507-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GOSS TO BE DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What is the pending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the nomination of \nPorter Goss.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in reference to that \nnomination.\n  Mr. President, I will vote against the nomination of Congressman \nPorter Goss to serve as the next Director of Central Intelligence. I do \nso reluctantly. I have known Congressman Goss for a number of years, \nand I consider him a good person and a good public servant. But we are \non the verge of enacting significant, historic, and much needed reform \nof the U.S. intelligence community. It is more important than ever that \nthe next leader of the intelligence community be nonpartisan and firmly \ncommitted to meaningful intelligence reform.\n  Based on his record and his public statements, and on the \nconfirmation hearings before the Intelligence Committee on which I \nserve, I do not believe Mr. Goss is the right person at this moment in \ntime for this vitally important national security position.\n  Mr. Goss has served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee \nfor almost 8 years, the second longest tenure in that position in the \nalmost 30 years since its creation. The chairman of a congressional \ncommittee has considerable power in determining on which issues the \ncommittee will focus,\n\n[[Page S9508]]\n\nand the manner in which they will conduct their oversight. I believe \nthis oversight record is a reasonable measure of Mr. Goss's likely \neffectiveness in managing the intelligence community during this highly \nchallenging transitional period.\n  Despite having served on the Aspin-Brown-Rudman commission on the \nroles and capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community in 1996, 8 \nyears ago, and cochairing, along with Senator Bob Graham, a joint \ninquiry into the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and serving on the House \nPermanent Subcommittee on Intelligence for almost 10 years, Congressman \nGoss's record demonstrates that he has been more a protector of the \nstatus quo than an agent of meaningful reform. Only a few months ago \ndid Congressman Goss introduce, for the first time, legislation to \nreform the intelligence community. It should be noted that on July 25, \n2002, Mr. Goss voted against the amendment of Congressman Tim Roemer of \nIndiana on the House floor creating the independent National Commission \non Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, commonly known as the 9/11 \nCommission. That is an incredible fact that must be taken into \nconsideration.\n  The man who is seeking to be head of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nat this moment, when significant reform is about to take place, voted \nagainst the creation of the 9/11 Commission, which has inspired both \nparties and the President to our current state.\n  This 9/11 Commission Report is the foundation upon which current \nintelligence reform efforts are being undertaken. I met personally with \nCongressman Goss because I do respect him, and I wanted to hear his \nexplanation. How can he ask to be head of the CIA, when he voted \nagainst the creation of the 9/11 Commission?\n\n  His argument was not convincing. He argued it was a matter of timing; \nthat while he was undertaking a joint inquiry about 9/11, the creation \nof a separate commission might, in fact, lead to the executive branch \nstalling information or refusing to cooperate. That was hardly a \nsatisfying answer.\n  In addition, it appears that as chairman of the House Intelligence \nOversight Committee, Congressman Goss has been reluctant to conduct \naggressive oversight of Intelligence Committee issues, particularly \nwhen they appear to deal with issues that may be embarrassing to the \ncurrent administration. For example, although the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee completed the first phase of its inquiry into the \nintelligence community's performance regarding prewar intelligence \nrelated to Iraq, and issued a public report, the House Intelligence \nCommittee, under Mr. Goss's leadership, has yet to complete a similar \nthorough investigation, despite starting it last year.\n  As another example, in June of this year during the House \nIntelligence Committee's markup of the fiscal year 2005 Intelligence \nAuthorization Act, Mr. Goss led a party-line vote to reject an \namendment that would have required the Department of Defense to provide \nan accounting of the nature and extent of its contacts with the Iraqi \nexile leader, Ahmed Chalabi.\n  Why is that significant? I hope that people who are following this \ndebate remember Ahmed Chalabi. He was the self-proclaimed leader of an \nIraqi national congress. He was the one you couldn't miss on talk shows \nbefore the invasion of Iraq. He was the one spreading the information \nfar and wide across America and around the world about the threats of \nSaddam Hussein. He was the person who was the favored and trusted ally \nof our Department of Defense when they made critical decisions about \ncommitting thousands of American soldiers and their lives to the cause \nof Iraq.\n  What do we know of Ahmed Chalabi? We know that some 5 years ago, the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and the Department of State stopped dealing \nwith Mr. Chalabi because they did not believe he was credible. They \ndidn't trust his judgment. They wouldn't bring him into the councils to \nmake important decisions.\n  But Department of Defense Under Secretary Rumsfeld and his special \nassistant, Mr. Douglas Feith, thought Chalabi was just what the doctor \nordered. He was there to confirm the fears that they spread across \nAmerica about Saddam Hussein. He was there to confirm the presence of \nweapons of mass destruction, which became the clarion call of this \nadministration, drawing us into an invasion of Iraq. He was the one \nconstantly suggesting that there was a connection between the 9/11 \nterrorism in the United States and Saddam Hussein.\n  What happened to Ahmed Chalabi? Those who follow news know what \nhappened. He went to Iraq, became a somewhat controversial figure in \nthe provisional government, returned to the United States, and was \ntreated by some in the administration as a conquering hero.\n  In fact, at one moment in time, to the embarrassment, I am sure, of \neveryone involved today, Ahmed Chalabi was positioned behind the First \nLady at one of President Bush's State of the Union Addresses so that he \nwould be on camera, showcased before the American people.\n  Fast forward just a few months. Ahmed Chalabi has now been the \nsubject of extensive searches by the American Government because of our \nsuspicion that he has not only misled us about information on Iraq but \nhas had some connection with Iran of an entirely dubious nature. Ahmed \nChalabi is persona non grata in this country. We are no longer sending \nhim some $350,000 to $360,000 a month to subsidize his lifestyle. He \nvirtually has been banished from his role as prime adviser to the \nUnited States.\n  When Mr. Goss was confronted with this and asked by his own committee \nfor an investigation as to how Mr. Chalabi, discredited by the CIA, \ndiscredited by the State Department, became the darling and favorite of \nthe Department of Defense, peddled bad information to the United States \nand the American people, and may have betrayed us to Iran--when he was \nasked to investigate this, he declined. He refused. You have to ask \nyourself: If Mr. Goss was unable or unwilling to ask the most basic \nquestions about Ahmed Chalabi, how aggressive, how objective will he be \nas Director of the CIA?\n  That is not the only thing. One of the most important issues we have \nto keep in mind is that the men and women of our intelligence community \nare dedicated, patriotic, hard-working people committed to the security \nof our Nation. Occasionally, there will be those who will disappoint \nus, but that is true of virtually every institution in America. But \nremembering their patriotism and the fact that many of them put their \nlives on the line, there came a moment in time when columnist Robert \nNovak outed the identity of a CIA agent, Valerie Plame. This is not \nonly disgraceful, it is dangerous. It meant that her life and her \ncareer were in danger. It sent ripples through the intelligence \ncommunity of men and women in similar positions wondering who would \nstep forward in Washington to stand up for the integrity of our agents \nin the intelligence community. Mr. Goss was then chairman of the House \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. He was asked in October 2003 whether \nhe would investigate the purposeful identification of covert CIA agent \nValerie Plame. Mr. Goss responded, ``If somebody sends me a blue dress \nand some DNA, I'll have an investigation.''\n\n  Mr. Goss apologized publicly and privately for that statement, but \nthe fact remains that he was loathe to challenge any intelligence-\nrelated decision of this administration.\n  That is not at all reassuring when we consider the well-documented \nintelligence failures leading up to 9/11 and prior to the invasion of \nIraq.\n  This is not a routine appointment. This is not a routine position. \nIntelligence is the first line of defense in our war against terrorism. \nIt is the first line of defense for the American people and our \nnational security. Having the best intelligence network and the best \nintelligence agency will be critical if we want our children to live in \npeace and safety. That is why it is so essential that we bring a person \nto this job who understands what we have lived through during the past \n4 years.\n  Lengthy reports by the 9/11 Commission, as well as the Joint \nIntelligence Committee's inquiry, have come to the conclusion that our \nintelligence agency failed us before the 9/11 attack. We know now that \nthey should have gathered more information, shared more information, \ndrawn obvious conclusions, and done something proactive to protect \nAmerica. They did not and 3,000\n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\ninnocent Americans died in Pennsylvania, Virginia, and New York.\n  Similarly, there came a point in time when we had to make a critical \ndecision in America whether to launch a preemptive attack against \nSaddam Hussein in Iraq, the first such preemptive attack in our \nhistory. We were told it was essential that we do so. We were told by \nthe President, the Vice President, the Secretary of State, the \nSecretary of Defense, the head of the CIA, and virtually every \nspokesman of the Government that it was essential we attack Saddam \nHussein because he had arsenals of weapons of mass destruction which \ncould be used against the Middle East, other countries in the region \nand the United States, that he was developing nuclear weapons that \nwould be a danger to the world, that he possessed unmanned aerial \nvehicles that could even strike the United States, that he was linked \nwith the al-Qaida attacks of 9/11, and the list goes on and on. Today, \na year and a half after the invasion, we have found that intelligence \ninformation was wrong, just plain wrong.\n  Think of it. Depending on the intelligence community as our first \nline of defense, it failed. It failed to alert us of the danger of 9/\n11, it failed to accurately assess the state of one nation, Iraq, \nbefore we launched an invasion which has cost us over 1,000 American \nsoldiers' lives, over 7,000 seriously wounded, and literally billions \nof dollars.\n  Can the intelligence community continue with business as usual? No. \nIf there was ever a time in our history when we needed someone clearly \nnonpartisan, someone who would stand up to a President of either \npolitical party and tell them the sober, cold truth, even if it wasn't \npopular, if there was ever a time that we needed a Director of the \nCIA determined to reform that agency and the other intelligence \nagencies under his supervision, that time is today. This is not a \nroutine nomination. This is a nomination as important as any to be \nconsidered by the Senate.\n\n  I will not go into the lengthy partisan statements made by Mr. Goss \nso many times in the past where he has taken to task my political \nparty, members of it, suggesting that we were weak on defense, weak on \nintelligence. In fact, he was drawn into this Presidential campaign in \na role now which he has neither explained nor given us much to work \nwith.\n  When we went to Mr. Goss and said, You have criticized Senator Kerry \nand Democrats for intelligence spending but back in 1995 you were the \ncosponsor of a budget proposal that would have had a minimum 20-percent \ncut in our intelligence community personnel, he wouldn't answer the \nquestion. When confronted by Senator Rockefeller with his obvious \ncontradiction between his accusations and his actions, Mr. Goss refused \nto acknowledge the obvious. The best he could tell us was, ``The record \nis the record.'' I don't know what that means. I have never before \nheard it from another witness nor nominee. But it basically told the \nIntelligence Committee he wasn't about to discuss the issue with us.\n  I am sorry. I think Mr. Goss should have been open and candid and \ntold us exactly what he meant, and if he made a mistake to concede that \npoint. It would have put him in a much better position to be a credible \nagent for nonpartisan leadership and for change as Director of the CIA.\n  Because I have serious doubts about Mr. Goss's commitment to reform, \nhis ability to be independent and nonpartisan, I do not believe he is \nthe right person to be serving at the helm of the intelligence \ncommunity during this extraordinarily challenging time and I will \noppose his nomination.\n  I concede the outcome of the vote on this nomination. I assume he \nwill be comfortably confirmed by the Senate.\n  I sincerely hope Mr. Goss will take my comments and the comments of \nthose who vote against him as a challenge to him in his new role at the \nCIA. I hope he proves me wrong. I hope that I stand before this Chamber \nin the future and say he was nonpartisan, he was committed to reform, \nhe was prepared to tell this administration and any administration he \nserved the truth, even if it was politically painful. I hope that day \nwill come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, I have listened with interest \nto the comments of my good friend from Illinois, as I did earlier today \nby my friend from West Virginia. I respect their analysis of this \nnomination. I hope they respect my disagreement with that analysis.\n  I rise today to support the nomination of a friend, a man with whom I \nhave worked for over 25 years, a fellow Floridian whose judgment and \nintegrity I highly regard.\n  I support the confirmation of Porter Goss as the next Director of the \nCIA. I have known Congressman Goss and his wonderful family for more \nthan two decades. I commend them for their willingness to delay the \nwell-earned retirement which they thought would lie before them at the \nend of this session of Congress to take on this very difficult and \nimportant responsibility.\n  My colleagues know that I have been extremely critical of this \nadministration for, among other things, its failure to hold anyone \naccountable for the intelligence failures that allowed terrorists to \nstrike our Nation on September 11, 2001, and for the failure that led \nus into the war in Iraq.\n  I have been extremely critical of the President and the Vice \nPresident for allowing America to be distracted from the real war \nagainst terror in Afghanistan and to call upon us to retreat from that \nreal war against the real terrorists who had killed 3,000 Americans and \nusing fabricated intelligence to draw us into the war in Iraq.\n  I have repeatedly questioned why the President has waited more than 3 \nyears since September 11 to begin a serious discussion of \nrestructuring, reorienting, and reforming our intelligence \ncapabilities.\n  I am here today to support the nomination of Porter Goss precisely \nbecause of these concerns. From my personal experience, I can tell you \nthat Porter Goss is the right man for this job. He is uniquely \nqualified to serve as America's Director of Central Intelligence. He is \na man of great character, exceptional intelligence, a tremendous work \nethic, and outstanding personal and professional integrity.\n  Let me share a story.\n  As Governor of Florida, I had known of Porter Goss as he served as a \ndistinguished mayor of the town of Sanibel Island, FL. In the early \n1980s, the county in which Sanibel is located, Lee County, FL, was in \nthe midst of probably the largest public works project in the history \nof that county, a major new airport which is now known as the \nSouthwestern Florida International Airport.\n  In the midst of that, three of the five members of the county \ncommission were indicted for corruption, largely relating to activities \ninvolving the construction of the airport. The county government was in \ndisarray. Public confidence in the county government had sunk to a new \nlow, and this major, critically important project to the future of the \ncitizens of southwest Florida had come into question. It was my \nresponsibility as Governor of Florida to first suspend from office \nthose individuals who had been indicted, and then to look for three \ncitizens of Lee County who could assume the important responsibility of \nrestoring the integrity of county government and completing the \nimportant airport project.\n  Although I am a Democrat, and had just been reelected as a Democrat, \nand Porter is a Republican, it was my feeling that his personal \ncharacteristics were more important than his party label, and so I \nappointed him to one of those three positions. And from that \nappointment, he quickly became the chair of the Lee County commission.\n  Party affiliation did not matter then. I do not believe party \naffiliation should matter today in determining who should be the next \nDirector of our Central Intelligence operation. What mattered then was \nthe fact that Porter, with his clear commitment to public service, his \nintegrity and his leadership skills, at a time when his community \ndesperately needed all of them, was able to recapture the confidence of \nthe people, was able to restart this important airport project, which \nnow is one of the most important economic assets of the community.\n  When it comes to the intelligence community, Congressman Goss has the \nbalanced perspective of having been\n\n[[Page S9510]]\n\nboth an insider and an outsider. For a decade early in his career, he \nserved the Nation both in Army Intelligence and the CIA. He knows from \npersonal, firsthand experience the value and the risks of clandestine \noperations.\n  Since he has been in Congress--elected in 1988--and especially as a \nmember of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, he has \ncome to know the agencies from an oversight capacity.\n  Now, some have said he is too close to the intelligence agencies, \nthat he is too protective of the status quo. But from my partnership \nwith him as cochairmen of the congressional joint inquiry into the \nevents of September 11, it is my firm belief, and my assurance to my \ncolleagues, that Porter Goss can and will be independent in his \njudgments. Porter Goss will also be clear and tough minded in \ndetermining where there are needed reforms and leading us to those \nreforms.\n  If any of my colleagues or citizens of this great Nation wish to have \nan indication of where those reforms are likely to take us, I would \ndirect you to the 19 reforms recommended by that congressional joint \ninquiry, upon which our Presiding Officer participated with great \ndistinction.\n  As we move to implement much-needed reforms in our intelligence \ncommunity, I am confident Porter Goss will not be part of the problem \nbut will be a leader in taking us toward principled and effective \nsolutions which will make Americans safer.\n  This time the President got it right. I strongly urge the \nconfirmation of his nominee to be the Director of Central Intelligence, \nPorter Goss.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I intend to vote today to confirm the \nnomination of Representative Porter Goss to be the Director of Central \nIntelligence. I recognize the deep experience that Representative Goss \nbrings to this position as the recent Chairman of the House Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, and as a former CIA officer and Army \nintelligence officer. I also understand the unique role the DCI plays \nin providing the President with intelligence and advising him on \nintelligence matters. Thus, I believe that on balance Mr. Goss's \nqualifications are sufficient to confirm the President's choice for \nthis position.\n  However, I want to express concerns about Porter Goss and the very \npartisan way in which he has conducted himself. His statements \nmischaracterizing Democratic presidential nominee Senator John Kerry's \npositions on intelligence and accusing Congressional Democrats of being \nweak on intelligence are not the sort of rhetoric we want associated \nwith the leader of our intelligence community. As former Secretary of \nState Henry Kissinger testified in the Appropriations Committee \nyesterday, the ideal leader for our Nation's intelligence community \nshould be as non-partisan as possible. Mr. Goss has acknowledged that \nas DCI he will need to be non-partisan and objective if he is to \nprovide the President with independent judgments about the intelligence \nhe provides, and during his nomination hearings, he made a commitment \nto do just that. We must hold him to his commitment.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor today to speak of Porter \nGoss's integrity and his strong qualifications. He will no doubt be \nconfirmed and will take on one of the most critical jobs in our \ngovernment at a time of uncertainty about how his very job will be \nstructured. The 9/11 Commission has made a compelling case for making \nmajor changes to the organization of our intelligence community. The \nnew threats which confront us require a more cohesive intelligence \neffort that emphasizes shared intelligence over turf battles. To meet \nthis challenge, we need a leader at the helm of the intelligence \ncommunity who embraces the spirit of reform--even if not all the \nspecifics of the 9/11 Commission recommendations--and who is willing to \nimplement the reforms that all agree are sorely needed. I have no doubt \nthat Porter Goss is capable of managing the changes that need to take \nplace and I am hopeful that he will dedicate himself to these efforts.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the most important quality I am looking for \nin a Director of Central Intelligence is someone who can be relied upon \nto provide objective intelligence assessments independent of the policy \nand political agenda of the White House. Too often we haven't had that.\n  The massive intelligence failures before the Iraq war were, to a \nsignificant degree, the result of the CIA shaping intelligence to \nsupport administration policy. The CIA's errors were all in one \ndirection, making the Iraqi threat clearer, sharper and more imminent, \nthereby promoting the administration's decision to remove Saddam \nHussein from power. Nuances, qualifications and caveats were dropped; a \n``slam-dunk'' was the assessment. The CIA was saying to the \nadministration, to the Congress, and to the American people what it \nthought the administration wanted to hear.\n  The problem of intelligence being manipulated and politicized is not \nnew. Forty years ago, Secretary of Defense McNamara used classified \ncommunications intercepts, later proved to be very dubious, to push for \npassage of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution, which was then used by \nPresident Johnson as the legislative foundation to expand the war in \nVietnam.\n  Intelligence was manipulated by then-DCI William Casey during the \nIran Contra period. The bipartisan Iran-Contra report cited evidence \nthat Director Casey ``misrepresented or selectively used available \nintelligence to support the policy he was promoting.''\n  We need a different kind of DCI, one who is not going to be \ninfluenced by the policy choices or politics of whatever administration \nis in power. After reviewing Congressman Goss's record, I am not \nconvinced that he would be that kind of DCI. For example, the \nWashington Post reported that in 2002, when asked about intelligence \nfailures in Iraq, Congressman Goss said ``I don't like to see the left-\nwingers splattering mud on an agency that's done some very fine work.'' \nThe Senate Intelligence Committee produced a unanimous 500-page report \non the massive CIA failures leading up to the Iraq war. I would not \ncharacterize the committee as ``a bunch of left wingers.'' We need \nsomeone who is committed to independence and reform, not an ideology.\n  During his nomination hearing, Congressman Goss was very reluctant to \nadmit there had been intelligence failures on the part of the \nintelligence community during the most recent Iraq War. And, when asked \nquestions about some of his partisan comments, Congressman Goss \nanswered many of them by simply saying ``the record is the record.'' \nWhatever that means, it is not an acceptable answer from a nominee for \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n  I will vote against Congressman Goss. I hope that, if confirmed, he \nwill prove me wrong.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the nomination \nof Porter Goss to be the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, \nCIA. Yesterday the Senate Intelligence Committee voted 12-to-4 to send \nRepresentative Goss' nomination to the Senate floor. I welcome the \nopportunity to say a few words about this important nomination and \nabout the state of our Nation's intelligence community.\n  As my colleagues know, in 1947, President Harry Truman signed \nlegislation which provided for the establishment of the CIA. This \nimportant agency supports the President, the National Security Council, \nand American officials who play a role in shaping or executing the \nnational security policy of the United States. The CIA engages in \nresearch and analysis of information, as well as a host of other \nactivities related to foreign intelligence and national security.\n  However, as every American knows all too well, times have changed \nsince 1947. We are now engaged in new battles. We are facing new \nthreats. The Soviet Union is no longer our arch enemy. Instead we face \nan enemy that is dispersed throughout the world in small cells--\nsometimes connected, sometimes acting independently. The new threat--\nterrorism--is an asymmetrical one.\n  Nonetheless, we must remember that terrorism alone is not our enemy. \nIt is a tactic used by our enemies. Therefore, our task is twofold. \nFirst, we must defeat soundly those who would attack our country and \nendanger the security of Americans. But secondly, we must also defeat \nthe murderous ideology of terrorism. That is because terrorism is the \nenemy of all humankind.\n\n[[Page S9511]]\n\nIt knows no faces, names, or nationalities. And I am confident that a \nstrong America, which is respected by our friends and allies, can \ndefeat this scourge.\n  Indeed, one thing we can all agree upon in this body is that a strong \nand capable intelligence effort has never been more important to the \nsecurity of our Nation. That brings me to the nomination before us \ntoday. At the best of times the job of Director of Central Intelligence \nis a difficult one. And we all know that these are not the best of \ntimes. Our intelligence infrastructure failed this Nation when we \nneeded it most.\n  There are two important traits that the next Director of the CIA \nneeds to possess in order to be successful in restoring the \neffectiveness of our intelligence capabilities.\n  First, it is of the utmost importance that the Director of the CIA be \nnonpartisan. The safety of the American people is not a matter of \npolitical parties. National security is an issue that must unite us in \na common cause. To that end, I share the deep concerns of several of my \ncolleagues that some of Representative Goss's comments during his \ntenure as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee were overly \npartisan and blindly supportive of the Bush administration.\n  Moreover it is critical to recognize that he chose to become involved \nin the political process. That decision was not forced on him. He chose \nit freely. And I believe that it has undermined his ability to be a \nnonpartisan Director of Central Intelligence, DCI. There is no question \nthat intelligence has been politicized in this administration. I know \nit. The American people know it. And the civil servants who work at the \nCIA know it. To rush to confirm an individual who has played a role in \npoliticizing intelligence is extremely unwise and only serves to \nfurther demoralize the individuals who are working so hard to protect \nour national security.\n  Second, he or she must have the knowledge and experience necessary to \nlead some of our most critical intelligence efforts. We cannot ignore \nthe fact that the most egregious lapses in history by our Nation's \nintelligence community happened while Mr. Goss was chairman of the \nHouse Intelligence Committee--the committee responsible for ensuring \nthat US intelligence agencies function effectively. If he failed in his \noversight responsibilities, as I believe he has, how then can we have \nany confidence that he is capable of accomplishing an even more \ndifficult task--the fundamental reform of the entire intelligence \napparatus? I do not believe that we can.\n  We all know that the 9/11 Commission has recommended a major overhaul \nof our intelligence operations. Much of that will have to be done at \nthe CIA. It is going to take an individual with very strong management \nskills to carry out the restructuring of that agency. He will have to \nhave credibility within the institution of the CIA if he is to be \nsuccessful. Institutions resist change. Based upon Mr. Goss' weak \noversight of the agency, I am not confident that he has the wherewithal \nto overcome the resistance he will confront to the fundamental reforms \nbeing contemplated.\n  Actions always speak louder than words. Unfortunately, we don't know \nwhat Mr. Goss's actions will be as director, but we do know what his \nactions have been as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. In \nmy opinion, to confirm Mr. Goss with such uncertainty about his ability \nto get the job done would be irresponsible.\n  This position is too critical to leave to chance. The agency is \ncurrently being led by a very able career intelligence director. He is \nalready working with the committees of Congress to devise a plan to \nrestore the effectiveness and credibility of the US intelligence \ncommunity. In the immediate future, he will continue to do so.\n  For those reasons, I will oppose this nomination when the Senate \nvotes today.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the nomination \nof Porter Goss to serve as Director of Central Intelligence.\n  The American people have learned much since 9/11 about the vital role \nof objective, nonpolitical intelligence in keeping us safe at home and \nin protecting American interests abroad. We also have witnessed the \ndisastrous consequences of the administration's manipulation of \nintelligence in its rush to war in Iraq--disastrous for our brave \ntroops on the ground, for their families, for our country, and for our \nstanding in the world.\n  When it comes to intelligence, this is no time for politics. As we \nreorganize and strengthen our intelligence structures, we need a leader \nof the CIA whose only loyalty is speaking truth to power.\n  We need an unbiased advisor to the President, not a partisan--someone \nwho will deliver the good news and the bad with candor, foresight, and \nauthority. With Porter Goss, however, we get not only a partisan, but a \ncheerleader for the Bush campaign.\n  What is most disturbing about the Porter Goss nomination is that he \nhas offered no explanation for his partisan behavior as chairman of the \nHouse Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  He has made partisan attacks on John Kerry for cutting intelligence \nbudgets, when Mr. Goss himself voted 7 out of 10 years to scale back \nintelligence appropriations.\n  He was initially unwilling to pursue the administration's vengeful \nleak of the name of CIA agent Valerie Plame to the press, which ended \nher career as a covert CIA officer and endangered her life.\n  He rushed to discredit former counterterrorism czar Richard Clarke \nafter Mr. Clarke's testimony to the 9/11 Commission became so \nembarrassing to the White House.\n  He did not support an inquiry into Ahmad Chalabi, even after \nallegations that Chalabi had leaked American secrets to Iran, because \nthe Chalabi affair was embarrassing to White House and the Pentagon.\n  Mr. Goss waited until June of this year to introduce legislation to \nreform our intelligence community a full 18 months after the initial \njoint congressional inquiry that he helped lead uncovered massive \nstructural problems the resulted in the intelligence failures before 9/\n11. That is not leadership. That is not vision.\n  In his confirmation hearing, when asked repeatedly about his partisan \nstatements and actions, he offered no explanation. He repeatedly \noffered the same unsatisfactory response: ``the record is the record.''\n  If the record is the record for Mr. Goss, then it is a record that \nputs politics above the national interest. If the record is the record, \nthen it is one that places partisan gain ahead of the facts. If the \nrecord is the record, then Mr. Goss is the wrong person to serve as our \nNation's Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Mr. Goss cannot, even now, cite a single instance in which public \nstatements of Bush administration policymakers mischaracterized the \navailable intelligence prior to the Iraq war. If he can't speak the \nplain truth about such an obvious fact, how can the American people \nhave any confidence in him as the head of our intelligence community?\n  The challenges of 9/11 and the administration's misuse of \nintelligence in rushing to war in Iraq demand that any reforms to our \nintelligence community be rooted firmly in the principle that \nintelligence must be completely insulated from partisan politics and \nideology. The confirmation of Porter Goss as Director of Central \nIntelligence violates that principle in the most fundamental sense.\n  We owe it to our fellow citizens to do better. I oppose the \nnomination of Porter Goss.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will vote for the nomination of Porter \nGoss to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  I served with Porter Goss during my time in the House of \nRepresentatives. He is a good, intelligent man with a tremendous work \nethic. He has served his country honorably in the Army, as a CIA \nofficer, and as a congressman from Florida.\n  He is the President's choice and I am willing to give the benefit of \nthe doubt. However, the two days of nomination hearings held by the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence highlighted several areas of \nconcern, and my vote today should not be seen as support for \nCongressman Goss to become the National Intelligence Director.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, Congressman Porter Goss will become \nDirector\n\n[[Page S9512]]\n\nof Central Intelligence at a difficult and important time for the U.S. \nIntelligence Community. In the coming months, he must help both \nCongress and the administration to take sensible steps on intelligence \nreform. In the years to come, if he remains in office, Mr. Goss must \nlead our intelligence agencies into a new era of flexibility, skill, \nand inter-agency cooperation.\n  I will vote in favor of confirming Mr. Goss to this position, \nalthough not without some misgivings. I will support his confirmation \nin part because I know him to be a gentleman and a man with a deep and \nsincere interest in intelligence, as well as substantial background in \nthe field. I will support him because many others who know him well, \nincluding our colleagues from Florida and others whose views I respect, \nhave contacted me and testified to his integrity and capabilities.\n  And I will support Mr. Goss because the President wants him. A CIA \nDirector cannot succeed unless the President likes and respects him \nenough to take seriously the facts and warnings the Director conveys to \nhim. The President must be willing to accept advice when the Director \nsays that something is not ``a slam dunk,'' and I hope that this \nPresident will be willing to accept such advice from this nominee.\n  As a matter of general policy, however, I have real concerns about \nappointing a partisan politician to such sensitive positions as \nDirector of Central Intelligence or Director of the FBI. In 1976, I \nvoted against George H. W. Bush as Director of Central Intelligence for \nprecisely that reason. I suggested: ``The chances for forceful \nintegrity will be infinitely greater if the Director of Central \nIntelligence is a highly respected nonpolitical figure.''\n  The need for a DCI to transcend partisan politics is crystal clear. \nHe is the person who must be able to tell the President that the world \nis not as the President might wish it, that a cherished policy proposal \nwill not work, or that some unforeseen development poses a threat to \nour national security. As we remove the walls between domestic and \nforeign intelligence, moreover, the DCI--like the FBI Director--will be \nhandling and presenting sensitive information on American citizens.\n  The next DCI will preside, moreover, over great and perhaps wrenching \ntransition in U.S. intelligence. The report of the 9/11 Commission \nhighlighted a series of long-standing shortfalls in our intelligence \nagencies. Although the particulars regarding the fight against al-Qaida \nmay have been new, the challenges facing U.S. intelligence are ones \nthat go back many years:\n  We need to provide instant and accurate intelligence to our military \nforces, and this drives much of our intelligence collection and \nanalysis today. At the same time, however, we need to provide a wide \nrange of so-called ``national'' intelligence to the rest of the \nnational security community. Balancing those needs is a continuing \nchallenge, especially as the funds for intelligence will often compete \nagainst other defense priorities.\n  We need intelligence collectors and analysts with a wider range of \nlinguistic and cultural skills than ever before. Once we fought a \ncommunist enemy that was worldwide, but centrally directed. Now we must \nvanquish the twin perils of radical Islamic terrorism and the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, both of which are nearly \nworld-wide, but no longer controlled by a central, well-defined enemy.\n  And we need technical intelligence collection systems that are ever \nmore powerful, that provide more real-time information, and that will \nbe effective in a world where technology often favors secrecy over \ntransparency.\n  We need seamless sharing of very sensitive intelligence information--\nbetween agencies, between countries, and between Washington and the \nState and local forces that guard us from terrorism on a daily basis. \n``Stovepipes'' and ``rice bowls'' are outmoded and in need of a real \nmake-over to meet the needs of the 21st century.\n  At the same time, however, we need strong protections for our civil \nliberties, which are the very foundation of our society. When the most \nrecognizable member of this Senate is denied an airline ticket in his \nhome town because his name shows up on some Government list, we know \nthat the intelligence feeding into our homeland security programs \nleaves a lot to be desired.\n  That is quite a menu of challenges, and they must all be addressed. \nThere is no ``pick one from column A'' option in heading U.S. \nintelligence.\n  In addition to all that, the Director must be willing and able to \n``speak truth to power.'' He must have the stature and Presidential \ntrust that leads top officials to accept his warnings and advice. And \nhe must be an able defender of the independence of intelligence \nanalysis, while still insuring that it is relevant to the needs and \nconcerns of policy-makers.\n  I will support the confirmation of Mr. Goss in the hope that he will \ntransition successfully from a serious congressman and a leading \npartisan figure to a clear-eyed, independent Director of Central \nIntelligence who is able to rally his troops, to make them as effective \nas possible, and to keep policy-makers from misusing or ignoring the \nwork of the thousands of skilled and patriotic men and women who work \nin U.S. intelligence today. The perilous times in which we live demand \nnothing less than complete dedication to those objectives.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, after much deliberation, I have decided \nto vote against the confirmation of Porter Goss to be Director of \nCentral Intelligence. The conclusions of the 9/11 Commission, as well \nas the failures of our pre-war intelligence on Iraq, have demonstrated \nthe enormous challenges we face in restructuring, reforming and \nimproving our intelligence capabilities. At this critical moment, we \nshould be focusing our efforts on enacting into law the recommendations \nof the commission, including the creation of the position of National \nIntelligence Director. The confirmation of a new Director of Central \nIntelligence, when the role of the DCI has yet to even be defined, does \nnot advance the hard reform work yet to be done. Nor does the \nappointment of Porter Goss, whose objectivity, capacity to work across \nparty lines, and openness to reform are subject to serious question.\n  The National Intelligence Director envisioned by the 9/11 Commission \nwill oversee our intelligence community, including the DCI. It is \ncritical that we clarify, in law, the relationship between these two \npositions. Unfortunately, the administration, by prioritizing the \nnomination of the DCI over the restructuring of our intelligence \ncommunity, seems to be signaling an attachment to the status quo.\n  Congressman Goss's record, in which he has repeatedly rejected \nindependent efforts to improve our intelligence whenever those efforts \nwere perceived to be contrary to the interests of the Bush \nadministration, is also cause for concern. He opposed the establishment \nof the 9/11 Commission, he attacked the integrity of Richard Clarke, \nthe former coordinator for counter-terrorism at the National Security \nCouncil, he opposed an investigation into the disclosure of the \nidentity of a CIA operative, and he referred to the bipartisan Senate \ninvestigation into the abuse of Iraqi detainees as a ``circus.''\n  Congressman Goss has also opposed investigations into intelligence on \nIraq, in particular the use of intelligence by the administration. He \ndismissed Senators who called for an examination of the circumstances \nthat led us to war as ``attack dogs'' and charged that they were \nexpressing ``artificial outrage.'' He has also implied that open \ndiscussions of the challenges facing our intelligence damage the morale \nof our armed forces and aid our enemies. These are not the statements \nof someone who appears prepared to undertake the difficult work of \nreform, without regard to political considerations.\n  This reform will require cooperation between the administration and \nthe Congress and between Republicans and Democrats. Unfortunately, \nCongressman Goss has made repeated, incendiary charges, including \nallegations that the Democratic Party does not support the intelligence \ncommunity and that Senator Kerry seeks to ``dismantle the nation's \nintelligence capabilities.'' These charges are not only flat wrong, \nthey are completely counterproductive to the bipartisan effort that is \nurgently needed at this moment.\n  Repairing our intelligence capabilities is critical to fighting the \nwar on\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\nterrorism and is an urgent priority. We must enact into law the \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission. We must examine the failures of \nour intelligence related to Iraq. We must begin the work of \nrestructuring our intelligence community so that it is more effective \nand less politicized. These challenges require the utmost objectivity, \nindependence, and nonpartisanship from the Director of Central \nIntelligence. Any reluctance on the part of the DCI to fully engage in \nthe reform process, for whatever reason, could set us back at a moment \nwhen we can least afford it.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \nnomination of Representative Porter J. Goss to the Director of Central \nIntelligence. He is a good man and a good friend. President Bush could \nnot have selected a more capable and qualified man for the job. He \nbrings to the Central Intelligence Agency and the intelligence \ncommunity what they have needed for years--intelligence experience, \npolitical experience, an open mind, and forward thinking.\n  I first met Representative Goss shortly after he was elected to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1988. We served together for 10 years \nbefore I was elected to this body. Representative Goss and his wife, \nMariel, are personal friends of my wife and myself to this day. I know \nhis personal character and I am confident he will bring integrity, \nhonesty, and forthrightness to his new job.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence holds one of the most important \nand unforgiving jobs in our Government. All his actions and decisions \nare analyzed and criticized by politicians, the press, and the public. \nAnd the pressures on the intelligence community are immense. They must \nbe right 100 percent of the time, while the terrorists only have to be \nright once. That is a heavy burden for one man to bear, but I believe \nRepresentative Goss is up to the challenge.\n  I cannot think of anyone with more experience for this job. \nRepresentative Goss has extensive experience in intelligence, on both \nthe practical and policy sides. He knows firsthand the importance of \nhuman intelligence, serving as an intelligence officer in the Army and \nas a case officer in the agency he will now lead. At that time the \nUnited States was promoting freedom and fighting the evil of communism. \nThough the evil we now face takes a different form, the value of \ninformation and power of knowledge remain the same.\n  We are in the midst of a review and reform of our intelligence \norganizations, and, going forward, one of the most important jobs for \nthe Director of Central Intelligence will be working with Congress. \nAgain, Representative Goss's experiences will be an asset to the \nintelligence community and the Congress. For the last 8 years he has \nbeen chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. \nIn that position he has worked fairly with both parties and both bodies \nof Congress without compromising his beliefs. I am confident he will \ncontinue to work honestly and fairly with Representatives and Senators \nof both parties in his new job.\n  Representative Goss's practical and political experience will also \npay dividends as the entire intelligence community is reformed in the \ncoming weeks and months. He has proven his openmindedness in constantly \nseeking to improve our intelligence capabilities and structures during \nhis tenure in Congress. He has held dozens of hearings on problems in \nthe intelligence community and how to fix them. He was a member of the \nAspin-Brown Commission, which took a deep look at our intelligence \ncommunity and provided some of the recommendations that we are \ncurrently reviewing. He also cochaired the bicameral investigation on \nintelligence issues surrounding the 9/11 terrorist attacks. His open \nmind and willingness to think critically about the status quo will \nserve us all well.\n  I have seen firsthand his dedication, integrity, and character, and I \nsupport Representative Goss's nomination without reservation. I wish \nhim well in that extremely important job and I look forward to seeing \nhim in briefings and hearings in the coming months.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of Porter \nGoss to be Director of Central Intelligence. I served with Porter Goss \nin the House of Representatives and I respect him. However, I do not \nbelieve he is the best choice for the position in these times.\n  On September 11, 2001, our country suffered a devastating attack. Now \nour country is in the midst of a war on terror and a war in Iraq. There \nhave been many examinations of our intelligence leading up to September \n11, leading up to the war in Iraq, and as we continue to wage the war \non terror. There are many unanswered questions about whether the \nintelligence was accurate, whether it was manipulated, whether our \nsoldiers and leaders can rely on it each and every day as they make \ndifficult decisions.\n  I recognize that members of the President's Cabinet, like the \nSecretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, must weigh political \nconsiderations as they develop policy. However, the Director of Central \nIntelligence is a unique position. It should stand above politics. The \ncitizens of the United States have the right to assume that the \nDirector of Central Intelligence is providing objective information and \nanalysis to allow the President to make the best possible decisions.\n  When Director Tenet resigned, the President had an opportunity to \nappoint a nominee who was nonpartisan, nonpolitical. He did not do so. \nInstead he chose Mr. Goss, who clearly knows the intelligence community \nwell, but is also clearly partisan and political.\n  The CIA is in turmoil. The hardworking men and women of the Agency \nneed a strong leader who will reform the system to make sure that the \ninformation they offer is used in a proper and timely fashion. The \npeople of this country need to know that the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity is doing its best to protect and serve U.S. national \ninterests.\n  I do not believe that Mr. Goss is the best candidate to lead the \nintelligence community through a difficult task of reform and restoring \nconfidence in the midst of a war.\n  It is important that our intelligence not be partisan, yet Mr. Goss \nhas been partisan in his comments over the past year. He has been \nfiercely critical of former President Clinton, our colleague Senator \nKerry, and the Democratic Party. His comments do not lead me to believe \nthat he will now abandon his partisanship or his political approach as \nthe Director of CIA.\n  No greater task lies before us today than to reform the intelligence \ncommunity so that it is effective as the leading weapon in the war on \nterrorism. Mr. Goss certainly knows the CIA and the intelligence \ncommunity, but in these times, experience is simply not enough. A \nleader committed to reform without regard to politics is also critical. \nThose attributes, I fear, Mr. Goss does not have, and therefore I \noppose his nomination.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the swift \nconfirmation of Congressman Porter Goss as Director of Central \nIntelligence. I have been privileged to know Mr. Goss for a number of \nyears, and I can attest that he is a leader, a man of personal \nintelligence and integrity, and a true patriot. He is also extremely \nwell qualified for the position to which he has been nominated.\n  I do not believe I am divulging any state secrets when I mention that \nPorter Goss knows the intelligence community from the ground up--\nbeginning with his service as a young case officer and most recently as \nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee. His 10-year career with \nthe Central Intelligence Agency gave him a thorough understanding of \nhow that large organization operates--invaluable background as the \nCongress and the executive branch proceed with various plans for \nreorganizing the intelligence community. His experience on the CIA \nstaff, combined with his oversight responsibilities in the House, makes \nhim perhaps uniquely qualified to understand the challenges and \nopportunities facing the community today. Congressman Goss has \ndemonstrated time and again his commitment to the needs and goals of \nthe intelligence community in its service to our Nation and the \nAmerican people. He is not merely qualified. He was meant for this \nposition.\n  When he takes up his duties, he will do so at a time of great change \nin the intelligence community. Reeling from the intelligence failures \nof 9/11 and\n\n[[Page S9514]]\n\nIraq, and faced with comprehensive reorganization, the community's \nleadership has rarely been so important. I am confident that Mr. Goss \nwill lead the CIA in an independent and nonpolitical manner as he has \ncommitted to do, ensuring that policymakers receive the best \nintelligence and analysis that our government can provide. I am also \nconfident that he will be helpful as the Congress reorganizes itself in \norder to better conduct oversight over the intelligence community. We \nin the Congress sometimes forget that intelligence failures the Nation \nhas experienced are not limited to the agencies alone. Congressional \noversight has been, as the\n9/11 Commission put it, ``dysfunctional,'' and must be changed.\n  As we face the national security challenges that are so evident to \nall of us, the Nation will be privileged to have Porter Goss at the \nhelm of the CIA. America needs an individual who will help lead our \nintelligence agencies into a new era. I wholeheartedly support his \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nnomination of Porter Goss to be Director of Central Intelligence. Few \npeople are as eminently qualified as he to lead the CIA at this \ncritical time in our Nation's history.\n  Porter Goss combines experience as both a U.S. Army Intelligence and \nCIA officer with 15 years as a Member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. During his time in Congress he has used his knowledge \nand experience to serve as chairman of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. He is a public servant who has earned our \nconfidence and that of the President to lead the dedicated men and \nwomen of the CIA who work tirelessly to preserve our Nation's security.\n  Now at this time when Congress is working hard to reshape our \nintelligence services, I applaud the President for nominating a man \nlike Porter Goss who understands what is working with intelligence and \nthat which needs to be improved. And based on his experience, he will \nundoubtedly be as well prepared as any DCI to communicate with Congress \nconcerning the needs of the CIA, and to understand the oversight \nresponsibilities of the legislative branch as it pertains to the \nintelligence community.\n  The challenges we face in defeating global terrorism remain great. \nPorter Goss understands where we have made mistakes in both \nintelligence operations and assessment. He understands that we need \nimproved human intelligence capabilities, as well as a culture of \ncompetition among intelligence analysts, to ensure that policymakers \nhave objective information and a range of options to choose from in \nmeeting the terrorist challenge. Porter Goss is committed to making \nthese changes on behalf of the American people.\n  In conclusion, I believe the President has chosen the right man to \nlead the CIA in its very important work, and I strongly support the \nnomination of Porter Goss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, we have two speakers. I inform the \ndistinguished leader, the minority whip, a man from Searchlight, that \nwe have two speakers.\n  If I could ask Senator Snowe how much time she would like to have.\n  Ms. SNOWE. About 12 minutes. And I would like to yield 2 minutes to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. All right. So a total of what, 15 or 20 minutes?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am assuming by about 4:45--I am not anticipating any \nfurther speakers on our side. That could change.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend will yield?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. REID. We could not have a vote before 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Right.\n  Mr. REID. We have a couple people off campus doing other things.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Could we agree to have a UC request in regard to a vote \ncertain at 5 o'clock?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would be happy to agree to having a vote \nat 5 o'clock and having the time between now and then evenly divided. I \nfrankly don't think we are going to be using any more time, so if you \nneed more time on your side, you could have part of ours.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 5 \no'clock and that the time between now and then be evenly divided.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have no objection. I think that is an excellent \nsuggestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield whatever time she may consume to \nthe Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas, and I am glad to \nyield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Let me make a couple comments about this man.\n  First of all, before he leaves the Chamber, I want to thank the \nSenator from Florida for his comments and for his efforts in this \nnomination. I also thank the chairman of our select committee in the \nSenate, the Senator from Kansas.\n  Two years after I was elected to the House--I believe it was 2 years \nafterward--Porter Goss was elected to the House from Florida. It took \nus no time at all to figure out this guy was one of the foremost \nauthorities on the intelligence community. He had experience with the \nCIA, with Army Intelligence. We relied on him. I am talking about way \nback 16 years ago.\n  When I went from the House to the Senate in 1994, I took the place of \nSenator David Boren, who is now the president of Oklahoma University. \nHe is a very close friend of mine. He was my predecessor in this Senate \nseat. He was also chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. The thing he warned me of when I first came in was: You \nare going to have to do something about this mess we have in \nintelligence. He said: You have the DIA and the CIA and the FBI and the \nNSA, and nobody is talking to each other.\n  I found out before too long that was the case. He said he had been \nworking on this for about 6 or 7 years and had not been able to achieve \nit. It became a turf battle. On one occasion I found there was a \nlistening device the NSA had that they would not even share with the \nFBI for some of their investigations. This was wrong.\n  We have come a long way since that time. It has been my experience in \nboth Kosovo and Bosnia that you have a lot of these agencies around the \ntable sharing information and working together that did not do so \nbefore. So I believe we have come a long way.\n  One of the reasons I have been resisting a lot of changes within our \nintelligence system is I wanted to wait until Porter Goss came on \nboard. I believe Porter Goss has more knowledge on intelligence than \nanybody else who could have been nominated.\n  I think the President made an excellent nomination. I think we see by \nthis bipartisan support that we are going to be able to overcome the \nobstacles and move ahead aggressively in achieving quality intelligence \nto protect the American people.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine for yielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today regarding the nomination of \nPorter Goss as our next Director of Central Intelligence. I commend the \nPresident for his timely submission of this nomination as Director of \nthe Central Intelligence Agency. Given our war on terror and the \nmissions in Afghanistan and Iraq, now is not the time to leave a vacuum \nin leadership for our Nation's intelligence.\n  On that note, I also commend our chairman, Senator Roberts, for his \nleadership in conducting the hearings and shepherding the entire \nprocess so we can complete this confirmation and ensure our \nintelligence apparatus has the direction it deserves and the leadership \nit must have in order to move forward.\n  As we all know, this nomination arrived during a time in which we are \ncompelled to undertake the most profound, sweeping reform of our entire \nintelligence community in nearly 60 years, 3 years after the worst \nattack ever on American soil. Indeed, there is no longer a question \nwhether we are at the threshold of the single most comprehensive and \ncritical restructuring of\n\n[[Page S9515]]\n\nthe manner in which intelligence is gathered, analyzed, and \ndisseminated in at least a generation. The questions are: What shape \nwill this reform take? How will the leadership of the intelligence \ncommunity implement and execute these changes? And how will the \nnominee, Porter Goss, synthesize and translate his knowledge and depth \nof experience into specific, tangible changes in how the intelligence \ncommunity performs? Because the person who is asked to implement this \ntype of reform must be firm, bold, visionary, and lay the foundation \nfor our intelligence community for the 21st century.\n  Many of us who serve on the Intelligence Committee--indeed, \nthroughout the Senate--have been advocating for comprehensive \nimprovements in the intelligence community structures and methods. \nShortly, the Senate will have the opportunity to deliberate with \nrespect to overall and fundamental reform. It is absolutely the type of \nchange and reform not only this Senate, this Congress, and the \nPresident must embrace; this permanent reform is essential to address \nthe grave failures in communication, coordination, and cooperation that \ncertainly the 9/11 Joint Inquiry, the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nthe 9/11 Commission, and others have found with respect to the attacks \non September 11, 2001, as well as the pre-Iraq-war assessment of \nweapons of mass destruction that failed to reconcile with the realities \nin the postwar chapter. Indeed, with the new reality in which we live, \ndelaying reforming the intelligence community is no longer an option.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, this last year we \nhave undertaken a major review of the prewar intelligence of Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction, the regime's ties to terrorism, Saddam \nHussein's human rights abuses, and his regime's impact on regional \nstability. That report was a detailed, comprehensive cataloguing not \nonly of the facts but also a stunning revelation of systemic, pervasive \nflaws in our intelligence community that coalesced to produce broad \nfailures in intelligence gathering and analysis. It revealed a \npervasive complacency as well as a lack of accountability throughout \nthe chain of command that allowed outdated assumptions about \nintelligence to be carried forward for years unquestioned and that \ntolerated an absence of rigorous analysis and a kind of monolithic \ngrouping.\n\n  From that report, we now know that even after the lack of information \nsharing was found to have played a key role in the intelligence \nfailures of 9/11, intelligence reporting continues to be highly \ncompartmentalized, and analysts with a need to know are not given \naccess to information. Essentially, the intelligence community \ncontinues to operate in a ``stovepiped'' manner, preventing critical \ninformation sharing essential for sound analysis. There was a lack of \nanalytic rigor on one of the most critical and defining issues spanning \nmore than a decade: the question of the preponderance of weapons of \nmass destruction within Iraq. The community had failed to do its \nanalysis for more than a decade, we soon discovered.\n  Moreover, there was a lack of human intelligence that is so critical \nto assessing the enemy's capabilities and intentions. They were forced \nto rely on outdated, vague intelligence from less than credible \nsources.\n  I say all of this because that is the reality that our next Director \nof Central Intelligence must not only confront, but he also must \naddress. It is in that light that our committee, during the \nconfirmation process, reviewed the qualifications, the credentials, and \nthe qualities that Porter Goss possesses in order to address some of \nthe most systemic and profound changes this intelligence community is \ngoing to face since its inception in 1947.\n  I have come to believe that Porter Goss, in examining his record, his \ntestimony before the committee, his responses to the committee, has the \nexperience, the character, the credibility, the knowledge, the \ndisposition, and the predilection for reform to lead this comprehensive \noverhaul and restructuring of our entire intelligence community.\n  Let me first say that I worked with Congressman Goss in the House of \nRepresentatives for 6 years. I have no doubt about his competence, \ncertainly his intelligence, his character, his unimpeachable integrity, \nor his bipartisanship. He was far from a polarizing or partisan force \nin the House of Representatives. Rather, what I discovered in working \nwith him in the House, he was interested in solving problems rather \nthan creating political points or sound bites. He was interested in \nreaching a consensus on the issues.\n  I know there had been some questions during the course of the hearing \nas to whether Porter Goss would be able to be sufficiently independent \nminded in a position where he will be the President's chief adviser on \nintelligence issues. Certainly this was an issue that was thoroughly \nexplored in the confirmation hearings just concluded. At the opening of \nthat hearing, Congressman Goss addressed the issue directly when he \ntold the committee:\n\n     . . . I understand completely the difference in obligations \n     the position of [director of Central Intelligence agency] \n     carries with it and that which the role of a Congressman \n     carries. These are two completely distinct jobs in our form \n     of government. I understand these distinctions and if \n     confirmed commit myself to a nonpartisan approach to the job \n     of [director of Central Intelligence agency].\n\n  That is important to underscore.\n  Moreover, in response to questions about some specific political \nstatements that Porter Goss had mentioned a few months ago on the floor \nof the House of Representatives, he expressed regret and apologized if \nhe sounded any partisan notes in the past on any issues or matters of \nnational security.\n\n  I know others have raised the question of whether Porter Goss will be \nwilling to inform administration officials if or when public statements \ndeviate from or distort available intelligence. In responding to this \nquestion, I would refer directly to the House Intelligence Committee's \n2003 interim assessment of the pre-Iraq-war intelligence when then-\nChairman Goss stated that if public officials cite intelligence \nincorrectly, the intelligence community has a responsibility to address \nthat policymaker on any mischaracterization of available intelligence. \nI expect that not only would Porter Goss be held to that assessment as \nDCI but that he would hold himself to that assessment.\n  We must also recognize the unique qualifications that Porter Goss \nbrings to the position. As I mentioned earlier, he is a product of \nservice in the intelligence community, while he also later served as \nchairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He can view the \nintelligence community through the eyes of a former CIA officer and \nintelligence officer and also as someone who has stood outside of that \nworld looking in with his oversight of the intelligence apparatus as \nchair of the House Intelligence Committee.\n  I know there has been some concern expressed that maybe Porter Goss \nwill be too wedded to the CIA or that he is too CIA-centric and, \ntherefore, would not have the independent vision necessary to institute \nthe required changes and the reforms that surely are to come. I would \nargue that it is precisely because of his past work within the \ncommunity that he is best suited to take it into the future, all the \nmore so as his service imbues him with an indispensable credibility \nthat would engender the kind of trust within a community where some \ncontinue to believe that necessary changes have already been made, that \nwe should not identify the failures that we did in our comprehensive \nreport within the intelligence community in the prewar assessments as \negregious or systemic or broad or comprehensive failures. That is the \nkind of atmosphere that he will be entering as the new Director of the \nCentral Intelligence Agency and trying to bring about the kind of \nreform that is absolutely vital.\n  His own record of reform initiatives is also important to explore \nbecause it also will belie the claim that somehow he will not be \npredisposed or have a predilection for the type of reform we certainly \nare going to be considering, hopefully next week, and enacting in \nCongress, and also the reform that has also been brought about as a \nresult of the President's Executive orders.\n  Still others have questioned whether Porter Goss could have done more \nto institute intelligence reform prior to the attacks of 9/11. Again, I \nthink as we review the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, we can see \nmuch could\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\nhave been done in all spheres. Whether it was on the part of former \nPresidents, on the part of Congress, committees, individuals, agencies, \nand bureaucracies, we know that the history documented in the 9/11 \nreport was replete with examples of what could have been and should \nhave been done differently.\n  What is required now is that we look at the totality of the record of \nthe nominee we are considering today. In so doing, I believe we will \nsee an individual who is wholly committed to providing the impetus and \nthe leadership required to institute critical reform. Indeed, who \nbetter than someone who has not only been a member of the intelligence \nworld but also one who has investigated that world to understand why \nchange is necessary.\n  The most glaring of problems--those we identified in the Senate \nIntelligence Committee report, such as the poor state of human \nintelligence, operations, intelligence collection in general, analysis, \nand the pervasive problems with information sharing--these have all \nbeen issues that Porter Goss has been committed to addressing \nthroughout his tenure as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. \nIndeed, Mr. Goss has held over 62 hearings on intelligence community \nreform just this year. So I do believe that he shows a predisposition \nand indeed a drive for reform.\n  I think we also see that commitment reflected in Mr. Goss's \ncontributions as a member of the Aspin-Brown commission, which was \nformed to assess the future direction, priorities, and structure of the \nintelligence community in the post-Cold-War world. This commission made \na number of recommendations including looking at how to streamline the \nDCI's responsibilities and provide him with additional flexibility in \nmanaging the community.\n  He provided insights and leadership in the ``Joint Inquiry Into \nIntelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist \nAttacks of September 11, 2001''--a report that contained 19 \nrecommendations, including the creation of a director of national \nintelligence among the many changes that we have now been debating in \nCongress.\n  So all of this undoubtedly served as a catalyst for Congressman Goss \nauthoring his own reform legislation, which he introduced this past \nJune, that calls for significant reform of the intelligence community's \nstructure, as well as enhanced DCI, with critically needed personnel \nand budgetary authority--going beyond even what the President issued in \nhis own Executive orders.\n  But I think Porter Goss also understands, in response to many of the \nquestions that were raised during the course of the confirmation \nhearing, that a director of national intelligence will need to possess \nboth the budgetary and personnel authorities that will be vital to a \nnewly created director of national intelligence in order for that \nindividual to be effective in implementing the kinds of changes that \nneed to be brought about within the overall intelligence community.\n  Finally, there is further evidence of the extent to which Porter Goss \nis compelled to remedy our intelligence shortcomings. He has \nrecognized--after his committee's investigation into the failures that \noccurred prior to the Iraq war--that the intelligence community has \nrepeatedly fallen short in the area of information collection, most \nnotably in the area of human intelligence.\n\n  For those who are not convinced he understands what is required to be \ndone--particularly in this regard--as Porter Goss himself has said, the \nCIA's human spy operation was headed ``over a proverbial cliff'' and in \ndanger of becoming only a fleeting memory of ``the nimble, flexible, \ncore, mission-oriented enterprise'' it once was. Sounds like a person \nwho is convinced of the need for change.\n  He has also stated that the intelligence community failed to provide \nthe best possible intelligence to policymakers, and that the requisite, \nboth from a collection and analytical viewpoint, was not provided.\n  I believe Porter Goss embodies the credibility and credentials that \nwill be required to lead the intelligence community agencies and the \nprofessionals within that community in implementing the types of \nreforms from within--by Executive order or through congressional \nenactment. He brings unique and exceptional experience both in the \nfield and behind the gavel. I believe he is well prepared to see our \nintelligence apparatus as it undergoes the major transformation \nnecessary for a new era.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, a vital member \nof the Intelligence Committee, be recognized for 5 minutes. Senator \nWarner is a previous member of the Intelligence Committee, now again on \nthe Intelligence Committee, and he is chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. He has a unique perspective to offer my colleagues. Is 5 \nminutes appropriate?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee. I hope the Senate appreciates \nthe thoroughness with which Chairman Roberts has gone into this \nnomination. He has provided the members of the committee and many \nothers with an opportunity to express their views with regard to the \nnomination. An extensive series of hearings have been held--more than \nhave been held on a nominee in a long time. Maybe only Supreme Court \nJustices occasionally see the volume and thoroughness with which this \nnomination has been carefully viewed by the Senate. I compliment the \nchairman, and indeed the ranking member who participated very actively \nin this, as well as the members of the committee.\n  I first came to know the nominee about a decade ago. I remember one \nof our most revered, distinguished contemporary colleagues, Senator \nMoynihan, who sat right back there. I was on the floor and he stood and \nsaid it was time to abolish the CIA. He had a lot of concerns about the \nAgency. At that time, I was the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee. Together, with Porter Goss and some others, we put together \na piece of legislation establishing a commission to examine some of the \nconcerns of our distinguished late colleague from New York. Porter Goss \nand I served on that commission. Les Aspin was the first chairman. He \nhad an untimely early death and he was followed by Harold Brown. That \nwas my initiation to work with this fine, able individual.\n\n  I commend the President for selecting him to take on this important \nassignment. I thank Representative Goss, his wife, and family for \nundertaking another chapter of public life.\n  All of his credentials have been carefully reviewed. I would like to \ntalk about somewhat of a different aspect of the challenges that will \nface Porter Goss. We just concluded a very extensive briefing upstairs \nwith the Secretary of Defense, Ambassador Negroponte, the commander of \nCENTCOM, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Deputy Secretary of \nState, almost three-quarters of the Senate being present. The briefing \nwas about the situations primarily in the Iraq and Afghanistan theater, \nbut it was about terrorism on the whole.\n  As part of our discussion, we talked about the ongoing work in the \nCongress of the United States with regard to the 9/11 report, which all \nof us believe is a very significant contribution by a conscientious \ngroup of tried, tested, and able public servants. But we worked through \nthese equations and options. The Governmental Affairs Committee is \ndoing the markup of what will be the primary vehicle. Senator Roberts \ncontributed his views on it.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee had a hearing with the Secretary \nof Defense, as well as the Acting Director of the CIA. So the Senate \nhas done a lot of work in preparation.\n  How does that relate to Porter Goss? I cannot predict, and I don't \nthink anyone can, at this time what will eventually evolve with regard \nto the legislative achievements of this body and the House in a \nconference. Perhaps a lot of people have high expectations that a bill \nwill be before our President shortly.\n  I intend to work conscientiously, as I have, and will continue to \nwork, forgetting any question of turf, to try to achieve a strong bill \nthat clearly improves and strengthens our intelligence system.\n  I brought in a reference to the briefing today because in some \ndiscussion\n\n[[Page S9517]]\n\nwith our colleagues--and it was a classified briefing, but I can share \nthis--General Abizaid said he is acting on intelligence daily to \nconduct his mission. Lives are at risk, and he clearly, drawing on his \nextensive experience in the Army said: Today the intelligence \ncollection that my soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines need and have \nand use is vastly improved over what we had in gulf war 1 in 1991.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor another 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there has been steady progress in the \nimprovements in our intelligence system. The Department of Defense is \nthe largest user, and these senior people in the Department of \nDefense--civilian and military alike--have not tried to tell the \nCongress what to do but respectfully told us what not to do: Don't do \nanything to weaken the improvements that we have achieved--I say we, \nworking with the Congress and the President--we have achieved to date \nsince 1991 in the first gulf war and, indeed, since 9/11 with President \nBush and Executive orders, a wide range of implementation of important \nthings that have been done to improve our intelligence system, \nparticularly from the standpoint of the tactical use by the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  If confirmed and if we pass a new law signed by the President, Porter \nGoss will be the man entrusted to implement that law. And I say to my \ncolleagues with the deepest respect, that is a daunting task--to do it \nin a way not to shake the confidence of the tens upon thousands of \nconscientious employees in the various departments and agencies, the \nCIA, the Department of Defense who are concerned about their jobs, \nconcerned about their futures. We need to hold the team in place. We \nneed to keep what is working now going as we phase in such new laws and \nprovisions as this body, working with the House and signed by the \nPresident, may enact.\n  I do not know of another individual who has the experience of Porter \nGoss or is better qualified to take on the task of implementing such \nnew laws as the Congress and the President may enact.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this very fine, outstanding American \nwho, once again, was thinking about a quieter form of life the \nopportunity to move into this job.\n  There was printed in the Record a report that was issued by the CSIS, \nprepared by a number of former colleagues and others in the \nintelligence community trying to say to the Congress we best move with \nconsiderable caution as we enact this new legislation. I found this \nvery helpful in my work participating in drawing up this bill, and I \ncommend it to my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, again I thank the distinguished chairman and the \ndistinguished vice chairman of the committee for their work in making \nit possible for this nomination to have been carefully reviewed by the \nSenate in terms of a series of hearings and a very active and thorough \ndebate on the Senate floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, with this debate and the vote certain at \n5 o'clock, I think there has been an extraordinary level of examination \nof this nomination. Two days of open hearings were held. By way of \ncomparison, that is one day more than Secretary of State Powell had \nduring his confirmation in early 2001.\n  It is certainly understandable that an official of the DCI stature \nwould be the subject of close Senate scrutiny. I think we have achieved \nthat level of scrutiny, and members of the Intelligence Committee on \nboth sides have expressed satisfaction with the way this process has \nunfolded. It was not by accident. It was in close conference and \ncooperation with the distinguished vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I think Mr. Goss has been forthcoming. I think he has been candid \nwith the committee. He provided literally dozens of written answers to \nquestions sent to him by the committee, both before and after his \nconfirmation hearings. He also provided complete and exhaustive details \nabout his background and his professional life in connection with his \nnomination.\n  In short, I believe the examination of this nomination has been \nthorough and informative. The nominee and Members on both sides should \nbe complimented for the way it has unfolded.\n  Expressions of support for his nomination have come from both sides \nof the aisle and both sides of Capitol Hill. This nominee is ready to \ngo to work, and he is needed.\n  I urge the Senate to vote for his confirmation, and I look forward to \nworking with Porter Goss as the next and, by the way, possibly last \nDCI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, at the proper time, which I believe \nwill be at 5 o'clock, I will call for the yeas and nays, or can I do \nthat now before I make a statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator can do it any time he chooses.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I wish to make a short statement, and then I will \ncall for the yeas and nays.\n  Porter Goss has been very well vetted. What has come from this \ndiscussion back and forth are several things.\n  One, he is a very good man. Second, he knows the intelligence \nbusiness. Third, I think there is still a question of whether he has \nrun any larger organizations, and that becomes a factor. The third had \nto do with partisanship. It was interesting to me that a number of \npeople said everybody around here is partisan. Of course, that is true. \nBut this has to do with a nomination for the Central Intelligence \nAgency. That is a position where the national security law forbades a \nnominee from being political in any way, shape, or form.\n  I think the question really is with him. I want to believe it is \ntrue, but based upon the record, I cannot accept it as true to this \npoint, and I have to look at what has happened as opposed to what he \nsays will happen; that he has been very partisan and very partisan \nwithin the field of intelligence and very partisan within the field of \nintelligence very recently at a time, obviously, when we are engaged in \na broad election.\n  I think it is probable that he will be confirmed, but that does not \ntake away from my responsibility to point out what I think is critical: \nThat now, more than ever, it is important for a CIA Director or for \nanybody in intelligence to tell the truth, to make sure that if there \nwas a reference in a Cincinnati October 2 speech about Niger and \nuranium enrichment and the possible seeking of it by Iraq, and then \nwhen it comes to the State of the Union that somehow that the CIA \nDirector disappeared and never said, Oh, no, that shouldn't be in the \nState of the Union because it was never true--I don't want to get into \nthat now. The point is we need somebody who is independent and takes \npride, who describes himself, defines himself as being independent and \nstanding up for the intelligence business and, therefore, is speaking \nthe truth. I hope that person will be Porter Goss. That is not yet \nproven, and based upon the record it is not possible for me to vote \nanything but no at this time.\n\n  It being very close to 5, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Porter J. Goss, of Florida, to be Director of Central Intelligence? \nOn this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  On November 20, 2000, in Savannah, GA, the body of Billy Jean \nLevette, a transgender individual, was found in a secluded area. His \nbody was face up with a wound to the back of the head, his pants pulled \nhalfway down and his shirt pulled up. Levette was the second \ntransgender individual killed in the Savannah area in a year.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9518-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECURITY FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nS. 2742, which is a short but important piece of legislation that \nSenator hatch and I have cosponsored at the request of the Supreme \nCourt. This legislation would renew authority to provide security for \nthe Justices when they leave the Supreme Court. Recent reports of the \nassault of Justice Souter when he was outside of the Supreme Court \nhighlight the importance of security for Justices. If no congressional \naction is taken, the authority of Supreme Court police to protect \nJustices off court grounds will expire at the end of this year.\n  Another provision in this legislation allows the Supreme Court to \naccept gifts ``pertaining to the history of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States or its justices.'' The administrative office of the \nCourts currently has statutory authority to accept gifts on behalf of \nthe judiciary. This provision would grant the Supreme Court authority \nto accept gifts but it would narrow the types of gifts that can be \nreceived to historical items. I think this provision strikes the proper \nbalance.\n  Finally, this legislation also would provide an additional venue for \nthe prosecution of offenses that occur on the Supreme Court grounds. \nCurrently, the DC Superior Court is the only place of proper venue \ndespite the uniquely Federal interest at stake. This legislation would \nallow suit to be brought in United States District Court in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9518-5", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ROTTERDAM CONVENTION ON PRIOR INFORMED CONSENT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this week, seventy-four nations are \nmeeting in Geneva at the first Conference of the Parties to the \nRotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent (PIC) for Certain \nHazardous Chemicals and Pesticides. This important international \nagreement establishes a legally binding framework that requires \nexporters of listed substances to secure informed consent from \ngovernments of importing countries prior to any shipment of such \nchemicals. Simply put, the convention recognizes and incorporates the \nbasic principle of right-to-know with respect to trade in hazardous \nchemicals. As such, it marks yet another positive step in the direction \nof a comprehensive international approach to chemicals management.\n  Unfortunately, the United States is not yet a party to the \nconvention, and thus will not be at the table this week when important \ndecisions are made regarding organization, scope, and future direction. \nEarlier this week, for example, the parties agreed to add fourteen new \nchemicals to the convention's list of substances requiring informed \nconsent. Because we are not a party, the United States did not \nparticipate in that decision.\n  Lest one think this is an exceptional case, the Rotterdam Convention \nis one of three important international agreements on chemicals that \nthe United States has signed, but so far failed to ratify. The two \nother agreements--the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic \nPollutants (POPs) and the POPs Protocol to the Convention on Long Range \nTransboundary Air Pollution--ban or severely restrict the production \nand use of some of the most hazardous chemicals in existence. Both \nagreements have entered into force, and preparations are being made for \nthe first meetings of the parties. Yet, the United States is not on \nboard.\n  Although our Government played a leading role in negotiating all of \nthese agreements and despite the fact that the United States is a \nsignatory to each, the current administration along with the leadership \nin Congress has so far failed to move the necessary implementing \nlegislation that would allow the United States to become a party. Such \nlegislation involves the work of four different committees in the \nCongress. To date, however, only the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee has reported a bill, which I co-sponsored with Senator \nChafee. This bill provides a reasonable and effective approach to \nmeeting our current obligations under all three of these agreements, \nwhile also providing a robust mechanism for accommodating future \ndecisions of the parties. I would urge my colleagues to follow our lead \nand swiftly enact sensible implementing legislation. The United States \ncannot afford to sit on the sidelines any longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9518-6", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9518-S9519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LANHAM ACT CLARIFICATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record some additional information about the genesis and intent of \na bill introduced last week, strengthening and clarifying a provision \nof the Lanham Act. Specifically, S. 2796 was introduced to clarify that \nservice marks, collective marks, and certification marks are entitled \nto the same protections, rights, privileges of trademarks.\n  It is my hope that the Congress will act on this measure in short \norder, and I offer this information to assist my colleagues in \nevaluating the bill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Amendments to Lanham Act\n\n                        [Indicated by Brackets]\n\n     Sec. 3 [15 U.S.C. 1053]. Service marks registrable\n       Subject to the provisions relating to the registration of \n     trademarks, so far as they are\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\n     applicable, service marks shall be registrable, in the same \n     manner and with the same effect as are trademarks, and when \n     registered they shall be entitled to the protection[s, rights \n     and privileges] provided in this chapter in the case of \n     trademarks. Applications and procedure under this section \n     shall conform as nearly as practicable to those prescribed \n     for the registration of trademarks.\n     Sec. 4 [15 U.S.C. 1054]. Collective marks and certification \n         marks registrable\n       Subject to the provisions relating to the registration of \n     trademarks, so far as they are applicable, collective and \n     certification marks, including indications of regional \n     origin, shall be registrable under this chapter, in the same \n     manner and with the same effect as are trademarks, by \n     persons, and nations. States, municipalities, and the like, \n     exercising legitimate control over the use of the marks \n     sought to be registered, even though not possessing an \n     industrial or commercial establishment, and when registered \n     they shall be entitled to the protection[s, rights and \n     privileges] provided in this chapter in the case of \n     trademarks, except in the case of certification marks when \n     used so as to represent falsely that the owner or a user \n     thereof makes or sells the goods or performs the services on \n     or in connection with which such mark is used. Applications \n     and procedure under this section shall conform as nearly as \n     practicable to those prescribed for the registration of \n     trademarks.\n\n\n                      background and justification\n\n       Section 4 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1054, states \n     that certification marks and collective marks ``shall be \n     entitled to the protection provided'' to trademarks. This \n     section expresses the congressional intention that all \n     certification marks and collective marks be treated with \n     equivalent rights and protections to trademarks, except where \n     Congress, by statute, has expressly provided otherwise.\n       It is common in trademark, service mark, collective mark \n     and certification mark licenses to include provisions under \n     which licensees acknowledge the validity of an agree not to \n     challenge the marks. These ``no challenge'' provisions play \n     an important role in protecting the marks, reducing mark \n     owners' litigation costs, and providing assurances to \n     licensees that the marks they are investing in will have \n     continued validity. After applying principles of equity, many \n     courts have upheld such ``no challenge'' provisions in \n     trademark licenses and dismissed validity challenges.\n       Recently, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in the case \n     of Idaho Potato Commission v. M & M Produce Farm and Sales, \n     335 F.3d 130 (2d Cir. 2003), interpreted the Lanham Act as \n     requiring that certification marks be treated differently \n     from trademarks with respect to ``no challenge'' provisions. \n     The court reasoned that the public policy underlying \n     certification marks was more analogous to the public policy \n     underlying patents. As a result, the court ruled that \n     licensee certification mark no challenge provisions are \n     governed by the Supreme Court's decision in Lear, Inc v. \n     Adkins, 395 U.S. 653 (1969). The Second Circuit's decision \n     appears to have gone beyond congressional intent relating to \n     certification marks. Certification marks have none of the \n     preclusive effects of patents. Rather, the competitive \n     effects of certification marks are the same as trademarks. \n     Certification marks guard the public from deception and \n     protect mark owners' and their licensees' investments. Like \n     trademarks, certification marks provide information vital to \n     consumers' purchasing decisions. Certification marks help \n     consumers identify goods and services that have the quality \n     and safety features they want.\n       It is important to remove any perceived distinction between \n     certification marks and collective marks as compared to \n     trademarks, except as expressly provided otherwise by \n     statute. Therefore, this bill clarifies Congress, original \n     intentions regarding the treatment of certification marks and \n     collective marks through this amendment to Section 4 of the \n     Act. Licenses governing certification marks, and the \n     provisions contained in such licenses, should be treated no \n     less favorably than licenses for trademarks and other marks. \n     ``No challenge'' provisions, and other non-quality related \n     provisions in certification mark licenses or agreements are \n     to be accorded the same respect and treatment, and are to be \n     the subject to the same principles of equity, as like \n     provisions in trademark licenses and agreements. While \n     nothing in this revision to the Lanham Act should be read as \n     impairing a court's ability to apply existing principles of \n     equity, where their application is appropriate, such \n     licensing provisions are essential to preserving the public \n     benefits of such marks without increasing the litigation and \n     other transactional costs for certification mark owners. \n     Similarly, certification and collective mark owners have the \n     same remedies for infringement of their marks that are \n     available to trademark owners.\n       Section 3 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1053, is \n     amended in the same manner as Section 4 to maintain the \n     parallel language of the two sections and to evidence \n     congressional intent that all four marks protected by the \n     Lanham Act are to be accorded the same rights and protections \n     except as specifically provided by statute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9519-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING WORLD WAR II VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, throughout my service to the State of \nIndiana, I have been honored to represent thousands of Hoosier veterans \nwho have fought bravely for our country. It is with great honor that I \nrecognize the sacrifices of these three courageous men, Private First \nClass Leo Wilson Landess, Private First Class Robert Eugene Osborn, and \nPrivate First Class John Lee Reynolds, who were called to service in \nWorld War II to safeguard American freedom. These valiant young men \ndefended our Nation and our liberty in the face of evil, before they \nhad a chance to receive a high school diploma. It was more than 60 \nyears ago that these three men left Governor I.P. Gray High School and \nwere inducted into the Army. I applaud the Jay County High School \nCorporation for honoring these three World War II veterans, on June 12, \n2004.\n  Their effort and unwavering commitment along with 120,000 other \nHoosier World War II veterans, played a vital role in the long and \ndifficult process of helping others enjoy freedom and democracy. By the \nend of the war, almost 13,000 Hoosier soldiers lost their lives. I am \nreminded by a quote by Douglas MacArthur, ``The soldier, above all \nother people, prays for peace, for he must suffer and bear the deepest \nwounds and scars of war.'' I would like to express my deep appreciation \nfor their dedicated service and the many sacrifices they made on behalf \nof our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9519-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MISSOURI RIVER DROUGHT CONSERVATION PLAN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, last Tuesday, September 14, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee reported out the Fiscal Year 2005 Interior \nAppropriations bill on a unanimous and bipartisan vote. The bill funds \nseveral of the Federal agencies that are responsible for managing \nmillions of acres of land in South Dakota, including the U.S. Forest \nService, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service. \nIncluded in that bill was a provision directing the Corps of Engineers \nto immediately implement the drought conservation measures outlined in \nthe 2004 Missouri River Master Water Control Manual. This is an \nimportant provision that will better balance the competing uses of \nMissouri River water and, more importantly, bring a sense of equity and \nfair play to a process long-slanted toward a single group of navigation \ninterests.\n  Perhaps no Federal agency has a more direct impact on South Dakotans \nthan the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps of Engineers has a \ntough job in South Dakota, balancing a host of competing and, it \nappears from time to time, mutually exclusive interests. However, on \nthe key issue of managing the Missouri, the Corps has consistently come \nup short as a steward of America's longest river. With a current water \nstorage rate of 35.9 million acre-feet, the main-stem Missouri River \nreservoirs are at the lowest level in history. The provision included \nin the Interior Appropriations bill faces up to this reality by taking \na strong step toward conserving our water resources.\n  Unfortunately, yesterday, in an unprecedented maneuver to strike out \nand cancel the express will of the Appropriations Committee, a \nprovision was inserted in the fiscal year 2005 Veterans, Housing and \nUrban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill that \ncancels out the drought conservation plan. The proponents of this new \nprovision had already been rebuffed last week when attempting to change \nthe original section. Surely we can find some common ground for the \nupstream states struggling with the lack of water flow. I expect an \nuphill battle, but I will do everything I can to fight for the needs of \nupstream states.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9519-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9519-S9520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JUMPSTART OUR BUSINESS STRENGTH ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President. I rise to speak about an important piece of \nlegislation that is pending before Congress. The Jumpstart Our Business \nStrength, JOBS, Act, also known as FSC/ETI. This bill was passed by \nboth the House and the Senate earlier this year and now awaits the \nappointment of conferees by the House of Representatives. As a Senate \nconferee, I am hopeful that we can move quickly toward a conference \nwith the House and\n\n[[Page S9520]]\n\ncomplete action on FSC before the 108th Congress adjourns.\n  This bill has aptly been named the JOBS Act because of the direct \nimpact it will have on businesses and employment in the United States. \nI believe this bill can strengthen the U.S. shipping industry. Over the \npast year I have worked closely with my colleagues, Senators Trent \nLott, John Breaux and others, to provide critical tax reform for the \nU.S. maritime industry. I intend to work in conference to provide \nnecessary relief to the maritime industry in Oregon and elsewhere \nthroughout our country.\n  It is clear to me that the ability of the American shipowner to \noperate ships on a comparable economic basis as foreign competitors is \nvital to the competitiveness of the U.S.-flag industry. Yet United \nStates shipping companies are subject to significantly higher taxes \nthan their foreign-based competition, particularly those that operate \nforeign vessels under what are commonly known as ``flag-of-\nconvenience'' countries. Thus, American shipowners are increasingly \nunable to compete with their foreign-flag counterparts in the foreign \ntrade of the United States.\n  Recently, many of the industrialized trading partners of the U.S., \nincluding the United Kingdom, Norway and Germany, have developed \ntonnage-based corporation tax regimes, known as ``tonnage tax'' \nregimes, to enable their fleets to compete fairly on the international \nstage. In a similar manner, our proposed tonnage tax provisions would \nauthorize an alternative U.S. tax regime based upon the tonnage of a \ntaxpayer's U.S.-flag fleet. That alternative regime would create a \npositive economic environment for U.S.-flag international shipping \noperations in line with that of other major U.S. trading partners.\n  This legislative provision is urgently needed to preserve U.S.-flag \nshipping and related employment opportunities for U.S. merchant \nmariners. At this time, there are only 89 U.S.-flag vessels engaged in \nthe foreign trade that are operated by U.S. companies to which the \ntonnage tax regime would apply. Implementation of the tonnage tax \nregime is required now to prevent further reductions in an already \ndecimated U.S.-flag commercial fleet and depleted U.S. mariner pool.\n  It is also important to the U.S. maritime industry that we enact an \nadditional reform measure to defer U.S. tax on the foreign shipping \nincome of a controlled foreign corporation, CFC--but only if that CFC \nis affiliated with a U.S. company that maintains a qualified fleet of \nat least two U.S.-flag commercial vessels. Generally, the U.S. does not \ntax foreign-source income earned by a CFC until that income is \nrepatriated as a dividend to the U.S. shareholders of the CFC. However, \na CFC's foreign shipping income is taxed to its U.S. shareholders in \nthe year earned without regard to whether it is then, or ever, \ndistributed to those shareholders.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate and House colleagues towards \nenactment of the FSC/ETI tax legislation and to ensure that these \ncritical maritime provisions are included in the final version of the \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9520-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ROBERTO CLEMENTE DAY\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I rise to speak about a topic that \nholds a special place in my life and the communities of Pennsylvania--\nbaseball. Like our Nation's democracy, baseball is a part of our \ncountry's collective definition of community, history, and heroism.\n  The Pittsburgh Pirates and Philadelphia Phillies are recognized by \nfans for their hometown affiliation but more for their heroes. In \nPennsylvania, we have plenty of players to boast about, but one in \nparticular comes to mind, Roberto Clemente. Clemente is Pittsburgh's \nmost reversed hero. He was the first Latin-American to be inducted into \nthe Hall of Fame and the first player for whom the Hall's required 5-\nyear waiting period was waived. In honor of the humanitarian work in \nwhich he was so involved, the Roberto Clemente Foundation now serves \nPittsburgh's inner-city through programs to instill responsible \ncommunity behavior in disadvantaged youth, and to provide them with \norganized recreation. Clemente's example is an amazing illustration of \nhow powerful professional sports heroes can be as role models.\n  Roberto Clemente Day was established in 2002 to increase awareness of \nthe Roberto Clemente Award and the amount of time and effort its \nrecipients dedicate towards community and charitable endeavors. Since \n1971, Major League Baseball has annually presented an award that \nrecognizes a player who best exemplifies the game of baseball through \nsportsmanship, community involvement, and positive contributions to his \nteam. The award was named in honor of Clemente in 1973. The national \nrecipient of the 2004 Roberto Clemente Award will be announced during \nthe 2004 World Series. This year, September 22 has been designated as \n2004 Roberto Clemente Day.\n  PNC Park in Pittsburgh will be among the many ballparks around the \ncountry that will hold a ceremony commemorating Roberto Clemente Day. \nAs residents of Pittsburgh cross the Roberto Clemente Bridge, which \nspans the Allegheny River, may they remember the example that Roberto \nClemente set for us all.\n  Roberto Clemente Walker was born in Barrio San Anton in Carolina, \nPuerto Rico, August 18, 1934. Roberto always excelled at track and \nfield; however, his real love was baseball.\n  Clemente joined the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1955, where he played his \nentire 18-year Major League Baseball career from 1955 to 1972. Clemente \nis considered one of the finest outfielders to ever play professional \nbaseball, amassing over 3,000 hits, 12 Golden Glove Awards, a league \nMVP Award, and leading the Pittsburgh Pirates to World Series victories \nin 1960 and 1971.\n  Clemente was also a devoted father. With his wife Vera Cristina, he \nraised three sons: Roberto Jr., Luis Roberto, and Roberto Enrique. \nProud of his heritage Roberto insisted that Vera give birth to all \nthree sons in Puerto Rico.\n  I will always remember feeling deeply saddened upon hearing the news, \non December 31, 1972, that Clemente had died in a tragic plane crash \noff the coast of Puerto Rico. The plane was taking medical, food, and \nclothing supplies to earthquake stricken Nicaragua. Clemente will \nalways be remembered as one of the greatest humanitarians of all time.\n  Aside from playing baseball myself over the years, the culture of \nidentifying with star baseball players and my hometown team is an \ninextricable part of my boyhood. As a young boy playing and watching \nbaseball, I learned the value of hard work, the importance of teamwork, \nhow to deal with success and failure, how to concentrate and stay \nfocused on a goal, and how to look beyond personal achievement to \nsomething bigger than oneself. Roberto Clemente embodied all of these \nvirtues.\n  As our Nation recognizes Hispanic Heritage Month during the month of \nSeptember, this is an ideal time to honor this exceptional person and \npersonal hero and his legacy that lives on through the recipients of \nthe Roberto Clemente Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9520-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9520-S9521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN MEMORIAM TO STATE SENATOR HENRY J. MELLO\n\n  Mrs. Boxer. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor the \nmemory of one of California's dedicated public servants, California \nState Senator Henry Mello. Senator Mello passed away on September 4, \n2004. He was 80 years old.\n  Senator Mello was first elected to the Santa Cruz County Board of \nSupervisors in 1966, where he served for 8 years. In 1976, he was \nelected to the California State Assembly. After serving for two terms \nin the assembly, Senator Mello was elected to the California State \nSenate, where he spent the majority of his career in public service. \nDuring his tenure as a member of the California State Legislature, \nSenator Mello carried a record number of bills and resolutions--727--of \nwhich 456 were signed into law. Because of his successful leadership \nskills and his ability to work across partisan lines, Senator Mello \nserved as the State Senate's majority whip from 1981 to 1992, and as \nthe majority leader from 1992 to 1996.\n  Whether he was championing childrens' rights or seniors' rights, \nenvironmental issues or public education, residents of the central \ncoast knew they had an advocate in Senator Mello. Among his many \naccomplishments in the State legislature, Senator Mello advocated for \nthe establishment of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary; the \ncreation of the California\n\n[[Page S9521]]\n\nSenior Legislature, and the conversion of Fort Ord Army Base into \nCalifornia State University Monterey Bay. A particular highlight in his \ncareer, Senator Mello cosponsored the Mello-Roos Act, which established \ntax-exempt bonds and special districts for school construction and \nother public improvements.\n  Senator Mello was proud of his Portugese heritage, and regularly \ntraveled to Washington, DC to advocate for increased foreign aid to \nPortugal. The King of Portugal knighted Senator Mello for his efforts. \nIn his spare time, Senator Mello was also an avid deep-sea fisherman \nand jazz pianist. In 2002, Senator Mello played with the Jimmy Dorsey \nOrchestra at the performing arts center in Watsonville that is named \nafter him--the Henry J. Mello Center for the Performing Arts.\n  Senator Mello was a deeply loved member of both the California State \nlegislature and the central coast community, and a strong, tenacious \nman who championed the causes of those he represented. He will be \nmissed by all who knew him. We take comfort in knowing that future \ngenerations will benefit from his spirit, his vision, and his \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9521-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF DISHA PANCHOLI\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

DOCKERY III\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, my dear friend, and neighbor for \nmany years, Donald M. Dockery III, died on September 7. As a World War \nII veteran, he was pleased that he lived to watch on television the \ndedication of the memorial on the Mall here in Washington honoring \nthose who served in that great conflict.\n  He served in Europe as a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Corps. After the \nwar, he remained in the Reserves and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in \nthe U.S. Air Force.\n  Donald Dockery was a special friend. He and his family were our \nclosest neighbors when I was growing up in the Byram community, 7 miles \nsouth of Jackson, MS. His wife, Stella, and their children, Donna, Kay, \nand Billy were also very close friends of mine, and my family.\n  Donald's death was like having a death in our own family. He and \nStella watched after me as I grew up in the neighborhood. Donald was \nthe personification of a good citizen, the kind who enriches our \ncountry with a strong spirit of community.\n  He was active in the boosters club at our school, helping children \nwho needed money for lunch room tickets or a band uniform. He was a \nvery successful businessman. He owned a store and was in the pulp wood \nand cattle business. He also got into the bottled water business; and, \nwith his father-in-law and his son, he developed their company into a \nvery impressive enterprise.\n  When my father's health began declining several years ago, Donald \nwould visit him every day. Their friendship was steadfast and enduring \nfor over 50 years.\n  It is impossible to measure the influence another person can have on \none's life, but I am sure Donald Dockery helped shape my views of the \nrole a good citizen should play in his community and the importance of \nbeing a loyal and caring friend.\n  My family and I will miss him very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9521-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DONALD COMLISH\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the passing \nof Donald Comlish, who was the vice president for international affairs \nof the Air Transport Association. Through his years of service, Mr. \nComlish helped provide great service to our airline industry as well as \nthe traveling public, and he will be truly missed.\n  Mr. Comlish worked for the ATA for 22 years as the chief \nrepresentative of the airline industry in the negotiation of the \ninternational agreements between the United States and foreign \ncountries that provide the legal and operational basis for \ninternational airline flights.\n  He participated in the negotiation of aviation agreements with \nFrance, Germany, Japan, Thailand and many other countries during his \ncareer, helping to literally open up the world to American travelers. \nMr. Comlish helped to negotiate the 1977 Bermuda II agreement, which \neased restrictions on air travel between the United States and Britain. \nHe also helped to complete a partnership between the United States and \nChina that provided for post-World War II resumption of direct air \nservice between the two countries.\n  Donald Comlish was born in Stratford, CT and enlisted in the Navy \nafter high school. He attended the Navy School of Music in Washington \nand played with the Navy Band. He graduated from St. Bonaventure \nUniversity in 1961, and received a law degree from Catholic University \nin 1965. He began his career as a law clerk for the firm of Spencer & \nWhalen and the Civil Aeronautics Board, and then began working for the \nATA. Donald was a well-respected and accomplished attorney who was \nadmitted and qualified as an attorney and counselor to the Supreme \nCourt. After leaving the ATA in the mid-1990s, he remained a consultant \nto the airline industry until his retirement in 1999.\n  Shortly before he retired, he decided to once again pursue his love \nof music and began playing saxophone and clarinet for the Montgomery \nVillage Community Band and the Virginia Grand Military Band. He was \nalso a member of the International Aviation Club.\n  Mr. Comlish's survivors include his wife of 42 years, Carol Comlish; \n6 children: Jeannie, Michael, Gregory, Matthew, Paul, and Chrissy; and \n1 grandson. His efforts improved the lives of every American who \ntravels, and he certainly left the world better than he found \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9521-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9521-S9522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House agrees \nto the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 1658) to amend the \nRailroad Right-of-Way Conveyance Validation Act to validate additional \nconveyances of certain lands in the State of California that form part \nof the right-of-way granted by the United States to facilitate the \nconstruction of the transcontinental railway, and for other purposes.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill and joint resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1301.

A bill to amend the Federal Rules of Evidence to create an \nexplicit privilege to preserve medical privacy, to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Patients' \nPrivacy Protection Act, legislation that will close a loophole in the \nFederal Rules of Evidence and ensure that every American's medical \nrecords remain confidential. I want to acknowledge my friend \nCongressman Nadler who is introducing the House companion to this bill \ntoday as well as Senators Corzine, Wyden, Lautenberg, Boxer, Jeffords, \nand Mikulski who join me as original cosponsors of this critical \nmeasure.\n  I began exploring this issue when I learned that Attorney General \nJohn Ashcroft had subpoenaed the confidential medical records from \nthousands of women around the country to defend the first-ever Federal \nabortion ban in Federal court. The fact that the women in question were \nnot a party to the lawsuits did not deter him.\n  Such a deliberate intrusion into people's medical privacy record is \ndeeply disturbing. Americans deserve full confidence that the \ngovernment is not looking into their medical records. Without such an \nassurance, how will Americans trust their doctors? What procedures, \ndiscussions, and diagnoses will they avoid for fear that these records \ncould shame them or adversely impact their future if unearthed?\n  At issue in this bill is what a reasonable person should expect when \nthey walk into a doctor's office. That person expects that what they \nsay to her doctor stays with her doctor. Only because of that \nconfidence are people able to be honest. And only through that honesty \nare people able to obtain the healthcare they need.\n  The right to private medical records is an issue that, in rhetoric at \nleast, has broad support on both sides of the partisan divide. In fact, \nit was President Bush himself who, as recently as 2001 during a \nstatement on the Medical Privacy Rule said, ``I believe that we must \nprotect both vital health care services and the right of every American \nto have confidence that his or her personal medical records will remain \nprivate.''\n  Even Attorney General Ashcroft has made strong statements in support \nof the privacy of medical records. Back in 1998, in a press release put \nout by his Senate office in which he is referred to as a ``consistent \nchampion of privacy rights,'' then-Senator Ashcroft says ``We should \nguarantee that the federal government does not undermine an \nindividual's fundamental right to privacy . . . Without privacy \nprotections in place, people may be discouraged from seeking help or \ntaking advantage of the access to health care.''\n  I agree. But unlike Attorney General Ashcroft, I believe preserving \npatient privacy entails more than issuing a press release. Patient \nprivacy doesn't end when it conflicts with a political agenda, no \nmatter how deeply felt that conviction.\n  Throughout this Administration, we have seen Attorney General \nAshcroft disregard civil liberties in the name of preventing terrorism. \nBut through this action, we see him disregarding civil rights in the \nname of outlawing abortion. This is a very slippery slope that, if \nunchecked, could affect not just women seeking reproductive healthcare, \nbut all Americans. Over the past few months, the Department of Justice \nhas asserted that federal law does not recognize the doctor-patient \nprivilege, and that individuals no longer have a reasonable expectation \nof medical privacy. These are alarming statements.\n  Thankfully, Attorney General Ashcroft is not being allowed to run \nroughshod over our right to privacy and medical confidentiality. On \nMarch 5, 2004, a San Francisco court ruled that the Department of \nJustice has no right to view the records in question in the Planned \nParenthood Federation of America lawsuit against the abortion ban. The \ndecision issued by Judge Phyllis Hamilton soundly affirmed women's \nright to privacy. She said, ``There is no question that the patient is \nentitled to privacy and protection. \n. . . Women are entitled to not have the government looking at their \nrecords.''\n  Nevertheless, we cannot take a chance that once again, when it suits \nthe political or ideological interests of this Administration or \nAdministrations to come, the federal government will intrude upon the \nmost personal of information. That is why I stand before you today.\n  The Patient Privacy Protection Act of 2004 is very simple. It states \nthat a patient's medical records and any communication about their \nmedical history are confidential unless a judge determines that the \npublic interest in those records being made public significantly \noutweighs the patient's privilege. In the cases where a judge orders \nthe records to be disclosed, the court shall, to the extent \npracticable, eliminate any and all personally identifiably information.\n  I am pleased to be introducing this simple, straightforward, common-\nsense piece of legislation. I do not believe there is a Member of \neither Chamber of Congress who in good faith could oppose this measure, \nand I look forward to working with my colleagues, Representative Nadler \nand others to see it enacted into law expediently.\n\n[[Page S9527]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 2828. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \ndefine political committee and clarify when organizations described in \nsection 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1968 must register as \npolitical committees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my good \nfriend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, and our good \nfriends who lead the campaign finance reform fight in the House, \nRepresentatives Shays and Meehan, in introducing a bill to end the \nillegal practice of 527 groups spending soft money on ads and other \nactivities to influence Federal elections.\n  As my colleagues know, a number of 527 groups have been raising and \nspending substantial amounts of soft money in a blatant effort to \ninfluence the outcome of this year's Presidential election. These \nactivities are illegal under existing laws, and yet once again, the \nFederal Election Commission (FEC) has failed to do its job and has \nrefused to do anything to stop these illegal activities. Therefore, we \nmust pursue all possible steps to overturn the FEC's misinterpretation \nof the campaign finance laws, which is improperly allowing 527 groups \nwhose purpose is to influence Federal elections to spend soft money on \nthese efforts.\n  Last week, we filed a lawsuit to overturn the FEC's failure to issue \nregulations to stop these illegal practices by 527 groups. President \nBush and his campaign filed a similar lawsuit against the FEC last week \nas well, and I also appreciate President Bush's support for the \nlegislative effort we begin today on 527s. We are introducing \nlegislation that will accomplish the same result. We are going to \nfollow every possible avenue to stop 527 groups from effectively \nbreaking the law, and doing what they are already prohibited from doing \nby longstanding laws.\n  The bill we introduce today is simply. It would require that all 527s \nregister as political committees and comply with Federal campaign \nfinance laws, including Federal limits on the contributions they \nreceive, unless the money they raise and spend is only in connection \nwith non-Federal candidate elections, State or local ballot \ninitiatives, or the nomination or confirmation of individuals to non-\nelected offices.\n  Additionally, this legislation would set new rules for Federal \npolitical committees that spend funds on voter mobilization efforts \neffecting both federal and local races and, therefore, use both a \nfederal and a non-Federal account under FEC regulations. The new rules \nwould prevent unlimited soft money from being channeled into Federal \nelection activities by these Federal political committees.\n  Under the new rules, at least half of the funds spent on these voter \nmobilization activities by Federal political committees would have to \nbe hard money from their Federal account. More importantly, the funds \nraised for their non-federal account would have to come from \nindividuals and would be limited to no more than $25,000 per year per \ndonor. Corporations and labor unions could not contribute to these non-\nfederal accounts. To put it in simple terms, a George Soros could give \n$25,000 per year as opposed to $10 million to finance these activities.\n  Let me be perfectly clear on one point here. Our proposal will not \nshut down 527s, it will simply require them to abide by the same \nFederal regulations every other Federal political committee must abide \nby in spending money to influence Federal elections.\n  It is unfortunate that we even need to be here introducing this bill \ntoday. This legislation would not be necessary if it weren't for the \nabject failure of the FEC to enforce existing laws. As my colleagues \nwell know, some organizations, registered under section 527 of the \nInternal Revenue Code, have had a major impact on this year's \npresidential election by raising and spending illegal soft money to run \nads attacking both President Bush and Senator Kerry. The use of soft \nmoney to finance these activities is clearly illegal under current \nstatute, and the fact that they have been allowed to continue unchecked \nis unconscionable.\n  The blame for this lack of enforcement does not lie with the \nCongress, nor with the Administration. The blame for this continuing \nillegal activity lies squarely with the FEC. This agency has a duty to \nissue regulations to properly implement and enforce the nation's \ncampaign laws--and the FEC has failed, and it has failed miserably to \ncarry out that responsibility. The Supreme Court found that to be the \ncase in its McConnell decision and Judge Kollar-Kotelly found that to \nbe the case in her recent decision overturning 15 regulations \nincorrectly adopted by the FEC to implement the new BCRA law. That is \nwhy a Los Angeles Times editorial today stated that, ``her decision \nwould make a fitting obituary for an agency that deserves to die.''\n  It should be clear by now why we have introduced legislation to \nabolish the FEC and replace it with a new enforcement agency. And we \nwill be conducting a major effort starting at the beginning of next \nyear to enact our bill to get a new, true enforcement agency and to \npass the 527 reform act we are introducing today. We are not going to \nallow the destructive FEC to continue to undermine the nation's \ncampaign finance laws as it has been consistently doing for the past \ntwo decades. In the mean time, given the unmitigated failure of this \nagency, I believe that its Chair, Bradley Smith and its Vice Chair, \nEllen Weintraub, should resign and recognize that they have failed to \ncarry out their responsibilities as public officials.\n  Opponents of campaign reform like to point out that the activities of \nthese 527s serve as proof that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of \n2002 (BCRA) has failed in its stated purpose to eliminate the \ncorrupting influence of soft money in our political campaigns. Let me \nbe perfectly clear on this. The 527 issue has nothing to do with BCRA, \nit has everything to do with the 194 law and the failure of the FEC to \ndo its job and properly regulate the activities of these groups.\n  As further evidence of the FEC's lack of capability, let me quote \nfrom a couple of recent court decisions which highlight this agency's \nshortcomings. First, in its decision upholding the constitutionality of \nBCRA in McConnell v. FEC, the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the FEC \nhad ``subverted'' the law, issued regulations that ``permitted more \nthan Congress had ever intended,'' and ``invited widespread \ncircumvention'' of FECA's limited on contributions. Additionally, just \nthis past Saturday, a federal district court judge threw out 15 of the \nFEC's regulations implementing BCRA. Among the reasons for her actions \nwere that one provision ``severely undermines FECA'' and would ``foster \ncorruption'', another ``runs completely afoul'' of current law, another \nwould ``render the statute largely meaningless'' and, finally, that \nanother had ``no rational basis.''\n\n  The track record of the FEC is clear, and by their continued \nstonewalling, the Commission has proven itself to be nothing more than \na bureaucratic nightmare, and the time has come to put an end to its \ndestructive tactics. The FEC has had ample, and well documented, \nopportunities to address the issue of the 527s illegal activities, and \neach time they have taken a pass, choosing instead to delay, postpone, \nand refuse to act.\n  Enough is enough. It is time to stop wasting taxpayer's dollars on an \nagency that runs roughshod over the will of the Congress, the Supreme \nCourt, the American people, and the Constitution. We've fought too long \nand too hard to sit back and allow this worthless agency to undermine \nthe law.\n  So, here is the bottom line: if the FEC won't do its job, and its \ncommissioners have proven time and time again that they won't, then \nwe'll do it for them. The bill Senator Feingold and I introduce today \nwill put an end to the abusive, illegal practices of these 527s. And we \nwill fight beginning next year to replace this rogue agency with a real \nenforcement agency.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of these bills and put \nan end to this problem once and for all.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2828\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S9528]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on \n     January 1, 2005.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again be working \nwith my partner in reform, the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nand also with the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman, who was \nso instrumental in getting the 527 disclosure bill passed in 2000. We \nare introducing today the 527 Reform Act of 2004. This bill will do \nwhat the FEC could and should do under current law, but, once again, \nhas failed to do.\n  It sometimes seems like our mission in life is to clean up the mess \nthat the FEC has made. We had to do that with BCRA, the Bipartisan \nCampaign Reform Act, which passed in 2002, closing the soft money \nloophole that the FEC created in the late '70s and expanded in the \n'90s. We are doing it again with the regulations that the FEC put in \nplace after BCRA passed. Just this past weekend an extraordinary court \ndecision came down that threw out 15 of the 19 FEC regulations \nchallenged by Representatives Shays and Meehan in a lawsuit under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act. That decision was an extraordinary \nrebuke to a Federal agency.\n  And now we are here to introduce a bill that will make absolutely \nclear that the Federal election laws apply to 527 organizations. Let me \nemphasize one thing. We believe that current Federal election law \nrequires these groups to register as political committees and stop \nraising and spending soft money. But the FEC has failed to enforce the \nlaw, saying it is too complicated or that it is too late in the \nelection cycle to take action. Those excuses are unacceptable, so we \nmust act in the Congress.\n  This bill will require all 527s to register as political committees \nunless they fall into a number of narrow exceptions. The exceptions are \nbasically for groups that Congress exempted from disclosure \nrequirements because they are so small or for groups that are involved \nexclusively in State election activity.\n  Once a group registers as a political committee, certain activities \nsuch as ads that mention only Federal candidates will have to be paid \nfor solely with hard money. But the FEC permits Federal political \ncommittees to maintain a non-Federal account to pay a portion of the \nexpenses of activities that affect both Federal and non-Federal \nelections. Our bill sets new allocation rules that will make sure that \nthese allocable activities are paid for with at least 50 percent hard \nmoney.\n  Finally, the bill makes an important change with respect to the non-\nFederal portion of the allocable activities. We put a limit of $25,000 \nper year on the contributions that can be accepted for that non-Federal \naccount. And we prohibit corporate or union funds from being given to \nthose non-Federal accounts. So no more will million dollar soft money \ncontributions be used to pay for get-out-the-vote efforts in the \nPresidential campaign.\n  Nothing in this bill will affect 501(c) advocacy groups. The bill \nonly applies to groups that claim a tax exemption under section 527. \nAnd it would be effective in the next election cycle, not this one.\n  The soft money loophole was opened by FEC rulings in the late '70s. \nBy the time we started work on BCRA, the problem had mushroomed and led \nto the scandals we saw in the 1996 campaign. When we passed BCRA, I \nsaid we would have to be vigilant to make sure that the FEC enforced \nthe law and that similar loopholes did not develop. That is what we \nhave been doing for the past 2 years, and what are again doing today.\n  I have no doubt that if we don't act on this 527 problem now, we will \nsee the problem explode into scandals over the next few election \ncycles. This time we're not going to wait.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of our bill and a section-by-\nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           527 Reform Act of 2004 Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. Short Title. The bill may be cited as the ``527 \n     Reform Act of 2004.''\n       Section 2. Treatment of Section 527 Organizations. This \n     section revises the definition of ``political committee'' in \n     the Federal Election Campaign Act (``FECA'') to add the \n     requirement that an organization ``has as its major purpose \n     the nomination or election of one or more candidates.'' This \n     language is taken from the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Buckley v. Valeo, which added this ``major purpose'' test to \n     the existing statutory definition that a ``political \n     committee'' is a group that raises or spends $1,000 or more \n     in a year in contributions or expenditures to influence \n     federal elections. The ``major purpose'' test has not \n     previously been codified.\n       This section also provides that 527 organizations have the \n     ``major purpose'' of nominating or electing candidates, and \n     thus satisfy that portion of the test for political committee \n     status, unless they meet one of the following exceptions:\n       (1) has annual receipts of less than $25,000;\n       (2) is the campaign committee of a non-Federal candidate;\n       (3) is a state or local party committee;\n       (4) is devoted exclusively to election activities relating \n     to an election where no candidate for federal office appears \n     on the ballot;\n       (5) raises and spends money exclusively for the selection, \n     nomination, election or appointment of non-Federal \n     candidates;\n       (6) raises and spends money exclusively to influence state \n     or local ballot initiatives, referenda, constitutional \n     amendments, bond issues, or other ballot measures;\n       (7) raises and spends money exclusively to influence the \n     selection, appointment, nomination, or confirmation of \n     individuals to non-elected offices.\n       An organization that makes a disbursement for a public \n     communication that promotes, supports, attacks or opposes a \n     clearly identified candidate for Federal office during the \n     two-year election cycle of that candidate cannot qualify for \n     exceptions (2)-(7) above.\n       Section 3. Certain Expenses by Major Purpose Organizations \n     Treated as Expenditures. This section supplements the \n     definition of ``expenditure'' for any organization whose \n     ``major purpose'' is the nomination or election of one or \n     more candidates. (This goes to the other portion of the test \n     for ``political committee'' status: whether a group with a \n     ``major purpose'' to influence federal elections spends \n     $1,000 in ``expenditures'' in a year.)\n       Payments for the following activities by ``major purpose'' \n     organizations, which under Section 2 include 527 \n     organizations involved in Federal elections, will be \n     considered expenditures:\n       (1) public communications that promote, support, attack, or \n     oppose a clearly identified Federal candidate or a political \n     party;\n       (2) voter registration activity, voter identification, get-\n     out the vote activity, or generic campaign activity conducted \n     in connection with an election where a Federal candidate \n     appears on the ballot.\n       Section 4. Rules for Allocation of Expenses Between Federal \n     and Non-Federal Candidates. This section provides allocation \n     rules for political committees (other than candidate \n     committees or political party committees) that engage in both \n     Federal and non-Federal election activities. If a political \n     committee engages in activities that mention a clearly \n     identified Federal candidate or candidates, or a political \n     party generally, it must fund at least 50% of those \n     activities from a Federal account that contains only hard \n     money, even if such activities also mention, or are for the \n     benefit of, non-Federal candidates. The other portion may be \n     funded from a ``qualified non-Federal account.'' An activity \n     that mentions both Federal candidates and a political party \n     generally must be paid for entirely with hard money. These \n     allocation rules apply to administrative expenses, the costs \n     of fundraising programs or events, public communications, and \n     voter drive activities, which are defined in this section as \n     voter registration, voter identification, get out the vote, \n     and generic campaign activities.\n       The section also provides that contributions to ``qualified \n     non-Federal accounts'' used to pay the non-Federal portion of \n     expenses that are allocated under this section must come only \n     from individuals and may not exceed $25,000 per donor per \n     year. ($25,000 per year is the same contribution limit that \n     applies to contributions by individuals to national party \n     committees.) Individuals can contribute $5,000 per donor per \n     year to the Federal account of political committees.\n       Section 5. Construction. This section provides that the 527 \n     Reform Act shall not be construed as approving, ratifying, or \n     endorsing any regulation issued by the FEC. It therefore will \n     have no effect on pending litigation concerning regulations \n     issued by the FEC to implement the Bipartisan Campaign Reform \n     Act of 2002. The Act also shall not be construed to \n     establish, modify, or otherwise affect the definition of \n     political organization for purposes of the Internal Revenue \n     Code.\n       Section 6. Effective Date. The amendments made by the 527 \n     Reform Act shall take effect\n\n[[Page S9530]]\n\n     on January 1, 2005. They will have no effect on the 2004 \n     elections.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nlegislative efforts of my friends and colleagues Senators McCain and \nFeingold to close the ``527'' loophole that threatens the health of our \nFederal elections by allowing unlimited amounts of soft money to \ndictate the terms of debate in defiance of the letter and spirit of the \nMcCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n  These 527 groups have become nothing more than multi-million dollar \nmegaphones advocating the special interests of wealthy individuals and \ngroups. And it will only get worse in years to come.\n  527 groups have been growing since the mid-1990s thanks to loopholes \nresulting in part from puzzling decisions by the Internal Revenue \nService and the Federal Election Commission.\n  The 527 groups would get tax-exempt status from the IRS by claiming \nthey existed to influence elections. But then they would avoid election \ndisclosure laws by denying to the Federal Election Commission they were \ntrying to influence elections because they did not use the magic words \nlike ``vote for'' or ``vote against.''\n  The result was a tax exemption for groups influencing Federal \ncampaigns, but a lack of disclosure so voters did not know who the \ngroups were, who they gave their money to and where they got their \nmoney from.\n  Congress partially closed this loophole in June 2000, by passing the \nfirst significant campaign finance reform measure in a quarter century. \nThis legislation was passed out of the Government Affairs Committee, of \nwhich I was chairman at the time, and signed into law later that year \nby President Clinton.\n  The new law required 527 groups to give notice of their intent to \nclaim tax-exempt status; to disclose information about their large \ncontributors and expenditures; and to file annual informational returns \nalong the lines of those filed by virtually all other tax-exempt \norganizations.\n  But this only partially closed this loophole. Despite the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance reforms, 527s can still raise unlimited \namounts of cash from just a few wealthy individuals or groups whose \ninterests and motivations are likely unknown to the American public. \nThe Federal Election Commission could have closed this loophole but has \nfailed to act despite massive evidence that 527s are skirting Federal \nelection law.\n  This is both an end-run around our campaign finance laws as well as a \ndirect assault on our democracy. Elections should be determined by \nmillions of individual voters who cast their ballots uninfluenced by \nthe millions of dollars of advertising paid for a by a few individuals \nor groups with special interests.\n  Reform of the 527 loophole does not mean silencing these groups or \ntaking away their right to put their message on the air. All this \nreform would require from 527s is to follow the same rules as other \npolitical advocacy groups when it comes to raising and spending money \non federal elections. The money must come from individuals in amounts \nno larger than $5,000, with no contributions from corporations or \nunions allowed.\n  If the 527 groups' support is as widespread as they claim, they will \nhave no problem getting their message out.\n  We started the job in 2000. We knew it was not enough. Now it's time \nto finish the job and get unlimited soft money out of the system.\n  The voices of millions of average Americans should not be reduced to \na whisper because they can't afford the price of the pulpit.\n  And the voices of a few should not shout like thunder because they \nhave the money to command the air waves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mrs. Dole):\n  S. 2829. A bill to establish a grant program administered under an \nagreement among the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development, \nHealth and Human Services, and Veterans Affairs, in consultation with \nthe U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, to address the goal of \nending chronic homelessness through coordinated provision of housing, \nhealth care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, and \nsupportive and other services, including assistance in accessing non-\nhomeless specific benefits and services, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Samaritan \nInitiative Act of 2004, and I am pleased to have Senator Dole join me \nin this effort. The Samaritan Initiative would mark the beginning of a \nnew, collaborative approach in the Federal effort to end chronic \nhomelessness.\n  The Initiative would create a groundbreaking joint effort between the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Health \nand Human Resources, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Each \ndepartment would contribute money to a joint fund and would coordinate \nin the effort to end chronic homelessness. This coordinated approach \nwill streamline the grants application process and will ensure \nconsistent standards. It will also ensure that each department \ncontinues to provide its own particular expertise. I am hopeful that \nother Federal agencies will join in the effort as well.\n  Homeless individuals often have needs far beyond simple shelter; they \nmay need assistance with healthcare, substance abuse, mental illness, \njob training, or other basics of life. Providing shelter without any \nsupportive services may fail to address some of the underlying problems \nthat can cause an individual to become, and remain, homeless.\n  By addressing the comprehensive needs of homeless individuals, the \nSamaritan Initiative will help reduce incidents of chronic \nhomelessness. According to the Interagency Council on Homelessness, \nthis 10 percent of the homeless population consumes more than half of \nthe resources. The Samaritan Initiative will help provide the flexible \nresources necessary to move chronically homeless individuals into \nstable, permanent, supportive housing, which will in turn free up other \nresources.\n  For many years now I have been a strong advocate for the Government \nPerformance and Results Act, which requires a focus on outcomes through \nclear, measurable goals. I am pleased to say that the Samaritan \nInitiative embodies this outcome-based focus and requires visible, \nmeasurable, quantifiable performance outcomes in reducing and ending \nhomelessness. A focus on outcomes, rather than case management or \nprocess, also allows for new, innovative solutions to chronic \nhomelessness. This will ensure that taxpayer dollars are spent in a \nresponsible, effective manner.\n  I am proud to say that the Samaritan Initiative is supported by The \nU.S. Conference of Mayors, The National Association of Counties, The \nNational League of Cities, The Enterprise Foundation, The National \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill, the National AIDS Housing Coalition, The \nNational Alliance to End Homelessness, The Corporation for Supportive \nHousing, the Association for Service Disabled Veterans, the National \nCoalition for Homeless Veterans, and many other groups. I look forward \nto working with them, along with my colleagues in the Senate, to end \nchronic homelessness in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to clarify that \nfederally recognized Indian tribal governments are to be regulated \nunder the same government employer rules and procedures that apply to \nFederal, State, and other local government employers with regard to the \nestablishment and maintenance of employee benefit plans; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need to \nclarify the legal status of employee benefit plans offered by Indian \ntribal governments.\n  In the past, the pension and welfare benefit plans of Indian tribal \ngovernments enjoyed the same status as granted to state and local \ngovernments. However, in recent years, a legal cloud has developed over \nthe status of these plans. Confusion has arisen regarding whether or \nnot the existing definition of a governmental plan includes plans \nsponsored by Indian tribal governments. In part, this has been a result \nof the Internal Revenue Service's lack of guidance to tribal \ngovernments on this issue; the inconsistent practice of granting \ngovernmental plan status to plans sponsored by Indian tribal \ngovernments; and finally a January ``no ruling'' position by the \nInternal Revenue Service that places many plans in the status of \noperating without a current determination letter recognizing the \nlegality of their plan. As a result, many tribal governments have \nlimited their offering of such welfare and retirement benefits to \nemployees.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation--the Government Pensions \nEqualization Act--to remove this legal uncertainty by amending the \ndefinition of a governmental plan to explicitly include plans offered \nby Indian tribal governments. Indian tribes, like all employers, \nrequire legal certainty regarding the status of their employee benefit \nunder the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA. Moreover, Indian tribes \nshould be afforded the same sovereignty status given state and local \ngovernments.\n  Governmental plans are relieved from many of the requirements \ngoverning the operation of tax qualified pension and welfare benefit \nplans. There are several reasons for this relief. Governments exist for \nthe benefit of their citizens and are not subject to the profit and \nloss pressures affecting the private sector. Governments offer redress \nfor grievances under their own judicial systems. Elected officials who \nare responsible for government benefit programs are directly \naccountable to their constituents via the ballot box. Governments often \noffer more generous benefit plans for key officers, such as judges, \nlegislators, and key executive personnel as a means to gain the \nvaluable services of these skilled individuals. They also offer special \npensions for public safety officers who can retire at a relatively \nyoung age and short period of service. This flexibility is impossible \nwithout the special relief provided governmental plans.\n  Indian tribal governments meet all the special protections, \nconditions, and needs I have described. This legislation clarifies once \nand for all that they should be afforded the same treatment as their \nstate and local government counterparts.\n  Passage of this legislation is an important step in the fight to \nprotect the sovereignty of Indian country and to foster the ability of \ntribal governments to provide retirement security to their employees \nand nation. I look forward to President Bush signing this legislation \ninto law. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed ion the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 432\n\n       Whereas Social Security is based on a promise to the \n     American people: if you work hard and contribute to Social \n     Security, you will be able to retire and live in dignity;\n       Whereas Social Security is the primary source of income for \n     two-thirds of American seniors;\n       Whereas Social Security benefits for retired workers \n     average only about $900 per month;\n       Whereas $900 per month is insufficient to maintain a decent \n     standard of living in many parts of the United States, \n     especially for seniors with relatively high health care \n     costs;\n       Whereas in 2001, President George W. Bush created the \n     President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security \n     (referred to in this resolution as the ``Bush Social Security \n     Commission''), naming as Commission members only those who \n     advocated Social Security privatization, and mandating that \n     the proposals put forward by the Commission include \n     privatization of Social Security;\n       Whereas the Bush Social Security Commission produced Social \n     Security privatization proposals that required deep cuts in \n     Social Security benefits;\n       Whereas the Bush Social Security Commission's proposed \n     changes could reduce Social Security benefits to future \n     retirees by as much as 46 percent;\n       Whereas under the Bush Social Security Commission's \n     proposal, the cuts in Social Security benefits would apply to \n     all seniors, not just those seniors who choose to participate \n     in privatized accounts;\n       Whereas the cuts in Social Security benefits could be even \n     deeper if individuals do shift funds to privatized accounts;\n       Whereas privatization advocates attempt to justify cuts in \n     Social Security benefits by pointing to future projected \n     shortfalls in the Social Security trust fund, but diversion \n     of payroll tax revenues from the trust fund into privatized \n     accounts would substantially accelerate the date by which the \n     Social Security trust fund becomes insolvent;\n       Whereas in order to avoid accelerating the insolvency of \n     the Social Security trust fund, the Bush Social Security \n     Commission was forced to propose that the Federal Government \n     incur as much as $4,700,000,000,000 in Federal debt (in \n     today's dollars) by 2041;\n       Whereas in response to the Bush Social Security \n     Commission's report, 50 members of the Senate wrote to \n     President Bush, urging him to reject the Commission's \n     proposed cuts in Social Security benefits;\n       Whereas the President has not complied with the request of \n     the Senators and instead has reiterated his intention to move \n     toward the privatization of Social Security; and\n       Whereas the deep cuts in Social Security benefits proposed \n     by the Bush Social Security Commission could jeopardize the \n     financial security of millions of Americans: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that Congress \n     should reject Social Security privatization proposals, \n     including those that require deep cuts in Social Security \n     benefits, such as the proposals of President Bush's Social \n     Security Commission.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Daschle, \nSenator Baucus and Senator Durbin, I am submitting a resolution that \ncalls on the Congress to reject Social Security privatization plans, \nincluding those that require deep cuts in guaranteed benefits, such as \nthe proposals by President Bush's Social Security Commission.\n  For nearly 70 years, Social Security has reflected the best of \nAmerica's values. Social Security promises Americans that if you work \nhard, pay your taxes, and play by the rules, you will be able to retire \nand live in dignity.\n  Social Security benefits are far from lavish. The average retiree \nreceives only about $900 a month. That doesn't go far in many parts of \nthe country--certainly not in New Jersey. Unfortunately, even the \nbenefits promised under current law are now at risk.\n  President Bush says he wants to move toward privatization. But what \nhe does not say is that shifting funds from the Social Security Trust \nFund into privatized accounts almost inevitably leads to deep cuts in \nguaranteed benefits.\n  To appreciate the depth of the cuts that flow from privatization, one \nneed only consider the privatization plans developed by President \nBush's own Social Security Commission. That commission included only \nproponents of privatization selected by President Bush, and it \ndeveloped privatization plans that call for deep benefits cuts. \nAccording to the nonpartisan actuaries at the Social Security \nAdministration, those cuts would exceed 25 percent for some current \nworkers. In the future, seniors could face a 45 percent cut in \nbenefits.\n  The President likes to argue that privatization is about choice. But \nthere would be no choice about these cuts--they would harm every \nsenior. In fact, those who chose to participate in privatized accounts \nwould see their benefits cut even deeper.\n  That is why, in response to the Bush Commission's report, 50 members \nof the Senate wrote to President Bush, urging him to reject the \nCommission's proposed cuts in benefits. Unfortunately, we have yet to \nreceive a response.\n  Privatization advocates try to justify cuts in Social Security by \npointing to future projected shortfalls in the Trust Fund. But \ndiverting payroll taxes from the Trust Fund only makes matters worse, \nand would substantially accelerate the date by which the Fund would \nbecome insolvent. That is why privatization almost inevitably leads to \ndeep cuts in benefits.\n  It is critical that this issue be fully discussed now--before the \nelection. So I will be looking for an opportunity to bring this \nresolution before the Senate before the end of the year. I hope we can \nkill this radical idea before it has a chance to get off the ground.\n  We must never accept any plan that takes the security out of Social \nSecurity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9534-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                subcommittee on public lands and forests\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 709, S. 2826, the \nDistrict of Columbia appropriations bill; that the bill be read a third \ntime; that the Appropriations Committee then be discharged from further \nconsideration of H.R. 4850, the House-passed DC appropriations bill, \nand the Senate proceed to its consideration.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause of \nH.R. 4850 be stricken; the text of S. 2826 be inserted in lieu thereof; \nthe bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two \nHouses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on behalf of \nthe Senate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that S. 2826 then be returned to the \ncalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. \nLandrieu, the ranking member on the DC Appropriations Subcommittee, for \nher hard work and efforts in helping to\n\n[[Page S9536]]\n\ndraft the appropriations bill before us today. This bill provides $560 \nmillion in Federal funds for the District of Columbia and includes the \ncity's own local budget of $6.2 billion.\n  The funds in this bill focus on a number of key priorities for the \nDistrict of Columbia: First, improving the lives and opportunities for \nchildren in the District; second, reducing and preventing crime in the \nDistrict; and third, increasing security in our Nation's capital.\n  The bill continues an initiative we began last year to help improve \nthe city's long-troubled foster care system by providing funds for \nintensive intervention when children first enter care; providing \nresources for early and continued mental health services for all \nchildren in foster care; providing incentives to retain qualified \nsocial workers and foster parents; and funding a new computer tracking \nsystem for children in foster care.\n  The bill also focuses on children by enhancing educational \nopportunities for inner-city students. We are continuing to provide a \ntotal of $40 million for three interrelated educational components: $13 \nmillion to promote excellence in traditional public schools; $13 \nmillion to expand choice through high quality charter schools; and $13 \nmillion for opportunity scholarships for low-income students in failing \nschools.\n  The second priority that this bill funds crime fighting in the \nDistrict. The federal government entirely funds the D.C. Courts and the \nCourt Services and Supervision Agency. The committee is providing a \ntotal of $337 million for these agencies, which is $55 million more \nthan the fiscal year enacted level. Most of these additional resources \nare for renovations and repairs to the City's 4th oldest building, the \nHistoric Old Courthouse, which will make it habitable once again and \nprovide much-needed courtroom capacity. The bill also provides \nadditional resources to enhance supervision of high-risk sex offenders, \noffenders with mental health problems, and domestic violence offenders.\n  With this bill, we are beginning an important federal investment in a \nnew forensics lab for the District of Columbia. Currently, the city \nmust rely on the generosity of the FBI's crime lab. Because of its own \nheavy workload, the Bureau limits the amount of evidence that it can \nprocess for the city. With so many unsolved rape, murder, and other \nviolent crime cases in the District, a new crime lab is a crucial need.\n  The sobering fact is that, as the seat of our Nation's capital, the \nDistrict of Columbia is a target of bioterrorism attacks. And, those \nattacks must be investigated. Indeed, the anthrax attacks of 2001 and \nthe ricin scare of 2004 have shown that a forensics lab is vital to \npublic safety in the District and deserving of federal support.\n  The final priority in this bill is improving security in the \nDistrict. As the seat of the federal government and as a symbol of our \ndemocracy, the District of Columbia faces increased risks of terrorist \nattacks. Therefore, the bill includes security funding, including \nresources to complete a Unified Communications Center, which will be \nthe center for coordinated multi-agency responses in the event of \nregional and national emergencies. The bill also continues to provide \nfunds to reimburse the city for increased police, fire, and emergency \npersonnel costs associated with events that occur in the District \nbecause of the presence of the Federal Government.\n\n  I take this opportunity to recognize the city's leadership in \nimproving the financial condition of the District. Recently, the \nDistrict received a vote of confidence from Wall Street when its bonds \nwere upgraded two steps from ``BBB+'' to ``A''. Despite this good news \nabout the city's short-term financial performance, I am well aware that \nthe city faces a long-term economic structural imbalance. This \nimbalance represents a gap between the District's ability to raise \nrevenue at reasonable tax rates and its ability to provide services of \nreasonable quality to its residents.\n  I recognize that the structural imbalance is driven by expenditure \nrequirements and revenue restrictions which are mostly beyond the \ncontrol of the District's leadership. Clearly, the city's revenue \ncapacity would be larger without Federal constraints on its taxing \nauthority, such as its inability to tax Federal property or the income \nof non-residents.\n  I agree that the city faces a troubling problem in the long-term. I \nwant to help close the financial gap and help ensure the long-term \neconomic health of our Nation's capital. This is a Federal enclave, \nestablished by the Constitution, and it must live by the constraints \nimposed on it by the Federal Government. I believe that the Federal \nGovernment must recognize the costs it places on the city and the \nburden it places on the city's infrastructure, all the while limiting \nthe ability of the city to raise revenue. Indeed, many of the problems \nfacing the District result from it being the seat of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  This bill takes two small steps to begin to address the structural \nimbalance. First, we are providing $4 million to assist the city with \nits annual operating payment to the Washington Metropolitan Transit \nAuthority, commonly referred to as the ``Metro''.\n  The District's share of the Metro operating subsidy is $208 million. \nWhereas the State governments of Maryland and Virginia both help \nsubsidize the Metro, the District does not have a State to help share \nthe burden of this cost. In addition, many Federal workers use the \nMetro system to travel between Federal buildings throughout the \nworkday.\n  Second, the bill provides $10 million for a combined sewer overflow \nsystem. The current system was constructed in 1890 and overflows 60 to \n70 times each year, dumping raw sewage into the Anacostia River. \nClearly, the Federal Government places a heavy burden on this system \nand should help share the cost of upgrading it. I believe these small \nFederal contributions for infrastructure are important, but clearly the \nFederal Government must do more to help eliminate this structural \nimbalance that it has helped create.\n  I again thank Senator Landrieu. She and I share the same concerns for \nthe children and residents who live in the District of Columbia, as \nwell as the millions of visitors who come here every year to see \nAmerica's seat of government. She and I have worked as close partners \nin writing this bill. Together, we have put together a bill that \nfocuses on improving the well-being of the District's children and \nprotecting the safety of all who live and work here. I thank the \nSenator from Louisiana, and I turn to her now for her remarks.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman DeWine in \npresenting the bipartisan fiscal year 2005 District of Columbia \nappropriations bill to the Senate. The bill totals $560 million, which \nis an increase of $18.3 million from fiscal year 2004. The chairman and \nI moved this bill through the full Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, \nSeptember 21 by a near-unanimous vote with no controversial amendments. \nDuring our 3-year chairman and ranking membership of the D.C. \nsubcommittee, we have met many policy and partisan challenges and \nremained great friends. This year is truly an achievement of the \nchairman's bipartisan lead of this bill. We continue to marry our \ninterests in strengthening education and child welfare in the District.\n  Great communities need great schools. This bill includes $26 million \nfor public education in support of the committee's goal to improve \neducation in the District. Fifty years after the landmark Brown v. the \nBoard of Education decision of the Supreme Court, 3 years after \nenactment of the significant No Child Left Behind Act, we are still \nworking to shape the two-sided face of public education, excellence and \nfailure, into a more equal experience for children. The District's \nschools have been mired in years of changing superintendents, \nmanagement and oversight challenges. A new superintendent has been \nhired, Dr. Clifford Janey, we are excited about his energy to reform \nand improve and want to support his efforts as strongly as possible. \nThis bill includes certain tools to, hopefully, contribute to Dr. \nJaney's work.\n  In our public schools we must recognize and reward excellence. We \nmust acknowledge and eliminate failure. This bill directs a total of $7 \nmillion for a new incentive grant program for public education \nimprovement in both traditional public schools and public charter \nschools. These grants will be\n\n[[Page S9537]]\n\nawarded to the principal of high performing or significantly improved \npublic schools to reward their good work. A reward is a powerful \nincentive to build on success and meet some of the areas which can make \ntheir school thrive. These grants could be for a specialized librarian, \nnew books, and bonuses for excellent teachers, or even to support \nsports and recreation with a new basketball court. It is entirely up to \nthe principal to decide. In addition, the bill includes $5 million to \nsupport the very successful D.C. program to reconstitute the schools \ndesignated as in need of improvement by the standards of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. The Transformation School Initiative has successfully \nbreathed new life into 15 of the lowest performing public schools in \nthe District with innovative ways to reinvigorate teachers, reinvest \nparents, and get kids exciting about going to school and excited about \nlearning. We are very pleased to support these programs with $13 \nmillion for public schools as part of the $40 million School \nImprovement Fund created last year.\n  The second prong of the School Improvement Fund, $13 million for \npublic charter school, is supported by robust support to strengthen the \nchartering system. With 41 charters granted to date, the District has \nachieved the distinction of having the highest number of charter \nschools per capita. As such, the District is in a position to serve as \nleader in the effort to use charter schools to spur system-wide \nimprovement from within our system of public education. Senator DeWine \nand I maintain our commitment to serve as a full and equal partner in \nthis endeavor.\n  It is important to note that while the primary reason for the rapid \ngrowth in the number of charter schools was the unmet desire of \neducation reformers to find a way to ``step out of the box'' that had \nbecome our public school system, charter schools are by definition \nindependent public schools. With their relative autonomy, charter \nschools are a way to provide greater educational choice and innovation \nwhile not abandoning the public school system. Recent studies show that \nthe existence of a charter school in a district not only increases the \nquality of education available to the students served directly by the \ncharter school but in all surrounding public schools. In addition, \ncharter schools provide a healthy dose of competition into the public \nschool system and have the effect of accelerating reforms and \nimprovements in traditional public schools.\n  Despite the increased challenge of educating students with the \ngreatest need, objective surveys and reports show that the academic \nprogress among charter schools students outpacing that of their cohorts \nin traditional public schools. Those successes included gains in \nreading and math performances; test scores higher than district, state \nand neighborhood schools; increased parental involvement; and higher \nattendance and fewer disciplinary problems.\n  Strengthening charter schools, which were created in the D.C. by \nCongress in the 1995 School Reform Act, is a primary tenant of our work \nto improve education. Pursuant to Section 120 of P.L. 106-522, the \nFiscal Year 2001 DC Appropriations Act, the local government is \nprohibited from amending the School Reform Act. Therefore, Congress has \ncontinued our oversight responsibility of the charter school law this \nyear. The bill fortifies the environment where strong, accountable, \nacademically excellent charter schools flourish.\n  This bill includes language which will encourage public schools to \nconvert to charter schools. The 1996 School Reform Act allows for \ntraditional public schools to petition to convert to a public charter \nschool, if the teachers and parents in the community want a more \nresponsive and engaging school. However, to date, only one school, Paul \nJunior High, has exercised that option. We are not trying to say that \nevery public school should be a charter school, but we support if the \ncommunity of a particular school sees a benefit in becoming a charter \nschool and can gain a majority consensus of that community, a \nconversion is possible.\n  In addition, we toughen oversight of chartering boards to better \nscreen applications and strengthen oversight of existing schools. We \nthink this will make a stronger public charter school community, and \nshould not create any additional bureaucracy which would tamp down \nreform. Finally, we included language which will improve access to \nfacilities for charter schools, which can be their greatest challenge. \nThe buildings in which children learn are just as critical as the other \ntools available to make these kids a success.\n  Under the kind leadership of Chairman DeWine, we have also invested \nin the welfare of the most vulnerable children in the District, those \nin the custody of the abuse and neglect welfare system. Just in the \nlast week, the District has suffered the loss of another child, Angel \nFleming, who was put in the custody of the Child and Family Services \nAgency.\n  The bill supports our priority of reforming child welfare by \nproviding the tools necessary to the foster care system with $5 \nmillion. We are funding for early intervention services to try to keep \nkids with relatives, rather than send them to temporary foster care \nhomes. The bill also continues to ensure that all kids in foster care \nget mental health assessments and services. Finally, Senator DeWine has \nensured that an area often forgotten, foster parents, receive the \nrespite services necessary and promote grassroots foster parent \nrecruiting and training efforts.\n  This bill meets our Federal responsibility to the criminal justice \nsystem and infrastructure investments requested by the mayor and \ncouncil. The new family court, which embraces the ideal of one family-\none judge, is fully funded and we continue to provide for their new \nbuilding. In addition, the bill initiates a new investment in the \nadministration of justice in the District by contributing $8 million to \nthe construction of a new forensics lab. This laboratory will alleviate \ncontract pressure D.C. imposes on other Federal agencies, such as the \nFBI, to complete local forensic work. The bill also contributes to \nsecurity and emergency preparedness in the Nation's capital with $22 \nmillion to bolster the police and first responders. In addition to all \nof the important initiatives in the District this bill invests in, \nthere is $13 million for cleaning up the Anacostia River and providing \nrecreation for the entire region and $5 million for transportation \nimprovements.\n  I want to thank the mayor of the District, Anthony Williams, the \nentire council, particularly the Chair Linda Cropp, and the D.C. \nDelegate to Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton for their many contributions \nand advice in developing this bill. They are great partners for \nChairman DeWine and I to ensure the bill meet the needs of the \nDistrict. I appreciate the chairman's consideration and our ability to \nwork together on this bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 4850), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The Chair appointed Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nStevens, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Inouye conferees on the part \nof the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/22/senate-section/article/S9537-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9537]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2830\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

We will convene following \nthat speech for a short period of morning business. Following morning \nbusiness, we hope to consider the Foreign Operations appropriations \nbill.

The leader has spoken to some of the Jewish Members \nof the Senate and he recognizes the problem. We have this tax bill of \nwhich we know the importance.
