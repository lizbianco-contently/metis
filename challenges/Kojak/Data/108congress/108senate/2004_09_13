Mr. President, it was 1 year ago today that the voters in \nmy home State of Texas passed proposition 12, a referendum that paves \nthe way for substantive medical liability reform and provides hope that \nquality health care will win out over the interests of a handful of \npolitically powerful personal injury lawyers.\n  The people of Texas spoke, and the doctors across the State are \nreopening their doors. In fact, two obstetricians in the small town of \nFredericksburg, TX, announced their return with an advertisement in the \nlocal newspaper that proclaimed: ``We're Back!''\n  One of these obstetricians, Dr. David Cantu, had been working for \nmore than 10 years as an obstetrician with no claims, but he and his \npartner had to quit practicing obstetrics because of the cost of \ninsurance. Dr. Cantu's overhead was hitting 100 percent, and he had a \n3-month stretch with no pay.\n  As soon as they stopped delivering babies, the practice saw an \nimmediate decrease in insurance costs, but their patients were forced \nto travel elsewhere to have their babies delivered. This was doubly \ndifficult for them considering the fact that 70 percent of Dr. Cantu's \npatients are Medicaid patients, and 40 percent were Spanish speaking.\n  But with proposition 12, Dr. Cantu and his partner are now able to \ndeliver babies again. Proposition 12 has placed a $250,000 cap on \nnoneconomic damages in medical liability cases. When Dr. Cantu was \nasked, How has that helped you and your patients, he said:\n\n       Because now I come out ahead instead of paying to be an \n     Obstetrician. Prop. 12 made the practice of Obstetrics \n     affordable.\n\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\n\n  When it comes to health care, I strongly believe the proper role of \nGovernment is to protect the freedom of all of us to improve our own \nhealth and to deal with our own health care needs. We must ensure that \ndecisions about a patient's health are not made by the Government but \nby individuals and families; that is, between the patient and his or \nher doctor.\n  Patients and their doctors--not lawyers, not bureaucrats--should be \ntrusted to decide what treatment is best for them. I strongly believe \nwhen people have good choices in health care, it ultimately translates \ninto higher quality and better care.\n  Dr. Cantu's story shows us that our current medical liability system \nis the biggest challenge we face in this regard. Our current system is \nwasteful and dangerous, and it too often serves the interests of greed, \nnot justice and common sense. The overall results of our current system \nare sky-high costs for liability insurance, costs that have created a \ncrisis of enormous proportions--a crisis that is threatening quality of \ncare, diminishing access to care, and exploding the cost of care.\n  But there is hope. Evidence is mounting that reforms such as \nproposition 12 in the State of Texas are working. We can see that in \nreal terms and not just because of advertisements of doors to doctors' \noffices reopening. Even though these reforms have been in place for \nonly 1 year in Texas, early results are encouraging.\n  After a decrease in Texas insurance carriers from 17 to 4--that is \nthe number of medical liability insurance companies that would actually \ninsure a physician or a health care provider against medical liability \nclaims--proposition 12 has created an environment where 10 different \ncarriers have now sought reentry into the Texas market to write \nphysician policies. The largest insurer in the State, Texas Medical \nLiability Trust, reduced its premiums by 12 percent. A Texas hospital \nassociation survey shows, for hospitals in our State, a 17-percent \nreduction across the board.\n  Why this response? Lawsuits against hospitals are down 70 percent \nfrom last summer's race to the courthouse, when Texas courts were \nflooded by personal injury lawyers with more than 10,000 medical \nmalpractice lawsuits, shortly before voters approved proposition 12.\n  Let me repeat that because it is important for everyone to \nunderstand. Knowing that proposition 12 was likely to pass, personal \ninjury trial lawyers filed more than 10,000 medical liability lawsuits \nshortly before the reform was to take effect in order to beat the \npeople's mandate that health care should be more widely available and, \ncertainly, medical liability insurance available more readily to more \nphysicians. Why? To help doctors, to help hospitals and the \ncorporations that own those hospitals?\n  Everybody knows that corporations don't practice medicine, and the \nonly way you can get your baby treated or yourself treated is to have a \ndoctor who will see you. So what we are talking about is not a benefit \ndirectly to doctors or the hospitals; what we are talking about is a \nbenefit to patients--in other words, to all of us--as a result of this \ncommonsense reform.\n  The best news is that doctors such as David Cantu are responding. In \nAustin, 16 new obstetricians have started their practice in the last \nyear, reversing a trend over the previous 2\\1/2\\ years when Austin lost \n16 obstetricians due to the medical liability crisis. Driscoll \nChildren's Hospital is recruiting close to a dozen new pediatric \nspecialists, three neonatologists, two cardiologists, a hematologist, a \ngeneral surgeon, and four other specialists, something they could not \ndo under the earlier environment.\n  These successes are not limited to just the State of Texas. A recent \nstudy by the Rand Institute found that California's 1975 medical \nliability reform, known as MICRA, reduced defendants' liabilities by 30 \npercent and plaintiffs' attorneys fees by 60 percent. That was a means \nto an end because the result in California has been that insurance \nrates have actually risen at a rate of about two-thirds of what the \nrate has been in the rest of the Nation. These are signs that reforms \nsuch as proposition 12, or California's MICRA, have worked. Yet still \nwe find that in the U.S. Senate today, we are unable to get a solution \nfor families all across the Nation in States that have no such reforms \nin place. This is a national problem and it calls for a national \nsolution.\n  I want to say a few words about our Nation's need for serious medical \nliability reform and the U.S. Senate's appalling refusal to address \nthat problem with real solutions. Unfortunately, special interests \ncontinue to win out over mainstream America, and our health care system \ncontinues to bear the burden of costly and frivolous lawsuits. We see \nthat medical care and medical liability insurance rates continue to \ngrow unabated.\n  I couldn't help but notice this quote from Senator Kerry at the \nDemocratic National Convention in his acceptance speech. He noted \nspecifically:\n\n       Since 2000, four million people have lost their health \n     insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it. You \n     know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your \n     deductibles have all gone through the roof.\n\n  I am actually very pleased to hear this acknowledgment by the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, recognizing the seriousness of our situation. He is \nright about one thing: These are real problems, and they deserve real \nand immediate solutions.\n  With all due respect, he and some of our colleagues in the Senate \ncontinue to avoid the most obvious and primary cause of escalating \nhealth care costs and the decrease in availability of medical liability \ninsurance and the consequential lack of access to real health care--\nthat is, runaway lawsuits.\n\n  Three times in the 108th Congress alone Republican leadership has \nbrought meaningful medical liability reform to the Senate which, if \npassed, President Bush would readily sign into law. This chart shows \nthree different bills that have been brought to the Senate floor by the \nmajority leader: S. 11, the Patients First Act of 2003; S. 2061, the \nHealthy Mothers and Healthy Babies Access to Care Act; and S. 2207, the \nPregnancy and Trauma Care Access Protection Act.\n  Over a year ago, the majority leader brought forth a comprehensive \nreform proposal known as S. 11. Earlier we brought forth two additional \nproposals which dealt more with specialty practices such as \nobstetricians who deliver babies and emergency room physicians, hoping \nthat even if we were not able to get broad medical liability reform, we \nmight be able to achieve it for those specialties that are most acutely \naffected and where access to health care hits the hardest.\n  I do not begin to claim that the legislative proposals we have \nadvanced were the only solution to the problems. Indeed, I applaud \nother reforms. But it is clear, as this chart indicates, that each time \nwe have tried to come up with a solution, we have been denied an \nopportunity to go forward with the debate and to have amendments, if \nany Senator wished to offer amendments, and to try to get good, \ncommonsense medical liability reform that would increase access to \nhealth care.\n  I don't believe medical liability reform is the only problem that \nconfronts our health care system today. I applaud many other reforms \nthat have been proposed by the President and others, including the \ninnovation of health savings accounts, which were part of the Medicare \nbill we passed about a year ago, and the use of new technology to make \nthe practice of medicine more efficient and to reduce the likelihood of \nmedical errors. These and other reforms do represent commonsense \nproposals that hold great promise, not only for improved health care \nbut to make sure the cost of health care remains affordable and thus \nmore available to more people.\n  Above all, it is clear that any of these bills would offer much-\nneeded relief to the health care system brought to a state of crisis by \npolitically powerful personal injury lawyers in as many as 23 States \nacross the country. I find it sad that any special interest group--and \nthe Senators voting according to the wishes of those groups and not the \nAmerican people, a list that includes the Democratic nominees for \nPresident and Vice President--has denied us the opportunity on each of \nthese three occasions to begin the debate, begin the legislative \nprocess, and hopefully accomplish meaningful reform and improve access \nto health care. But we were denied even the chance to debate and vote \non the issue, even when a bipartisan majority of this body agrees that \nwe need reform and we have the\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\ntools to effect that reform within our reach. Their choice to deny us \nthat opportunity was not ours; it was theirs. To this day, those who \nobstruct meaningful medical liability reform leave the American people \nwith the sad reality of the status quo, a broken civil justice system \nand little hope for a national solution.\n  While the problem persists in all aspects of our health care system, \nthe crisis is particularly acute among specialty doctors--for example, \nneurosurgeons, brain and spinal surgeons, emergency room physicians, \nand, notably, obstetricians and gynecologists, the doctors who actually \ncare for women who are pregnant and who deliver their babies. A handful \nof powerfully connected personal injury lawyers is seriously \njeopardizing patient care for women and their newborns. I and others \nfind that completely unacceptable.\n  Across the country liability insurance for obstetrician/gynecologists \nhas become prohibitively expensive. Premiums have tripled and \nquadrupled, leaving OB/GYNs without the ability to get liability \ninsurance at all as insurance companies fold or stop insuring doctors.\n  This last week, the Washington Post wrote an article on a malpractice \ninsurer, known as NCRIC, right here in the District of Columbia, which \nis ``feeling the squeeze,'' losing over $4 million in 2003 alone.\n  This chart shows that 23 States are on red alert--in a medical \nliability crisis--while just 3, including Texas, are in crisis pending \neffect of reform. Others noted by the hash marks on the chart are those \nwhere the crisis is still brewing.\n  These skyrocketing medical malpractice premiums literally are driving \nphysicians out of business and leaving Americans without access to \nquality health care. Between 2002 and 2003, rates rose as much as 40 \npercent in some States, with the impact hitting specialty doctors such \nas obstetricians/gynecologists the hardest.\n  When an OB/GYN cannot find or afford medical liability insurance, \nthey are forced to stop delivering babies, forced to curtail surgical \nservices, or close their doors altogether. Now more than one in seven \nacross the Nation is simply leaving the profession and walking away.\n  For example, in my home State of Texas, the entire obstetrics unit at \nSpring Branch Medical Center in Houston was forced to close just prior \nto an expected 2003 increase of 67 percent in the hospital's medical \nliability premiums.\n  Today, because the effects of proposition 12 have not been fully \nrealized, out of 254 counties in Texas--one of the States in crisis \npending effect of the reforms--more than half of the counties in Texas \nsimply do not have available a single doctor who specializes in \ndelivering babies. In many cases, doctors simply chose to stop serving \ncertain patients to avoid costly litigation; or even if they were not \ninvolved in litigation, they were still forced to pay ultra-high \nmedical liability premiums, making it simply impossible to make ends \nmeet.\n  One rural obstetrics/gynecologist who serves mostly Medicaid, or poor \npatients, was forced to stop seeing high-risk patients altogether \nbecause his insurance premiums had increased 300 percent.\n  The effects are felt almost entirely by the poorer members of our \nsociety who depend, of course, on Medicaid to help them with their \nhealth care premiums.\n  Perhaps most disconcerting of all, however, is the trend of doctors \nengaging in defensive medical practice. When we ask why is the cost of \nhealth care going up so dramatically and why are health care premiums \npaid by employers or by self-employed persons going up so dramatically, \nit is in part because of the effect of defensive medicine--physicians \nwho provide tests and services, not because they think it is medically \nindicated but because they simply want to defend themselves against a \npotential lawsuit.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, a majority \nof doctors say they recommend invasive procedures and painful tests \nthey consider unnecessary in medical terms in hopes of avoiding \nlitigation. That is the point we have reached.\n  The most basic principles of justice require that we embrace national \nreform as soon as possible, striving to protect access both to the \ncourts and to our hospitals and to physicians. As a matter of \nprinciple, those who are wrongly injured deserve their day in court; \nthere is no question about that. We all agree. If a doctor is \nresponsible or negligent, he or she should be held fully accountable. \nBut the sad fact is that the current system does not foster \naccountability. Instead, it has nearly destroyed any hope for quality \nand affordable health care in America. The time for that to change is \nnow and we must change it.\n  It is time for Congress to act and to provide a national solution so \nall Americans can benefit from medical liability reform, so all \nAmericans can open their newspapers and see an advertisement from their \nneighborhood doctor, who may have once been forced out of his practice \nnow happily, proclaiming: We are back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I wish to make some comments on \nintelligence reform, an issue that is a real focus for the Senate, with \nactivities both on the floor as well as off the floor and most of it in \ncommittee and task forces right now.\n  Before doing so, I thank my colleague from Texas, who so carefully \nand deliberately and comprehensively laid out a huge problem that, as \nhe said, affects access to health care now. As he described it, \nobstetricians and gynecologists are leaving the practice of delivering \nbabies and getting out of taking care of women who need it because they \nsimply cannot afford it any longer. Trauma surgeons and centers are \nstopping doing surgery, not because they want to, but they cannot \nafford to and still provide for their family.\n  The driver for those OB/GYNs, the trauma centers, neurosurgeons, and \northopedic surgeons is the liability system that is out of control. It \nused to be that people would talk about it and it didn't have much \ntraction with the American people because they would say those doctors \nmake so much money and they can take care of it. But when you have \nneurosurgeons paying $400,000 a year just for liability insurance, you \nsimply cannot keep delivering care. If it is $100,000 or $200,000, you \ncan pass it on to the patients. But remember, the skyrocketing premiums \nare costing the American people--you, the people listening to me, who \nare having to pay more for health care--because it drives the cost up.\n  I very much appreciate him coming to the floor and addressing that \nissue. Health care costs right now are increasing each and every year. \nWe all know that and it is our obligation to address that. It is about \n15 percent of our gross domestic product right now. Whether that is too \nmuch or too little, the point is, it is going up, and one of the big \ndrivers of that is the medical liability cost.\n  Americans deserve affordable health care, reliable health care, \naccessible health care, and good quality health care. We are getting to \na point where we simply cannot afford it; thus, as we look to the \nfuture, and whether it is in individual Senate races or the \nPresidential race, I encourage the American people to ask these \nquestions: Who is addressing the root causes of these escalating costs \nin health care? Is it Democrats or Republicans? Is it the nominee or \nthe incumbent? Is it President Bush or nominee Kerry? Who is addressing \nthe root causes of driving these costs sky high and out of everybody's \ncontrol, when ultimately the American taxpayer pays it, and your \npremium is going to go up, whether or not you are involved in a \nlawsuit, because that cost is passed on to you.\n  As my colleague pointed out on the floor, on three occasions, we have \naddressed the root cause--these frivolous lawsuits, the personal injury \nlawyers, who are putting money in their pockets instead of the pockets \nof the victims who may have been hurt; or the predatory personal injury \nlawyers--not all of them but the ones filing frivolous lawsuits, in \norder to hit that litigation lottery and line their pocketbooks. We \nhave tried to do this three times unsuccessfully basically because of \nthe Democrats--not all because one voted with us. They said they were \nnot going to discuss it on the floor of the Senate. So I think it is an \nissue that we must\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\naddress, and I appreciate our distinguished colleague bringing it to \nthe floor. It is an important issue that we have to address on this \nfloor and I think will play out in races across the country. Who is for \nreasonable, commonsense medical liability reform which allows \nobstetricians to keep delivering babies, trauma centers to stay open, \nand allows doctors to do what they want to do, and that is to practice \nmedicine and take care of patients, instead of driving them away. It is \nas simple as that.\n\n  We are going to try to get it before the Senate, probably not in the \nnext 18 days we have left in our legislative session, but we will bring \nit back again and again until we are successful.\n  I should mention as an aside as well, in the Presidential race, it is \nimportant, as we look at who is addressing the root causes in terms of \na vision for health care, we do need to take a look at the health care \nplans.\n  The American Enterprise Institute released today a very good paper--I \nam sure there will be other papers--that looked at the Kerry health \ncare plan and said it is going to cost $1.5 trillion. That is twice \nwhat the Kerry campaign has said.\n  Mr. President, $1.5 trillion is huge. The only way it can be paid \nfor, obviously, is by increasing taxes on everybody--everybody. I \nencourage people to look at that document.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9102-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          INTELLIGENCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I do want to bring people up to date--and I \nwill be brief--on where we are with the Senate intelligence reform \ninitiatives in light of the 9/11 Commission. Over the next several \ndays, we will have a very busy week. It is cut a little bit short by \nthe Jewish holidays. I believe our central focus in this body, given \nthe fact we have so few legislative days, must be on the security of \nthe American people, and that means the bill that is currently on the \nfloor that we are turning to and will be voting on one of the \namendments at 5:30 p.m. today, the Homeland Security appropriations \nbill.\n  It says ``Homeland Security'' appropriations. We have had good \ndebate. We all hope to pass that bill late tomorrow night or Wednesday \nmorning for sure.\n  Second, we need to focus on reforming our intelligence community, \nsomething people do understand--broadly the American people \nunderstand--that is reflected in the 9/11 Commission recommendations, \nthe update of that report, the discussion of that report, and we have \nresponded aggressively in terms of hearings, recognizing that reform \nshould be done now, not knee-jerk but deliberate reform, and begin it \nin a way that will have an impact to make our intelligence better, to \nmake our intelligence sharing among our various entities better, that \nmakes our oversight better.\n  Last week, the leadership on both sides of the aisle, on both sides \nof the Capitol, met with the President of the United States, who \npresented his plan for reorganizing the intelligence community. It was \na good meeting. It was a productive meeting. There was a good \ndiscussion by the participants. The general consensus was we need to \nrespond quickly but also very responsibly, and that really is our \ncharge.\n  We are responding to the reform we all know needs to occur, but it \nwas spelled out by the 9/11 Commission. It does not mean we should take \nevery recommendation and do exactly what they said, but it means we \nneed to look at those recommendations, study them, get new information, \nmake them even more current, and then act on many of those \nrecommendations.\n  The President mentioned that they in the administration have \naddressed 36 of the recommendations. There are really two \nrecommendations that apply to reorganization of this body, 39 to the \nexecutive branch, and the administration has addressed 36 of those 39 \nrecommendations.\n  Before we recessed in July, Senator Daschle and I announced that the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee would be the vehicle, that they would \nhave the responsibility for leading the reorganization of the executive \nbranch, the branch outside the legislative branch.\n  For our internal reorganization, we announced a task force that is \nled by the leadership, represented by the majority whip, Senator \nMcConnell, and the minority whip, Senator Reid, that would address the \nrecommendations of Senate oversight.\n  The McConnell-Reid task force is meeting to discuss the whole range \nof options that have been put on the table, several of which were put \non the table by the 9/11 Commission. Indeed, there are a lot more \noptions that are available to be discussed and debated, and then to \nmake a proposal as to what, based on all of this input, would be most \nappropriate, most responsible for this body to do, to accomplish that \nSenate oversight of intelligence and homeland security.\n  It is a bipartisan effort. When we talk about safety and security of \nthe American people, politics falls aside pretty quickly. Senator \nDaschle and the Democratic leadership and the leadership on our side \nare working closely together to address the challenges before us. We \nhave tapped into the expertise of the Congressional Research Service \nand other outside experts in a search for additional or other ways and \nmeans to improve Senate oversight.\n  The McConnell-Reid task force will meet several more times over the \ncoming weeks. They will be assessing the\n9/11 Commission's proposals, as well as other proposals. Our goal is to \nget a resolution to the floor before the Senate adjourns on October 8.\n  Meanwhile, the arm that I mentioned, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee arm, led by Senators Collins and Lieberman, continues to make \nsteady progress. Last week, the Governmental Affairs Committee held a \nbriefing with Robert Mueller, who is Director of the FBI, and John \nMcLaughlin, who is Acting Director of the CIA. This morning they held \nanother hearing with Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of \nHomeland Security Tom Ridge.\n  I mention all these hearings so my colleagues and the American people \nknow we are aggressively addressing these issues. We can expect more \nhearings to be held this week and in the weeks ahead, culminating in a \ndraft bill that will be marked up that week of September 20. The bill \nwill address the 9/11 Commission's key recommendations dealing with the \nestablishment of a national intelligence director--we are using that \nlittle acronym NID--as well as the creation of the National \nCounterterrorism Center, as well as the proposals of the reorganization \nof the executive branch.\n  The committee's bill will reflect the views and the input of a number \nof Senate committees and Members of Congress, as well as proposals that \nare put forth by the President and the White House.\n  I am confident that the Governmental Affairs Committee product will \nserve as a strong, comprehensive, and serious bill that will be the \nbaseline for our deliberations on the floor of the Senate on September \n27. There will be a continuation of hearings. The main action on the \nSenate floor will begin soon.\n  I do want to show my colleagues and the American people that the \nSenate is moving deliberately, quickly, and in this bipartisan manner \nto address these national security needs.\n  As I said at the outset, our highest responsibility is to the safety, \nthe security of the American people. We are working hard to meet that \nresponsibility to move America forward, and I am confident we will get \nthat job done. Over the course of this week, we will continue with the \nappropriations bills and, as I mentioned in my opening statement a few \nminutes ago, we are working out an agreement to address the next \nappropriations bill. Hopefully, we will be able to announce that either \nlater today or tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, before the majority leader \nleaves, I spoke with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee as he \nwas leaving the floor and inquired as to what he is anticipating. He \ntold me that he is anticipating there will be a House bill that would \nbe sent sometime today on emergency assistance for FEMA and, I assume, \nother agencies as well.\n  If that is the case, then that is new information, and we can proceed \non\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\nthat basis. That, in large part, is the commentary I am wanting to \nmake, having just come back from Florida, visiting a number of the \ndevastated areas. We will await the latest information on handling that \ninformation tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nFlorida for his leadership. We were on the floor talking last Tuesday \nand Wednesday and will continue talking every day about the real \ntragedy that has gone on with the people of Florida and that whole part \nof the world as a result of the assault by Mother Nature again and \nagain.\n  I pledge to him we will continue this dialog. He understands our \ncommitment from the leadership--Democrats and Republicans--to address \nthe issue of the flow of funds and that the resources necessary to \nrespond in a responsible and quick way are first and foremost and that \nwe will be right there and will continue to work over the course of \ntoday and will update each other as to the best, quickest, and most \nresponsible way to address the issue.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It does not look as though we are going to be \nspared the third one because the latest track, as of 11 this morning, \nnow has it moving back east, hitting the Florida coast somewhere around \nDestin and Fort Walton, whereas this morning's track had it going into \nsome place like Pensacola. The only good news is it is not coming back \nto that part of Florida where the two other hurricanes crisscrossed and \nhit the same area of central Florida. Of course, the last storm was so \nmassive that it virtually covered up the entire State, not only with \nthe deluge of rain but with whipping winds, so that its winds, albeit \nnot a category 4 like Charley was, nevertheless did a great deal of \ndamage.\n  As the majority leader exits, I am going to tick off a number of \nthose particular estimates. It is rather extraordinary. I thank the \nmajority leader for working with me on behalf of the people of Florida.\n  Mr. President, I have returned from Florida and I will tell my \ncolleagues about some of the devastation I have seen over the course of \nthis past weekend. Our folks are hurting and a number of their needs \nare unmet. As of this morning, some 8 to 9 days after the last \nhurricane, Frances--and, remember, we have been hit twice in a row, \nfirst with Charley and then with Frances--there are still about 350,000 \npeople in Florida without power.\n  Now, if one is a young person, such as a lot of our pages, they can \nmake do. But if one is a senior citizen and has special needs, \nparticularly with lifesaving equipment, and does not have any \nelectricity in the house, it is very difficult to be able to exist. \nThus, we have to take special-needs folks and put them in shelters and \nthen, if a shelter does not have electricity, provide by generators the \nelectricity in order to run the particular machines that are lifesaving \nmachines.\n  Of course, this is beginning to wear thin on a lot of our folks in \nFlorida and yet they have such an optimistic, can-do spirit. They are \ngoing about the process of rehabilitating themselves and repairing all \nof the damage and cleaning up from all of the destruction, but they are \nlooking forward to what the Federal Government does, one of its charter \nreasons for existing, and that is protecting its people in times of \ndisaster.\n  My colleagues heard my exchange with the majority leader on the \nnecessity for us to pass this special legislation because last week \nFEMA ran out of money. We had to pass a special $2 billion \nappropriation, but all of us knew that was not even going to take care \nof the expenses for FEMA for the first hurricane, which was Charley. So \nnow we have to have an additional package of at least $2.5 billion that \nincludes not only FEMA but also a host of other agencies, such as the \nDepartment of Agriculture; the Small Business Administration, which \noffers low-interest loans to businesses and individuals; the Department \nof Agriculture because we have extraordinary crop losses in Florida as \na result of these two hurricanes, the Department of Transportation for \nthe damage that has been done particularly to airports in Florida; for \nthe military, the damage that was done to Patrick Air Force Base, and \nNASA at the Kennedy Space Center, as well as the American Red Cross, \nand economic development funding.\n  There are news accounts going around right now about the President \nsending a disaster package requesting $2.5 billion, and that it may \ninclude FEMA, the Small Business Administration, and NASA. But what \nabout all the other agencies? Conspicuously absent is the Department of \nAgriculture. That is why I sent a letter to the President on Friday and \npointed out the Florida Department of Agriculture has estimated that \nFlorida agriculture itself suffered to the tune of $2 billion in losses \ndue to those two hurricanes.\n  For example, most people do not realize we have a huge nursery \nindustry in Florida. We have one of the biggest fern industries in the \nworld. Nurseries have suffered a half a billion dollars in damages. \nCitrus growers, a half a billion dollars in damages; sod producers, \n$300 million from the standing water.\n  You will have to excuse my raspy throat because, in and out of all of \nthe elements, the gremlins grabbed hold of my throat. But I am going to \ncroak it through so that people understand we really have some losses. \nCattlemen, $100 million; dairy producers, about $12 million; timber, \n$150 million. The need is great. It is in an industry, agriculture, \nthat is huge in Florida. It is a $62 billion-a-year industry in \nFlorida.\n  I mentioned the Federal Aviation Administration under the Department \nof Transportation. It estimates $64 million in losses, and that \nincludes about $50 million in losses to the Orlando International \nAirport. There is $12 million in losses, almost total, to the little \nCharlotte County Municipal Airport where it was ground zero and where \nthe Charlotte County Emergency Operations Center had the roof ripped \noff when Charley hit with 145-mile-an-hour winds.\n  Last week, I participated in a hearing with the NASA Administrator. \nThe highest winds, interestingly, were recorded in a gust at the \nKennedy Space Center, 120 miles an hour. This is from Frances, the \nsecond storm. They are estimating $100 million in damage. That took 900 \npanels off the big vehicle assembly building. Those panels are huge, 10 \nfeet high and about 4 feet wide. They are out, and there are 900 open \nwindows now into the vehicle assembly building where we assemble the \nstack of the space shuttle vertically. So that is another $100 million.\n  If you look back to Hurricane Andrew, its supplemental--which ended \nup costing over $6 billion for the Federal Government, and that was 12 \nyears ago; that was the monster hurricane--that even included $75 \nmillion for the Economic Development Administration, which had a lot of \nprojects, including dislocation caused by the hurricane and replacement \nof such things as sewer and water treatment facilities and the \nconstruction of a drainage system to deal with the flooding.\n  I mentioned Patrick Air Force Base, the military. It suffered. Also \nthe National Guard, the Navy, the Air Force, the Coast Guard--they all \nreport funding needs into the millions because of those storms.\n  I wanted to lay the predicate for this request when it comes over. \nWhen the White House sends their request, if it is $2.5 billion, it is \nnot going to start to cover all the things that are needed. If that is \nwhat comes to us with the House originating this legislation tonight, \nthen this Senator is not going to have any choice but to accept this so \nwe can go ahead and get something over to the White House to be signed \ninto law because of the many needs we have. Yet there is going to be \nmore to come in the future, and we will have to identify those. I want \nto make sure, in these requests that are made by the White House and \nthen in whatever the House passes tonight, that we do not forget these \nadditional needs such as Florida agriculture where the damage has been \nso significant.\n  That is my story. I am going to continue to tell this story like a \nbroken record. As I go home and I come back and I go home and I come \nback, I will continue to help out these folks who are suffering, these \nfolks who are so courageous in the midst of the utter devastation \naround them.\n  If two storms were not enough, we have another one coming. I was \nthinking over the course of the last 24 hours that we might be spared \nthis, that it\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\nmight inch on out there in its track to the west. It is now, as we \nspeak, starting to round the western end of Cuba, between the west end \nof Cuba and the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. But now the track, instead \nof sending it further west out of Florida, has it coming back.\n\n  I see my colleague from Florida, my distinguished senior Senator, is \nhere. Just to share with him the latest 11 o'clock advisory from this \nmorning, instead of coming in at Pensacola, it has now moved back east \nin the area of Destin, WaterColor, San Destin, that area. It doesn't \nlook like we are going to get spared the third hurricane.\n  My family has been in Florida 175 years. I know there have been times \nin that span of time where we have had back-to-back hurricanes, but not \nhurricanes of the magnitude of a category 4 and then a category 2, a \ncategory 2 that had gusts up to 120 miles an hour, which is category 3. \nBut never have I heard where we have had three major hurricanes in a \nrow all hitting the same State. Mind you, as Hurricane Ivan is rounding \nthe tip of western Cuba tonight, it is a category 5, and as it comes \naround Cuba, what does it hit? It hits the warm waters of the Gulf of \nMexico. Unless there is some shearing action at the top of the \nhurricane, it is even going to intensify more from the 160-mile-an-hour \nwinds it has right now. No State should have to suffer three big ones \nin a row, yet this is what we are facing.\n  I ask, I implore, I plead with my colleagues, don't hesitate a moment \nto help our people in Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9104-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, before I get into this \nhurricane discussion, my eye caught an Associated Press newswire out \nearly this morning. A Miami-Dade County police officer was shot several \ntimes after a driver she stopped fired nearly two dozen bullets at her \nwith an AK-47 assault rifle.\n  The assault rifle ban has been in effect for over a decade. According \nto the Department of Justice, it expired this past weekend and now AK-\n47s are allowed to be purchased under U.S. law.\n  My family has been in Florida 175 years. I grew up in the country. I \ngrew up on a ranch. I have hunted all my life. I have a son who is an \navid hunter. We enjoy the outdoors, but we do not hunt with AK-47s. AK-\n47s and assault rifles are for killing, not for hunting.\n  Why is it that law enforcement, at every level of government--\nFederal, State and local--is against terminating this law that \nprohibited the sale of assault rifles? Why is law enforcement opposed \nto the termination of this law? For exactly this reason: A Miami-Dade \nCounty police officer was shot two dozen times by an AK-47. I rest my \ncase, and I think it is a sad day that we could not reenact an \nextension of the law on the abolition of assault weapons, primarily for \nthe sake of law enforcement.\n  I am a defender of the constitutional right to bear arms.

Mr. President, on Saturday the Nation paused \nto observe the third anniversary of the horrible tragedy of September \n11, 2001. In the first hours and weeks after the attack on the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon, the Nation was shocked by what had been \nthe unthinkable--a terrorist plot carried out on the soil of the United \nStates of America.\n  We have seen grisly images of terrorism on our television screens \nfrom the Middle East, from Africa, from the Baltics, even from Great \nBritain. But now we have been hit here at home seemingly without \nwarning, without the chance to have prevented the loss of over 3,000 \ninnocent lives.\n  We now know that the terrorist attack of September 11 was the result \nof a sophisticated plot, a plot that developed over many months, a plot \nthat required the coordination among a number of individuals and we \nknow that had our national intelligence agencies been better organized \nand more focused on the problem of international terrorism this tragedy \nwould have been avoided.\n  Incredibly, it is now more than 3 years after that tragic event and \nthe basic problems in our national intelligence community that \ncontributed to our vulnerability on September 11, 2001, are now for the \nfirst time being seriously considered. Let me be clear.\n  These problems were not a mystery before September 11. Before \nSeptember 11, there had been a series of reviews of our national \nintelligence, reviews of our national intelligence in the context of \nterrorism and a series of very similar conforming recommendations. \nThese weaknesses that contributed to September 11 were well known. They \nwere well known by the administration and a majority in this Congress. \nWhat had occurred is that they had been essentially dismissed.\n  I am delighted that the good work of the 9/11 Commission has finally \nshaken the administration and my colleagues out of their lethargy.\n  In my last statement I identified five major problems and challenges \nof the U.S. intelligence community. Today I would like to suggest the \ndirection the reforms should take in response to each of these problems \nand challenges.\n  First, the failure to adapt to a changing adversary and a changing \nglobal environment.\n  In the final report of the congressional joint inquiry, we \noptimistically stated:\n\n       The cataclysmic events of September 11, 2001 provided a \n     unique and compelling mandate for strong leadership and \n     constructive changes throughout the intelligence community.\n\n  However, the record is that since September 11 the intelligence \ncommunity has been slow to accept the concept that a non-nation state \ncan challenge the United States of America. We are all familiar with \nthose scenes immediately after September 11 when the finger of \nresponsibility was pointed not at al-Qaida, not at the Taliban, not at \nthe place in which the terrorist plot had emerged but, rather, to Iraq \nbecause only a nation state could carry out a plot as complex and as \ndevastating as September 11. We have taken only first steps to \nunderstand the real enemy, international terror.\n  Satellites will not give us the understanding, the capability, nor \nthe intentions of Osama bin Laden. Yet the allocation of our \nintelligence resources continues to be dominated by the maintenance of \nthe cold war satellite architecture and the development of yet a new \ngeneration of satellite technology. The recruitment and training of \nhuman intelligence agents has accelerated but remains inadequate. A \nsense of urgency is required to dramatically increase the number of men \nand women in the intelligence agencies with the command of the \nlanguages and the cultures of the Middle East, Central Asia, and China. \nIn none of our intelligence agencies is this failure to transition to \nnew threats and to new demand more evident than in the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation.\n\n  The FBI is, first and foremost, a law enforcement agency and it \ndeserves its reputation as the best in the world. In that important \nresponsibility, the priorities and professional rewards are for \ninvestigating a crime after it has occurred, arresting the culprit, \nproviding the court admissible evidence to secure a conviction, and \nsending the criminal to jail. That is not the orientation of an \nintelligence agency. There the objective is to understand the threat \nbefore the act has occurred so the plot can be interdicted.\n  So what should we do? The United States can begin by learning a \nlesson from our foe.\n  Since our unfinished war in Afghanistan, al-Qaida has regrouped and \ndecentralized. It has established alliances with terrorist groups in \nover 60 countries. This may seem counterintuitive, but in public \nadministration there is\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nan admonition that in order to decentralize, an organization must first \ncentralize.\n  Since their inception, the intelligence agencies have focused on \ntheir specific assignments, such as the collection of communications or \nthe analysis of visual images.\n  As an example, the National Reconnaissance Office is paid to think \nabout the capabilities of the next generation of satellites, not \nwhether the relative importance of satellites in relation to human \nintelligence is declining. The larger realities--such as the changed \nnature of our enemies--go underattended. That is why the joint inquiry \nrecommended that we centralize greater control over the intelligence \nagencies in a director of national intelligence to ``make certain the \nentire U.S. intelligence community operates as a coherent whole.''\n  Once the agencies are retrieved into a coherent whole, I would then \nrecommend that they, as the combined military commands of Goldwater-\nNichols, be then decentralized around specific missions such as \ncountering global proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nterror.\n  This new architecture would itself be subject to constant change as \nold threats decline and go away and new ones emerge to replace them. \nSuch a structure would require constant attention to these questions: \nWho is the enemy today? Who is the enemy likely to be tomorrow? And \nwhat do we need to know in order to successfully confront this enemy?\n  A second reform designed to keep the intelligence community focused \non both today and tomorrow is to increase the linkages between the \nintelligence communities and other sources of information and analysis. \nThere have been some successful attempts to reach out to, for instance, \nacademic programs and private sector think tanks. These initiatives \nshould be expanded and integrated as a permanent component of the \nintelligence agency rather than an occasional effort.\n  I also believe the intelligence communities need to reach out to the \nconsumer. Just as in a commercial venture, where the needs and desires \nof the consumer drive the success of the provider, the intelligence \ncommunity should do likewise. What a difference it might have made if \nbefore September 11 someone had worked with the administrators of our \nmost vulnerable systems--airlines, seaports, power, and industrial \nplants--to understand their vulnerabilities and assess whether current \nintelligence would indicate the need for change in their traditional \nmeans of operation in order to harden them from terrorist attacks.\n  It was no mystery that terrorists were considering using commercial \nairlines as weapons of mass destruction. That had been discussed for \nthe better part of a decade. The problem was we did not connect that \ninformation with those who had a responsibility for the safety of \ncommercial airlines.\n  Finally, if we are to recentralize our intelligence agency so we can \nthen decentralize based on specific tasks, we need to change the \nposition of the Director of Central Intelligence. Since 1947, when the \nintelligence community of the United States was first established, the \nDirector of Central Intelligence has also been the head of the CIA. \nGiven the divergent responsibilities of both jobs, that needs to be \nchanged.\n  To give an analogy, we do not ask the Secretary of Defense to also be \nthe Secretary of the Army. Each job has its own special perspectives \nand responsibilities. Yet that is essentially what we are doing with a \nmerger of one of the intelligence operative agencies--the CIA--with the \nhead of the individual who is supposed to have a view across the entire \nintelligence community. The head of the central intelligence function \nis designed to be one who can make strategic decisions regardless of \nhow they affect the CIA or any other specific functional agency. It is \ntime, today, to apply the same rule we have applied since immediately \nafter World War II to our military, to our intelligence community.\n  A second failure of intelligence is the repeated instances in which \nthe intelligence community has failed to provide strategic \nintelligence. Our late colleague, Pat Moynihan, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows, used to have his seat in the back row, middle section of \nthe Chamber of the Senate. From there he often complained that while \nthe United States intelligence services can provide us with information \non how many telephones there were in the Kremlin and information on how \nmany sailors man the latest class of Soviet warships, the intelligence \ncommunity had not been able to figure out that the Soviet Union was on \nthe verge of collapse due to its weakening economy. Sometimes that kind \nof information gleaned both from publicly available sources and a \nknowledge of the country, rather than wiretaps and satellites, is the \nmost important information there is.\n  Senator Moynihan had a solution. He wanted to abolish the American \nintelligence agency. I believe the need to collect, analyze, integrate, \nand disseminate intelligence is too great. Instead, rather than \nabolition, we need a series of reforms designed to enhance the \ngathering of strategic intelligence. For starters, the President should \ndirect the next Director of Central Intelligence, whatever title he or \nshe might have, to expand the number and orientation of voices that \ncontribute to the intelligence process. The Bush administration has \nbeen accused--correctly, in my opinion--of practicing incestuous \namplification.\n  In other words, the only people who were at the table are people who \nhave the same point of view. Their views are then vetted through people \nwho again share the same beliefs. As a result, the original conclusion \nis not only validated, it is amplified. After the attacks of September \n11, the intelligence community was accused of failing to connect the \ndots. Incestuous amplification is unlikely to either connect the dots \nor expand the number of dots which are visible.\n\n  Two places to start this report would be the State Department and \nopenly available sources of information. Unfortunately, the State \nDepartment has been the orphan of this administration. This is a \nparticular shame, given the fact that the State Department has gotten \nit right more often than any other security agency.\n  From the beginning, the Secretary of State was skeptical of the \nstories coming out of Africa and Damascus about the status of Saddam \nHussein's restoration of his nuclear capabilities. Using information \nfrom our own sources as well as European allies, the State Department \nhad the best assessment of conditions in postwar Iraq. The intelligence \ncommunity needs to be more amenable to the use of open source \ninformation.\n  The percentage of information which we contributed to a wise ultimate \njudgment derived from open sources--such as journalists, regional \ntelevision and the Internet--is increasing. The duty of reading and \nassessing the significance of events reported openly in a foreign post \nis too often assigned to the newest, the least experienced intelligence \nofficer or Foreign Service officer. There are indicators, for example, \nthat press and television reports in the Middle East should have raised \nconcerns before September 11 that a tragedy in the homeland of the \nUnited States was in the making.\n  It is for that reason that the joint inquiry recommended that \n``Congress and the administration should ensure the full development \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security of an effective all-source \nterrorism information fusion center that will dramatically improve the \nfocus and quality of counter terrorism analysis and facilitate the \ntimely dissemination of relevant intelligence information both within \nand beyond the boundaries of the Intelligence Community.''\n  I wish to pause to give particular credit to those words and that \nwise policy to our colleague, Senator Richard Shelby. He served for an \nextended period of time as both chairman and vice chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee and throughout that period was particularly \nadamant in his support for integrating intelligence collection sources \nso that all could be taken into account with the wisest analysis and \nuse of intelligence.\n  This idea--the fusion center--was signed into law within the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. But what has happened since? What has \nhappened since is this very good idea has languished. The goal of the \nfusion center was not only to perform analysis that would fill the gap \nbetween foreign and domestic intelligence, but it also was\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\nto share information with State and local law enforcement and to access \ntheir capability. This is not happening.\n  The third failure is the failure to establish within the intelligence \ncommunity priorities and then deploy behind them. Rather than set up \nintelligence systems to validate convenient political notions, we need \na system that pursues mutually agreed upon intelligence priorities. To \nthat end, the President must assure that clear, consistent, and current \npolicies are established and enforced through the intelligence agency. \nThe President needs to charge the National Security Council with the \npreparation of a governmentwide strategy for combating terrorism at \nhome and abroad. It is an outrage that we are now more than 3 years \nfrom September 11 and we do not have a clear national strategy of how \nwe are going to eradicate international terrorists.\n  The restructuring of the intelligence community suggested above can \nsignificantly contribute to a more coherent set of intelligence \ninitiatives, but without leadership and commitment from the President, \nlittle progress will be made.\n  Fourth, the intelligence community has not implemented the policies \nnecessary to recruit, train, reward or sanction, maintain the talents, \nor diversify its human intelligence capabilities. The intelligence \ncommunity's current recruitment and training regime has been inadequate \nto overcome this handicap.\n  Of particular concern to me is the difficulty of receiving a security \nclearance for a first-generation American of Arabic ancestry. These \nyoung Americans, who have a heritage in the countries of the Middle \nEast and Central Asia, are most likely to have absorbed colloquial \nArabic, Farsi or Pashtun, at home, and could have the personal skills \nthat will increase their value as a case agent. Of course, they are \nlikely to have something else; that is, they are likely to have a \nfamily.\n  An intelligence security background check--an important part of \nassuring the patriotism of our intelligence community--includes \ninterviews with family members. And if those family members live in \nSyria, for example, it may be difficult or impossible to get a \nclearance. If one of the family members, even a distant one, has been \nin the service of that foreign government, the recruit is likely to be \nrejected, even though he or she may meet every standard of being a \npatriotic American. By failing to find ways to overcome this bias, we \nare denying ourselves the benefit of one of our Nation's greatest \nassets, our diversity.\n  Another frequently cited reason for difficulty of recruitment of \nintelligence officers is the mid-1950s culture of the intelligence \ncommunity. While most other aspects of our society have become \naccustomed to frequent turnover in careers--in fact, the average \nAmerican can anticipate working at seven or more distinctly different \njobs or places of employment throughout his or her worklife--\nintelligence agencies continue to seek to employ people who are \nprepared to make a lifetime commitment.\n  Our Joint Inquiry recommended a series of reforms to bring the human \ntalent in the community, which is in line with the current challenges, \nto the intelligence community. Those included a focus on bringing \nmidcareer professionals into the intelligence community, allowing for \nmore time-limited service for college graduates, finding ways to bring \nmore native language speakers into the intelligence agencies, and other \nefforts at diversification.\n  At this point, I commend the former Director of Central Intelligence, \nMr. George Tenet, for the work he has done to initiate these policies. \nI am pleased that the recently enacted Defense appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2005 includes seed money for the development of a reserve \nofficers training corps style program for the intelligence community at \nseveral universities, a recruitment and training program which will \nprovide financial aid in exchange for a commitment of service within \nthe intelligence community.\n  This could be a significant response to the need for proficiency in \nsome of the world's most difficult languages and least known cultures \nand histories. Having these students under supervision during their \ncollege careers would also facilitate the clearance of first-generation \nAmericans of Arab background into the intelligence services. And it \nwould have, as does the military reserve officers training corps, the \nfurther attribute of facilitating jointness; that is, the willingness \nof people to see the mission rather than stop their vision at the \nparticular agency at which they serve. Once these young people enter \ntheir respective intelligence agencies, many of them will have known \neach other during their shared preparatory experience and, therefore, \nwill be more likely to work effectively together.\n\n  The fifth failure is the failure to realize that many of the most \nimportant decisions made by the intelligence community that were \npreviously described as tactical have now become strategic.\n  There have been too many instances, most of which we cannot talk \nabout in open session, when mid-level bureaucrats in the intelligence \ncommunity have made decisions at a tactical level without a more \nstrategic view as to the implications of those decisions. These can be \nseemingly as simple as the rotation of surveillance aircraft or other \nmeans of surveillance which, when discovered, set off a diplomatic \nfirestorm with one of our friends or with one of our enemies.\n  The leadership of the intelligence community has a special \nresponsibility to determine if there is a full understanding of the \nimplications, rewards, and risks of an action. Review and ultimate \njudgment on tactical measures must be made by someone with the \nrequisite strategic vision and authority.\n  For that reason, and because of the significant confusion that the \nFISA process--the process by which a warrant was obtained to either \nplace a wiretap or review the effects of a foreign person--caused for \nthe FBI in seeking to investigate suspects prior to 9/11, it is \nimportant we reform the way the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \nis now taught and applied.\n  For example, the officials of our Government who are charged with \nmaking the ultimate decision on these warrants, the Attorney General \nand the Secretary of State or their delegates, must place the \nindividual application of such a warrant into the context of U.S. \nstrategic global interests.\n  There are areas where the Congress, through oversight, can and must \nplay a significant role. In a subsequent statement, I will review in \nmore detail the role of Congress in the oversight and direction of the \nintelligence community and some of the reforms that I suggest should be \nmade in order to more effectively carry out that responsibility.\n  America lost more than 3,000 of our people on September 11. But we \nlost something else. We lost our innocence. We can never bring back \nthose people we lost, nor will we ever restore America's innocence. \nWhat we can do is honor their memories. What we can do is learn from \ntheir loss by embarking on the road from innocence to wisdom.\n  Government must lead when the people hesitate. And the people must \nlead when our Government, as it has under our current President, \nfalters. Our safety and our future are too important to be left to \nchange. Luck may spare us. It will never protect us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, 3 days ago, a picture appeared in the \nMinneapolis-based Star Tribune newspaper, accompanying a Los Angeles \nTimes article whose headline read: ``U.S. Makes Show of Strength in \nFallujah.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DAYTON. The picture, for the record, showed about 30 Iraqi \ncivilians standing amidst the rubble of bombed buildings in the Iraqi \ntown of Fallujah. In the forefront of the picture were five Iraqi \nchildren, and the caption beneath the picture read:\n\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\n\n       An Iraqi boy weeps, as people survey the destruction in a \n     neighborhood, following a U.S. airstrike overnight. Twelve \nIraqis were killed, including several women and children. . . .\n\n  President Bush makes a show of strength, and an Iraqi boy weeps. I \nsay ``President Bush'' because this is not the U.S. military. They are \ncarrying out the orders of their Commander in Chief. This is not the \nAmerican people because the American people do not kill innocent women \nand children in another country. This is the result of and the \nresponsibility of a failed policy in Iraq by the President and his \nadministration.\n  There were at least two other aerial bombings that day in two other \nIraqi cities, according to that one story--more destruction, more \ncivilian casualties, more children weeping; children who lost brothers, \nsisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents, and friends; children who will \nhave the United States of America, for the rest of their lives, seared \ninto their memories; children who will, horribly, possibly cheer if \nterrorists can cause that kind of terrible destruction to Americans in \nAmerican cities; children who might even be willing to do something \nlike that themselves in revenge.\n  President Bush, Vice President Cheney, and other apologists for this \ncontinuing war in Iraq claim that they are fighting terrorists there so \nwe won't have to fight them here. By these actions, I maintain they are \ncreating terrorists in Iraq whom we will have to fight here, whom we \nwill have to defend against, fend off, and protect ourselves from for \nyears, even decades to come. How would we feel if our children or our \nfriends or our parents or wives or husbands were buried beneath the \nrubble that used to be our homes, our stores, and our neighborhoods?\n  I do not fault the courageous Americans in our Armed Forces who have \nborne the brunt of this administration's failed policy. To the \ncontrary, I salute them for their heroism and their patriotism. It has \nbeen over a year and a half since they won the initial military victory \nin Iraq. They went from the Iraqi border to Baghdad in 3 weeks. They \nrouted Saddam Hussein's army. They toppled his evil regime. And since \nthen, they have stood guard until someone began to run that country.\n  They are still standing guard, 138,000 brave Americans. They are \nfighting, they are bleeding, and they are dying because this \nadministration and their Iraqi allies have not figured out how to run \nthat country.\n  We need a policy, a plan, and a timetable to get out of Iraq--not to \nlose Iraq but to leave Iraq, not tomorrow or next week, unfortunately--\nbecause the Bush administration has failed. They have failed to prepare \nfor that. But not in 10 or 20 years, as my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, has predicted. He is not recommending \nthat course of action; he is just telling us and the American people \nthe truth. Thank goodness someone is telling us the truth, the truth \nabout what the Bush administration has gotten us into and where their \npresent policies will leave us.\n  What he can't tell us, because no one can, is how many more Americans \nwill die in Iraq during those 10 or 20 years; how many more Americans \nwill die elsewhere around the world or, God forbid, right in this very \ncountry because of the failures of those policies today.\n  Today I am asking the esteemed chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to hold oversight hearings this week on the current policy in \nIraq, on the military situation there, on the plans of this \nadministration, on the timetable for our continuing involvement there, \nand on the costs in dollars and lives and international esteem to the \nUnited States of America, because the American people deserve the \ntruth. This Congress deserves the facts. Our soldiers, our 138,000 \ncourageous Americans serving in Iraq today, deserve to come home with \ntheir military victory secured.\n\n  And I say to those who want to support our troops, if you want to \nsupport our troops, bring them home alive, bring them home alive now or \nas soon as possible hereafter, but not in 4 years or 10 years or 20 \nyears. Make the administration in Iraq and the people of Iraq \nresponsible for their own country. That is what democracy is about. It \nis about self-determination and self-responsibility. It is time the \npeople of Iraq become responsible for Iraq. It is time the 206,000 \nmilitia and military that we claim to have trained in Iraq become \nresponsible for Fallujah and Baghdad and everywhere else in Iraq.\n  The article I referred to earlier states: U.S. and Iraqi authorities \nlost control of Fallujah last April after they turned the city over to \na U.S.-sanctioned force, the Fallujah brigade, which has now all but \ndisappeared.\n  Where did they disappear to? I supported that action back then. I \nthought that was the right course of action, that we make Iraqis \nresponsible for the defense of their own country, for the security of \ntheir own cities. Now I learn, not through this administration's \ndisclosures but through an article appearing in an investigative \nstory--thank goodness for the free and vigilant press because we \nwouldn't learn those things here in Congress if we were waiting to be \ntold--that the Fallujah brigade has ``all but disappeared.''\n  That is a fundamental failure of this administration and the Iraqi \nadministration to train, equip, and motivate the Iraqi forces in Iraq \nto stand up for and defend their own country from whomever it is over \nthere--insurgents, terrorists, and citizens who want an end to the \nviolence, understandably so, in their own homes and neighborhoods.\n  It is time to put Iraq in charge of Iraq, make them stand up and \nfight for their own country, for their own cities, for their own \nsecurity, and stop forcing Americans on the ground or in the air to \ncause this kind of destruction that that picture capsulizes which is \ngoing to wreak future destruction on our own cities and our own people.\n  This is a failed policy. It is a disastrous policy. It is one for \nwhich this administration should take responsibility.\n  Again, I call upon the Armed Services Committee of the Senate to hold \noversight hearings and tell the American people the truth about what is \ngoing on there and what the future holds--in the near future, not the \nfuture future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Sept. 10, 2004]\n\n                U.S. Makes Show of Strength in Fallujah\n\n                       (By Patrick J. McDonnell)\n\n       Baghdad.--U.S. forces rolled into the rebel bastion of \n     Samarra on Thursday and sought to reestablish Iraqi \n     government control as aircraft pounded suspected guerrilla \n     positions in two other insurgent strongholds: the flashpoint \n     city of Fallujah in the west and the trouble spot of Tal Afar \n     in the north.\n       The show of strength--along with the stated U.S. resolve to \n     crush a Shiite Muslim militia in Baghdad--underscored the \n     military's determination to exert control over the country in \n     the months leading up to elections scheduled for January.\n       The U.S. move against the three insurgent centers came \n     after a spike in attacks this week that pushed American \n     military fatalities from all causes to more than 1,000. The \n     actions appeared designed to dispel the perception that \n     swaths of Iraq had become a ``no-go'' zone for U.S. troops.\n       American warplanes struck Fallujah, the third attack in as \n     many days against suspected insurgent positions in the city \n     30 miles west of Baghdad. U.S. and Iraqi authorities lost \n     control of Fallujah after U.S. Marines ended a three-week \n     siege last April and turned the city over to a U.S.-\n     sanctioned force, the Fallujah Brigade, which has now all but \n     disappeared.\n       Nine people, including two children, were reported killed \n     in a Fallujah house that the U.S. command suspected of being \n     used by allies of the Jordanian-born terror mastermind Abu \n     Musab al-Zarqawi.\n\n\n                            foreign fighters\n\n       On Thursday evening, a U.S. spokesman, Maj. Jay Antonelli, \n     revised the earlier description of events in Fallujah. ``In \n     spite of the great care taken to spare the lives of \n     noncombatants, an unknown number of Iraqi civilians were \n     unfortunately among those killed and wounded in the strike,'' \n     Antonelli said in an e-mail statement.\n       ``The foreign fighters who hide among the people of \n     Fallujah place them at significant risk,'' Antonelli said.\n       He added: ``Foreign fighters will not enjoy safe haven \n     anywhere in the city.''\n       In a separate statement, the U.S. command said military \n     operations around Tal Afar were designed to rid the city of \n     ``a large terrorist element that has displaced local Iraqi \n     security forces throughout the recent weeks.''\n       The U.S. military said 57 insurgents were killed in the \n     attack on Tal Afar, a northern city near the border with \n     Syria that lies on smuggling routes for weapons and foreign \n     fighters. The provincial health director, Dr. Rabie Yassin, \n     said 27 civilians were killed and 70 wounded. It was unclear \n     whether those reported by the Iraqis as civilians were \n     counted as insurgents by the Americans.\n       Meanwhile, relative calm held in much of the Shiite Muslim \n     heartland after an agreement negotiated last month by Iraq's \n     leading\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\n     Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Husseini al-Sistani. \n     The agreement brought an end to weeks of fighting between \n     U.S. troops and Shiite militiamen loyal to radical cleric \n     Muqtada al-Sadr.\n       Scattered clashes continued between Al-Sadr's loyalists and \n     American forces in the radical cleric's Baghdad stronghold, \n     Sadr City.\n       Iraqi officials want to prevent Al-Sadr from rebuilding his \n     forces in Najaf. Toward that end, dozens of Iraqi soldiers \n     and police raided Al-Sadr's Najaf office to search for \n     weapons. Al-Sadr was not there at the time, and no weapons \n     were found, although Iraqi officials said ammunition and \n     mortars were confiscated from nearby houses.\n       U.S. and Iraqi government troops are not in full control of \n     several cities and areas in Iraq, including Samarra in the \n     north, Fallujah and Ramadi in the west, and the largely \n     Shiite neighborhood known as Sadr City in eastern Baghdad, \n     where a militia holds sway. Other cities and towns, such as \n     Tal, have become guerrilla bastions where the U.S.-backed \n     Iraqi government exerts only limited control.\n       In Samarra, U.S. commanders said their forces, accompanied \n     by members of the Iraqi police and by national guard \n     soldiers, drove into the city Thursday morning after gaining \n     assurances from local Iraqi leaders that they would not be \n     fired on. The local leaders said they sensed divisions within \n     the insurgents' ranks between those who favored some \n     accommodation with the Americans and those who rejected it, \n     and felt secure enough to issue the temporary guarantee.\n       U.S. soldiers and the Iraqi police then convened a meeting \n     of the U.S.-backed council, which chose a new mayor and \n     police chief. After a few uneventful hours, the U.S. soldiers \n     and the Iraqi police left.\n       However, commanders acknowledge that as many as 500 \n     insurgents remain in Samarra. The guerrillas' preference is \n     to strike at smaller U.S. or Iraqi units. In classic \n     guerrilla style, they tend to hide their arms and blend in \n     among city residents when faced with larger forces.\n       The U.S. troops pulled out at the end of the day for lack \n     of a secure base to spend the night.\n       Maj. Neal O'Brien of the 1st Infantry Division, which \n     patrols four provinces north of Baghdad that includes \n     Samarra, said, ``We will never give up our right to maneuver \n     in any of our areas.''\n       The U.S. approach in Samarra since spring had been to allow \n     local leaders to work out a way to disarm or otherwise \n     neutralize a stubborn insurgent force that had disrupted \n     government and police activities in the ancient city of \n     200,000.\n       The largely Sunni Muslim population has long posed a major \n     challenge for U.S. forces. The city was the site of a large-\n     scale U.S. offensive last winter designed to flush out a \n     guerrilla force thought to be composed of religious \n     militants, anti-American nationalists and loyalists of Saddam \n     Hussein's former Baath Party. During that offensive, a U.S. \n     force of more than 3,000 soldiers also met little resistance \n     as the guerrillas apparently melted into the populace.\n       But in recent months, residents say, Samarra had fallen \n     back under insurgent control.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Kennedy, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Schumer, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3624.\n       On page 39, after line 5, insert the following:\n       Sec. 515. The amount appropriated by title III for the \n     Office of State and Local Government Coordination and \n     Preparedness under the heading ``firefighter assistance \n     grants'' is hereby increased to $900,000,000.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am going to speak about the compelling \nneeds that our local fire departments have.\n  All of us, over the weekend, went to events commemorating September \n11, 2001. We all spoke about how much we admired those men and women \nwho stood up to defend the Nation, including those very brave first \nresponders at the World Trade Center who dashed up over 75 floors in \nburning buildings to try to rescue people. They put themselves on the \nline, and many of them, as we know, perished on that horrible day.\n  Here in the Washington, DC area, as we know, the Pentagon was hit. We \nin Maryland had 60 Marylanders die that day. We had some die at the \nWorld Trade Center, but the majority were at the Pentagon. Some died on \nthe airplanes. We had people die on those airlines, including a flight \nattendant who gave her life and was one of the people who tried to deal \nwith the situation. We had others who died on those planes, such as a \nfamily who was leaving on a sabbatical--a husband and wife who were \nacademics, with their two children. Again, we had people die at the \nPentagon, such as one young man from Baltimore who was a financial \nanalyst over at the Pentagon. Of those from Maryland who died at the \nPentagon, 24 came from one county, Prince George's County. They were \nprimarily African-Americans who worked in this financial services area \nof the Pentagon. Imagine, 24 people, such as Odessa Morris who had just \ncelebrated her 25th anniversary; or Max Bielke, who had been in the \nmilitary and when he retired, he went back to work as a civilian \nemployee because he loved it. He was the last man to leave Vietnam. He \nstamped all the papers at our embassy there. He was the last soldier \nout of Vietnam. So we mourn that day.\n  At the same time, we were proud of the Maryland response. I was \nparticularly proud of the Chevy Chase rescue team. This is a volunteer \nfire department in Montgomery County that dashed across the Potomac \nunder the doctrine of mutual aid to provide firefighting assistance on \nthat horrible day, joining with our local fire departments from \nNorthern Virginia and Rescue One from Chevy Chase, and stayed on the \nscene in order to be able to quell the fires that continued to burn. \nThey were part of a FEMA search and rescue unit and they provided help. \nThey were the ones who brought in the dogs to look for survivors. They \nwere there night and day for several days and weeks.\n  I was very proud of the Chevy Chase fire fighters and of all our fire \ndepartments in Maryland who went up to the World Trade Center to dig in \nthe wreckage to see if they could find any survivors. We know the story \nabout what happened at the World Trade Center. Again, the Chevy Chase \nFire Department is a volunteer fire department. They serve their \ncommunity and country on their own time and their own dime. It cost the \nChevy Chase Fire Department over $300,000 to be able to be on the job. \nThey did it willingly, unstintingly. Yet at the same time, we know \nthose local fire departments cannot continue to function when we go on \nOrange Alert, and they continue on their own time and on their own \ndime.\n  One of the great things we created was the Fire Grant Program. The \nFire Grant Program was an invention before 9/11 of Senator Kit Bond and \nme as part of a FEMA reform package, along with Congressmen Hoyer and \nWeldon in the House. We did it in a bipartisan effort to make sure our \nfire departments--particularly our volunteer fire departments--had the \nright equipment they needed to protect the protector, and also the \nupdated technology to be able to protect us.\n  When we created that program as part of FEMA, well before September \n11, 2001, it was authorized at $300 million. At the same time, what we \nknow is that when we did that--after 9/11, the need was so compelling, \nworking, again, on a bipartisan, bicameral basis, we authorized a fire \ngrant program at $900 million. What else do we know? We know there is \ncompelling need. We know the fire administration, just in 2003, \nreceived almost 20,000 applications totaling $2.5 billion in funding \nrequests for local fire departments.\n\n  Imagine that. The fire administration received requests for $2.5 \nbillion.\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\nYet because of funding at around the $700 million level, they could \nonly fund 8,900 of those 20,000 requests. So we know the need is in the \nbillions. We know we are authorized at the $900 million level.\n  What my amendment will do, when I have the opportunity to offer it, \nis raise funding for fire grants to the authorized level of $900 \nmillion. Why do we want to do that? We are facing new threats every \nday. Just over a month ago, when the administration raised the terror \nalert to Orange for the communities of Washington, New York, and New \nJersey, we knew what the needs really were.\n  The bill we are considering today actually has funding at $700 \nmillion. I know on Friday an amendment offered by the Republican \nleader, the majority leader, Senator Frist, actually increased it by \n$50 million. I will be offering an amendment at an appropriate time to \nraise it $150 million so that we can bring it up to the authorized \nlevel of $900 million.\n  What would this additional $150 million mean? It would mean \nprotective gear for 150,000 firefighters. It means local fire \ndepartments could buy 500 new fire trucks. It means they could buy 300 \nnew rescue vehicles. But this is not about protective gear and fire \ntrucks; it is about the tools our firefighters need.\n  First of all, they need the equipment to protect themselves, such as \nbreathing equipment and fire retardation gear. We need to protect the \nprotectors so they can protect us. Then, at the same time, they need \nother technology. What we also know is that this program gives us \ndouble value. If our first responders have the right equipment, they \nare ready to respond against not only a terrorist attack, but anything \nelse that may happen to a community.\n  During those hurricanes that have been whipping Florida, we have had \nour first responders there, and they have the right equipment, as well \nas the radio equipment, to respond.\n  It also means the kind of equipment that we need not only when the \nChevy Chase Fire and Rescue Department dashes across the Potomac but \nwhat they need if something happens on the beltway.\n  We in Baltimore had a terrible tanker explosion on I-95. Because our \nfirefighters were prepared, they could deal with the hazmat situation. \nI could give a number of examples.\n  This is not just Barbara Mikulski speaking. The Council on Foreign \nRelations, chaired by our former colleague, Senator Rudman--and we know \nthe independence he has--issued an independent report last year. We \nalso know he was the author of many balanced budget amendments. So we \nknow he approaches it with Yankee common sense and the frugality for \nwhich he is very well known. So we have Senator Rudman, an independent \npersonality, one who has always been frugal from a budget standpoint, \nand yet he is recommending more money.\n  What did the report show? That the United States remains ill prepared \nfor a catastrophic attack; that fire departments across the country \nhave only enough radios to equip half the firefighters on a shift; \nbreathing apparatus for just one-third of our firefighters; and that \nonly 10 percent of fire departments have the equipment to respond to a \nbuilding collapse. That is the Rudman report.\n  Then Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Fire \nProtection Association also did a study called ``A Needs Assessment of \nthe U.S. Fire Service.'' They found that 57,000 firefighters lacked the \nprotective clothing they needed to protect themselves to protect us.\n  In Maryland alone, it would take $52 million to replace protective \ngear for all of our firefighters. This is what we are talking about.\n  We do not want to just throw money at problems. We believe the fire \ngrant is a model program because we refuse to earmark the grants. They \nare subject to peer review, so they are given on the basis of priority \nand merit. We know what our shortcomings are, and these various reports \ndocument them.\n  We talked about how last year there were 20,000 applicants and $2.5 \nbillion worth of requests. That speaks for itself. We have double value \nfor this spending, not only for response to terrorist attacks but \nagainst all hazards, whether it is hurricanes, tornadoes, or the \nwildfires that hit the West. We need to be able to protect the local \nfire departments.\n  Mr. President, you know how expensive this equipment can be. You \ncannot do this on bingos and fish fries. They need the U.S. Government \nto stand behind them to do that.\n  There are over a million firefighters in the United States, of which \nthere are 750,000 volunteers. Isn't that terrific? They really do save \nlives; they save homes; they save communities. We need to save them and \nto help them. They do not know what they are going to face when they \nenter a house to save a child trapped on the second floor. They may put \nout the flames in a factory that contains toxic chemicals. They are the \nfirst on the scene at any disaster. Firefighters are our protectors. \nMany are volunteers who work three shifts: one on a regular job, one \nwith their families, and then another shift at the fire department. As \nI said, they cannot also then be expected to raise the money through \ncharity, tip jars, and bingo. Of course they can do that because we \nalways want local community support, but the equipment and gear they \nneed is very expensive. A new fire engine costs $300,000. A new rescue \nvehicle costs $500,000. Self-contained breathing apparatus costs \n$6,000.\n  Mr. President, you know how expensive it is. The Fire Grant Program \nis working. In my own community, the Forestville fire department, \nlocated in Prince George's County, was awarded funds for a new hydrant \ntanker. Why is that so important? The last one contained just a couple \nof hundred gallons, where this one is over 2,500. This is right next \ndoor to Andrews Air Force Base. Any attack on the United States would \nmean they would have to respond under doctrine of mutual aid.\n\n  It is the same with the Kensington volunteer fire department in \nMontgomery County. We replaced a pumper truck that is dated to 1979. I \ncould go all around the State of Maryland.\n  The amendment speaks for itself. Senator Cochran still is not here. I \nam sure the Senator is tied up. We have worked together on many \noccasions.\n  First, I really have enjoyed working with him on appropriations, on \nnational security issues. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security, it has been a delight to work with him.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. What it does is raise the Fire \nGrant program to its fully authorized level of $900 million.\n  As I have stated, the amendment speaks for itself. It increases the \nmoney to $900 million, the authorized level. We believe the amendment \nis warranted because, as I have said, the Fire Administration received \nrequests totaling $2.5 billion, and since we cannot fund it at $2.5 \nbillion, I believe we need to take this important step and fund it at \nthe $900 million level.\n  The amendment speaks for itself. I now turn to the Democratic whip \nand ask him how should we proceed? I would like to offer my amendment. \nI would like to get a vote on my amendment. Should I ask for the yeas \nand nays now?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland, we have a number of votes we are going to try to \nget lined up for later this evening. It is my suggestion that the \nSenator ask for the yeas and nays, and then at a subsequent time, we \nwill figure out when we are going to vote on it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to the Presiding Officer, to \nSenator Cochran, and to the whip, I would like to work with them in a \nway that would create the orderly disposition of my amendment.\n  I will withhold any rights to seek the yeas and nays. Is that an \nappropriate request?\n  Mr. REID. That is appropriate\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I am wondering if the Senator from Massachusetts would \nwithhold his recognition, following a very brief statement by the \nSenator from Nebraska who wishes to offer an amendment and then speak. \nIt should take just a few minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the Senator \nfrom Nebraska, the Senator from Massachusetts regain the floor.\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3625\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, the pending \namendment is laid aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3625.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To maintain the State Homeland Security Grant Program at the \n                    fiscal year 2004 funding level)\n\n       On page 19, line 17, strike ``$2,845,081,000'' and all that \n     follows through line 22, and insert the following: \n     ``$3,605,081,000, which shall be allocated as follows:\n       ``(1) $1,700,000,000 for formula-based grants, $400,000,000 \n     for law enforcement terrorism prevention grants, and \n     $30,000,000 for Citizen Corps grants pursuant to section 1014 \n     of the USA PATRIOT ACT (42 U.S.C. 3714): Provided, That''.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank the minority assistant leader and my \nfriend from Massachusetts for this courtesy to have this opportunity to \nspeak for a few minutes about the first responder issue, as it relates \nto legislation before us today.\n  Since September 11, States and communities of all sizes have made \ngreat strides in preparing for another possible terrorist attack. Based \non the National Strategy for Homeland Security's principle of shared \nresponsibility, Federal, State, and local governments, together with \nthe private sector and the American people, have worked in partnership \nto ensure that our first responders are well equipped and well trained. \nStates and local governments are responsible for preparing and \nimplementing multi-year plans to ensure our Nation's first responders \nreceive the equipment and training they require so that we are not only \nsecuring our homeland, but we are actually secure in each of our \nhometowns.\n  The Senate's Homeland Security appropriations bill, S. 2537, slashes \nthe primary first responder program by 45 percent, or $760 million. My \namendment would restore this funding back to the fiscal year 2004 total \nof $1.7 billion. Called the State Homeland Security Grant Program, this \nis the primary source of coordinated funding for first responders. \nSHSGP, as it is referred to, allows States and local governments to \nbuild and maintain a base capacity by funding essential prevention, \npreparedness, response, and recovery capabilities within the State and \nacross regional boundaries. Eligible uses include equipment, training, \nand exercises necessary to ensure our first responders are prepared and \nthat both urban and rural critical infrastructure is protected, \nsomething I am sure the Presiding Officer is interested in, coming from \nthe neighboring State of Wyoming.\n  At least 80 percent of SHSGP is passed through to those who protect \nour hometowns: firefighters, police, EMTs, and other local emergency \nmanagers across the country. Nearly every State, even those that get \nadditional money from the Urban Areas Security Initiative, UASI, will \nsuffer a net loss in fiscal year 2004 under the Senate bill. Nearly \nhalf of all those States will see their efforts cut almost in half.\n  Funding cuts of this magnitude will mean that private/public \npartnerships will have to be dismantled, and countless hours of \nplanning, training, and exercise will have to be retooled. Regional \nalliances will fall dormant. Training classes and exercises will be \ncancelled, and equipment purchases will be put on hold. In short, \nhometown security will suffer immeasurably.\n  The citizens of America expect that everything possible is being done \nto prevent another terrorist attack, and they expect that if another \ntragedy were to occur, the response and recovery will be immediate, \nwell coordinated, and well trained. This vital work takes dedicated \nprofessionals executing well-rehearsed plans.\n  I have watched the vote counts on other amendments to this bill, and \nunfortunately it is clear that this amendment will not pass. This is \nextremely disappointing. It is disappointing to me and should be to all \nrural areas. Because I realize this will fall short of the required 60 \nvotes, for the sake of time I will not force a vote on my amendment, \nbut I do hope that as debate on funding for this important program \nproceeds, that everyone will come to the same conclusion I have: These \nfunding cuts will undermine regional efforts and harm every State's \nability to protect both its urban and rural critical infrastructure. \nWhether it is the protection of an urban shopping mall or the \nprevention of a rural bioterrorism incident that affects our food and \nwater supply, critical infrastructures in every State must be \nprotected.\n  If our goal is to make sure our homeland and hometown security is as \nstrong as the weakest link, we must ensure that every link is strong \nand that there is no weak link in our protection. That includes food \nand local areas, as well as urban and populated areas. All must be \nprotected.\n\n  I will make one further point on this subject. It is my understanding \nthat an amendment may be offered that affects the funding formula for \nthe State homeland security grant program. Currently, 38 percent of \nSHSGP funds are dispersed based upon a minimum funding formula, and the \nremaining 62 percent are dispersed to states based upon population. As \nI understand it, the amendment that may be offered would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to change the 62 percent portion of the \nfunds from a population based formula into a high threat and population \ndensity formula.\n  As someone who comes from a rural State, I plan to oppose this \namendment and hope that my colleagues from smaller States and rural \nareas will do the same.\n  The proposed funding formula would have the effect of shifting a lot \nof the current funding from the smaller states and sending it to our \nlargest States that meet loosely defined criteria such as threat, \nvulnerability, and the presence of critical infrastructure.\n  I wholeheartedly support funding for the first responder efforts in \nour major metropolitan areas, which is why I strongly support the \ncurrent Urban Area Security Initiative program, which sends extra \nfunding to these large areas. But I do not support paying for these \nprograms by shifting funds away from our rural, less-populated states.\n  Nebraska would lose $8 million under this proposed formula. I can't \ntell you how critical that is to a state like Nebraska and to all the \ncommunities in Nebraska that are trying to follow through on the \npreparedness plans the Department of Homeland Security asked them to \nimplement. And a shift in formula like this one would pull the rug out \nfrom under them.\n  One needs to only look at the most recent terrorist attack in Russia \nand see that this attack was in a school in a rural area, and it is \neasy to understand that we must not be lulled into thinking that the \nrural areas are not going to be affected by any kind of terrorist \nactivity.\n  Our country is only as safe as our weakest vulnerability. The State \nHomeland Security Grant Program has already been cut by 45 percent in \nthis bill. Shifting funds away from our less populated states will \nfurther exacerbate the problem. We need to make sure every part of the \ncountry is prepared, regardless of location.\n  I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his courtesy, and I yield \nthe floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3625, Withdrawn\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3626\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nthat it be counted under the agreement toward one of Senator Murray's \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3626.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the President to provide to Congress a copy of the \nScowcroft Commission report on improving the capabilities of the United \n                     States intelligence community)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 515. (a) Not later than 15 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a copy of \n     the Scowcroft Commission report to Congress.\n       (b) The report required under subsection (a) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (c) In this section, the term ``Scowcroft Commission \n     report'' means the report on improving the capabilities of \n     the United States intelligence community that was prepared by \n     the presidential commission appointed pursuant to National \n     Security Presidential Directive 5 (May 9, 2001) and chaired \n     by General Brent Scowcroft and that was submitted to the \n     President in or around December 2001.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I acknowledge and thank the leadership of \nthe other side for their cooperation in working through this particular \nsituation.\n  This amendment will require the President to give Congress a copy of \nthe December 2001 Scowcroft Commission report on intelligence reform. A \nclassified annex could be provided is necessary, although some of those \nwho have seen the report say that it contains very little that would be \nharmful to National security. What is harmful to our security is the \ncontinuing refusal by the Bush administration to make the report \npublic.\n  As my colleagues know, General Brent Scowcroft had a distinguished \nmilitary career and served as the National Security Adviser to the \nfirst President Bush. Because of his broad experience with intelligence \nand his widely respected intellect and insights, the current President \nBush appointed him as chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence \nAdvisory Board.\n  In National Security Presidential Directive 5, in May 2001, President \nBush ordered a review of U.S. intelligence to ensure that U.S. \nintelligence capabilities are well designed to deal with that wide \nrange of critical challenges facing the Nation. General Scowcroft was \nnamed to lead a commission to provide recommendations on intelligence \nreform as a result of that directive.\n  However, the report of the Scowcroft Commission, which was submitted \n3 months after 9/11, continues to be classified, despite repeated \nrequests from the Congress to release it.\n  On July 21 this year an article by Shaun Waterman of United Press \nInternational, discussing the Scowcroft recommendations was published. \nAs the article stated:\n\n       Scowcroft's report, which remains classified, proposed \n     giving the existing CIA Director budget, administrative and \n     hire/fire control over the three largest and most expensive \n     agencies, according to former Office of Management and Budget \n     National Security Chief Richard Stubbings. The National \n     Security Agency, which intercepts phone calls, faxes, emails \n     and the like; the National Reconnaissance Office, which \n     designs, builds and maintains spy satellites; and the \n     National Geo-Spatial Intelligence Agency, which analyzes spy \n     satellite photos, would all be taken out of the Pentagon's \n     control and transferred--along with parts of the FBI--to the \n     control of a modified director post.\n\n  That is the end of that report.\n  Obviously these reformed submitted in December 2001, are very similar \nto the reforms proposed by the 9/11 Commission in the summer of 2004. \nIn fact, similar proposals on intelligence reform have been made for \nalmost 50 years.\n  In 1955, a commission led by Herbert Hoover recommended splitting off \nCIA management duties so that the Director of Central Intelligence \ncould focus on coordinating the entire intelligence community.\n  In 1976, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence led by Frank \nChurch recommended giving the Director control over intelligence \nbudgets and relieving him of day-to-day CIA management \nresponsibilities.\n  in 1976, former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford recommended \nestablishing a National intelligence director.\n  In 1985, Admiral Stansfield Turner recommended establishing a \nNational intelligence director to oversee the entire intelligence \ncommunity, with the CIA Director managing only the CIA.\n  Despite these and other recommendations, needed intelligence reforms \nwere never enacted.\n  The 9/11 Commissioners were given a copy of the Scowcroft \nrecommendations as background for their work, and the final report from \nthe Commission drew significantly from his recommendations.\n  Governor Thomas Kean, Chairman of the 9/11 Commission, made this \npoint clearly at a Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing last \nTuesday. He said:\n\n       And a number of the recommendations we've made have \n     synthesized things from people like Scowcroft and a number of \n     others who have made similar recommendations. And those \n     recommendations have not been implemented.\n\n  Clearly, before we act on intelligence reform later this month, \nCongress should have benefit of General Scowcroft's recommendations as \nwell. Congress faces a major task in reorganizing the intelligence \ncommunity, at this time when the threats against our Nation are new and \ndifferent. We must have the best information, advice and wisdom on this \nchallenge, including a copy of the Scowcroft Commission report.\n  General Scowcroft, I am told, will be talking to Members of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee this week in closed session about the \nreport. But the meeting is for committee members only, is classified, \nand is off-the-record. I understand that none of the committee members \nwill be permitted to read the report.\n  Frankly, that is ridiculous. Every Member of Congress has an interest \nin being well-informed before voting on intelligence reform. Every \nAmerican has an interest too. The 9/11 Commission's report and its 41 \nrecommendations are not classified, and General Scowcroft's should not \nbe classified either.\n  Congress should not be forced to rely on sketchy press reports for \ninformation on an issue with such important consequences for our \nNational security and our ability too fight the al-Qaida terrorists. It \nis irresponsible for the administration to keep Congress in the dark.\n  We hope to complete action on legislation to implement the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations before we adjourn. Given the enormous stakes \nfor our Nation, it is unconscionable that the President has not already \nmade an unclassified copy of the Scowcroft report available to us.\n  There is bipartisan support for release of the Scowcroft Commission \nreport and recommendations. In July, the Democratic leader asked the \nPresident to declassify the report. During an August 16 Senate Armed \nServices Committees hearing on the 9/11 Commission recommendations, \nSenator Warner, our distinguished Chairman, indicated that the Congress \nshould have the report. He said:\n\n       For the record, the Scowcroft Commission report has not \n     been released by the White House. So there has been some \n     public discussion of its major points, so we're going to look \n     into seeing whether or not we can have greater access to it.\n\n  Senator Roberts, the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, also \nseeks the Scowcroft Commission report. At the same hearing, he said:\n\n       I just had a talk with Brent Scowcroft last Thursday, and \n     even at my age, I begged him on hands and knee to release the \n     report to the Intelligence Committee and to the Armed \n     Services Committee.\n\n  At our August 17 hearing, Senator Roberts said he agreed that ``it \nwould be very helpful'' if the Scowcroft recommendations were released.\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has also indicated that he can't \nsee any reason why the Scowcroft Report should not be declassified. \nWhen he testified in the Senate Armed Services Committee last month, he \nsaid:\n\n       I've been briefed on the Scowcroft Commission report. I \n     don't see any reason why there shouldn't be a process going \n     through and see what portion of it can be declassified. I \n     don't know who classified it in the first place. It wasn't \n     the Department of Defense, to my knowledge. . . .\n\n  Why does the administration refuse to declassify the report and make \nit available to Congress? Why would the\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nadministration knowingly put the Congress in the position of acting on \nan intelligence reform proposal with enormous consequences for our \nNational security, without having an unclassified copy of this crucial \nreport?\n  The obvious reason is that the administration is desperate to avoid \nembarrassment about the President's mishandling of intelligence reform.\n  The Scowcroft report and recommendations are nearly 3 years old. They \nwere submitted to President Bush in December 2001--just 3 months after \nthe devastating attacks on September 11. Now, finally, we are about to \nenact long-overdue reforms to enable our intelligence community to deal \nmore effectively with terrorist threats and other threats to our \nsecurity.\n  The President needs to come clean. He should release a declassified \ncopy of the report to the Congress so we can act responsibly on \nintelligence reform. The American people can decide for themselves \nwhether the President has dragged his feet on intelligence reform for \nnearly 3 years, despite his current rhetoric about the need for change.\n  I urge the President to declassify the Scowcroft Commission report \nimmediately, and that is what my amendment would do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we appreciate very much the Senator's \namendment and discussion of the Scowcroft Commission report and whether \nthe contents of that report should be declassified. That is, as I \nunderstand it, the purpose of the amendment, to make that information \npublic.\n  What I hope we can do in the consideration of this appropriations \nbill is to keep our attention focused on the funding of the Department \nof Homeland Security activities. That is the purpose of this \nappropriations bill. We have worked very hard with colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee to identify priorities. We fully considered \nthe President's budget request on issues surrounding funding levels. We \nknow we do not have unlimited budget authority. We are limited by an \nallocation from the full Committee on Appropriations in the Senate.\n  I hope we defer this issue to the consideration of the authorizing \ncommittee. The Intelligence Committee has this issue under review. As a \nmatter of fact, this issue has already been raised, as I understand it, \nin hearings that are being held in consideration of the so-called 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. We have had that report before the Senate. \nThere are a number of other committees looking into these issues.\n  But the Appropriations Committee is trying to get funds approved by \nthe Congress to fund the Department of Homeland Security needs for this \nnext fiscal year beginning October 1.\n  I don't know whether the Senator wants a vote on his amendment, or \nmaybe at the appropriate time after other Senators have had an \nopportunity to discuss their views, if they so choose, we could move to \ntable the amendment. That would be my suggestion, that we remove that \namendment from this bill and let it be handled by some other committee.\n  I am sympathetic with the concerns the Senator has expressed, but I \nreally do not think we ought to convert the consideration of an \nappropriations bill into consideration of whether to declassify or not \nthe Scowcroft Commission report. That is my reaction to the amendment. \nI hope the Senate will consider our views.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to respond?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think the Senator is quite correct in \nterms of understanding that with an appropriations bill there are rules \nabout whether we have legislation, et cetera, on appropriations, and \nthat is done for good reason. The Senator has outlined some thoughts. \nThe authorization, as the Senator knows, has already been passed and is \nnow in conference.\n  Let me mention this point, because we looked very carefully at this \nissue.\n  The Scowcroft Commission deals with the amendment. There is the \nrequirement that all amendments be related to the text of homeland \nsecurity. The Scowcroft Commission report deals with collection, \nanalysis, and dissemination of intelligence. The Department of Homeland \nSecurity plays an important role in these matters, and the Office of \nthe Under Secretary for Information, Analysis and Infrastructure \nProtection is funded in this bill. On page 74, it says it is \nresponsible for collecting and disseminating terrorist threat \ninformation, fusing and integrating data with foreign intelligence to \nproduce a comprehensive picture of threat, and developing and \nimplementing an action plan to mitigate terrorist threats and national \nvulnerabilities. The Scowcroft report addresses issues that would have \na substantial impact on the way this office and all intelligence \nofficials at the Department of Homeland Security conduct their work, \nand the quality of intelligence to a large extent determines whether \nthe Department of Homeland Security is able to perform its mission and \nprotect the public from future terrorists.\n  On page 29 of the bill, $157 million is provided for intelligence \nfunctions in the Office of Director of Information, Analysis and \nInfrastructure in the Department of Homeland Security.\n  Then section 504 of the bill specifically provides funds made \navailable by this act for intelligence activities are determined to be \nspecifically authorized by the Congress.\n  This is legislative language authorizing the operation of a portion \nof the intelligence community.\n  I want to say to the Senator that we thought long and hard about the \nappropriateness of this amendment. Reading through the legislation \nitself, it appeared these matters were directly in line with a number \nof at least some portions of the Scowcroft Commission report. \nParticularly since we have such a sense of urgency in ensuring that we \nare going to try to get it right with the recommendations of the 9/11 \nCommission and the Scowcroft report, given the fact, as I mentioned \nearlier, that Secretary Rumsfeld, Chairman Warner, Chairman Roberts all \nindicated they thought it would be of use and value, it seemed to me \nthis could be something we can all get behind and support.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his further \ncomments to the Senate.\n  I also at this time would like to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest which I understand has been cleared on both sides of the aisle. \nThe distinguished leader from Nevada is here on the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the vote in \nrelation to the Schumer amendment this evening, the Senate proceed to a \nvote in relation to the Lautenberg amendment No. 3617; provided further \nthat no amendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote. \nFinally, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for debate prior to each vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding the \nfirst vote will occur at 5:30 or 5:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 5:30.\n  Mr. REID. And it is my further understanding there has been consent \nentered that Senator Schumer could modify his amendment; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That modification is at the desk and I ask it be brought \nforward in compliance with the unanimous consent request made by the \nSenator from Mississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the request of the \nSenator from Mississippi?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, thank you.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad pertaining to the submission of S. Con.\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\nRes. 136 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent \nand Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CONRAD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been here with Senator Byrd and \nSenator Cochran trying to move this most important bill along. We \nlearned over the weekend that developments had occurred and that we \nwould not even ask for a filing deadline for tonight. That was the \noriginal plan. Senators who wished to offer amendments would have had \nto file, say, at 5 o'clock tonight. That being the case, we would have \nprobably had maybe a dozen amendments, and we could finish those \ntomorrow. It may have taken a while, but we could have finished them \nwith a good hard day's work tomorrow.\n  We have been told now we have another supplemental for Florida coming \nalong, and some people on the majority side want to include that in \nthis bill. I think that is a real mistake. I want to do everything that \nI can to help the people of Florida; they have been through a lot. That \nhas not ended yet, as you know, with Hurricane Ivan approaching, which \nmay hit Florida again.\n  We can finish this Homeland Security appropriations bill. I think \nthat would be a real important thing to do before we leave for the \nJewish holiday. I think if we try to include the supplemental \nappropriations bill as part of this, it is going to make it difficult, \nif not impossible, to finish because we have been told by Senator \nNelson of Florida and by other Senators who are interested in what is \ngoing on in the farm country around the United States that on the next \nbill that comes, there is going to be an amendment on that, and there \nwill be significant amendments that will require debate and a lot of \nmoney.\n  I am not a visionary, by any means, but having been on the Senate \nfloor a lot, I believe it will be difficult, if not impossible, to \nfinish the bill--certainly not tomorrow night. It will spill over into \nWednesday. We will not finish by 11 o'clock, or whatever time the \nleader wants to finish to allow people to go west for the holiday.\n  So I ask respectfully that the majority take another look at this, \nand let's have a filing deadline quickly and finish this bill tomorrow. \nI know the majority wants to get as much work done as possible, and I \nrespect that. We have been really good on these bills. We have been \nsticking to what we believe is the important work of the country, this \nHomeland Security bill. We entered into an agreement that we would only \noffer related amendments, and we stuck by that. We have so little time \nto do so much.\n  I think if we went ahead and did this emergency supplemental, it \nwould be much easier to do that as a standalone vehicle, not tie it \ninto this because it will wind up hurting both vehicles. That is a real \nmistake. I am willing to work with the body to determine what is best \nfor the country, but I suggest it is not going to be a different \ncountry to have this Homeland Security appropriations bill not \ncompleted.\n  Senators Cochran and Byrd are two of the most experienced and wise \npeople we have in the entire Senate. I think it complicates their job \nsignificantly to try to change the context of this bill from a homeland \nsecurity bill to one that deals with a hurricane that occurred in \nFlorida, and another hurricane that occurred in Florida, and maybe \nanother one that will occur in Florida. I don't think the two matters \nare related. Again, I respectfully suggest that the majority take \nanother look at this and see what we can do to separate the issues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3615, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment I have at the desk be modified by language that is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 13, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n\n                         Ground Transportation\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Transportation Security \n     Administration to support efforts for identification and \n     tracking for shipments of hazardous materials and continue \n     and expand upon the background check system for commercial \n     driver licenses with a HAZMAT endorsement, $70,000,000: \n     Provided, That the amount appropriated under title I for the \n     Human Resources Account of the Office of the Under Secretary \n     for Management shall be reduced by $70,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, at 5:30, we are going to be voting in the \nSenate on a motion to table the Schumer amendment. The Senator \ndescribed his amendment recently and talked about the fact that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security has not done anything, essentially, to \nprotect against the explosives or other dangers occurring when trucks \nwith hazardous material are driven throughout the country, and that an \nadditional $70 million, I think, is the total amount of new money to be \nadded to this bill for this purpose.\n  It is described in the Senator's amendment as a tracking system for \nhazardous material trucks, hazmat trucks, and a background check system \nfor commercial drivers' licenses.\n  I am suggesting to the Senate that this is an additional $70 million \nthat cannot be efficiently used for this purpose in 1 fiscal year, and \nI am going to tell you why.\n  The Appropriations Committee has already provided funding for a \nnumber of different programs designed to accomplish the goals that the \nSenator has described in his comments about and his description of his \namendment when he previously offered it.\n  Last year, in fiscal year 2004, Congress appropriated $9.4 million \nfor an effort to develop a high-explosive countermeasure system in the \nScience and Technology Directorate. Research is being undertaken and a \nprogram that will follow on is funded at $33.590 million to provide \ntechnologies and programs that would interdict explosive attacks \nagainst buildings from all modes of transportation, including trucking. \nIt is also designed to protect critical infrastructure and the Nation's \ncivilian population. This is an increase of $23.89 million from the \nbudget request submitted by the administration.\n  We have tried to communicate with the Transportation Security \nAdministration and other agencies of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to see what funds could be utilized to help make this the most \nsophisticated and effective system available to the American public in \nprotecting buildings, protecting civilian populations, protecting the \ntrucking systems and the infrastructure of our country against problems \nof vehicle bombs, problems of hazardous materials being confiscated and \nconverted into explosives to damage infrastructure: highways, tunnels, \nbridges, buildings, and the like.\n  So the Homeland Security Advanced Research Project Agency is issuing \na broad agency announcement for systems for vehicle bomb detection \nusing optical and nuclear thermal neutron analysis. The Science and \nTechnology Directorate is piloting several sites using different means \nfor detecting vehicle bombs at checkpoints. There are other initiatives \nto deny terrorists the use of commercial explosives and materials for \nmaking such bombs.\n  So across the board, what I am saying, there is a broad indepth, \ncomprehensive effort underway and using a variety of technologies and \nprograms that seek to achieve, and will achieve, the goal suggested by \nthe Senator from New York.\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\n  We do not need to adopt this amendment to accomplish the goal he \ntalks about that we need to pursue. We are doing what the Senator has \nsuggested should be done.\n  There is a Hazardous Material Shipper Training Program in place for \ndrivers and others who are involved as employees in that industry, \nproviding information about security requirements and responsibilities \nof those engaged in the trucking industry. It is promoting security \nawareness for each mode of transportation, not just truckers but other \nshippers as well.\n  Funds have been provided in the 2004 appropriations bill to test \ncertain technologies, new technologies to track high-risk trucks on the \nNation's highways. The Senator said there is no program such as that in \nplace. Programs are being tested to be implemented. We want to be sure \nthe Transportation Security Administration has the ability to track \nvehicles throughout the entire country, in Alaska and Hawaii as well, \nto identify the best practices and the standards and regulations that \nought to be implemented and enforced by Federal, State, local, and \nindustry stakeholders as well.\n  Congress has provided over $42 million for the Highway Watch Program \nto promote security awareness among all segments of the commercial \nmotor carrier industry and the transportation community at large. For \nthis fiscal year, in this bill that is before the Senate, $15 million \nis provided for this program.\n  For the previous 2 fiscal years, $12 million has been provided for \nthe Transportation Security Administration and the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration to test and evaluate a variety of \ntechnologies, such as global positioning systems, wireless \ncommunications, use of global positioning satellites, alarm systems, \nbiometric identification, and radio frequency identification devices to \nensure that dangerous or potentially dangerous vehicles are identified.\n  Field testing has just been completed, and the evaluation phase in \nthis program has begun. These are steps toward the goal that we all \nshare, and that is identified by the Senator from New York as a very \nimminent and urgent need. It is an urgent need, and we are treating it \nas such over the prior appropriations bill's approval and provisions, \nas well as this year's appropriations bill.\n  There was a mandate in the PATRIOT Act that the Transportation \nSecurity Administration has implemented, in partnership with the \ndepartments in the State motor vehicle area, to ensure that all drivers \nwho are licensed to transport hazardous materials are subjected to \nFederal background checks to be sure the people who are operating these \nvehicles ought to be operating them; that they are not high-risk \npeople; that they do not have something in their background that raises \nalarms about their dependability.\n  The Transportation Security Administration has undertaken background \nchecks on 2.7 million drivers who have hazardous materials endorsements \non their commercial driver's licenses. These background checks have \nidentified approximately 36 individuals who are no longer allowed to \ntransport hazardous materials. TSA will complete this background check, \nand when it is completed they will have conducted name-based background \nchecks on all 3.5 million drivers this year. There will be an FBI \nfingerprint-based criminal history check undertaken as well.\n  The offset would affect the Office of Under Secretary of Management's \nHuman Resources Division.\n  In terms of research, what I am suggesting is that every effort \npossible is being made, through grants provided by the Department of \nHomeland Security, technology development, and deployment in the \ndepartment, to develop a more efficient system for identifying drivers \nto be sure they are trustworthy and are not threats to the Nation's \nsecurity through the operation of vehicles carrying hazardous \nmaterials, the confiscation of vehicles that are carrying hazardous \nmaterials or that could be converted into bombmaking vehicles. All of \nthis is being done in an aggressive and comprehensive way by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, in cooperation with State and local \nauthorities throughout the country.\n  Private sector groups, shippers who are undertaking to safeguard the \ncontent of packages that go into vehicles, are also very actively \ninvolved in helping ensure that the public is not going to be put in \ndanger through the use of our transportation system in this way.\n  We think the provisions of the bill are adequate. To provide funding \nthat the Senator is suggesting is needed will be wasteful and cannot be \nefficiently used for the purposes he seeks. The goals are notable and \nlaudable. We share them and we are doing everything we can to ensure \nthat we have in place the programs, training, research, and \ntechnologies that we need to protect ourselves from these kinds of \nattacks and attacks against the Nation's critical infrastructure and \npopulation centers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Mississippi for \nhis graciousness in allowing this amendment to be modified. I agree \nwith him that we have the same goals, but our analysis of how well we \nare progressing toward those goals is woefully inadequate.\n  I want to make clear what the amendment seeks to do because there \nhave been some concerns raised by the American Trucking Association and \nsome truck firms. To address those concerns, which I did not think were \nreal, I modified the amendment to make that clear. Here is what the \namendment does not do: It does not require that members of the trucking \nindustry purchase GPS systems for their truck fleets. It does not \nrequire trucking companies to present plans to TSA of current truck \nroutes throughout the country.\n  My amendment simply provides the TSA with the resources to begin \nlooking into how we go about monitoring what has been shown to us as a \nvulnerability within our existing plan to secure our country from \nterrorist threats. I know the ATA, which has resisted any regulation of \nthe trucking industry, has raised some concerns, but their concerns are \neither incorrect or shortsighted.\n  My amendment provides the TSA with flexibility and much needed funds \nto address truck security and has none of the mandates or high costs \nthat have been talked about. Both the TSA and DOT, I will agree with my \nfriend from Mississippi, are currently working on improving and \nexpanding truck-tracking systems and background checks for commercial \ndriver's licenses with the HAZMAT endorsement. But let me suggest \nsomething. Here is the plan. First, they were doing nothing, and a \nyear, a year and a half ago, I prodded and prodded. So now the plan is \nthat any new application for a HAZMAT license will be checked out, a \nbackground check will be given. The problem is, all existing licenses \nwill not be checked until they are renewed.\n  Since most States have 5-year renewal periods, we are not going to \ncheck many of these licenses until 2007, 2008, 2009, even 2010.\n  When one asks the TSA why they are not doing it more quickly, they \nsay one word: Money. We do not have the money.\n  It is hardly believable that $10 million here or $9.4 million there, \nwhich is spread across a whole lot of programs and research, will be \nenough. So the bottom line is, we agree that we have to do this, but I \nwould rather err on the side of making sure we get it done quickly, \ngiven that the terrorists have said--at least with al-Qaida--that truck \nbombs are a preferred weapon. Every one of us knows what has happened. \nWe have not provided the money we need in homeland security, whether it \nis truck security or anything else. We slow-walk these programs.\n  To say that somebody could have a hazardous material license and be \non a terrorist watch list and we will not catch up to them until 2010 \nmakes no sense. When TSA says they have not done this or not done it \nquickly because they do not have the money, what we do is provide them \nthe money. There is an offset, an offset from a pot of money that \nsimply says let us outsource some structural personnel reorganizing.\n  It amazes me that we could spend $70 million for that but only $15 \nmillion for the whole program of truck security.\n  As for the GPS system, it is needed. We do not mandate it because we, \nlike our friend from Mississippi, are not\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\nsure exactly the best way to go. But we sure want TSA to come up with a \nplan quickly and figure out how to do it and not impose the costs on \nthe trucking industry if need be.\n  Here in America, a lot of companies put in a GPS system on their own, \nnot to deal with terrorism but to deal with stolen trucks.\n  I remind my colleagues that a truck carrying hazardous material is \nmissing, gone, from Pennsauken, NJ, not far from my city, and we still \ndo not know where it is. We do not know what has been done with it. In \nall likelihood, it was stolen for mercenary purposes. But can we afford \nthe risk that the next truck is stolen for terrorist purposes?\n  Simply training with the ATA program, which trains truck drivers on \nsafety in terms of terrorism, does not deal with the fact that a \nterrorist might wish to steal a truck, hijack a truck, use a truck. All \nthe training programs of good drivers, legitimate drivers in the world \nwill not deal with that, and that is why we believe these other steps \nare so needed.\n  The bottom line is this is not a whole lot of money. This is a \nserious threat. It is offset. There are no mandates. Again, I say to my \ncolleagues, we do not wish to wake up one morning and say: What if--God \nforbid there was a terrible incident--we had done more and allocated \nthe money needed?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 5:30 having arrived, there will be \n2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to table the Schumer amendment. I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thought there were 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would have to withhold his motion \nto table.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that in spite of the motion by the \nSenator from Mississippi, there be 2 minutes equally divided on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the American Trucking Association has \ndelivered a letter to me. It is signed by 34 organizations or \nindustries that are concerned that the passage of the Schumer amendment \nwould result in an enormous burden on our national economic recovery, \nthat it would impose enormous costs on many industries, that it would \nforce haulers to undertake expensive new activities that have not been \napproved or suggested by the Transportation Security Administration as \nnecessary or as improvements to the security systems now in place. This \nis a three-page letter. Rather than have it read into the Record, I ask \nunanimous consent the letter, dated September 13, addressed to me, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                               American Trucking Associations,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2004.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We urge you to vote no on the Schumer \n     Amendment to the Department of Homeland Security \n     Appropriations for FY 2005.\n       The Schumer Amendment would (1) mandate background checks \n     for drivers transporting hazardous materials; (2) require \n     trucks transporting hazardous materials to be equipped with \n     global positioning satellite (GPS) tracking devices; and (3) \n     require written route plans to be prepared and filed with the \n     Department prior to transporting hazardous materials. For the \n     reasons set forth below, these initiatives are not necessary, \n     will not ensure the secure transportation of hazardous \n     materials, and will cause most trucking companies to embargo \n     these vital commodities.\n\n\n                           backgroiund checks\n\n       Pursuant to the mandate contained in the USA PATRIOT Act, \n     the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has \n     implemented a program to ensure that all drivers licensed to \n     transport hazardous materials are subjected to a federal \n     background check. to date, TSA has run background checks on \n     the 2.7 million drivers that have hazardous materials \n     endorsements to their commercial drivers' licenses. These \n     background checks have identified approximately three dozen \n     individuals who may no longer be able to transport hazardous \n     materials. Background checks are continuing under this TSA \n     program and this portion of the amendment mandating \n     background checks is duplicative and not necessary.\n\n\n          hazardous materials are critical to the u.s. economy\n\n       There are more than 800,000 shipments of hazardous \n     materials each day. Regulated hazardous materials include \n     such items as pharmaceuticals, paint, hairspray, pesticides, \n     airbags, cigarette lighters and other consumer commodities. \n     In fact, the vast majority of hazardous materials transported \n     do not pose a plausible risk of use in a terrorist attack. \n     Nevertheless, the amendment would require transporters to \n     equip literally hundreds of thousands of trucks with \n     expensive tracking technology. The prenotification of route \n     plans referenced by the Senator in his floor statement would \n     frustrate the ability of hospitals to provide prompt or \n     immediate medical treatments to their patients, hamper \n     agricultural distributors' ability to provide farmers with \n     the fertilizers and pesticides they depend upon and greatly \n     increase the cost of many consumer commodities, such as home \n     heating oil.\n\n\n                  global positioning satellite mandate\n\n       The pending amendment would require any truck carrying \n     hazardous materials to be equipped with GPS technology that \n     would enable the government to determine its location at all \n     times. GPS systems, however, are easily defeated by cutting \n     power to the transponder, otherwise disabling the \n     transponder, shielding the transponder, parking the truck in \n     an area that does not have ``line of sight'' to the \n     satellite, offloading the cargo to another truck or simply \n     decoupling the trailer and hooking it up to an alternative \n     power unit leaving the original power unit with its \n     transponder on the side of the road.\n       Moreover, GPS systems are expensive. Senator Schumer's \n     estimate of $200 for the cost of GPS is not accurate in the \n     context of real-time 2-way communication GPS technology. The \n     purchase and installation of ``hardened'' GPS transponders \n     costs more than $1,500 per vehicle. In addition, the annual \n     communication costs may exceed $1,000 per vehicle depending \n     upon how often the truck is ``pinged'' by the satellite. \n     Because hazardous materials comprise only a small percentage \n     of the freight transported by the trucking industry, the \n     trucking industry does not dedicate specific trucks to \n     transport hazardous materials. As a result, the pending \n     amendment would require the industry to equip virtually the \n     entire fleet. Faced with these enormous costs most companies \n     would simply refuse to haul hazardous materials, which could \n     cripple the U.S. manufacturing industries and deal a severe \n     blow to our economic recovery.\n\n\n                     written route plan requirement\n\n       The pending amendment would require motor carriers to file \n     written route plans with the government for purposes of route \n     verification. This proposal could actually comprise security \n     as a terrorist could exploit the carrier's or government's \n     communication systems used to transmit route plans, which \n     would provide the terrorist with a virtual shopping list of \n     certain desirable hazardous materials.\n       This proposal would require the expenditure of enormous \n     administrative resources necessary to devise, transmit and \n     verify the route plans. Moreover, written route plans are not \n     practicable to implement in many trucking operations. While \n     written route plans may be implemented in a truckload \n     environment where a carrier picks up a load of materials at \n     one location and delivers it to its final destination, a \n     significant amount of freight is moved in the less-than-\n     truckload or package & delivery environment, where written \n     route plans are not feasible because the freight may be \n     transloaded several times before delivery. For these \n     carriers, the costs associated with providing this service \n     would far outweigh the revenue opportunities from such low \n     volume freight. As a result, many of the safest and most \n     responsible carriers will no longer carry hazardous \n     materials. The removal of competitive forces from this \n     segment of the hazardous materials transportation market will \n     result in significant price increases in the cost of \n     transporting this freight. Moreover, the administrative \n     burden to the federal, state and local governments of real \n     time tracking of several hundred thousand daily shipments is \n     enormous. Finally, the transportation of radioactive \n     materials and certain explosives are already subject to \n     additional stringent safety and security requirements of the \n     Department of Transportation.\n\n\n                          fmcsa study pending\n\n                      (the amendment is premature)\n\n       In his floor statement introducing his amendment, Senator \n     Schumer argued for the implementation of ``global positioning \n     satellite (GPS)'' technology to track all truck shipments of \n     hazardous materials. Respectfully, the Senator's proposal is \n     premature and may frustrate the development of more effective \n     and less costly alternatives.\n       It is important that the Senator be aware of a current \n     research project, which began almost a year ago, under the \n     auspices of the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor \n     Carrier Safety Administration. That project, referred to as \n     the ``Field Operations Test'' (FOT), involves the testing and \n     evaluation of a variety of technologies including\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\n     GPS, wireless communications, global positioning satellites, \n     ``panic buttons and alarms'', ``geo-fencing'', biometric \n     identification and radio frequency identification devices.\n       The field testing has just been completed, and, the \n     evaluation phase has already begun. Already, SAIC and Batelle \n     have produced a multi-volume draft report which has been \n     circulated (on a limited basis) to security specialists \n     within both government and industry.\n       The Senate should pause until the evaluation and reports \n     are complete, and final recommendations have been submitted \n     to both the Department of Transportation and the Department \n     of Homeland Security.\n       We urge you to defeat the Schumer amendment.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       Agricultural Retailers Association\n       American Chemistry Council\n       American Farm Bureau Federation\n       American Petroleum Institute\n       American Pyrotechnics Association\n       American Trucking Associations\n       Chlorine Chemistry Council\n       Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance\n       Compressed Gas Association\n       Council on Safe Transportation of Hazardous Articles\n       The Chlorine Institute\n       Dangerous Goods Advisory Council\n       The Fertilizer Institute\n       Institute of Makers of Explosives\n       Industrial Packaging Alliance of North America\n       International Vessel Operators Hazardous Materials \n     Association\n       International Warehouse Logistics Association\n       National Association of Chemical Distributors\n       National Association of Convenience Stores\n       National Association of Manufacturers\n       National Association of Truck Stop Operators\n       National Paint & Coatings Association\n       National Private Truck Council\n       National Propane Gas Association\n       National Tank Truck Carriers\n       Nuclear Energy Institute\n       Petroleum Marketers Association of America\n       Radiopharmaceuticals Shippers & Carriers Conference\n       Reusable Industrial Packaging Association\n       Steel Shipping Container Institute\n       Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America\n       Truckload Carriers Association\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n       Utility Solid Waste Activities Group.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I think the Senate has heard as much \ndiscussion as they probably need to form an opinion about this \namendment. We urge Senators to vote yes on the motion to table and \npermit the committee to continue to work with the Department and \nindustries that are involved to bring the best possible technologies \ninto play to protect the security of our country and the transportation \nindustries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me make a couple of quick points.\n  First, the ATA letter says there are mandates. It was written before \nwe modified the amendment. If there were any, there was no intention to \nhave mandates, but now the amendment as modified makes it clear, so I \nthink their letter is outdated.\n  Of course, no industry wants any regulation. We are in a brave new \nworld. The airline industry didn't want anything done after 9/11 unless \nthe Federal Government paid for the whole thing. We are not outlining \nwhat ought to be done and what mandates should be, but we ought to move \nforward and find out how to make our trucks, particularly the trucks \ncarrying hazardous materials, safer.\n  It is a small amount of money. It says take $70 million out of a pot \nof money to outsource, to make TSA more efficient, and put it into \ntruck security to do two things: First, to check on who can get a \ndriver's license for hazardous materials, to avoid a situation like the \none when hijackers were able to go fly planes, and, second, to study \nhow to set up a GPS system so we can track trucks in case they are \nstolen.\n  I urge support of the amendment. I think we would be foolhardy not to \ndo so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine), the Senator from North Carolina \n(Mr. Edwards), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry). and the \nSenator from Rhode Island (Mr. Reed) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3617\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Under the previous order, \nthere will now be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on the Lautenberg \namendment.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by \nSenator Corzine and me. The amendment simply adds $100 million to \nensure that the Coast Guard is going to have adequate funding for its \nnonhomeland security measures.\n  It is interesting; we fund Iraq's coast guard, and now the Iraqi \nCoastal Defense Force is receiving U.S. tax dollars for Chinese-built \nboats and crew training. If we can find money for Iraq's coast guard, \nthen surely we can adequately fund our own Coast Guard. They perform \nservices that are essential.\n  We need to add this funding because GAO found that the Coast Guard \nhas to dip into its nonhomeland budget during times of elevated \nsecurity alert. That means missions such as search and rescue, \nprotecting our fisheries, ice-breaking operations, marine pollution, \nmigrants, drug interdiction, and other law enforcement issues as well.\n  The amendment is still $150 million less than the amount authorized \nin the Coast Guard bill signed into law just last month by the \nPresident. I urge my colleagues to look at their coastline and decide \nwhether they ought to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment offers to add a \nsubstantial amount of money to the operational budget of the U.S. Coast \nGuard. I remind Senators that the Coast Guard's total appropriation in \nthis next fiscal year is $705 million above last year's appropriation. \nIt is about $134 million above the President's request for overall U.S. \nCoast Guard activity. We urge the Senate to vote no against the \nLautenberg amendment.\n  I make a point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act that the amendment provides spending in excess of the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n\n[[Page S9117]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

On this vote, the yeas are 38, the nays are \n50. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3621\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3621 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3621.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To set aside an amount for a pilot project to test \n  interoperable communications between the first Northern Border Air \n   Wing, Bellingham, Washington, and local law enforcement personnel)\n\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n       Sec. 515. Of the amount appropriated by title II for the \n     Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation \n     Security under the heading ``air and marine interdiction, \n     operations, maintenance, and procurement'', $5,000,000 may be \n     used for a pilot project to test interoperable communications \n     between the first Northern Border Air Wing, Bellingham, \n     Washington, and local law enforcement personnel.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment I just called up has been \nagreed to on both sides. It simply allows our northern Air Guard to be \nable to communicate with those on the ground and use available funds.\n  I have talked with the managers on both sides, and I believe the \namendment is agreed to. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we reviewed the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Washington. We agree to support it, and we ask the Senate \nto adopt it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3621) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are at a point in the deliberations \nthat I think we can be pleased with the progress we have made so far \nlast week as well as today. We hope to be able to push ahead and \ncomplete action on this bill tomorrow evening. That is the expectation \nof the leadership. But I know we have a number of amendments that \nSenators are preparing to offer tomorrow. There are also four \namendments that we have had discussion on which have not yet been \ndisposed of. But in view of the fact we have made such good progress \nand there are other activities that are important to Senators off the \nfloor at this point in the evening, it is my hope that we will go into \nmorning business and let the leadership decide how long that will be.\n  I thank my friend from Nevada, who has been very helpful in handling \nthe bill on the floor, along with our other leaders on our side of the \naisle as well, particularly Senator Frist, the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have tonight a couple of amendments, \nmaybe even three, that people could offer. I talked with Senator \nDayton, and he said he wants to offer one which will take 5 minutes. It \nis up to the manager whether he wants to do that tonight or tomorrow. \nWe also have two Feingold amendments that should be accepted, we \nunderstand, and a Levin amendment. It is up to the manager.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we are happy to stay here as long as \nthere is business to be transacted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, since I last spoke on the Senate floor \nabout how we should proceed on this bill, or made suggestions, I have \nlearned that the House leadership has said they are going to spend all \nweek looking at the next supplemental dealing with Florida.\n  Whether that is the case or not, I do not know. All I know is that is \nwhat they have said. I again ask the majority to take a close look at \nwhat we are doing. Let us finish Homeland Security appropriations and \nworry about Florida--and I realize it takes a lot of worrying because \nthey have had calamities that are untoward in our history, but let us \nget rid of this Homeland Security bill. I say that in a positive sense.\n  We have made good progress. I think the amendments have been listed. \nWe can get rid of these, and again I hate to use a term like that--we \ncan dispose of these amendments. We can adopt and accept some of them. \nI think we could do it even maybe tomorrow evening. But if we are going \nto complicate this matter with the supplemental appropriations, it is \ngoing to make things real tough to finish this bill.\n  I am here only to serve the body and do whatever I can to move things \nalong. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3629\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3629.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S9118]]\n\n     (Purpose: To ensure the continuation of benefits for certain \n     individuals providing security services for Federal buildings)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. Amounts appropriated under this Act for expenses \n     related to the protection of federally owned and leased \n     buildings and for the operations of the Federal Protective \n     Service shall not be made available unless the Service \n     implements procedures to ensure that, with respect to \n     contracts (including subcontracts) entered into on or after \n     May 30, 2004 with private security firms to provide \n     protective services for federally owned or leased buildings, \n     the terms of such contracts are not modified in a manner that \n     results in a change in benefits for the employees involved \n     unless the employees involved consent to such changes.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the manager of this bill for the opportunity to \npresent my amendment tonight.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment is unfortunately necessary to protect \nthe security of the men and women who protect our security day and \nnight in States such as Minnesota. As my colleagues will recall, when \nthe Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002, the Congress \ngranted the Secretary of the new Department of Homeland Security the \nunprecedented power to override longstanding employee contracts. He or \nshe was given the power to hire, fire, promote, demote, or do anything \nto the employees of that new agency.\n  Some of us opposed that unprecedented, unwarranted, and unnecessary \npower. A couple of my colleagues were vilified, demonized, and defeated \nfor opposing that unilateral power. The majority in this body, at the \ninsistence of the Bush administration, voted for it. Well, they got it.\n  So of the security guards in the Federal building where I have my \noffice in Minnesota and elsewhere, I am told a private contractor took \nover their contract this July, and without consultation, without \nnegotiation, or without consent altered their health benefit payments. \nIt saves this big company taxes.\n  Of course, they could underbid the existing contractor and take that \nout of the benefits of those security guards in Minnesota to the \ndetriment of them and their families.\n  The result has been that since July 1, 15 to 20 percent of that local \nguard force has had to quit, look for a new job, or take a second job. \nOthers have not been able to meet their house and car payments. They \nare having a harder time concentrating on work, their work being to \nprotect the people who work in my office, my constituents.\n  One guard had a heart problem and had to be taken from work to the \nhospital in an ambulance because of the stress that was imposed. He \nreceived medical services that now, as a result of this contract \nchange, he does not have the money to pay for.\n  It takes 70 to 80 hours to train a new security guard. For a full-\ntimer, that is about 10 full-time days. For part-timers, that can take \nup to a month depending on their part-time schedule. So this is not \nsaving the taxpayers money. This is saving the private contractor \nmoney. It is providing greater profits for that company at the expense \nof the health and economic security of the people who are providing \nthat security day and night in Minnesota and other States because their \nprotections were stripped out and eliminated when this new Department \nof Homeland Security was created.\n  I say, respectfully, to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nas well as to the chairman of the subcommittee and the distinguished \nranking member, I know they have expressed in the past their reluctance \nto adopt policy changes in appropriations measures, but the health, \nsecurity and protections of the people in Minnesota, unfortunately, \ncannot wait for some other measure to come forward. So I believe it is \nessential that I bring forward this amendment, and I ask my colleagues \nto consider it.\n  It very simply says--and I would be quite happy to go back further in \ntime, but for the sake of this particular situation and others like \nit--for contracts that have been taken over through low-ball bidding \nsince May 30, 2004, alterations in health protection and health \ncoverage have to be negotiated with the employees or with their \nbargaining unit. To me, this is the minimal measure of protection that \nshould be granted to every employee in the Federal Government, in this \nagency, or any other.\n\n  At 5:25 p.m., I received stated objections from someone at the \nFederal Protective Service purporting to represent the official \nresponse of the Department of Homeland Security. Once again, the \nexisting Federal agency at the last minute has objections to the \nlegislation that could have been presented to me today, last week, \nwhenever. My staff has been in discussion with the majority and the \nminority staff on the committee for the last few days. Less than 2 \nhours ago, to receive from the agency involved their stated objections \nthat they will use, I assume to try to defeat this amendment, I find to \nbe offensive.\n  They, once again, presume that because they have this authorizing \nlegislation that grants the Secretary unilateral, complete, absolute \npower to make these changes in people's contracts that affect their \nlives, that affect their families, they do not even need to bother to \nrespond to proposed legislation, which is exactly the reason this \nshould not have been passed to begin with; exactly the reason employees \nshould have due process; exactly the reason this ought to be in \ncontract bargaining procedures so that those changes that are going to \nbe made have to go through a negotiation or discussion with the elected \nrepresentatives of those affected employees.\n  We have gone too far in creating this department and giving that \nunilateral authority to any single individual. This is a step back in \nthe proper direction that is not in any way going to affect the \nnational security of this country. In fact, I take that back. It will \nonly enhance the national security of this country, of the Federal \nemployees in the Federal buildings such as in Minnesota and the \ncitizens who go to those buildings to meet with their elected \nrepresentatives because they will be better qualified, better trained, \nmore capable people, including those who now hold those jobs, except \nfor those who have been forced to leave those jobs. So there will be \nbetter national security at a lower cost to the taxpayer when the \nretraining and other ancillary costs are included.\n  The only one that will be adversely affected by this will be the \nprivate employer who is underbid and is trying to extract additional \nprofits out of the economic security of those employees and the public \nsecurity of those they protect.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his suggestion of \nthis change. As I understand the amendment, it would limit the \nappropriation provided in this bill by restricting the opportunities \nfor the Federal Protective Service to enter into certain contracts. It \nimposes conditions under which they can engage in contract activities \nfor protective services at Federal building sites.\n  I am advised by the Federal Protective Service, which is under the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, that this is an amendment not \nsupported by the administration. There are those who are involved in \nhelping to safeguard the security of Federal buildings and other \nfacilities. They have limited resources which they say would be \nsignificantly diverted from the primary mission of providing the \nprofessional, qualified, and capable security guard service according \nto contracts and the needs of individual locations. The restrictive \nlanguage of the amendment is counterproductive to the progress the \nFederal Protective Service has made.\n  So the argument that I have to make and that I am happy to make is \nthat this amendment should not be included in this legislation, and we \nwould be forced to resist it. I will urge my colleagues to vote against \nit at the appropriate time.\n  The leadership has indicated, I think, either formally or informally, \nthat there will be no further rollcall votes this evening, so this is \nan issue that would have to go over until tomorrow,\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\nand we will be happy to discuss the details more fully tomorrow so that \nall Senators are aware of the impact this amendment would have on the \nFederal Protective Service and its ability to do its job.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment be set \naside so that other matters may be brought up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there is a matter I can bring to the \nattention of the Senate, a modification of an amendment that has \nalready been adopted.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3618, As Modified\n\n  On behalf of Senator Byrd and myself, I offer a modification to \namendment No. 3618 which was adopted by voice vote on Friday, September \n10, 2004.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3618), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 39, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following new \n     section:\n       ``Sec. __.

Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today \nwould require the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit to Congress \na report on the amount of goods acquired by the Department during \nfiscal year 2005 that were made overseas.\n  I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee for working with me to include this important provision in \nthe bill.\n  My amendment would extend for another year with respect to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security a provision that was enacted as part of \nthe fiscal year 2004 omnibus spending bill requiring all Federal \ndepartments and agencies to submit to Congress a report about goods \nthat they purchase that are made outside of the United States. These \nreports will improve the disclosure of the amount of foreign-made goods \npurchased by the federal government.\n  My amendment, like current law, requires that this report include the \nfollowing information: (a) the dollar value of any articles, materials, \nor supplies purchased that are manufactured outside of the United \nStates; (b) an itemized list of all waivers of the Buy American Act \ngranted with respect to such articles, materials, or supplies, and (c) \na summary of total procurement funds spent on goods manufactured in the \nUnited States versus funds spent on goods manufactured outside of the \nUnited States.\n  The amendment also requires that the report be made publicly \navailable to the maximum extent practicable.\n  Prior to the enactment earlier this year of the Government-wide Buy \nAmerican reporting requirement that I authored, only the Department of \nDefense was required to report annually on its use of waivers of \ndomestic procurement laws. Last year, I introduced legislation to \nstrengthen the Buy American Act of 1933, the statute that governs \nprocurement by the Federal Government. The name of the Act accurately \nand succinctly describes its purpose: to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment supports domestic companies and domestic workers by buying\n\n[[Page S9120]]\n\nAmerican-made goods. One part of my bill would require that all Federal \ndepartments and agencies submit annual reports on their purchases. The \namendment that I am offering today is based on that provision in my \nbill.\n  The Buy American Act requires that the Federal Government support \ndomestic businesses and domestic workers by buying American-made goods. \nI am pleased to note that the underlying bill includes language that \nstates that none of the funds appropriated to the Department of \nHomeland Security may be used in contravention of the applicable \nprovisions of the Buy American Act.\n  It only makes sense that Federal departments and agencies be required \nto report to Congress on their compliance with Federal law and with \ncongressional intent regarding this important matter.\n  The American people deserve to know how their tax dollars are being \nspent, and to what extent these dollars are being used to support \nforeign jobs. I look forward to reviewing the fiscal year 2004 versions \nof these reports, and I am pleased that the managers have worked with \nme to extend the requirement for the Department of Homeland Security \nfor fiscal year 2005. I will continue my efforts to ensure that this \nsimple reporting requirement is made permanent for all Federal \ndepartments and agencies.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee \nfor agreeing to accept my amendment, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3620\n\n                               CONTRACTS\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, does the amendment apply \nto any existing contract at the Department of Homeland Security?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No, the amendment would only apply to new contracts signed \nafter the date of enactment.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator. Does that mean that the Senator's \namendment will not prohibit any task order, change order or extension \nissued in connection with an existing contract awarded prior to the ate \nof enactment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct. The intent of the amendment is to \nonly capture new contracts.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the Senator. So this amendment will not impact \ntask orders issued under the US VISIT contract awarded to Accenture and \nthe Smart Border Alliance?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator is correct, the amendment is not intended to \nimpact that contract or any task orders issued under the US VISIT \ncontract.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum, unless the manager has \nmore.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I do not know of any other Senator who is \nplanning to speak or offer an amendment at this time, so I think it is \nappropriate to put in a quorum call, unless we go to morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9120-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on another \nmatter. It came to my attention that the President, today, spoke in \nMuskegon, MI, about health care. The President derided John Kerry's \nplan for reforming health care as a bureaucratic nightmare and \ncontended it would cost $1.5 trillion.\n  I want to mention for the record, when this President became \nPresident we were spending $1.3 trillion on health care. Now we are \nspending $1.8 trillion on health care. Do you hear me? That is a half a \ntrillion dollars. That is a half-trillion-dollar increase that \nAmericans are now spending on health care. What do we have to show for \nresults? We have to show, as a result, that an average family would \nhave to pay $10,000 for a family policy for comprehensive health care.\n  The results will show we have had the greatest decline in coverage of \ninsurance for American workers during the last 3 years in the history \nof our health insurance debate. Drug prices are skyrocketing right up \nthrough the roof. Ask any senior citizen about the cost increase in \nprescription drugs. At the same time, you will find some of the \ngreatest profits in the history of the drug companies and the HMOs.\n  I suggest that the tactics of fear and smear no longer be used when \nit comes to health care debates. Let us get rid of fear and smear. The \nfacts do not add up to the recommendations and the suggestions we heard \nthis afternoon. We know health insurance coverage is a crisis in this \ncountry in terms of cost and the increased numbers of uninsured and \nthat prices are going up through the roof. Yet this administration \nabsolutely opposed any opportunity for negotiated prices in terms of \nprescription drugs in the Medicare legislation last year.\n  Distortion and misrepresentation is a great concern to me. We have \nseen this administration distort and misrepresent intelligence about \ngetting us into Iraq. We have seen them distort and misrepresent \nintelligence when they talk about our economy. It has been true with \nregard to education and leaving 4.5 million children out of the No \nChild Left Behind Program.\n  As I have said at other times, when this Nation made a commitment \nthat we were going to cover Medicare, we covered all of our seniors. \nWhen we said we were going to cover voting rights, we covered all of \nour Americans who should have been eligible for voting rights. When we \nsaid we were going to cover all children in this country--and 4.5 \nmillion of them being left out and behind--I compared it to the fact \nthat when President Kennedy said we were going to the Moon, Congress \ngave us half the money to get us up to $150 million and not do anything \nelse but get our astronauts to the Moon and not bring them home. Those \nare the facts.\n  That is why these representations and debate in terms of health care, \nin terms of education, in terms of our economy, and in terms of Iraq--\nthis is an administration that has failed in terms of its \nresponsibilities. It is misleading the American people on issue after \nissue. That is what this debate is about. We will have a chance to see \nits outcome on election day.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9120-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING DR.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the\n\n[[Page S9121]]\n\nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  In Baltimore, MD, in 1999, a group of six people went on a crime \nspree that included over a dozen armed robberies and four car-jackings. \nWhile most of the victims were threatened at gunpoint and otherwise not \ninjured, one man was hit in the head with a baseball bat and Tacy \nRanta, a prominent transgender activist, was fatally shot in the chest. \nWhen one of the assailants asked the shooter why he had shot ``that \nlady,'' the shooter replied ``that was no lady--that was a faggot.'' \nSome transgender activists believe that since Ranta was the only one \nkilled, the murder was a hate crime based on her status as a \ntranssexual.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9121-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9121-S9122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VIOLENT CRIME CONTROL AND LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT \n                                OF 1994\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today marks the 10-year anniversary of the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The bill, which \nwas the product of bi-partisan compromise, took a balanced position to \ncriminal justice policy, strengthening many Federal penalties, \nproviding funding to build prisons and promoting truth-in-sentencing. \nMost importantly, the act made important investments in programs \ndesigned to prevent crime in the first place, including putting 100,000 \ncommunity policing officers on the street and reducing violence against \nwomen and children.\n  To ensure this bill's passage, I worked harder than I ever had in the \nU.S. Senate. Prior to the final vote, in August of 1994, I stated that \n``I will vote for this bill, because, as much as anything I have ever \nvoted on in 22 years in the U.S. Senate, I truly believe that passage \nof this legislation will make a difference in the lives of the American \npeople. I believe with every fiber in my being that if this bill \npasses, fewer people will be murdered, fewer people will be victims, \nfewer women will be senselessly beaten, fewer people will continue on \nthe drug path, and fewer children will become criminals.''\n  Fortunately, this turned out to be right. With the passage of the \nBiden crime bill we were able to form a partnership amongst Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement and create programs that helped drive \ndown crime rates for 8 consecutive years. In 1994 we had historically \nhigh rates of violent crimes, such as murders, forcible rapes, and \naggravated assaults. We were able to reduce these to the lowest levels \nin a generation. We reduced the murder rate by 37.8 percent; we reduced \nforcible rapes by 19.1 percent; and we reduced aggravated assaults by \n25.5 percent. Property crimes, including auto thefts, also were reduced \nfrom historical highs to the lowest levels in decades.\n  How were we able to achieve such great results? Well, we all know it \nwas a combination of factors, but most law enforcement officials credit \nthe Office of Community Oriented Policing with a pivotal role. Indeed, \nin the words of Attorney General Ashcroft, the Community Oriented \nPolicing program has been ``a miraculous success.'' COPS has funded \nover 118,000 local officers to patrol our neighborhoods and towns and \nhelp drive down crime rates. Because of COPS, the concept of community \npolicing has spread to cities and towns across the country.\n  A testament to the success of the program is the fact that it has \nbeen endorsed by every major law enforcement group in the country, \nincluding the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the National Sheriff's \nAssociation, the International Brotherhood of Police Organizations, the \nNational Organization of Black Law Enforcement Officials, the \nInternational Union of Police Associations, the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, and others.\n  Completely disregarding the overwhelming success of COPS, the Bush \nadministration and Republican leadership have set their sights on \neliminating this program. President Bush has proposed cuts each year he \nhas been in office, and while we have fought to maintain funding for \nCOPS, we are fighting an uphill battle. Funding for 5 State and local \nlaw enforcement programs run out of the Department of Justice is down \n75.6 percent since fiscal year 2002. To me, this approach is \ninexplicable, particularly because the need for Federal assistance \nremains pressing.\n\n  Recent articles from USA Today and the New York Times highlighted the \nfact that many cities are being forced to eliminate officers because of \ntheir woeful local budgets. In fact, New York City has lot 3,000 \nofficers in the last few years. Other cities, such as Cleveland, OH, \nMilwaukee, MN, and Houston, TX, are facing similar shortages. As a \nresult, local police chiefs are reluctantly pulling officers from the \nproactive policing activities that were so successful in the nineties. \nThis has not been a choice taken lightly. Police chiefs understand the \nvalue of proactive policing; however, they simply don't have the \nmanpower to do it all. Basically, we have been asking them to do more \nwith less, and responding to emergency calls must take precedence over \nproactive programs. However, I fear that we are starting to see the \nresults. Local chiefs are reporting increased gang activity. Murder \nrates and auto thefts--two very accurate indicators of crime trends--\nhave gone up for 3 consecutive years.\n  The Bush administration's response to these criticisms is that \nfunding for first responders is way up. Undoubtedly, these are \ncritical, necessary expenditures, and I believe that the administration \nhas not invested enough for our first responders. However, this \nargument misses the point entirely. We have an obligation to do both. \nWe must fund our first responders and invest in the programs that help \nreduce traditional crime and prevent terrorism. As the President has \nstated on many occasions, it is the solemn duty of the Federal \nGovernment to keep Americans safe. We simply can't achieve this goal \nwithout investing in our State and local law enforcement partners. The \nCOPS office has been a critical lynchpin in the Federal, State, and \nlocal partnership that has been effective since the passage of the 1994 \nBiden crime bill, and I hope that the Bush administration and this \nCongress will reverse its current course and provide critical funding \nfor this program.\n  Another component of the 1994 Biden crime bill was the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. With the passage of the Violence Against Women Act \nwe started talking about that dirty little secret that no one wanted to \nsay out loud, and as a result women and children have become safer. \nInstead of suffering alone, a rape victim or battered wife can now turn \nto a trained police officer, an emergency room nurse, or a 1-800 \ntelephone operator. We've transformed so-called ``family matters'' into \npublic crimes that hold the offender accountable and provide the victim \nwith meaningful services.\n  Since fiscal year 1995, nearly $3.8 billion has been appropriated for \nthe programs created by the Violence Against Women Act. In Delaware \nalone, the Office on Violence Against Women has overseen 21 grant \nawards totaling $9.5 million. These investments have paid off. Domestic \nviolence has dropped nearly 50 percent. Incidents of rape are down by \n60 percent. The number of women killed by an abusive husband or \nboyfriend is down 22 percent. Today, more than half of all rape victims \nare stepping forward to report the crime, and over a million women have \nfound justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic violence \nprotection orders.\n\n  Of course, we need to do more. As more and more brave women step \nforward to report a rape or seek a restraining order, more demands are \nplaced on women's shelters, State prosecutors, victim advocates, and \nother resources. As we encourage victim reporting and swift responses \nby our criminal justice system, we must continue to create and support \nservices for families in distress. We cannot let the Violence Against \nWomen Act become a victim of its own success.\n  To ensure that VAWA is passed on to the next generation, we have \nbegun\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\nworking on the next version of the act. This is a collaborative effort. \nWe are listening closely to those on the front lines--police, trial \njudges, emergency room nurses and many others--and making targeted \nimprovements to existing grant programs and tightening up criminal \nlaws. We are learning about the new challenges and the persistent \nproblems of old. Frankly, there are still far too many women and their \nchildren vulnerable to cowardly abusers. As such, the new act may \ninclude heightened penalties for repeat Federal domestic violence \noffenders, and update the Federal stalking statute to incorporate new \ntechnologies that can terrorize women.\n  This past spring, I was in my home State at an event honoring the \nwinners of our high school poster contest. To enter this first-ever \n``Teens Against Sexual Assault'' contest, any Delaware high school \nstudent could submit a poster that somehow visually depicted the \nmessage ``no means no.'' The two young winners were quite shy, but they \nboth joined me at the podium in front of 200 people. They stunned the \naudience, admitting that they both had been victims of rape and hoped \nthat through their efforts they could help other young women find the \ncourage to report their attacker and seek help. As I listened to these \ncourageous young women, I was reminded of the essential purpose of the \nViolence Against Women Act. We simply can't stop now.\n  Prior to the enactment of the 1994 crime bill, many doubted that the \nFederal Government could have a measurable impact on crime in the \nUnited States. Programs such as COPS and VAWA proved the critics wrong. \nCOPS and VAWA have made Americans safer and changed fundamental \nsocietal attitudes about domestic violence and sexual assault.\n  In this new age of terrorism, we simply cannot lose site of \ntraditional crimes in our neighborhoods and homes. While the threat of \nterrorism is very real, the likelihood of becoming a victim of a \n``traditional'' crime is exponentially far greater than becoming a \nvictim of a terrorist attack. Last year, there were over one million \nincidents of violent crime and over 16,000 murders reported to the \npolice. If we are going to continue to progress and make this country \nsafer, we must continue to invest in the programs that have proven \nsuccessful, and during the last few weeks of this legislative session, \nI hope Congress and President Bush will do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9122-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Specialist dustin s. colby\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

SP Colby is survived by \nhis mother, Misty L. Thoe, and his father, Jerry L. Colby, as well as \nnumerous siblings. This brave young soldier was only 20 years old.\n  The family of Dustin Colby issued the following statement in response \nto the news of their son's death:\n\n       Dustin was a dedicated son, grandson, brother, cousin, \n     nephew, boyfriend, friend and Soldier. He loved life, his \n     family, and being a soldier.\n\n  My deepest sympathy goes out to his family and friends. Specialist \nColby brought happiness to many people, and his memory will never die \nbecause of the impact he had on the people he knew. It is fitting that \nwe pay tribute to his life and his service to his country.\n\n\n                       Sgt. James Daniel Faulkner\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, with a heavy heart and deep sense of \ngratitude I honor the life of a brave young man who grew up in \nClarksville, IN. Sgt. James Daniel Faulkner, 23 years old, died on \nSeptember 8 when the armored personnel carrier he was driving at the \nhead of a convoy was struck by enemy fire in Baghdad. With his entire \nlife before him, James chose to risk everything to fight for the values \nAmericans hold close to our hearts, in a land halfway around the world.\n  James graduated from Clarksville High School in 1999. He attended \nIndiana University Southeast for 1 year before deciding that he wanted \nto seek different opportunities. Shortly thereafter James, along with a \nlongtime friend from high school, joined the Army in November of 2000. \nJames was a combat engineer who served his country with pride. He was \nassigned to the 1st Cavalry's 20th Engineer Battalion, based in Fort \nHood, TX. Just a few weeks ago, James visited with his family for the \nlast time while on leave before returning to Iraq to fulfill his tour \nof duty, which started in March of this year.\n  James was the 34th Hoosier soldier to be killed while serving his \ncountry in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This brave young soldier leaves \nbehind his fiancee, Lisa Moreno, whom he was set to marry in July; his \nmother, Pam Gilkey; his father, James Faulkner; his stepfather; his \nthree sisters; and his two brothers.\n  Today, I join James' family, his friends and all Americans in \nmourning his death. While we struggle to bear our sorrow over this \ntremendous loss, we can also take pride in the example he set, bravely \nfighting to make the world a safer place. It is his courage and \nstrength of character that people will remember when they think of \nJames, a memory that will burn brightly during these continuing days of \nconflict and grief.\n  According to Clarksville High School's director of counseling Pat \nHunt, James had enjoyed athletics and was a strong student. James \nstarred on the track and cross-country teams and was a member of the \nNational Honor Society. He was known by all for his dedicated spirit \nand his love of country. His mother, Pam, recounted a conversation she \nhad with her son to the Louisville Courier-Journal, remembering when \nshe questioned her son's reasons for his recent re-enlistment. She said \nJames replied by simply saying he was ``proud to serve his country.''\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring James' sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of James' actions will live on far longer than any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of James Daniel Faulkner in the \nofficial record of the United States Senate for his service to this \ncountry and for his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and \npeace. When I think about this just cause in which we are engaged, and \nthe unfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope \nthat families like James' can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with James.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9122-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9122-S9124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              OUT OF TIME\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a matter of hours, the assault weapons \nban will expire. That moment will mark a turning point--to the wrong \ndirection--in our effort to reduce gun violence. Criminals, and \npotentially terrorists, will once again have easy access to 19 of the \nhighest powered and most lethal firearms produced. I am disappointed \nthat, despite broad bipartisan support for the ban, the Republican \ncongressional leadership opposes it and President Bush has done little \nor nothing to support this important legislation.\n  At midnight tonight, 19 currently banned assault weapons will become \nlegal once again, as well as firearms that can accept detachable \nmagazines and have more than one of several specific military features, \nsuch as a folding/telescoping stock, protruding pistol grip, bayonet \nmount, threaded muzzle or flash suppressor, barrel shroud or grenade \nlauncher. Common sense tells us that there is no reason for civilians\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\nto have easy access to guns with these features.\n  Over the past year, I have repeatedly urged the Congress to act. I \nbelieve that allowing gun manufacturers to restart production of these \ndangerous weapons will increase their number and availability on our \nstreets and lead to a rise in gun crimes committed with assault \nweapons.\n  Many in the law enforcement community have called the currently \nbanned assault weapons ``the weapons of choice for criminals.'' This is \nwhat the Michigan Association of Chiefs of Police has said about the \nexpiration of the assault weapons ban:\n\n       We are disappointed in the lack of political will to extend \n     a ban that has apparently worked. In the ten years of the \n     ban's life, there has been a 66% reduction in assault weapons \n     traced to crime.\n\n  The MACP has informed me that 14 police officers have been killed in \nthe U.S. by assault weapons already this year. Unfortunately, that the \nnumber will likely rise as the assault weapons ban is allowed to \nexpire.\n  Last week, Police Chief Ervin Portis of Jackson, MI, came to \nWashington, DC in support of reauthorizing the assault weapons ban. \nAccompanying him on this trip was David Harvey, retired chief of police \nof Garden City, MI. Chief Harvey was chief of police on December 31, \n2002, when an armed assailant set out to execute a police officer from \nGarden City. His intended victim was Officer Rodney Donald. Officer \nDonald was shot 7 times with a semi-automatic rifle that contained a \nmagazine with a capacity of 100 rounds. Officer Donald is now \npermanently disabled and unable to perform duties as a police officer. \nThe clip used in this attack is currently banned, but, like many of the \nassault weapons it was designed for, the clip will again become legal \nat midnight.\n  As many of my colleagues know, law enforcement support for the \nassault weapons ban is broad. Supporters include the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, \nthe Police Foundation, the Police Executive Research Forum, the \nInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers, the National Association \nof School Resource Officers, the National Fraternal Order of Police, \nthe National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the \nHispanic American Police Command Officers Association, and the National \nBlack Police Association.\n  On the other side are lobbyists of the National Rifle Association and \ntheir allies in Congress and the White House. The NRA has said that the \nban is ineffective and unnecessary. But this assertion is not supported \nby the facts. According to statistics reported by the Brady Campaign to \nPrevent Gun Violence, from 1990 to 1994, assault weapons named in the \nban constituted 4.82 percent of guns traced in criminal investigations. \nHowever, since the ban's enactment, these assault weapons have made up \nonly 1.61 percent of the crime-related guns traced. It is disturbing \nthat the President has sat back rather than standing up with our \nNation's law enforcement community in support of this critical piece of \ngun safety legislation.\n  The Senate majority leader was quoted in a New York Times article on \nSeptember 9 as saying, ``I think the will of the American people is \nconsistent with letting it expire, so it will expire.'' I am aware of \nno facts to support that statement. In fact, numerous polls have found \nthat large majorities of adults support a reauthorization of the ban. \nIn the very same New York Times article, the House majority leader is \nquoted referring to the Assault weapons ban as ``a feel-good piece of \nlegislation.''\n  On March 2 of this year, I joined with the majority of my colleagues \nin passing an amendment to reauthorize the assault weapons ban for \nanother 10 years. The bill to which it was attached, however, was later \nderailed.\n  Despite the overwhelming support of the law enforcement community, \nthe ongoing threat of terrorism, bipartisan support in the Senate, and \nthe pleas of Americans who have already lost loved ones to assault \nweapons tragedies, it appears the ban will expire at midnight tonight, \nas neither the President nor the Republican congressional leadership is \nwilling to act. Unfortunately, tomorrow morning Americans will wake up \nless secure than they are today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article titled \n``Effort to Renew Weapons Ban Falters on Hill'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the following material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 9, 2004]\n\n              Effort To Renew Weapons Ban Falters on Hill\n\n                        (By Sheryl Gay Stolberg)\n\n       Washington, Sept. 8--Despite widespread popular support, \n     the federal law banning the sale of 19 kinds of semiautomatic \n     assault weapons is almost certain to expire on Monday, the \n     result of intense lobbying by the National Rifle Association \n     and the complicated election-year politics of Washington.\n       While President Bush has expressed support for legislation \n     extending the ban and has said he would sign it into law, he \n     has not pressured lawmakers to act, leading critics to accuse \n     him of trying to have it both ways.\n       Efforts to renew the ban, which polls show is supported by \n     at least two-thirds of Americans, have faltered this year on \n     Capitol Hill. Democrats are well aware that they lost control \n     of the House of Representatives in 1994, the year President \n     Bill Clinton signed the original legislation, and have shied \n     away from the issue of gun control, while Republican leaders \n     have opposed the ban.\n       ``I think the will of the American people is consistent \n     with letting it expire, so it will expire,'' Senator Bill \n     Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said on Wednesday.\n       The House majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay of \n     Texas, dismissed the ban as ``a feel-good piece of \n     legislation'' and said flatly that it would expire Monday, \n     even if Mr. Bush made an effort to renew it.\n       ``If the president asked me, it would still be no,'' Mr. \n     DeLay said. ``He knows, because we don't have the votes to \n     pass the assault weapons ban. It will expire Monday, and \n     that's that.''\n       Democrats decried the influence of the rifle association \n     and said the ban could be renewed if the president wanted it \n     to.\n       ``If you support something, you have a responsibility to \n     advocate for it,'' said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the \n     California Democrat and chief sponsor of the ban's renewal. \n     Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, who was a \n     lead sponsor of the ban 10 years ago when he was in the \n     House, blamed ``a dysfunction of our politics'' for what he \n     called ``this Alice in Wonderland situation of repealing a \n     law that everyone agrees has been overwhelmingly \n     successful.''\n       The act prohibits, by name, the sale of 19 specific weapons \n     that have the features of guns used by the military, and also \n     outlaws magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of \n     ammunition. While backers acknowledge that the law is riddled \n     with loopholes, they cite federal statistics showing crimes \n     traceable to assault weapons have declined by two-thirds \n     since the law went into effect.\n       But the N.R.A., which has made overturning the ban its top \n     legislative priority, says the law bans only ``cosmetic \n     accessories'' on guns, and does little other than place a \n     burden on gun manufacturers. ``We felt from the very start it \n     was bogus legislation,'' Wayne LaPierre, the association's \n     chief executive, said.\n       On Wednesday, in a last-ditch effort to persuade lawmakers \n     to renew the law, supporters of the ban--including police \n     chiefs from around the country and victims of gun violence \n     and their relatives--converged on Washington for a news \n     conference.\n       Tom Mauser, whose 15-year-old son, Daniel, was killed in \n     the 1999 massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, \n     arrived wearing his son's sneakers and took them off while \n     addressing reporters, a pointed physical reminder of his \n     loss.\n       James S. Brady, the former White House press secretary who \n     suffered brain damage after being shot in the head by a \n     handgun during the 1981 assassination attempt on President \n     Ronald Reagan, sat, mostly silent, in a wheelchair.\n       ``The assault weapons are coming, they're coming next \n     week,'' warned Mr. Brady's wife, Sarah, who has been a vocal \n     advocate for restrictions on gun ownership for the past two \n     decades.\n       Noting that Mr. Reagan had supported the weapons ban in \n     1994, Mrs. Brady said she felt deserted by the party she and \n     her husband had worked so hard for. ``I am angry,'' she said. \n     ``I am angry at our president. I'm so disappointed.''\n       The White House press secretary, Scott McClellan, repeated \n     on Wednesday that ''the president supports the \n     reauthorization of the current law.'' But when asked by \n     reporters what, if anything, Mr. Bush was doing to make that \n     happen, Mr. McClellan replied: ``The president doesn't set \n     the Congressional timetable. Congress sets the timetable. \n     And the president's views are very clear.''\n       Democrats hit hard at Mr. Bush. ``We cry out for \n     leadership,'' said Senator Schumer, adding that, ``The \n     president talks about flip-flops. Well, flip: I'm for it. \n     Flop: House, don't do anything, don't pass it.''\n       The Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John Kerry of \n     Massachusetts, supports renewing the ban, and took a break \n     from campaigning earlier this year to return to the Senate \n     when it came up for a vote as part of a broader piece of gun \n     legislation. Fifty-two senators voted in favor of renewing \n     the ban, but the underlying measure was defeated.\n\n[[Page S9124]]\n\n       On Wednesday, a senior adviser to Mr. Kerry, Joe Lockhart, \n     signaled that the ban would become a campaign issue. He said \n     that Mr. Kerry planned to discuss the ban Monday, at an event \n     timed to coincide with its expiration. Mr. Kerry, he said, \n     ``believes the cynical deal between the president and the \n     House Republican leadership, hiding behind procedure, is \n     completely unacceptable.''\n       A poll released this week by the Annenberg Public Policy \n     Center of the University of Pennsylvania found that 68 \n     percent of Americans--and 32 percent of N.R.A. members--\n     support renewing the ban. The findings, drawn from interviews \n     with 4,959 adults, had a margin of sampling error of plus or \n     minus one percentage point.\n       A separate national survey, conducted by Doug Schoen, a \n     Democratic pollster, on behalf of the Brady Campaign to \n     Prevent Gun Violence, found that 74 percent of voters support \n     renewing the ban, but that support is highest--79 percent--\n     among independent voters who are being courted by President \n     Bush and Mr. Kerry. That survey of 800 voters had a margin of \n     error of three percentage points.\n       Mr. Schoen, who is not advising the Kerry campaign, also \n     surveyed voters in the swing states of Ohio, Florida and \n     Pennsylvania and concluded that support for the ban was high \n     enough to make it a significant issue. ``If Kerry wants to \n     distinguish his position from Bush, this provides a very \n     convenient vehicle,'' he said.\n       But over all, Democrats have not talked much about the \n     weapons ban. Senator Patty Murray, the Washington Democrat \n     who is in a tough re-election fight, said voters, unaware \n     that the ban was set to expire, had not made it an issue, and \n     that neither had she.\n       ``There are so many issues, education and health care and \n     jobs and the economy in my state right now,'' Ms. Murray \n     said. ``People are really focused on that.''\n       And over the years the ban has been a losing issue for \n     Democrats. After Republicans took control of the House in \n     1994, President Clinton remarked that the ban might have cost \n     Democrats 20 seats. Some believe that former Vice President \n     Al Gore lost crucial states, including his home state, \n     Tennessee, in the 2000 election because he came out too \n     strongly for gun control.\n       Even the ban's chief Democratic backers in Congress, \n     Senator Feinstein and Representative Carolyn McCarthy of New \n     York, acknowledged that Democrats were afraid to be too vocal \n     in their support. ``In the small states in particular, and \n     the rural states, the control of the N.R.A. is much \n     greater,'' said Ms. Feinstein, adding, They will specifically \n     target a member, including a House member, and go after \n     them.''\n       The N.R.A. has also said it will not endorse a candidate \n     for president until after Congress recesses for the fall \n     election, a pronouncement that the ban's backers say is \n     tantamount to a threat not to endorse Mr. Bush until the ban \n     expires. Mr. LaPierre said the claim was ``100 percent \n     untrue.'' But he blamed Democrats for the bill's undoing, \n     saying they had tried, unwisely, to use it to gain political \n     advantage when Mr. Clinton was president.\n       ``I guess you could say politics is what enacted it in the \n     first place,'' he said. ``Politics is going to be the undoing \n     of it.''\n       On Wednesday, as the police chiefs and victims' relatives \n     fanned out across Capitol Hill to lobby lawmakers, a chief \n     target was the House speaker, Representative J. Dennis \n     Hastert of Illinois. In recent weeks, advocates for the ban \n     have been approaching Mr. Hastert at bookstores around the \n     country, where he has been signing copies of his new \n     autobiography, ``Speaker.''\n       Several, including Mr. Mauser, said that Mr. Hastert seemed \n     supportive. ``He said yes, I support that,'' said Penny \n     Okamoto, who said she saw Mr. Hastert on Aug. 16 at a Barnes \n     & Noble store in Beaverton, Ore. ``I was so surprised, I \n     actually asked him twice.''\n       But on Wednesday, the speaker was noncommittal, saying that \n     if the Senate was to adopt the bill, ``then we'll take a look \n     at it.''\n       Mr. Mauser said he was not satisfied with that, and would \n     knock on Mr. Hastert's door on Thursday. He said that he had \n     already spoken with an aide to his own congressman, \n     Representative Tom Tancredo, a Republican who opposes the \n     ban, and that the meeting did not go well.\n       ``It ended on a pretty bad note,'' Mr. Mauser said. ``Not \n     even a shake of the hand.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9124-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9124-S9125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, nurses are an invaluable \nresource for the VA health care system, as well as for health care \nsystems the world over. As such, VA has established nurse-managed \nprimary care clinics at many of its medical centers. These clinics are \nrun by nurse practitioners who serve as independent practitioners with \nprescriptive authority and a focus on delivering cost-effective, \nefficient, high quality care. I am pleased to say that on July 6, 2004, \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, of which I am ranking \nmember, received VA's favorable report on these clinics, entitled, \n``Nurse-Managed Primary Care Clinics Evaluation.''\n  To complete this report, VA identified three clinics in three VISNs: \nFergus Falls, MN; Denver, CO; and Madison, WI. VA then evaluated \npatient satisfaction, access to care, provider experiences, functional \nstatus of patients receiving care, cost of care, and waiting times. \nOverall, the report concluded that veterans seem immensely satisfied \nwith the care they receive at the clinics and that the costs associated \nwith them are reasonable. I am very proud of the success of these \nclinics, though not at all surprised by the quality of care provided by \nVA's nurse practitioners.\n  The patients surveyed at the three clinics stated that they were \nhighly satisfied with the services received there, especially in terms \nof length of time spent waiting at the office, time spent with the \nveteran, explanation of what was done for the patient, technical skills \nand personal manner of staff, as well as the overall visit. In \naddition, 67 percent of the veterans served by these clinics rated them \ngood on wait times, convenience of the office location, and the ability \nto get through to the office by telephone.\n  The Nurse-Managed Primary Care Clinics Evaluation resulted from a \nJune 14, 2001, hearing conducted by the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs. At this hearing, in-depth discussion about innovations at a \nnurse-managed clinic took place. Subsequently, nurse recruitment and \nretention provisions were included in Public Law 107-135, which \nincluded an evaluation of nurse-managed health care clinics in VA. I am \npleased that the committee was able to effect the survey that resulted \nin this extremely encouraging report.\n  Currently, VA employs 36,000 registered nurses, approximately 6 \npercent of which are nurse practitioners. Nurses have long been \nrecognized by VA, as well as those of us who oversee it, as \nindispensable to the delivery of health care. In fact, according to a \n1999 article by M.O. Mundinger in Nursing Economics, nurse \npractitioners are able to effectively provide 90 percent of the \nservices primary care physicians do. In recognizing the great value \nnurses hold, VA has done all it can to foster and fully utilize these \nessential members of the health care community. Its nurse-managed \nprimary care clinics are one important, and successful, facet of this \neffort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9125-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9125-S9126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NAMING OF THE USS ``SOMERSET''\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I wish to rise today to recognize \nMarie Swajeski, founder of the Children's Repertory Theatre, now known \nas the Delaware Children's Theatre. Marie has dedicated her life to \nchildren and the theater. She literally has touched the lives of \nthousands.\n  Marie was born in Philadelphia, PA to the late David and Helen \nMondillo. Growing up in Philadelphia, she met her husband John at a \ndance hall shortly before World War II. They married a few years later \nin 1949. The couple moved to Delaware in 1951 when John took a job at \nDupont.\n  Marie's passion for the theater and to make people happy began at an \nearly age. She carried this kindred spirit through adulthood and began \ndirection of theatrical productions in the 1960s for the Ardensingers \nCandlelight Dinner Theatre and the Catholic Youth Organization. She \nbecame involved in both adult and children's activities, and in 1969 \nbecame chairwoman of the opera society's Junior Division, today known \nas the Family Opera Theatre. Marie's community theater experience \ninvolvement spans a wide variety of activities, including actor, \ndirector, choreographer, producer, and theater arts instructor.\n  But Marie had a dream and a desire to do more. She wanted to leave a \nlegacy for generations to come. In 1973, she founded and became the \nartistic director of the Children's Repertory Theatre, now known as the \nDelaware Children's Theatre, DCT. Rehearsing in various basements and \ngarages, a touring company of children and adults was formed to bring \nprofessional quality theater to schools, parks, retirement and nursing \nhomes, hospitals, and colleges throughout Delaware.\n  Marie set her goals and standards high. At the time, many people \nthought that there would be little interest in children's theater. \nMarie proved them wrong. She was a true pioneer. Her strong belief that \nchildren would benefit from watching and participating in live theater \ncarried her through this challenging period of time.\n  She assembled an army of enthusiasts and volunteers who shared her \nvision. For the next 10 years, they conducted educational workshops for \nchildren. DCT received grant money from the Delaware Arts Council in \nthe early years to perform and tour schools throughout the State. In \nits first decade, DCT presented to critical acclaim over 700 \nperformances to more than 90,000 children.\n  Over the years, the demand for more children's theater began to grow. \nThe Delaware Children's Theatre needed a home. In 1984, the DCT bought \nthe New Century Club Building on Delaware Avenue in Wilmington. It \nbecame more than just a theater to house productions; it has become a \nmagical second home to thousands of children.\n  DCT has served others as well since its inception. In the early \nyears, the DCT offered free summer workshops for underprivileged \nchildren. DCT's outreach group, The Rainbow Players, often performs at \nthe Ronald McDonald House, River Fest--benefiting The Boys & Girls \nClub--Ministry of Caring, and nursing homes.\n  It is through Marie's hard work and perseverance that the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of children have been changed. She has helped \nshape and enrich the lives of thousands on the stage of the theater, \nand in the hearts of those who have been lucky enough to call her their \nfriend. I rise today to honor and thank Marie for her selfless \ndedication to the betterment of others. She truly is a remarkable woman \nand a testament to the community she represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9126-2", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9126-S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN MEMORIUM OF THE REVEREND DR. BROOKS E. REYNOLDS, SR.\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few \nmoments today to reflect on the life of a remarkable Delawarean, Rev. \nDr. Brooks Reynolds, upon his passing at the age of 88. Dr. Reynolds \nwas among the most remarkable men I have been privileged to know in all \nof the years I have lived in Delaware. Throughout his life, he \ndemonstrated tremendous courage and integrity. He was a man with a kind \nheart, great abilities, and boundless energy. Unlike most people who \nare looking for ways to slow down when they turn 80 years old, Brooks \nReynolds kept picking up the pace. In the way he lived his own life, \nDr. Reynolds reminded each of us how good we can be.\n  The Rev. Dr. Brooks E. Reynolds, Sr., was born in Shortly, DE, on \nNovember 2, 1915, to the late John and Lida Rickards Reynolds. Upon \ncompleting high school in Georgetown in 1933, he attended Goldey \nCollege, now known as Goldey Beacom College, in Wilmington and \nWashington College in Chestertown, MD, before earning a bachelor's \ndegree in education and a master's degree in sacred theology from \nTemple University in Philadelphia, PA. His doctorate of divinity degree \nwas earned at Howard University in Washington, DC.\n  Dr. Reynolds was lucky enough to have found love twice in his life. \nHe married Grace Collins Reynolds in 1939 and together they served a \nnumber of churches beginning in Hooper's Island, MD, in 1938, a part of \nthe former Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Church. Grace passed \naway in 1993.\n  His dear friend, Beatrice Simonds, was an important part of his \nlatest ministries and they spent many happy years together before his \npassing. She describes him as having ``personality plus.'' In Bea's \nwords, ``If there ever was a God on earth, he was.''\n  In 1945, Dr. Reynolds was called to start a new church in Wilmington \nManor just south of Wilmington, DE. Beginning with meetings in a \nprivate home, the church grew through two building programs and the \nrenaming to Asbury United Methodist Church. It had a membership of 2300 \nwhen Dr. Reynolds was reassigned to Bethesda United Methodist Church in \nSalisbury, MD, in 1974.\n  Dr. Reynolds first retired in 1986 but returned to active ministry to \nserve three additional pastorates, most recently Christ United \nMethodist Church in Laurel from 1999 to 2001, where I was once \nprivileged to speak as a lay person while Governor of Delaware. In \n1954, he became the first chaplain of the Delaware State Police and in \n2003 was awarded the first Delaware State Police emeritus status with \npromotion to major. Dr. Reynolds also served as the chaplain for the \nDelaware State Hospital.\n  Other significant past affiliations included the chaplaincy of \nGovernor Bacon Health Center in Delaware City, secretary of the board \nof evangelism and president of the board of trustees of the Peninsula \nConference Board of Hospital and Homes, and president of the trustees \nof the Manor House in Seaford. He was a 32nd degree Mason and Past \nGrand Chaplain of the Masonic Lodge of Delaware.\n  Dr. Reynolds will always be remembered by me and by the tens of \nthousands of people whose lives he touched and enriched as a kind and \ncompassionate man who loved all people. He saw no distinction between \ncolor, gender, race, or creed. He was a visionary in every sense of the \nword. Life was about growth, and he was always trying to find new ways \nto reach out to people. When the church had no money, Dr. Reynolds \nbought a bus to transport people to church who otherwise had no way of \ncoming to church. The bus transported parishioners, children to Sunday \nschool, and to day care. Some 300 children rode his buses. The church's \nfleet of buses expanded to include 27 buses.\n  Dr. Reynolds had a great sense of humor and was known for telling \nfabulous stories. One of my favorite all-time quotations came from him, \ntoo. ``The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.'' He \noften injected humor into his sermons and had a quick wit. He was a \ngenuine person, and was not just comfortable to be around; he was a joy \nto be around.\n  Dr. Reynolds is survived by his sons, Brooks E.

BROOKS E. REYNOLDS, SR.\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few \nmoments today to reflect on the life of a remarkable Delawarean, Rev. \nDr. Brooks Reynolds, upon his passing at the age of 88. Dr. Reynolds \nwas among the most remarkable men I have been privileged to know in all \nof the years I have lived in Delaware. Throughout his life, he \ndemonstrated tremendous courage and integrity. He was a man with a kind \nheart, great abilities, and boundless energy. Unlike most people who \nare looking for ways to slow down when they turn 80 years old, Brooks \nReynolds kept picking up the pace. In the way he lived his own life, \nDr. Reynolds reminded each of us how good we can be.\n  The Rev. Dr. Brooks E. Reynolds, Sr., was born in Shortly, DE, on \nNovember 2, 1915, to the late John and Lida Rickards Reynolds. Upon \ncompleting high school in Georgetown in 1933, he attended Goldey \nCollege, now known as Goldey Beacom College, in Wilmington and \nWashington College in Chestertown, MD, before earning a bachelor's \ndegree in education and a master's degree in sacred theology from \nTemple University in Philadelphia, PA. His doctorate of divinity degree \nwas earned at Howard University in Washington, DC.\n  Dr. Reynolds was lucky enough to have found love twice in his life. \nHe married Grace Collins Reynolds in 1939 and together they served a \nnumber of churches beginning in Hooper's Island, MD, in 1938, a part of \nthe former Wilmington Conference of the Methodist Church. Grace passed \naway in 1993.\n  His dear friend, Beatrice Simonds, was an important part of his \nlatest ministries and they spent many happy years together before his \npassing. She describes him as having ``personality plus.'' In Bea's \nwords, ``If there ever was a God on earth, he was.''\n  In 1945, Dr. Reynolds was called to start a new church in Wilmington \nManor just south of Wilmington, DE. Beginning with meetings in a \nprivate home, the church grew through two building programs and the \nrenaming to Asbury United Methodist Church. It had a membership of 2300 \nwhen Dr. Reynolds was reassigned to Bethesda United Methodist Church in \nSalisbury, MD, in 1974.\n  Dr. Reynolds first retired in 1986 but returned to active ministry to \nserve three additional pastorates, most recently Christ United \nMethodist Church in Laurel from 1999 to 2001, where I was once \nprivileged to speak as a lay person while Governor of Delaware. In \n1954, he became the first chaplain of the Delaware State Police and in \n2003 was awarded the first Delaware State Police emeritus status with \npromotion to major. Dr. Reynolds also served as the chaplain for the \nDelaware State Hospital.\n  Other significant past affiliations included the chaplaincy of \nGovernor Bacon Health Center in Delaware City, secretary of the board \nof evangelism and president of the board of trustees of the Peninsula \nConference Board of Hospital and Homes, and president of the trustees \nof the Manor House in Seaford. He was a 32nd degree Mason and Past \nGrand Chaplain of the Masonic Lodge of Delaware.\n  Dr. Reynolds will always be remembered by me and by the tens of \nthousands of people whose lives he touched and enriched as a kind and \ncompassionate man who loved all people. He saw no distinction between \ncolor, gender, race, or creed. He was a visionary in every sense of the \nword. Life was about growth, and he was always trying to find new ways \nto reach out to people. When the church had no money, Dr. Reynolds \nbought a bus to transport people to church who otherwise had no way of \ncoming to church. The bus transported parishioners, children to Sunday \nschool, and to day care. Some 300 children rode his buses. The church's \nfleet of buses expanded to include 27 buses.\n  Dr. Reynolds had a great sense of humor and was known for telling \nfabulous stories. One of my favorite all-time quotations came from him, \ntoo. ``The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.'' He \noften injected humor into his sermons and had a quick wit. He was a \ngenuine person, and was not just comfortable to be around; he was a joy \nto be around.\n  Dr. Reynolds is survived by his sons, Brooks E. Reynolds, Jr., of \nTopeka, KS, and State Representative Bruce C. Reynolds and his wife, \nKathleen, of Bear, DE, as well as by seven grandchildren, Ty, Lyda, \nBlair, Bret and Chad Reynolds, Mary Bock, and Brian Seals, and one \ngreat-granddaughter, Tara Leek.\n  I rise today to commemorate Dr. Reynolds, to celebrate his life, and \nto offer his family my support. Dr. Reynolds embodied the best of \nDelaware, and he will be sorely missed by us all.\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9127-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  IN HONOR OF DONALD R.

Mr. President, I will make a few remarks \nconcerning NASCAR and our soldiers at Walter Reed.\n  On June 3, I attended a Memorial Day dinner at the Walter Reed Army \nHospital honoring our country's wounded soldiers. I occasionally visit \nthe hospital to pay my respects to our country's wounded heroes. On \nthis occasion, however, I had the opportunity to meet two of NASCAR's \ngreatest drivers, Rusty Wallace and Jimmie Johnson, who were also \nparticipating in this event. Many of the soldiers at the hospital \nfollow NASCAR, and the racers' appearance at the hospital lifted the \nspirits of both wounded soldiers and dedicated hospital staff members. \nI am sure Rusty and Jimmie would agree with me when I say that nothing \nis more humbling or gratifying than meeting these real-life heroes, the \nmen and women who have served our country in such a noble manner. I \nwant to personally thank Rusty Wallace and Jimmie Johnson for taking \nthe time to share in this rewarding experience. They too are great \npatriots giving of their time to recognize these heroes.\n  Walter Reed Army Hospital is an amazing place. I have seen firsthand \nwhy it is the Nation's most effective military health care facility. \nOur soldiers and those who represent all the other military services \nare the reason that America is the paramount military force in the \nworld today.\n  The caregivers at Walter Reed, Bethesda and military hospitals \noverseas are some of America's great unsung heroes. They are the \ndoctors and nurses who are responsible for helping our soldiers get \nwell and back to their families or in uniform as soon as possible. \nTheir needs and concerns are equally important to me and my colleagues. \nWith the help of these doctors and nurses, our military services are \nimproving the quality of care provided to soldiers, their family \nmembers, our veterans and retirees. Most of these soldiers were doing \nwell although most had received serious wounds. Their loyalty to their \nbrothers at arms and to America is inspiring. We sent them there in our \nplace so we would be safer at home. And they have performed superbly. \nJimmie and Rusty understand that all of us, whether racer, politician, \ncritic, or protestor, enjoy the good life in this country because of \nthe courage of the soldier, their willingness to serve for us.\n  NASCAR and its fans love America. Their skills and their cars reflect \nour freedom and the technological skills that make us world leaders. It \nwas a great thing, that these super stars found time in their hectic \nand intense schedule to provide comfort, sympathy, and inspiration to \nthese who have sacrificed for us. I thank them for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9127-3", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9127-4", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations, a withdrawal and a treaty which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9127-5", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9127-S9130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-9055.

A bill to permit athletes to receive nonimmigrant status \nunder certain conditions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \naddress the inability of promising, talented young athletes from other \ncountries to play for sports teams in the United States, such as the \nMAINEiacs, a junior league hockey team in Lewiston, ME. This year's \nshortage of H-2B nonimmigrant visas for temporary or seasonal \nnonagricultural foreign workers is a matter of great concern to me and \nto many in my home State of Maine. In early March, the U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services announced that the congressionally mandated \ncap of 66,000 H-2B visas would soon be met. It immediately stopped \naccepting applications for these visas. This meant that thousands of \nemployers in Maine and across the United States who rely on the H-2B \nprogram have been in a very difficult position this summer.\n  For example, Maine's tourism and hospitality industry, as well as its \nforest products industry, have been particularly hard-pressed to find \nenough American workers to keep their businesses running at normal \nlevels during what is their busiest time of year. What many people do \nnot know, however, is that the H-2B visa shortage has also meant that \nhundreds of promising athletes have been unable to come to the United \nStates to play for minor league and amateur sports teams across the \nNation.\n  Those affected by the H-2B problem are not confined to just one \nindustry or one State. That is why I cosponsored two pieces of \nlegislation that would immediately address this problem: S. 2252, the \nSave the Summer Act, introduced by Senator Kennedy, and S. 2258, the \nSummer Operations and Services (SOS) Relief and Reform Act, introduced \nby Senators Hatch and Chambliss. The former would increase the H-2B \nvisa cap by 40,000 this fiscal year, while the\n\n[[Page S9132]]\n\nlatter would exclude from the cap returning foreign workers who were \ncounted against the cap within the past 2 years. It has become clear, \nhowever, that until this legislation comes before the full Senate for a \nvote, we must continue to actively seek alternative solutions to this \nproblem.\n  One issue we must address is the problem facing the many minor league \nprofessional teams, as well as junior league hockey teams, that rely on \nH-2B visas. Without these visas, sports teams in Maine and across the \nNation have been unable to bring some of their most talented prospects \nto the United States. Major League sports have also lost a traditional \nsource of talent for their teams.\n  In my home State of Maine, for example, the Lewiston MAINEiacs, a \nCanadian junior hockey league team, has been unable to obtain the H-2b \nvisas necessary for the majority of its players to remain in the United \nStates to play in the team's first home games this September. Although \nthese players range in age from 16 to 20, the majority of them are \nbetween 16 and 18 years old and are required during the hockey season \nto balance the demands of athletics and academics. These scholar-\nathletes are among Canada's most talented junior players, but due to \nthe shortage of H-2B visas, they are in danger of missing out on a \ntremendous opportunity to improve their skills and, possibly, graduate \nto a career in professional hockey. In addition, for each home game \nthat the team must cancel or reschedule, the economic impact on the \ncity of Lewiston, and nearby Auburn, in terms of lost hotel and \nrestaurant revenue will be considerable.\n\n  The Portland Sea Dogs, a Double-A level baseball team affiliated with \nthe Boston Red Sox, also relies on H-2B visas to bring several of its \nmost skilled players to the United States. Thousands of fans come out \neach year to see this team, and others like it across the country, play \nwhat is arguably one of America's favorite sports. This year, however, \napproximately 300 talented young, foreign baseball players have been \nprevented from coming to the U.S. to play for minor league teams, a \nproving ground for athletes hoping to make it to the Major Leagues.\n  The P-1 nonimmigrant visa is used by athletes who are deemed by the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as performing at an \n``internationally recognized level of performance.'' Unfortunately, \nUSCIS has interpreted this visa category to exclude these talented \nminor and amateur league athletes. This visa is typically reserved for \nonly those athletes who have already been promoted to Major League \nsports. However, none of these promising athletes is likely to earn a \nMajor League contract if the players are not first permitted to hone \ntheir skills, and to prove themselves, in the minor leagues. This \nproblem can easily be solved by expanding the P-1 visa category to \ninclude minor league athletes, as well as those amateur-level athletes, \nlike the Lewiston MAINEiacs, who have demonstrated a significant \nlikelihood of graduating to the major leagues.\n  I have received a letter from officials from Major League Baseball, \nwhich strongly supports the expansion of the P-1 visa category to \ninclude professional minor league baseball players. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print this letter in the Record. As the League points out, \nby making P-1 visas available to this group of athletes, teams would be \nable to make player development decisions based on the talent of its \nplayers, without being constrained by visa quotas. The P-1 category, \nthe League argues, is appropriate for minor league players because \nthese are the players that the Major League Clubs have selected as some \nof the best baseball prospects in the world.\n  There is no question that Americans are passionate about sports. We \nhave high expectations for our teams, and demand only the best from our \nathletes. By expanding the P-1 visa category, we will make it possible \nfor athletes to be selected based on talent and skill, rather than \nnationality. I ask that we act quickly to amend the law to make this \npossible.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Major League Baseball,\n\n\n                                   Office of the Commissioner,\n\n                                                    July 22, 2004.\n     Re Legislation for Nonimmigrant Alien Status for Certain \n         Athletes.\n\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senator from Maine, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I write to express Major League \n     Baseball's support for your efforts on behalf of Minor League \n     professional baseball players. We understand that you are \n     considering sponsoring legislation that will enable Minor \n     League players to obtain P-1 work visas to perform in the \n     United States.\n       Currently, foreign players under Minor League contracts are \n     required to obtain H-2B (temporary worker) work visas to \n     perform in the United States. The United States Citizenship \n     and Immigration Services stopped accepting H-2B visa \n     applications in March this year, citing the nationwide cap in \n     the number of such visas that can be issued. That action has \n     prevented approximately 300 young baseball players from \n     performing in the Minor Leagues in the United States this \n     season and developing their skills in the hopes of becoming \n     Major League players.\n       Minor League experience is crucial in developing the best \n     possible Major League players. Unlike other professional \n     athletes, baseball players almost invariably cannot go \n     directly from high school or college to the Major Leagues. \n     Almost all need substantial experience in the Minor Leagues \n     to develop their talents and skills to Major League quality. \n     To get that necessary experience, young players are signed by \n     Major League Clubs and assigned to play for Minor League \n     affiliates throughout the United States, such as the Eastern \n     League's Portland Sea Dogs in your state.\n       The Major League Clubs are currently able to use only 81% \n     of the H-2B visas the Department of Labor allowed them for \n     this season, because current laws prevented them from making \n     decisions in the late spring and throughout the summer to \n     promote foreign prospects to United States affiliates. Major \n     League Clubs sign players from the Dominican Republic and \n     Venezuela and assign them at first to affiliates in those \n     countries, then seek to promote them to affiliates in the \n     United States as players' skills progress. Typically, a Club \n     would seek to promote 3-5 players per season to Minor League \n     affiliates in the United States, but the visa restrictions \n     this year have made those promotions impossible. We have \n     learned that at least several Clubs shied away from drafting \n     foreign (mostly Canadian) players whom they otherwise might \n     have selected in the annual First-Year Player Draft in June, \n     because those Clubs knew there would be no opportunity for \n     those players to begin their professional careers in the \n     United States this season. For the Canadian players who were \n     drafted this past June, signings have declined 80% from 2003. \n     These results of the current visa laws have deprived Minor \n     League fans across America from seeing the best young players \n     possible perform for affiliates of the Major League Baseball \n     Clubs and have affected the quality and attractiveness of \n     those affiliates.\n       Under your leadership, congressional legislation could, by \n     sensibly making available P-1 visas to professional Minor \n     League athletes, ensure that the best baseball prospects from \n     around the world will get the opportunity to develop here in \n     the United States, without the constraint that the H-2B visa \n     cap imposes. The National Association of Professional \n     Baseball Leagues, Inc., also known as Minor League Baseball, \n     shares our support of your legislation. The Major League \n     Baseball Players Association also supports allowing the best \n     young players to develop here in the United States.\n       Major League Baseball hopes that your Senate colleagues \n     will follow your leadership and pursue a legislative remedy \n     to a problem that is threatening to weaken Baseball's Minor \n     League system.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Richard L. Alderson,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                              Baseball Operations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2793. A bill to remove civil liability barriers that discourage \nthe donation of fire equipment to volunteer fire companies; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Good \nSamaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2004.'' On September \n11, 2001, the Nation witnessed the tragic loss of hundreds of heroic \nfirefighters. Amazingly, every year quality firefighting equipment \nworth millions of dollars is wasted. In order to avoid civil liability \nlawsuits, heavy industry and wealthier fire departments destroy surplus \nequipment, including hoses, fire trucks, protective gear and breathing \napparatus, instead of donating it to volunteer fire departments.\n  The basic purpose of this legislation is to induce donations of \nsurplus firefighting equipment by reducing the threat of civil \nliability for organizations, most commonly heavy industry, and \nindividuals who wish to make these donations. The bill eliminates civil \nliability barriers to donations of surplus firefighting equipment by \nraising the liability standard for donors from ``negligence'' to \n``gross negligence.''\n\n[[Page S9133]]\n\n  The ``Good Samaritan Volunteer Firefighter Assistance Act of 2004'' \nis modeled after a bill passed by the Texas State legislature in 1997 \nand signed into law by then-Governor George W. Bush which has resulted \nin more than $6 million in additional equipment donations from \ncompanies and other fire departments for volunteer departments which \nmay not be as well equipped. Now companies in Texas can donate surplus \nequipment to the Texas Forest Service, which then certifies the \nequipment and passes it on to volunteer fire departments that are in \nneed. The donated equipment must meet all original specifications \nbefore it can be sent to volunteer departments. Arizona, Missouri, \nIndiana, and South Carolina have passed similar legislation at the \nstate level.\n  The legislation saves taxpayer dollars by encouraging donations, \nthereby reducing the taxpayers' burden of purchasing expensive \nequipment for volunteer fire departments. in the 107th Congress, \nRepresentative Castle introduced the Good Samaritan Volunteer \nFirefighter Assistance Act which had 104 bipartisan cosponsors in the \nHouse of Representatives. It is also supported by the National \nVolunteer Fire Council, the Firemen's Association of the State of New \nYork, and a former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(FEMA), James Lee Witt. The bill has been reintroduced as H.R. 1787 in \nthe 108th Congress.\n  This bill does not cost taxpayer dollars nor does it create \nadditional bureaucracies to inspect equipment. The bill eliminates \nunnecessary inspection bureaucracies. This is for three reasons. First, \nbureaucracies are not necessary for inspections because the fire chiefs \nmake the inspections themselves. Second, some of the State \nbureaucracies control who gets the equipment. These donations are \nprivate property transactions, not a good that is donated to the State, \nallowing the State to pick who will get the equipment. Third, there is \nno desire to create the temptation for waste, fraud, and abuse in a \nState bureaucracy in charge of picking winners and losers.\n  The bill reflects the purpose of the Texas State law. Federally, \nprecedent for similar measures includes the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan \nFood Act (Public Law 104-210), named for the late Representative Bill \nEmerson, which encourages restaurants, hotels and businesses to donate \nmillions of dollars worth of food. The Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 \n(Public Law 105-101) also immunizes individuals who do volunteer work \nfor non-profit organizations or governmental entities from liability \nfor ordinary negligence in the course of their volunteer work. I have \nalso previously introduced three Good Samaritan measures in the 106th \nCongress, S. 843, S. 844 and S. 845. These provisions were also \nincluded in a broader charitable package in S. 997, the Charity \nEmpowerment Act, to provide additional incentives for corporate in-kind \ncharitable contributions for motor vehicle, aircraft, and facility use. \nThe same provision passed the House of Representatives in the 107th \nCongress as part of H.R. 7, the Community Solutions Act, in July of \n2001, but was not signed into law.\n  Volunteers comprise approximately 73 percent of firefighters in the \nUnited States. Of the total estimated 1,078,300 firefighters across the \ncountry, 784,700 are volunteer. Of the more than 30,000 fire \ndepartments in the country, approximately 22,600 are all volunteer; \n4,800 are mostly volunteer; 1,600 are mostly career; and 2,000 are all \ncareer. In 2000, 58 of the 103 firefighters who died in the line of \nduty were volunteers.\n  This legislation provides a commonsense incentive for additional \ncontributions to volunteer fire departments around the country and \nwould make it more attractive for corporations to give equipment to \nfire departments in other states. All of America has witnessed the \nheroic acts of selflessness and sacrifice of firefighters in New York \nCity and in the Washington, D.C. area. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin supporting this incentive for the provision of additional safety \nequipment for volunteer firefighters who put their lives on the line \nevery day throughout this great nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 2794. A bill to improve elementary and secondary education; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join my colleagues to \nintroduce the No Child Left Behind Improvement Act. Our goal is to \nchart a better course for bringing the reforms under the law to all \nstudents across the country.\n  I was proud to stand with President Bush in January 2002 as he signed \nthe No Child Left Behind Act into law. At that time, Republicans and \nDemocrats came together to recognize the need to create a strong \neducation system where every child attends a good school with a good \nteacher. Together, we recognized the importance of achieving that goal \nfor the future of our democracy, economy, and national defense.\n  In drafting the No Child Left Behind Act in a bipartisan manner, we \nmade great progress from the days when Democrats and Republicans were \nlight years apart on school reform, with some trying to abolish the \nU.S. Department of Education and privatize our public schools.\n  No Child Left Behind made improving our public schools a national \npriority. It laid the cornerstone for a solid accountability system in \nevery State. It called for high academic standards in reading, math, \nand science, and high-quality tests to measure progress toward those \nstandards. For the first time, it placed our low-income children, \nchildren with disabilities, minority children, and English language \nlearners at the top of the school reform agenda. No longer would their \nneeds be hidden, overlooked, or ignored.\n  It also provided the building blocks for quality in all schools. A \nfully-qualified teacher in every classroom and better teacher training \nto make it happen. More after-school tutoring and supplemental services \nto help students with the greatest needs. Special programs for English \nlanguage learners. Expanded support for reading in early grades. School \nreport cards to provide information to parents and motivate them to be \npart of their children's education.\n  No Child Left Behind promised a great deal to our students and to \ntheir families. It's still the right promise. But it hasn't been kept.\n  Since the law passed, the country has seen the promise of funding No \nChild Left Behind flagrantly broken by the Bush administration, time \nand time again. President Bush proposed to cut funding for the law by \n$90 million just 1 month after signing the bill. His next education \nbudget cut funding by far more--$1.2 billion.\n  Today, he's leaving 4.6 million children behind, and he's \nunderfunding the law by $9.4 billion. At the same time, President Bush \nproposes to give tax breaks for the top 1 percent of Americans that \ntotal five times the funds promised but never delivered under the No \nChild Left Behind Act.\n  Despite these broken promises, our schools are trying to do their \npart. They've been asked to help all students reach proficiency, and \nthey are responding. Teachers and other school professionals are \nbeginning the hard work of tackling disparities in student achievement, \nand putting into place the curriculum needed to turn-around thousands \nof schools that have been identified as needing improvement.\n  School leaders are struggling to respond to the challenges of \nproviding more highly qualified teachers, supplemental services, and \nafter-school programs in school districts. They're laboring hard in \ntheir work to implement the No Child Left Behind Act and bring the \npromise of true reform to more children and their parents.\n  The work of school reform is not easy, and schools are struggling to \nsucceed under No Child Left Behind. But on top of the broken promise to \nprovide schools the resources they need to get the job done right, the \nadministration has undermined the efforts of schools to comply with the \nlaw, and crippled reforms through its ineffective implementation \neffort.\n  Since No Child Left Behind passed, the Department of Education's \ntrack record in issuing basic guidance under the law been mired in \ndelay. Final accountability guidelines for children with special needs \nand limited English\n\n[[Page S9134]]\n\nproficient children were announced 2 years after the law was enacted, \nand long after the law's accountability requirements were already in \nplace for schools.\n\n  The administration has abandoned requirements to measure adequately \nthe progress of English language learners in a valid and reliable way. \nThey've suggested to States that they don't have to bother to develop \nnative language assessments, and they've done nothing to help improve \nassessments for children with disabilities.\n  They've ignored standards for supplemental service providers, and \nfailed to enforce the civil rights protections that are so essential to \nproviding all children fair access to such services. Families are \nrelying on tutoring and extra support to help their children. But the \nadministration's guidance actually prohibits States from requiring high \nstandards for that supplemental support. A highly qualified teacher in \nevery classroom is good policy. Why shouldn't the same apply for \nsupplemental services?\n  The administration's ham-handed implementation of public school \nchoice has ignored questions of capacity in school districts with \novercrowded classrooms.\n  And their weakened regulations undermine protections against high \ndropout rates--especially for low-income and minority students. Without \ninformation and reporting of those rates for each subgroup of children, \nthe public won't have a complete picture of how children are \nsucceeding.\n  It's time for the administration to correct these problems and do \ntheir part to improve implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The bill that I'm introducing today gets these reforms on track. It \nwill help keep the promise of public school choice, promote quality and \naccess in supplemental services, provide for better assessments for \nchildren, and ensure better reporting by schools and states of \ngraduation and dropout rates so that children don't fall through the \ncracks.\n  It's important to acknowledge what this bill does not do. It does not \nmake fundamental changes to the requirements under No Child Left \nBehind. Those reforms are essential to improving our public schools. \nEvery child deserves a chance to learn in a good school, and that \nchance depends on whether we succeed in implementing the law.\n  The No Child Left Behind Improvement Act will ensure that school \ndistricts consider health and safety codes as they draw up their plans \nfor providing public school choice to students, consistent with the \nlaw. In order to ensure that public school choice actually helps \nchildren succeed educationally, we must provide an environment that is \nsafe and conducive to their learning--not overcrowded.\n  It will provide better access to quality supplemental services for \neligible students, and ensure full enforcement of civil rights \nprotections under those provisions. The administration's policy of \nrelaxed enforcement in this area allows some private providers off-the-\nhook from serving children that need the most help. That's wrong.\n  All students should have a fair chance to choose a supplemental \nservice provider that meets their needs. Limited English proficient \nchildren and children with disabilities are often those students that \nneed the most extra help and assistance in our public schools, and this \nbill would ensure that each State select some providers with the skills \nto serve those populations.\n  This bill will also better enable teachers and para-professionals to \nmeet the required standards for teacher quality under the law. A highly \nqualified teacher is the single most important factor in improving \nstudent achievement, and the No Child Left Behind Act requires that \nevery classroom have a qualified teacher by 2006.\n  We must provide for a system that ensures all teachers have the \nopportunity to meet that goal. The No Child Left Behind Act includes an \nalternate standard for veteran teachers to demonstrate their competence \nand be counted as highly qualified in the subject matter that they \nteach. This bill ensures that every State develop and implement that \nstandard under the law, and that every state provide para-professionals \nwith the opportunities provided under No Child Left Behind to \ndemonstrate their competence.\n\n  Fifteen States have not yet developed or applied standards for \nveteran teachers. We must do better especially for the 67 percent of \nall public school teachers that have been teaching for more than 5 \nyears.\n  And finally, for No Child Left Behind's accountability provisions to \nbe useful, they must be accurate. We need accurate determinations of \nwhether schools are making progress.\n  The Department's delay in issuing adequate accountability rules for \ncounting children with disabilities and limited English proficient \nchildren has created unnecessary confusion, caused a potential \nmislabeling of schools, and misdirected resources from the schools and \nstudents who actually need them. The Department should apply those \nregulations retroactively, so that schools may be judged on the same \nstandards for the past year as they will be in the future, not by \ndifferent criteria for different years. In June, I introduced a bill--\nThe No Child Left Behind Fairness Act--to accomplish that goal. The \nbill that I'm introducing today also includes those requirements.\n  We're at an important crossroads in reforming our public schools. \nSchools are hurting, crippled by shrinking budgets and a broken promise \nof funding under the law. The ineffective track record of this \nadministration in implementing No Child Left Behind largely has \ncontributed to their problems and frustrations.\n  We must do better. Turning our back on the reforms in the No Child \nLeft Behind Act is no solution. Neither is turning our back on public \neducation. I urge my colleagues to act to ensure that the promise of \nthe essential reforms under No Child Left Behind are realized. Our \nstudents and families deserve no less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2794\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for higher education affordability, \naccess, and opportunity; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Higher \nEducation Affordability, Access and Opportunity Act of 2004 with my \ncolleagues Senators Baucus, Alexander, Dole and Lieberman.\n  We are introducing this bipartisan legislation because we are aware \nthat the American workforce is in the midst\n\n[[Page S9138]]\n\nof its most significant changes since the 1940s. In the past year, this \neconomy has created nearly 1.7 million new jobs, yet the complaint from \nemployers continues to be that they cannot find skilled workers to fill \nthe jobs that are being created. Our educational systems must recognize \nthis changing reality and be ready to provide the support for a new \ngroup of students that represents a workforce revolution.\n  This skills gap promises to get worse unless Congress acts now to \nprovide the assistance necessary to train a generation of workers that \nwill fill the jobs of tomorrow. The Department of Labor has estimated \nthat as many as 80 percent of the jobs being created over the next 10 \nyears will require some postsecondary education. This will include many \nadult learners who will return to college for additional training. This \nalso includes new students attending college for the first time later \nin life to obtain new skills or to improve their current skills.\n  Congress needs to ensure that we have a comprehensive system of \nworkforce education and training established, one that includes the \nWorkforce Investment Act, the Higher Education Act, and career and \ntechnical education, as well as elementary and secondary education. The \nneeds of the new workforce will require a lifelong commitment to \nlearning, where workers are able to return to school and re-enter the \nworkforce seamlessly.\n  Many workers in my home State are leaving to find better jobs \nelsewhere. To create the kind of good jobs with good futures that will \nkeep people in Wyoming, we need workers with the skills that the new, \nglobal economy demands. Whether a company decides to open a plant in \nCasper or China, they depend on a qualified local workforce.\n  This legislation would help meet the needs of businesses today and \ninto the future. It would help postsecondary institutions develop and \nimplement curriculum related to high skilled or high-wage occupations. \nIt would also provide support for institutions to increase their \ncapacity to serve adult learners and students pursuing high-growth \noccupations.\n  This legislation would provide additional assistance for first-time \ncollege students who are attending school to receive advanced skill \ntraining or are looking to improve their skill set to enter high-wage \nor high-skilled occupations.\n  This legislation also provides support for small business owners, \noperators, and their employees to receive skill training at \ninstitutions of higher education so our small businesses can continue \nto lead the economic growth of our Nation.\n  This legislation also provides support for rural communities to \nrecruit and retrain elementary and secondary education, so these areas \ncan prepare their students for college and entry into the workforce \nwith the skills they need to succeed, not only in postsecondary \neducation, but in life.\n  This legislation also helps students better understand the cost of \nattending college by making the information collected by the Department \nof Education more accessible.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to co-sponsor, the \nHigher Education Access, Affordability and Opportunity Act being \nintroduced to day by Senator Enzi. This legislation is an issue of \ngreat concern to Senators and our constituents: job loss. There is \nreally nothing new about job loss in America. Our strength as an \neconomy is not measured by how many jobs we lose; it is measured by how \nmany good new jobs we create to replace those jobs and how well we \ntrain those people to fill those jobs. We don't want to lose any jobs. \nWe want to recognize the pain that goes with moving from one job to \nanother. But, the best thing we can do about job loss is to create an \nenvironment in which good new jobs can grow and to offer the training \nresources necessary to hold those jobs.\n  Senator Enzi believes, as do I, that a comprehensive approach to \ncreating jobs and training workers is necessary to adapt to the \nchanging demands of the modern economy. The Higher Education Act was \nenacted to give more students a change to attend college. It was not \nintended to be a job training bill, nor should it become one. There is, \nhowever, a need to create a stronger partnership between institutions \nof higher education and the 21st century workforce. The goal of access \nto higher education and the goal of training a highly skilled workforce \nare not mutually exclusive.\n  Community colleges are our secret weapons in workforce development. \nThis bill used our secret weapon to create a competitive grant program \nto help community colleges develop academic programs focusing on areas \nof high-growth employment. Among other things, it provides additional \nsubsidized loans for high-growth job sector training programs such as \ntechnology and health care.\n  In higher education we focus really on two principles: The first is \nautonomy and the second is choice. We allow generous amounts of \ngovernment money to follow students to the schools of their choice. \nThese principles provide students with flexibility to choose among fast \nmoving institutions, and facilitate contracts with businesses. These \ncompetitive grants and additional subsidized loans will give local \ngovernments both the resources necessary and autonomy to work with \ntheir local community colleges to develop programs that will train \nworkers for the jobs that are available within their communities.\n  I will continue to work with Senator Enzi on these important \nlegislative initiatives and make them a part of the reauthorization of \nthe Higher Education Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2796. A bill to clarify that service marks, collective marks, and \ncertification marks are entitled to the same protections, rights, and \nprivileges of trademarks; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today Senator Durbin and I are introducing \nlegislation strengthening current law concerning certification marks, \ncollective marks, and service marks.\n  While some of our colleagues may not recognize these terms, I doubt \nthere is any Senator who has not come into contact with one of these \nmarks. For example, if you bought the best baking potatoes in the \nworld, you are familiar with the ``Grown in Idaho  '' or ``Idaho \nPotatoes  '' certification mark. Perhaps you know the certification \nmark ``UL,'' which stands for Underwriters Laboratory and signifies \nthat an electrical product meets certain safety standards. If you watch \nnetwork television and have seen the CBS ``eye,'' you have seen a \nservice mark. The union labels on many products are collective marks.\n  To explain the differences among these marks: service marks are \nwords, names, symbols, or characters that distinguish the mark holder's \nservices, while trademarks distinguish the mark holder's goods. \nCollective marks are trademarks that are used by organization or \nassociation to identify goods or services produced by members of a \ngroup. The certification mark is a trade or service mark used to \ncertify characteristics about a product or service; it may indicate \nthat the product or service originates in a specific geographic region, \nor meets certain standards of quality or mode of manufacture, or the \nwork that went into it was performed by members of an organization.\n  While they are somewhat different, these marks all serve the same \npurpose--that is, they enable the public to distinguish among products \nand services and prevent consumers from being deceived by similar \nbrands. Congress\n\n[[Page S9141]]\n\ndetermined that marks would serve the public interest by enhancing \nproduct quality and safety, and provided legal protection to these \nmarks under the Lanham Act. The federal law protects all four kinds of \nmarks equally; specifically, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1503 and 15 U.S.C. \nSec. 1504 provide that service marks, collective marks, and \ncertification marks ``shall be entitled to the protection provided'' to \ntrademarks, except where Congress provides otherwise by statute.\n  The principle of equal treatment also applies to ``no challenge'' \nprovisions in license agreements for the use of a trademark, service \nmark, collective mark, or certification mark. It is common for such \nagreements to include provisions under which licensees acknowledge the \nvalidity of and agree not to challenge the marks. By protecting the \nvalidity of the marks, these provisions reduce potential litigation \ncosts for mark owners and protect the investment made by licensees. A \nlong line of cases has upheld ``no challenge'' provisions in trademark \nlicenses and dismissed validity challenges.\n  Unfortunately, the clarity of the Lanham Act on these points has been \nconfused by a recent decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in \nthe case of Idaho Potato Commission v. M Produce Farm and Sales. That \ndecision interpreted the Lanham Act as requiring that certification \nmarks should be treated differently from trademarks with respect to \n``no challenge'' provisions. The court mistakenly likened the public \npolicy considerations surrounding certification marks to those \nsurrounding patents.\n  This decision has raised great consternation among the holders of \ncertification marks and their licenses throughout the United States--\nmore than two dozen of whom joined in an amicus brief challenging the \ncourt's reasoning. Congress should be equally concerned, because this \ndecision has the potential to undermine the Lanham Act and \nthe certification mark system itself.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today would not change current \nlaw, but would only underscore the policy that Congress clearly \nintended in the first place. We propose to add the words ``rights an \nprivileges'' to the two sections of the law that I quoted above, which \nwould clarify that registered service marks, collective marks, and \ncertification marks are ``entitled to the protections, rights, and \nprivileges'' provided to trademarks. While I have learned never to call \nlegislation ``simple,'' I would stress that at least our intention is \nsimple: to reinstate the original intent of Congress and indicate our \nsupport of the view that these marks are to be given equal legal \ntreatment.\n  I invite all my colleagues to review this legislation and consider \nthe important public policy interests it would protect. It is not only \nthe mark holders and licensees in your State, but all consumers across \nthe nation who have a stake in this bill, and I hope the Senate will \nact swiftly to approve it.\n  I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2796\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Con. Res. 136\n\n       Whereas on September 11, 2001, acts of war involving the \n     hijacking of commercial airplanes were committed against the \n     United States, killing and injuring thousands of innocent \n     people;\n       Whereas 1 of the hijacked planes, United Airlines Flight \n     93, crashed in a field in Pennsylvania;\n       Whereas while Flight 93 was still in the air, the \n     passengers and crew, through cellular phone conversations \n     with loved ones on the ground, learned that other hijacked \n     airplanes had been used to attack the United States;\n       Whereas during those phone conversations, several of the \n     passengers indicated that there was an agreement among the \n     passengers and crew to try to overpower the hijackers who had \n     taken over Flight 93;\n       Whereas Congress established the National Commission on \n     Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (commonly referred \n     to as ``the 9-11 Commission'') to study the September 11, \n     2001, attacks and how they occurred;\n       Whereas the 9-11 Commission concluded that ``the nation \n     owes a debt to the passengers of Flight 93. Their actions \n     saved the lives of countless others, and may have saved \n     either the U.S. Capitol or the White House from \n     destruction.''; and\n       Whereas the crash of Flight 93 resulted in the death of \n     everyone on board: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) the United States owes the passengers and crew of \n     United Airlines Flight 93 deep respect and gratitude for \n     their decisive actions and efforts of bravery;\n       (2) the United States extends its condolences to the \n     families and friends of the passengers and crew of Flight 93;\n       (3) not later than January 1, 2006, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, the minority leader of the House of \n     Representatives, the majority leader of the Senate, and the \n     minority leader of the Senate shall determine a location in \n     the United States Capitol Building (including the Capitol \n     Visitor Center) that shall be named in honor of the \n     passengers and crew of Flight 93, who saved the United States \n     Capitol Building from destruction; and\n       (4) a memorial plaque shall be placed at the site of the \n     determined location that states the purpose of the honor and \n     the names of the passengers and crew of Flight 93 on whom the \n     honor is bestowed.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent \nresolution to honor the memory of the passengers on flight 93. This \npast weekend marked the third anniversary of the vicious and merciless \nattacks that took place on American soil on September 11, 2001.\n  As we reflect on those events and mourn the great loss we suffered, \nwe remember the innocent who perished and we are reminded of the \nvaliant efforts of those who saved lives, including the passengers and \ncrew of flight 93. Those brave people gave up their lives in order to \nsave others that fateful day.\n  In the last several months, the 9/11 Commission released its report \nabout the series of events that took place on September 11, 2001. The \nSenate has subsequently undertaken an evaluation of the Commission's \nfindings through a series of hearings. As the story continues to \nunfold, it becomes more clear how important the actions of the \npassengers and crew of flight 93 were. We now know that flight 93 was \nalmost certainly headed to the U.S. Capitol or the White House. We also \nknow the passengers of flight 93 learned through a series of phone \ncalls to loved ones that hijackers on three other flights had turned \nairplanes into flying bombs that morning, crashing them into the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon.\n  Armed only with that knowledge and their own courage and resolve, \nthose brave passengers attacked the hijackers and forced them to crash \nflight 93 into rural Pennsylvania far short of its intended target.\n  The 9/11 Commission concluded that the Nation owes a debt to the \npassengers of flight 93. Their actions saved the lives of countless \nothers and may have saved either the U.S. Capitol or the White House \nfrom destruction.\n  Those of us who work here in the Capitol owe a special debt of \ngratitude to those heroes. Their actions saved one of the greatest \nsymbols of our democracy. Had flight 93 reached its intended target, \nthe dreadful day might have been even worse.\n  Today I am submitting a resolution honoring and memorializing the \npassengers and crew of United Airline flight 93. This legislation \nexpresses our deepest respect and gratitude to them, as well as \ncondolences to their families\n\n[[Page S9142]]\n\nand friends. This bill also calls for a location in the Capitol to be \nnamed in their memory and a commemorative plaque to be placed at that \nlocation.\n  Today I bow my head in memory of those who died at the World Trade \nCenter and the Pentagon. I also pay respect to our first responders, \nvolunteers, and average citizens who risked their lives to save others \non that day.\n  Finally, I pay homage to the passengers and crew of flight 93 for \ntaking on those who wished to harm our country and Nation's Capital. I \nbelieve it is appropriate at this time to acknowledge the actions of \nthe passengers of flight 93 for showing such remarkable heroism and to \ncommemorate them in the very walls that might have crumbled had they \nnot made that ultimate sacrifice. We are forever indebted to them and \nshould never forget their bravery or their sacrifice or that of their \nloved ones.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in sponsoring this resolution. I \nhave it at the desk and I am submitting it now. I hope on a broad \nbipartisan basis we are able to recognize those brave passengers and \ncrew of flight 93 for what they did on that remarkable day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9142-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3621.

Also transmitted for information of the \nSenate is the report of the Department of State with respect to the \nProtocol.\n  The Protocol updates the existing Convention to bring it into close \nconformity with current U.S. tax treaty policy and to ensure that the \nConvention cannot be used inappropriately to secure tax reductions in \ncircumstances where there is no risk of double taxation. The Protocol \nwould modernize the Convention's anti-treaty-shopping provision. The \nProtocol also updates the Convention to take account of a 1996 change \nin the Internal Revenue Code relating to the tax treatment of certain \nformer long-term residents of the United States. The exchange of notes \nwith attached Understandings provides guidance to taxpayers and each \ngovernment regarding the intended interpretation of certain provisions \nof the Convention, as amended.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthis Protocol and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                      George W.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \ntomorrow following morning business the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. It is \nimperative that we finish the Homeland Security bill prior to the \nobservance of Rosh Hashanah on Wednesday. The chairman and ranking \nmember will be here in the morning to\n\n[[Page S9145]]\n\nbegin working through the final amendments. Senators should expect a \nlong day with numerous rollcall votes. Senators should make themselves \navailable throughout the day tomorrow as we move forward to complete \nthis bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me a few words \nbefore we finish, as I have stated on the floor, I believe we can \nfinish the Homeland Security appropriations bill tomorrow. I think we \ncan do that. Senator Daschle has stated that he believes that is the \ncase also. There is a complicating factor, and that is the reason we \ndidn't have a cutoff time this evening for filing amendments. There is \nsome interest in tying this together with supplemental appropriations \nfor the catastrophes--I say that in the plural--that have hit Florida. \nThe last one is not yet there. We understand the importance of that.\n  I say as sincerely as I can to my friend, who is my counterpart on \nthe majority side, don't connect these two bills. We are aware and \nconcerned about the problems in Florida and we will work to help. We \nhave two Democratic Senators from Florida. We know how important that \nis. But to tie these two together is only making our work more \ndifficult. We can finish this bill tomorrow. If the leadership on the \nRepublican side decides they want to go to another supplemental even \nbefore, let us do that separately. We are going to do everything we can \nto take care of the people of Florida. But this is so important.\n  I will not guarantee anything, but I think if the supplemental is \ntied to Homeland Security, we are not going to finish this tomorrow, \nand I think we will be lucky to finish it Wednesday morning.\n  That is my observation. I am doing everything I can to work on this \nmatter. I am making that suggestion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate the suggestions of my good \nfriend from Nevada. We both share a desire to help the people of \nFlorida who have certainly been lambasted by two horrendous hurricanes \nand are about to be hit by one that may be even bigger. We will work \nwith the other side of the aisle to see the best way to accommodate the \nneeds of our folks down in Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/09/13/senate-section/article/S9145-1", "month": "09", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
