Under the Budget Act it is in order to yield back time, and \nthat may occur at the managers' discretion over the course of this \nmorning and early afternoon.\n  Once time is used or yielded back, we would expect to begin a series \nof rollcall votes which would include passage of the resolution. Again, \nthe timing for that final vote will be determined by the number of \namendments and how soon we get to the series of rollcall votes. I do \nwant to encourage our colleagues that once we begin that series of \nrollcall votes, we do it in a very timely, orderly fashion.\n  We made very good progress on the resolution yesterday, conducting \nsix rollcall votes and disposing of eight amendments. The chairman and \nranking member are here today on the floor ready to work through the \namendments to the resolution. Therefore, Senators should expect a very \nbusy day, as we all know and have appropriately planned for a late \nevening tonight, with rollcall votes throughout.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2591-6", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2591]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 1997\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have yet \nto have a chance to review the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia. I object at this point and I expect in the near future I \nwill be happy to accommodate our friend. She can begin her debate and \nmaybe that will help clarify the intention of her amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I am so sorry. I was \nsure Senator Nickles had seen this amendment. I don't think there is \nanything surprising. It is essentially a jobs amendment, initiatives \nthat have been introduced by other Senators. We packaged it in one \npackage.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from California seek time \nfrom the manager on your side for proceeding?\n\n[[Page S2592]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask Senator Conrad if he wants me to take time by \ndiscussing Senator Corzine's amendment and making other remarks or take \ntime off the managers' time? Either way he wants it.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. How much time would the Senator need?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was hopeful, when I spoke last night, that I could have \n20 to 30 minutes for the entire amendment. That would be fine for me.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. Chairman, might we agree to a time on her amendment \nof 30 minutes equally divided?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, no, 30 minutes on my side, or 20 minutes on my side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then 40 minutes equally divided? Is that what the Senator \nis seeking?\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, 20 minutes a side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, 40 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I still haven't reviewed the amendment. I will do this: \nI tell my colleague I am happy to enter into time agreements on a lot \nof amendments but I will state I want to see the amendments first. I \nknow there is a whole package of amendments. I suggest we go under the \nassumption it will be that. I will grant you that in just a moment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from California at this \npoint, just for her side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague very much. I have been looking \nforward to offering this amendment. I hope at the appropriate moment in \ntime I will be able to send it to the desk.\n  Mr. President, if you were to go out all over this country and ask \nmost of our constituents from every State in the Union what is on their \nminds, they are going to say it is the economy; it is jobs; it is their \nsecurity. In this particular budget we should do much more to ensure \nthat jobs are created and that our families are protected. So what we \ndo in this amendment, which we pay for, is a number of initiatives \nwhich will help us create and retain jobs in this great country.\n  First of all, I want to give my colleagues a sense of why this is so \nimportant. The amendment I am offering is cosponsored by Senators \nDaschle, Sarbanes, Clinton, Schumer, Kennedy, Kohl, Durbin, Levin and \nDodd. I see Senator Kohl is here. I am hopeful he will want to make a \nfew comments as well.\n  Let me paint a picture of where we are. I think the best way to do it \nis just show a series of charts, that are very clear:\n\n       Private sector jobs decline: Three million jobs lost since \n     January 2001.\n\n  We see the incredible graph that just shows, essentially, almost a \nstraight line down. We did see in February we had a little increase of \n21,000 jobs, as I understand it, in the public sector. There is very \nlittle in the private sector.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will if I can reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have entered into a time agreement \nwhere the total time consumed on the Boxer amendment will be 20 minutes \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2783\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \nCorzine amendment and send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself and \n     Mr. Daschle, Mr. Sarbanes, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2783.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To create jobs, to discourage the shipping of jobs overseas, \n and provide adjustment assistance for dislocated workers, by changing \nthe tax treatment of certain income from runaway plants and by reducing \n   tax breaks for individuals with incomes in excess of one million \n      dollars per year, without affecting middle-class taxpayers)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $16,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $8,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $16,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $24,000,000,000.\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE FUND FOR JOB CREATION.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations, \n     discretionary spending limits, and other appropriate levels \n     and limits in this resolution by up to $24,000,000,000 over \n     the total of fiscal years 2005 through 2009 for a bill, joint \n     resolution, motion, amendment, or conference report that \n     would provide resources for job creation, discourage \n     outsourcing of jobs, provide a tax credit for the creation of \n     new manufacturing jobs in the United States, provide small \n     businesses with a tax credit for health care coverage, \n     restore funding to the Manufacturing Extension Program and to \n     the Advanced Technology Partnership, increase spending on \n     federal science research activities, prohibit the use of tax \n     dollars to outsource non-defense and non-homeland security \n     government contracts abroad, require employers to provide \n     workers advance notice of any intention to move their jobs \n     offshore, and expand Trade Adjustment Assistance to include \n     service workers and improve access to affordable health care.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me continue with the story that is not \na very happy story about job loss. We have seen 3 million jobs lost in \nthe last 3\\1/2\\ years. We see unemployment for 27 weeks or longer. We \nsee that 1.9 million workers are unemployed for more than 6 months. We \nhave statistics that say although the unemployment rate looks to be 5.6 \npercent, in reality it is over 9 percent if you factor in the people \nwho have given up their search for jobs. We see the smallest share of \nthe population at work since 1994, with 62.2 percent of the population \nunemployed. These are startling statistics.\n  Manufacturing jobs in America: From 1993 to 2000, 385,000 \nmanufacturing jobs created; and from 2001 to 2003, 2.785 thousand jobs \nlost. That is 75,270 jobs lost per month. For my people in California, \nwe have seen an enormous drop in manufacturing jobs.\n  I want to show my colleagues the context of this job loss if we look \nback to other administrations. This is the average number of jobs \ncreated or lost per month. Under Ronald Reagan, we had 165,000 jobs per \nmonth; under George H. Bush, we had 47,604 jobs created every month; \nunder Bill Clinton, we had 236,625 jobs created per month; and under \nGeorge W. Bush, 58,815 jobs per month on average lost.\n  By any standard, this is a unique time. We have a chance to do \nsomething about it with this budget resolution.\n  California jobs: From 1993 to 2000, under the Clinton administration, \n25,644 jobs were created per month in my State of 35 million people. \nUnder George W. Bush, 284,900 jobs lost. That is 7,913 jobs lost per \nmonth. Nearly 8,000 jobs are lost per month in my State. That is about \n8,000 family members coming home to tell their families they are in big \ntrouble. We ought to do something about it. The good news is we can do \nsomething about it with this amendment I offered.\n  I want to show one more chart.\n  President Bush promised a whole different story--promises, promises, \nwishful thinking on jobs. The Bush administration has consistently \nover-predicted job growth for 2002, 2003, and 2004.\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\n  Today, I read in the paper that the President is going to appoint a \nmanufacturing jobs czar. He came to a decision about the individual he \nwants to appoint. We have learned that this particular individual built \na plant in China. Whether he will continue with that nomination, I do \nnot know, but clearly that sends a very mixed signal, to be polite \nabout it.\n  Let me talk for a moment about the amendment I am offering to protect \nAmerica's jobs.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 15 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you.\n  Our amendment creates a $24 billion job reserve fund for the \nfollowing purposes:\n  The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program, $110 million cost; \nAdvanced Technology Program, $125 million cost; Federal science at $1 \nbillion cost; new manufacturing jobs tax credit at $7 billion cost; \nsmall business health insurance tax credit at $14 billion cost; stop \njobs from moving overseas and end the runaway plant tax break, which \nsaves $2 billion; the Dodd amendment with no Federal funds for \noutsourcing, no cost; worker notification, which is Senator Daschle's \namendment in relation to jobs moving overseas, no cost; and worker \nassistance and trade adjustment expansion for service workers and \nexpanded health insurance, $2 billion.\n\n  The way we pay for this amendment is the following: We end the \nrunaway plant tax break, which brings in $2 billion, and we reduce tax \nbreaks for millionaires, which brings in another $1 billion.\n  I want to spend just a moment explaining why I think that is fair. If \nyou earn over $1 million, under the Bush tax cut you are going to get a \nrefund of about $140,000 every single year.\n  Let me rephrase that. You are going to get a tax cut of $127,000 \nevery single year. We reduce that refund to $85,000 for a very noble \npurpose. That purpose is to get America back to work and to help our \nmiddle-class families.\n  I think if you ask the average person in your State, just from what I \ncan tell by looking at polls and talking to people, they will say even \nif they were in that millionaire category, we will have a stronger \neconomy and more people working by not giving millionaires $127,000 a \nyear from their taxes.\n  We reduce it to $85,000. Let us talk about that. They will now get \nback $85,000. How much is that? That is 7.5 times the annual income of \na minimum-wage worker, just in the millionaire tax cut. We are, in \nfact, cutting it to $85,000, but that is 7.5 times the annual income of \na minimum-wage worker. It is also two times the median household \nincome. If you are a millionaire and get back $85,000 a year instead of \n$127,000, you are still getting back every year twice the median \nhousehold income and 7.5 times the annual income of a minimum-wage \nworker.\n  I want to briefly tell you about each of these job creation plans.\n  Be providing a tax credit for creating new manufacturing jobs--this \nis a tax credit that goes to businesses that create jobs in \nmanufacturing, originally sponsored by Senator John Kerry--the \nmanufacturing jobs tax credit gives the tax cut to companies that \ncreate a new factory job in 2004, 2005 and 2006. This is a good thing \nfor business. It is a great thing for workers. It is a good way to deal \nwith this issue.\n  We increase the funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. \nIt sets aside $110 million of the reserve fund for the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership Program. In 2003, this program helped create or \nretain 35,000 jobs.\n  The administration only asks for $13 million in 2004, and it is \nrequesting only $39 million for 2005. They say they care about jobs, \nbut they ought to do more, and $110 million will create a lot more \njobs.\n  For the Advanced Technology Program, this amendment sets aside $140 \nmillion in the reserve fund. The administration proposes zeroing out \nthis ATP program. The ATP helps companies get to market and grow, and \nthat means jobs. Of the first 33 small companies to complete ATP \nprograms, 60 percent doubled in size, and 4 grew more than 1,000 \npercent. The ATP program bridges the gap between the research lab and \nthe marketplace. We need to see that go up to this $140 million level. \nI might say, even with that, it is still less than we have spent in the \npast on the program. George Bush, in 2005, requests zero for this \nimportant program.\n\n  Then we have Federal research and development, which is so key, at \nthe National Science Foundation. It falls $1 billion short of what is \ncalled for in the bill we passed 5 years ago. It is very important. \nWhen President Bush says he increases Federal research by 5 percent, \nthe problem for our Nation's researchers and research institutions is \nthat increase is largely targeted for weapons development. However, we \nhave other things we need to do which will create jobs, as well. That \nis the purpose of this amendment.\n  The health insurance tax credit for small business is clear. If \nbusiness pays health insurance for its people, we think they ought to \nget a tax break. That is the kind of tax break we believe in on this \nside of the aisle because it is to encourage businesses to help \nemployees with their health care.\n  We end tax subsidies to U.S. companies that send plants overseas. \nThis is a Dorgan-Mikulski idea. This amendment includes language \nbringing to an end tax subsidies for employers that ship production of \ngoods abroad. This part brings $2 billion.\n  We prohibit Federal funds from being used for offshore jobs. This is \nSenator Dodd's amendment that passed the Senate 70 to 26. When we give \nState and local governments Federal funds and when we decide to issue \ncontracts, the jobs ought to stay here.\n  In my own State, the Defense Department wanted to buy rice for Iraq. \nInstead of buying it from California, which has the best rice in the \nworld, they bought it from a foreign country. That is my farmers, \ntaxpayer dollars, and all my people's dollars going into the war \neffort. We give a contract on rice to a foreign country when the sons \nand daughters of our farmers and our people are going to war. I don't \nget it.\n  This is an important amendment. We are improving the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program and extending it to service workers. That means help \nfor people who are pushed out of a job because of trade agreements.\n  I will save some time for colleagues. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 7 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Kohl is recognized for 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KOHL. I come to the Senate today as a cosponsor to the Boxer-Dodd \namendment.\n  I thank my colleague from California for pulling together this \npackage--and for including a provision I authored to restore the \nfunding for the Manufacturing Extension Program, MEP. I hope my \ncolleagues will join us in resounding, bipartisan vote for the \namendment. It remedies a serious failing of the budget before us.\n  A budget worthy of the Senate's support should have vision. It should \npoint the way to a better world for our workers, our families, and our \ncommunities. Senator Boxer's amendment has a vision for bringing good \njobs back to our shores--and training a workforce able to fill and \ncreate such jobs. Without the Boxer amendment, the budget will remain a \ndocument whose only answer to the deterioration of the manufacturing \njob base is upper income tax cuts cloaked in discredited trickle-down \neconomic theory.\n  I am particularly pleased that Senator Boxer's amendment provides the \nresources to increase funding for the Manufacturing Extension Program \nfrom the $39.6 million suggested in the President's budget to $100 \nmillion, fully funding the program for fiscal year 2005. I intended to \noffer this as a free-standing amendment, but in the interest of time, I \nwill defer to my colleague from California. I commend her for allowing \nthe Senate to go on record on this vital program.\n  Manufacturing makes up 25 percent of Wisconsin's economy--making \nWisconsin the fourth largest manufacturing State in the Nation, tied \nwith Michigan. While that statistic may conjure up images of huge \nbusinesses, in Wisconsin, 89 percent of our manufacturers have fewer \nthan 100 employees. These small- and medium-sized firms are consistent \nforces for manufacturing job creation and are less likely than larger \nfirms to outsource jobs. Smaller manufacturers pay good wages and \ncontribute to the overall vitality of the local economy.\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n\n  In Wisconsin, the unemployment rate dropped to 5 percent, but these \nfigures hide the disappearance of the solid manufacturing jobs on which \nWisconsin's prosperity once rested. In January, the number of factory \njobs in Wisconsin fell to the lowest level in more than a decade--even \nas unemployment fell. Since 2000, we have lost one out of every seven \nmanufacturing jobs--79,000 in total.\n  In Wisconsin, and across our Nation, MEP is one Federal program \nactively and effectively combating this deterioration of the \nmanufacturing base. By helping small- and medium-sized manufacturers \nstreamline production, integrate new technologies, and improve \ncompetitiveness, MEP has created or saved more than 35,000 \nmanufacturing jobs nationwide during the last fiscal year. In \nWisconsin, the program is supported--and used--by scores of \nmanufacturers and the largest business association in my State: \nWisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for the MEP from Jim \nHaney, President of Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Wisconsin Manufacturers\n\n\n                                                   & Commerce,\n\n                                   Madison, WI, February 27, 2004.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: It was a pleasure to tour Berntsen \n     International with you last week in Madison. This company is \n     just one example of many WMEP success stories that I have \n     personally witnessed in Wisconsin. I completely agree with \n     you that MEP is one of the best government investments \n     around, and it should be fully supported at the state and \n     federal level.\n       Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce is an association \n     representing 4,300 members. As the largest business \n     association in Wisconsin, we are first and foremost concerned \n     about the business climate in the state. Our primary \n     priorities are to reduce the tax and regulatory burden on our \n     businesses. But we also recognize where smart and appropriate \n     investment of public dollars can produce results for business \n     in the state.\n       We need to prioritize our economic development initiatives \n     and judiciously place taxpayer dollars in those investments \n     that provide the best return for our state and our country. \n     There are many programs that should not make the cut. \n     However, MEP is one government investment that ranks at the \n     top when evaluated against criteria of national need, \n     effectiveness and results. We should not shortchange or \n     undercut this excellent program.\n       I understand the Senate Commerce, Justice, and State \n     Appropriations Committee will be reviewing manufacturing \n     support priorities with Secretary Evans this week. Please \n     urge Secretary Evans to do what he can to restore MEP funding \n     support to the FY03 level of $106 million.\n       Feel free to call me at 608-258-3400 to talk more about MEP \n     and its impact in Wisconsin.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      James Haney,\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. KOHL. Let me quote from that letter:\n\n       We need to prioritize our economic development initiatives \n     and judiciously place taxpayer dollars in those investments \n     that provide the best return for our state and our country. \n     There are many programs that should not make the cut. \n     However, MEP is one government investment that ranks at the \n     top when evaluated against criteria of national need, \n     effectiveness and results. We should not shortchange or \n     undercut this excellent program.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, isn't MEP exactly the sort of program a budget \nwith vision would support, a program, as Mr. Haney says, that brings \nreal returns--jobs, economic growth, hope--from our scarce taxpayer \ndollar, a program that has received strong bipartisan support at the \nState and national level, a program that faces our challenges head on--\nand taps the innovation and work ethic of American businesses to solve \nthem?\n  The Boxer amendment in so many ways adds vision to a budget that is \nblind when it comes to the trials of the American manufacturing sector. \nIt adds courage to a budget frightened to acknowledge the serious \njeopardy our economy faces. And it adds common sense to a budget that \ncalls for short sighted cuts in programs, like MEP, that offer a \ntenfold return on taxpayer dollars.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Boxer amendment. I urge the \nSenate to continue to work to amend this Budget resolution to turn it \ninto the plan that our Nation needs and deserves.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I wish to ask the Senator from California a \nquestion. I have been reading in the business magazines and the \nnewspapers about the jobless recovery we are having and I wonder, if \nthe Senator from California feels so passionately about creating jobs \nin this country, if she could give me a historical perspective about \nwhat we are talking in job creation in the last 3 years.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for asking this question. I have \nnever known that we have offered such a comprehensive jobs amendment on \na budget resolution. These are not ordinary times.\n  My friend is right when he asked this question. If we go back over \ntime to Herbert Hoover in the Depression years in the 1930s, that is \nthe only time we have actually lost jobs. We have created jobs under \nRoosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, \nReagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and now we are down to this and we \nhave seen 3 million jobs lost. We need a jobs amendment.\n  Mr. PRYOR. If the Senator will yield for another question, I notice \nin all the statistics, small business is the sector of the economy that \ncreates jobs and R is critical for creating jobs; also, the area we \nare struggling in in this country is manufacturing jobs.\n  Again, the Senator from California is so passionate on this issue. I \nwould like to hear the Senator's perspective and how this amendment \nwill help those sectors.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Clearly, we give tax breaks in this amendment to small \nbusinesses that pay or help pay for their employees' health benefits.\n  When we talk to people, they are scared about the cost of health \ninsurance. They are frightened. They are frightened that the costs are \ngoing up, that they may lose it, not to mention their entanglements \nwith HMOs that want to walk away.\n  We say to employers, employees, we will help if, in fact, you pay for \nyour employees' health care, or at least part of it.\n  We also give a manufacturing jobs tax credit. And this is Senator \nKerry's idea.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, do I have a remaining minute on my time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the time has been used.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield an additional 20 minutes off the \nresolution to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So I say to my friend from Arkansas--because I would like \nto continue this give-and-take--what we are seeing is a devastating \nchange in what has been known as economic progress in America--a \ndevastating change--something we have not seen since Herbert Hoover. \nThis is serious business.\n  For our small businesses that are creating whatever jobs are being \ncreated--although we still are not seeing a net increase in those \njobs--we need them to get help. So in this amendment not only do we \nsuggest a reserve fund to help our workers, but we suggest tax credits \nand tax breaks to our businesses that create manufacturing jobs. For \nevery job they create, they get a tax credit, and also for those \nbusinesses that pay for health care for workers.\n  So I think the question was right on the mark.\n  I would be glad if my friend has any other questions.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, will the Senator would yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. PRYOR. So it seems you are providing tax relief for companies \nthat are trying to, in effect, stimulate the economy and trying to \ncreate jobs in this country. Again, as I understand economic principles \nand the reality of this economy, it is small businesses that create \njobs in this country. With all due respect to the top 500 or 1,000 \ncompanies--we love to have them, and I am proud of what they do--it is \nthe small\n\n[[Page S2595]]\n\nbusinesses, when you are talking about the bread-and-butter job \ncreation, that do that.\n  I know the Senator's amendment would help small businesses \nconsiderably, not just in the manufacturing sector but in other areas.\n  I would just like you to comment on that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  This health care tax credit is very important as well.\n  In my State, my small businesses that do the right thing by their \nemployees are being hurt. We ought to recognize if you do the right \nthing, you ought to get rewarded for it. So that is why we do this.\n  I say to my friend, he is right; this jobs amendment helps workers \nand helps businesses. It is a balanced approach.\n  Here is how we encourage the creation of American jobs: We provide \ntax credits to companies that create new jobs. We provide tax credits \nto help small businesses pay for health insurance. We expand funding to \nthe Manufacturing Extension Partnership and the Advanced Technology \nProgram, which really helps small businesses in an enormous way. What \nwe do with these programs is we help them go from the research part of \nthings to the marketing part of things. It has been a huge success.\n  Unfortunately, the President has zeroed out the ATP. I cannot \nunderstand it. This is something our businesspeople really want.\n  Also, as to basic scientific research, we see it in the budget, but \nit is mostly for defense weapons programs. We do not have it on the \ncivilian side.\n  Again, coming from a State--I am sure your State has them, as well--\nwith very entrepreneurial people, who really can take off from \nscientific research, it is very important.\n  I say to my friend, we pay for this. We pay for this by ending--this \nis Senator Dorgan's idea--we end the tax break for companies that move \noffshore. Oh, yes, they are creating jobs, but they are creating jobs \noffshore. And we pay for it by saying to the millionaires--people who \nmake over $1 million a year--we are saying to those folks: Instead of \ngetting $127,000 a year back, can you take $85,000 a year back? That is \nstill 7.5 times more than a worker at the minimum wage.\n  So this is a golden moment for this Senate to come together across \nparty lines on behalf of our small businesses, on behalf of our \nworkers, and create jobs.\n  I have already shown my colleague the historic proportions of this \nmoment in history in which we find ourselves: the worst record since \nHerbert Hoover, the only Presidency since Herbert Hoover not to create \njobs. This is an extraordinary moment. We need to take a moment to \nrealize if a millionaire gets back $85,000 instead of $127,000, that is \nnot a great sacrifice to make for putting people to work, for giving a \nlift to small business.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I just have one more observation to make, \nand I will be glad to yield the floor. It seems to me our economy is \nchanging. As a Congress, we need to recognize that, we need to \nunderstand that, and try to harness that change in a positive way for \nour economy.\n  One area our economy has changed quite a bit in the last several \nyears is we have gone more and more to a service-oriented economy \nrather than just purely a manufacturing economy. Back in the 1960s, the \nCongress passed something called Trade Adjustment Assistance. What it \ndid is it provided sort of a package of various programs for workers \nwho had been dislocated--who had been downsized, in today's vernacular.\n  What I think we ought to do, and what this amendment does--and I \nthink it is very smart to do this and move in that direction--is it \ngives workers in the service industries those same TAA benefits.\n  The reason I think that is important is because a much larger \npercentage of our economy is now based on the service industries, and \nwhat we are seeing is the trend that those service jobs are moving \noffshore. We have heard about call centers and other things going \noffshore. That is exactly what we are seeing.\n  So, here again, the Boxer amendment acknowledges the economic reality \ntoday and tries to help people who need help most.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank my friend because he is exactly \nright. This outsourcing is a very tough issue. I say to my friend, \nbefore he goes to his committee hearing, I met a young man in \nCalifornia who had an excellent job as a computer program manager. He \nis a newlywed and very excited about his life. He finds out he is being \nfired, not because he is not a good employee--he is a great employee, \nterrific--but because his job is being outsourced to another country. \nAnd the person over there is going to get a quarter of what he makes. \nNow, here is the real kicker. He is told he has to train his \nreplacement.\n  I have to say, this is what is happening all over America. If we \ncannot take a stand in this budget which reflects all of our priorities \nas a nation, if we cannot take a stand for America's workers and \nAmerica's small businesses, I do not know why we are here. What are we \nhere for?\n  I ask my friend again to look at this chart which shows that the \nsmallest share of the population is at work since 1994. This is not a \ngood chart when you translate it into real lives of real people--and we \nknow the stories in our States: a mother wakes up worried because her \ncompany says it no longer will pay health care--that is why we give a \nhealth care tax credit in this amendment--a gentleman, as I described, \nis told by his boss: You are losing your job. It is being outsourced, \nand you have to train your replacement. This is what is happening in \nAmerica.\n  I know some colleagues are here who would like to be heard on this \namendment, which I am very pleased about.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this Washington Post article from today: ``Bush Choice for \nManufacturing Post in Question.''\n   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 11, 2004]\n\n             Bush Choice for Manufacturing Post in Question\n\n                 (By Mike Allen and Jonathan Weissman)\n\n        Six months after promising to create an office to help the \n     nation's struggling manufacturers, President Bush settled on \n     someone to head it, but the nomination was being reconsidered \n     last night after Democrats revealed that his candidate had \n     opened a factory in China.\n        Several officials said the nomination may be scrapped \n     because of the political risk but said that had not been \n     decided. Bush's opponent, Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass), has \n     made job losses his chief point of attack, and some \n     administration officials feared the nomination could hand him \n     fresh ammunition.\n        In late afternoon, the administration announced that the \n     new assistant secretary of commerce for manufacturing and \n     services would be named at a ceremony this morning. Industry \n     officials were told that the job would go to Anthony F. \n     Raimondo, chairman and chief executive of a Nebraska company \n     that makes metal buildings and grain silos.\n        But Kerry's campaign, tipped off about the impending \n     nomination several hours earlier, hastened to distribute news \n     reports that Raimondo's firm, Behlen Manufacturing Co. of \n     Columbus, Neb., had laid off 75 U.S. workers in 2002, four \n     months after announcing plans for a $3 million factory in \n     northwest Beijing.\n        Bush aides said Behlen, founded in 1936, has four U.S. \n     plants employing 1,000 people and a 150,000-square-foot plant \n     in China employing 180.\n        A senior administration official, who refused to be named \n     because Raimondo has not been nominated, said Behlen has \n     exported products to China since 1984 but was losing market \n     share to other U.S. firms. The official said that half the \n     equipment used to build the factory was made in the United \n     States.\n        ``This is not a case of making goods more cheaply in China \n     to sell back in the U.S.,'' the official said.\n        Democrats contended, however, that Raimondo's record helps \n     illustrate why the nation has lost 2.2 million jobs, most of \n     them in factories, during the Bush presidency. The layoffs \n     have been concentrated in such swing states as Pennsylvania, \n     Michigan and Ohio.\n        Seventy-five minutes after the administration announced a \n     news conference with Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans to \n     name the official, an advisory went out saying the event had \n     been ``postponed due to scheduling conflicts.''\n        By last night, three senior administration officials said \n     Raimondo's nomination might be scuttled but said they did not \n     know for sure. Bush announced the new office with fanfare \n     on Labor Day, and Democrats had been saying for weeks that \n     the long delay in naming the new assistant secretary \n     reflected the low priority that Bush puts on preserving \n     jobs.\n       An aide close to Bush said last night the uncertainty about \n     the nomination had\n\n[[Page S2596]]\n\n     ``nothing to do with Senator Kerry or his baseless charges.'' \n     This aide, who thought the nomination would go forward, said \n     the delay ``more has to do with congressional notification \n     issues and things like that than it does anything else.''\n       The congressional issues concerned one of the senators from \n     Raimondo's home state, Sen. Chuck Hagel (R). An aide said \n     last night that Hagel had no comment.\n       Bush's White House prides itself on orderliness but has \n     been on the defensive on economic issues. Last month, the \n     White House had to disavow its own estimate that 2.6 million \n     jobs would be created this year. The same economic report, \n     issued under Bush's signature, touted the economic \n     efficiencies of sending certain types of U.S. work overseas.\n       Business groups praised plans for the new position, which \n     quickly became known among industry officials as a \n     ``manufacturing czar.''\n       Raimondo, who is chairman of the Omaha Branch Board of the \n     Kansas City Federal Reserve Board, contributed the maximum of \n     $2,000 toward Bush's reelection in June, a month after the \n     campaign opened for business.\n       Raimondo is a longtime board member of the National \n     Association of Manufacturers. Michael E. Baroody, the group's \n     executive vice president, called Raimondo ``a class act who \n     understands manufacturing and understands public policy.''\n       When Bush announced the new position Sept. 1, he noted that \n     the nation had ``lost thousands of jobs in manufacturing . . \n     . some of it because production moved overseas.'' He made the \n     announcement in Ohio, which last year suffered the second-\n     worst job losses of any state, mostly in manufacturing.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I will only read the first paragraph, \nand then I would like to yield 5 minutes to my friend from New Jersey, \nSenator Corzine.\n  Here is what it says:\n\n       Six months after promising to create an office to help the \n     nation's struggling manufacturers, President Bush settled on \n     someone to head it, but the nomination was being reconsidered \n     last night after Democrats revealed that this candidate had \n     opened a factory in China.\n\n  Now, I ask you, what signal are we sending to the workers of America, \nto the businesses of America, when the President's No. 1 choice for \nmanufacturing czar has opened a business in China?\n  So if you put together this fact with this fact, with the chart I \nshowed you that illustrates the worst problem in job creation since \nHerbert Hoover, we have an explosive situation on our hands. The vote \non this amendment should not be about parties; it should be about our \npeople, whether they are in Alaska, Wyoming, New Jersey, Michigan, or \nCalifornia.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey and ask, after \nyielding that time, how much time would be remaining on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would have 4\\1/2\\ minutes on her \nside.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield Senator Corzine 3 minutes and Senator Stabenow 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I say to the Senator from California, I \nwould be happy to yield time off the resolution to the Senator from \nMichigan so it would not come out of her time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Excellent. So how much time will the Senator yield off \nthe resolution?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I could yield 10 minutes off the resolution to the \nSenator from Michigan. How much time does the Senator from New Jersey \nseek?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I would use 3 to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California for \nboth raising the issue and addressing it with resources through this \nbudget resolution. There is hardly an issue in America that is more \nimportant than that which has been very ably demonstrated by the series \nof charts the Senator from California has provided.\n  We have before us the worst record of job creation in the last 70 \nyears. It is one that is not getting better anytime. The only \nobservation I will add to the presentation of the Senator from \nCalifornia is that not only are we losing jobs, but when we lose those \njobs it makes the competitive market for wages and real income for \nAmericans go down.\n  The reality is for those people who lose their jobs--and there have \nbeen roughly 3 million in the private sector--their likelihood of \nretaining another job that pays the same as the one they have lost or \nthe benefits they had in the job they have lost is virtually nil. You \nsee about 75 or 80 percent of the equivalency of the compensation for \nindividuals who lose their jobs.\n  The problem is, we are putting more people on the job market. The \nnormal economics of supply and demand are undermining the real wages of \nthe people who remain in the workforce. So not only are we getting more \nunemployed and fewer people working in the overall workforce, but we \nare seeing a reduction in real wages in the economy.\n  This is an extraordinarily negative cycle that is being set up. It is \nabsolutely important that we reverse it. That is why this amendment is \nso important. It will encourage the creation of American jobs in a way \nthat begins creating greater demand which is going to raise the wage of \nwhat we pay for the jobs we have.\n\n  Certainly, we need to stop this mad rush of sending jobs overseas \nwhich is undermining also not only the number of jobs in America but, \nas I say, is lowering the real cost of real wages, which is undermining \nthe quality of life for everyone, not only the people who are \nunemployed but those who are working.\n  This is a dangerous phenomenon. The Senator from California has \nabsolutely focused on the right thing, making sure we are using our tax \nsystem to generate jobs. It is one of those issues that is going to \nresonate most strongly with the American people in 2004 because it \nmatters in people's lives more than anything else.\n  We have the worst job creation record in 75 years. Contrast that with \nwhat went on in the previous 8 years up through 2000, where we created \n22.5 million jobs with an entirely different tax structure. We were \nfocused on making sure we were increasing the real wages, increasing \nthe earning power of Americans. We did it by increasing the demand.\n  The Senator from California has focused on just the right issue. \nFrankly, as the chart now before us illustrates, in job creation not \nonly for the 1990s but all the way back through President Bush 1 and \nPresident Reagan as well, there was a serious effort to try to create \njobs. We have a series of economic policies right now that are \nundermining not only job creation but the real wages of American \nworkers. It is time we all take steps to try to correct that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question before his time \nexpires?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When my friend goes home to New Jersey and talks to \npeople, does he find what I find; that people are anxious, they are \ninsecure, they are concerned about retaining their job, retaining a \ngood job, retaining health benefits? What I find is, even if people \nhave good jobs, they are fearful of the cost of health insurance.\n  As the Senator knows, in our Democratic jobs alternative, we give a \ntax credit to businesses that pay for all or part of health insurance. \nI wondered if my friend has that same sense when he goes to talk to his \npeople at home?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has used 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend if he will yield an additional minute to \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional 3 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey off the resolution.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate the opportunity to respond.\n  First, a week ago Friday in New Jersey, we closed our next to last \noil production facility. At the end of 2005, an industry that used to \nhave several hundred thousand workers in New Jersey, as recently as 10 \nyears ago, will have zero autoworkers now. We closed a Ford plant a \nweek ago Friday. At the end of 2005, our final auto production facility \nfor GM will close.\n  We have seen the shrinkage of workers in the telecommunications \nindustry, Lucent, and AT, which have been truly remarkable. Over \n100,000 telecommunications jobs have been lost over the last 4 years. \nIt is incredible the tension and the anxiety that people feel about \nboth their ability to work and to care for their families. But\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\nthen to think about the responsibility of health care and their \nretirement security is overwhelmingly a part of the concerns that \nmiddle-class Americans have. The kind of proposal the Senator from \nCalifornia is putting forth addresses those real concerns. I \nreemphasize, it is not only the people who lose their jobs; it is the \npeople who live next door to those folks who see their real wages being \ndepleted to low levels. We are undermining the economic health and \nwell-being of the Nation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, he is so right. Consumer \nconfidence is almost everything in our economy, which is a consumer-\nbased economy.\n  I took economics, so I have an economics background from my college \nyears. But my friend practiced economics and did very well at it. What \nhe says is so important. If your next-door neighbor is suffering \nbecause of a loss of jobs or downward pressure on job income, it has a \ncontagious impact. A lot of this lack of consumer confidence is what we \nare seeing today.\n  I wish to ask my friend another question that has to do with the fact \nwe paid for this amendment. We paid for this in two ways. First, we \neliminate the tax loophole for companies that send their jobs overseas. \nThat brings in $2 billion to pay for this reserve fund for jobs. We \nalso say to millionaires, we know you are going to get back $127,000--\nand people who earn more than that will get exponentially more--so \ninstead of getting back $127,000, you get $85,000. That difference is \nmore than a minimum-wage worker's salary for an entire year.\n  As my friend looks as his people in New Jersey and knows the median \nincome level there, do you think this is a fair thing we do here, ask \neverybody to sacrifice?\n  To reiterate, we are saying to the millionaires of this country, we \nare proud of you, that you got the American dream; and you worked for \nit--most of them did, not all of them. Can't you make that sacrifice so \nwe can put people to work and turn around these numbers?\n  Look at this chart. We talked about this before, going back to Ronald \nReagan. We haven't seen this kind of deal since Herbert Hoover. Looking \nat New Jersey and the people making over $1 million who would be \nimpacted, does my friend not believe we pay for this in a fair way?\n  Mr. CORZINE. I think the Senator from California is talking straight \ncommon sense. I think even those who are doing very well in our society \ncan understand it.\n  First, the millionaires you are talking about are two-tenths of 1 \npercent of the total amount of the taxpayers who would be impacted--\ntwo-tenths of 1 percent. What the Senator is talking about is moving \nmarginal tax rates back to the level where they were during the \nnineties, at a time when 22.5 million jobs were created.\n  Think about it. Moving it back on two-tenths of 1 percent of the \npopulation, to a point in time when economic growth was the highest and \nthe most sustained we had in the 20th century, the most expansionary \nperiod we had in the 20th century.\n  What we are trying to do is turn around the economic performance of \nthe Nation so all will benefit as the performance of our economy \nspreads out. I think it is fair. It is smart because it actually has \nbeen exhibited by history that these kinds of rate structures are not \ninhibiting to the economy; they were a part of the economy at the most \nsuccessful period in the 20th century.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have one more question and that is it. First, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senators Mikulski and Dorgan be added as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator make the Senator from New Jersey a \ncosponsor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for that as well.\n  When we look at the promises made and the reality, I would like my \nfriend----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The initial time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will wait on that. I thank my friend from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nthis amendment. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. I, first, thank my \nfriend from California for her ongoing leadership, her eloquence, her \nunderstanding of these issues, and also my friend from New Jersey, who \nspeaks with such common sense about what this is all about.\n  There are several pieces to this amendment that are critical for my \nState. Frankly, there is nothing more important right now in Michigan \nthan creating a level playing field for our businesses and our workers, \nhelping them to lower the cost of their health care, helping and \nsupporting those efforts to invest in innovation and education, and the \nability to move forward with increased skills and productivity and \ncompete in the world economy.\n  I am very pleased that in this amendment is the type of manufacturing \ntax credit I first introduced last fall and have been working with the \nFinance Committee on to make sure we are rewarding those who are \ncreating manufacturing jobs in the United States of America. We need to \nmake sure they have a lower tax rate, and we need to make sure our tax \nsystem does not encourage those who wish to take our jobs and export \nthem. We want to export products, not our jobs. That is what this \namendment does. It allows us to focus on those things that create jobs \nin America, good-paying jobs, that focus on work, not wealth, in our \ncountry.\n  It is very common sense to say, rather than another tax cut for the \nprivileged few, we want to invest in jobs and strong businesses in \nAmerica for everyone. That is what this amendment is all about.\n  In speaking about this, I want to, once again, raise concern that \nafter 6 months of the President talking about putting someone in the \nDepartment of Commerce to focus specifically on manufacturing, we have \nyet to see that person appointed.\n  My deep concern is that I read in the paper today the person now \nbeing considered, after we have been encouraging this month after \nmonth, is someone who actually has--I don't know this gentleman and \nthis is certainly not a personal attack. I certainly don't know him, \nbut I do know of my concern that his company, Behlen Manufacturing, of \nColumbus, NE, laid off 75 workers in 2002, 4 months after announcing \nplans for a $3 million factory in northwest Beijing. As Yogi Berra \nsaid: It's deja vu all over again.\n  This is the kind of headline we get every day now in my State. I \ndon't want somebody heading up the manufacturing effort who is doing \nthat. I want to see someone who has made a commitment to America and \nAmerican jobs and to help American businesses stay here and be \nproductive. That means fighting for a level playing field on trade \npolicy, currency manipulation, and tackling health care issues. It also \nmeans focusing on those issues that help our companies be more \ncompetitive, more efficient.\n  Two of those programs, which I have been deeply involved in now for \nover 7 years, in the House and now in the Senate, are the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership and the Advanced Technology Program.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a moment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. She was right on target about this manufacturing czar, \nthis potential nominee, who may be a very lovely gentleman; \nnonetheless, what a poor choice. We should be rewarding people and \ncompanies that create jobs for the American people.\n  You know, I wish the world well. I want Iraq to have democracy and \nthe Haitians to have democracy. I want the people of Afghanistan to \nthrive. Lord knows, we spend enough money there to help them. What \nabout people at home? Isn't that our first responsibility?\n  I am telling you, when I have to hear stories from constituents who \nsay, Not only was I laid off and my job is going to be outsourced to a \nforeign country but I have to train my replacement--I say somebody may \ncall that outsourcing; I call it painful. I call it wrong.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, regular order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend from Nevada wants me to get to the question and \nI will.\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\n  When this gentleman moves his jobs to China, does he not get a tax \nadvantage? And are we not closing that loophole--it is the Dorgan \nidea--and does my friend support that, as well as the other items on \nthis list?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely. This is an issue we have to address. We \nhave to make sure our tax policy rewards those who create jobs here.\n  As the Senator from California was speaking about individuals, I \nwould like to share for the record two of literally hundreds of letters \nI have received from people in Michigan speaking about their personal \nsituation. This is not economic theory. These are real-life experiences \nof businesses and individuals in Michigan who are desperately impacted \nright now by our unwillingness to have policies that are good for \nAmerican businesses and jobs at home.\n  One example: A Michigan resident from Union City, MI, writes:\n\n       My wife and I own a small machine shop in Union City, MI. \n     At one time, we had seven employees. Now my wife, my son, and \n     myself are all that's left. Most of the time we don't even \n     have enough work for ourselves. I watched as many of my \n     friends and competitors have gone out of business and just \n     closed their doors or filed for bankruptcy. While we fight \n     the war on terrorism, if we are not careful, we will lose a \n     much bigger war to the rest of the world without firing a \n     shot.\n\n  This economic war, this need to fight for a level playing field for \nour businesses and workers, is every bit as serious to our quality of \nlife as what is happening abroad.\n  One other part of a letter I will share, and this is from a resident \nin Clyde, MI:\n\n       My husband, a 25-year mechanical engineer, designer of \n     automotive special machines, has been laid off seven months. \n     The company he worked for was bought by Fiat and within two \n     years, began outsourcing the engineering to countries such as \n     Bosnia where engineers will work for $6 hourly. Our workers \n     can't compete with that obviously. The engineering department \n     is now closed completely, everything outsourced. He is 55, \n     laid off 2\\1/2\\ weeks short of his retirement vesting at 100 \n     percent, can't draw social security and has been unable to \n     find work. The market is flooded with engineers because \n     outsourcing is happening all over . . . .\n       If we want to maintain the quality of our environment and \n     keep our families fed, we need legislation to address the \n     inequities in manufacturing standards globally, balancing \n     tariffs, something. Our workers can't compete with the \n     salaries outsourcing provides from other countries . . . .\n\n  And maintain our standard of living. I hear this story every single \nday in my State.\n  Before my time is up, I wish to address a couple of very important \nprovisions from which Michigan has greatly benefited, in addition to \nthe issues on tax policy and health care, and the other provisions.\n  The Advanced Technology Program is exactly the kind of program we \nought to be doing in this country and we have been doing, although we \nhave been fighting to keep it going. Now the President this year has \nzero in his budget for this program, even though we hear from the \nadministration rather than tackling issues such as smart trade policies \nand currency manipulation, they say we should focus on education and \ninnovation. Great. But when we have the innovative programs, such as \nATP, they have zero in the budget to fund them.\n\n  What does this do? It allows industries, such as the automotive \nindustry, to come together and partner with our universities on \nprograms and research projects that allow them to be more competitive. \nIt allows them to do activities such that got a headline yesterday in \nthe Detroit Free Press:\n\n       Detroit-based automakers can take pride in a report on the \n     latest issue of influential and assiduously objective \n     Consumer Reports magazine that they have surpassed the \n     Europeans in vehicle reliability.\n\n  I know some of the ways they do that have been to come together in \nprojects funded by the ATP to allow them to create greater reliability, \ngreater efficiencies, to compete in the world economy.\n  The Boxer amendment makes sure we continue this important \npartnership. It is partly funded by the Federal Government and partly \nfunded by the businesses. It is critical.\n  Madam President, I ask for an additional 5 minutes from my esteemed \ncolleague on the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I am happy to yield an additional 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Michigan off the resolution.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  In Michigan, 154 different businesses have been involved with 68 \ncompleted and ongoing partnerships. They are joint ventures as well as \nsingle business applicants. These are exactly what we hear from the \nadministration we ought to be doing: partnerships, public-private \nsector, working with the universities, small investment, big results.\n  The other important part of this amendment that relates to moving \nforward and being positive is the manufacturing extension partnership. \nIt is interesting; some of us have been involved with agriculture and \ncooperative extension. This program is based on that model of bringing \ntogether the best management practices, cutting-edge information, and \nworking with manufacturers to increase productivity and efficiency to \ncompete in a global economy. A very small amount of dollars is involved \nin this particular program, and it yields tremendous results.\n  In Michigan, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership funding is \ncredited with more than $80 million in sales impact, more than $32 \nmillion in cost reductions, and through the regional offices they have \nassisted over 250 companies in my State alone in achieving \ncertification to industry quality standards. This is important. It \nhelps our small and medium-size manufacturers.\n  It has had, in the past, strong bipartisan support. I was deeply \ndisappointed in the Budget Committee when I offered an amendment to \nrestore funding for MEP and ATP, and we did not have bipartisan \nsupport. It was a party-line vote. We certainly can correct that today \nbecause I know in the past there has been good bipartisan support for \nthis amendment.\n  I simply say to my colleagues this amendment gives us an opportunity \nin a very broad sense to focus on what is the most critical issue \nfacing our families and our businesses today, and that is the ability \nto compete in a global economy in a way that keeps jobs and our \nstandard of living in the United States.\n  There is not a business I talk with that does not say: Give us a \nlevel playing field and we will do the rest. We know if, in fact, we \nhave the right kind of policies and the right kind of investments, we \ncan do that.\n  This budget is all about choices. It always is. We are asking for a \nsmall change rather than investing, once again, in the success of those \nprivileged few who have been getting tax cuts and are set to get the \nmost tax cuts right on down the line; that we take a portion of that \nand invest it back in the health of our U.S. economy and the strength \nof the economy for the future and in the quality of life of every \nAmerican, and in those policies that will allow us to have the \nstrongest possible businesses, the best workers, and the most \nsuccessful workers in the world, because the Boxer amendment gives us \nthe ability to do what we need to do to put us on the right track for \nthe future and to continue the quality of life we all want for our \nfamilies.\n  I strongly support the Boxer amendment. I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for yielding me time. I am very hopeful we will see a \nstrong bipartisan vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I am going to have to oppose this \namendment offered by the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and I \nwould like to take a moment to explain why.\n  The spending proposed by the amendment is for a good purpose. We can \nand should find ways to fund this important goal.\n  But I do not believe that we need to roll back tax relief that \nCongress enacted in 2001 to fund this amendment. I supported those 2001 \ntax cuts. Congress enacted them in a time of massive surpluses. \nReturning some of those surpluses to the taxpayer was the right thing \nto do.\n  We can find other offsets to pay for the spending in this amendment. \nOffsets such as the closing of corporate tax shelters currently pending \nin the JOBS bill come readily to mind. Before we start rolling back the \ntax relief that we enacted in 2001, we should ensure that we have taken \nall reasonable steps to obtain revenues through closing down abusive \ntax shelters.\n  And so, I shall reluctantly oppose this amendment, as I did the \namendment offered by the Democratic leader,\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\nMr. Daschle, the day before yesterday increasing veterans' funding--and \nfor the same reason.\n  I shall look forward to working with my colleagues to find other \noffsets for their amendments--offsets that as much as possible avoid \nrolling back the tax relief that we enacted in 2001.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by my colleague from California. I urge all Senators to side \nwith working Americans and vote for this amendment.\n  There has been considerable media attention recently to the dire \nemployment situation in America, but this problem is so acute that I \nthink it bears repeating. Eight million Americans are currently looking \nfor work. Of these, nearly 2 million workers have already been \nunemployed for more than 6 months.\n  The Labor Department told us last week that almost 400,000 Americans \nare not even counted by the unemployment statistics because they have \nsimply given up and left the workforce. In the last 3 years, the Nation \nhas lost 2.5 million jobs--2.5 million.\n  This situation demands a response from the Nation's leaders that will \nactually help create jobs. Unfortunately, the Bush administration is \nfailing this test. Instead of appreciating the crisis facing those who \nhave lost their jobs, this administration presses ahead with failed \neconomic policies.\n  The President continues to call for additional tax cuts tilted toward \nthe wealthiest Americans. He opposes extending unemployment benefits to \nhelp families weather the difficult economy. And recently, his \nadministration actually endorsed the shipment of jobs overseas. The \nbudget resolution before us today makes the mistake of affirming the \nPresident's failed policies.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Boxer offers a starkly different \ndirection. Her amendment includes a series of provisions that will \nrespond to the employment crisis facing America by helping American \ncompanies stay here and add jobs.\n  First, this amendment creates a temporary tax break for businesses \nthat create jobs. In order to help employers feel more confident in \nadding new workers to their payroll, this amendment would reduce the \ncost of hiring during this uncertain time.\n  In addition, the amendment would require the Federal Government, \nwhenever possible, to hire American workers when spending taxpayers \ndollars. This is the least that we owe workers who are struggling to \npay their taxes as they worry that their jobs will be shipped overseas.\n  The amendment also ensures that our Tax Code does not provide \nincentives for companies to move their factories to other countries. \nAmerican businesses should not be allowed to avoid taxation on income \nfrom production that it moves overseas only to ship the goods back to \nthe U.S. The amendment before us would eliminate this perverse \nincentive in our Tax Code.\n  In cases where corporate executives have determined that it is in the \nbest interests of their companies to ship jobs overseas, this amendment \nrequires that the companies show some respect for their workers and \ncommunities by providing sufficient notice before pulling up their \nstakes.\n  The amendment also calls for increased investment in programs that we \nknow help our small- and medium-sized manufacturing companies benefit \nfrom new science and technological developments. Both the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership and the Advanced Technology Program help our \nmanufacturing companies globally. This amendment calls for adequate \nfunding for these important programs.\n  These are just a few of the important provisions of this amendment. \nThe message that this amendment sends is very simple: Congress \nunderstands that Americans need good jobs and we are prepared to \nsupport policies that will help create and maintain these jobs.\n  In my own State of West Virginia, hard-working people expect Congress \nto understand how devastating it is when factories close their doors \nand ship the jobs overseas. Since President Bush came to office, West \nVirginia has lost nearly 10,000 good manufacturing jobs.\n  Manufacturing jobs have traditionally provided a path to the middle \nclass. They offer good wages, health care benefits, and pension plans. \nHaving worked for years to bring new jobs to my State, I know how \nimportant it is to have public policies that will support job creation \nand protect American workers. That is what this amendment would do, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from California for \nthis very important amendment. It is becoming increasingly clear jobs \nare very much an endangered species in this economy. It is the No. 1 \nsubject. When I go home and go from town to town, the No. 1 subject is \neconomic opportunities, jobs, economic growth, and a deepening concern \nthat we are not seeing the kind of economic growth and job \nopportunities all of us would like.\n  We saw yesterday in the very steep selloff in the stock market an \nincreasing concern that economic growth is already stalling out.\n  We have seen in the jobs reports that job growth is badly lagging \nbehind what all of us would like to see, and badly lagging behind what \nwe have seen in other recessions.\n  On March 9 in the New York Times, Paul Krugman, the noted economist, \nhad this headlined article: ``Promises, Promises.'' The subheadline was \n``Wishful Thinking on Jobs.'' He went back and looked at the job \nhistory from 1999 to 2004 and then looked at the forecasts of the \nadministration. He pointed out that back in 2002, the administration \nsaid by this time, or January of 2005, we would have 138 million jobs. \nObviously we do not have 138 million jobs. We are at 130 million jobs \nnow.\n  Then in 2003 they refined that estimate and lowered it substantially \nand said, Well, no, we will not have 138 million jobs; we will have 135 \nmillion jobs. Now this year they revised the estimate again and said, \nWhoops, we were wrong again. We are not going to have 135 million jobs; \nwe are going to have 132.7 million jobs. As of the end of February, we \nare nowhere close to that. We are at 130.2 million jobs.\n  I will go to this chart that shows what has happened in every \nrecession since World War II. In every one of these recessions, we have \nseen on average, 17 months after the business cycle peaked, the job \nrecovery really took off. That has been the pattern of the nine \nrecessions since World War II.\n  Let's compare it to what is happening this time. That is the black \nline. Here we are 36 months since the business cycle peaked and we \nstill see almost no jobs recovery. Something is wrong and it is \nseriously wrong. We are now 5.4 million jobs short of the typical \nrecovery going all the way back to World War II. Look at nine previous \nrecessions. In those other recessions, the job market was soaring by \nthis time. Not now. Something is wrong.\n  Even when the administration dramatically altered and lowered their \nprojection of jobs by January of next year, they still said there would \nbe 2.6 million more jobs by the end of 2004 than 2003. If that forecast \nis to come true, they will have to generate 520,000 jobs a month \nbetween now and the end of the year. The most recent month was not \n520,000 jobs; it was not 420,000 jobs; it was not 120,000 jobs; it was \n21,000 jobs and every one of them was a Government job. There was no \ngrowth in the private sector. Something is wrong.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The quote stating that they expected 2.6 million more \njobs, was that by the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That was Mr. Mankiw, the Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Is that the same administration official, high economic \nofficial, who told us in the annual report, the one President Bush \nsigned off on, that outsourcing jobs was a good thing for America?\n  Mr. CONRAD. He did say that. It is a rather remarkable statement. He \nthought it was good for the country that jobs were outsourced overseas.\n\n[[Page S2600]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think he has regretted that remark, but that is what he \nsaid. He is the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to the \nPresident. He is the same person who said there were going to be 2.6 \nmillion more jobs in 2004 than the jobs we saw in 2003. We can see that \nto achieve that goal, they would have to be generating 520,000 jobs a \nmonth. In February, they had 21,000, and not a single one of them in \nthe private sector.\n  If we think about it, the President says his tax policies are \nworking. If his tax policies were working, the jobs that would be \ngenerated would not be in the Government. The Government jobs are not \ndeveloped by his tax plan. One would expect he would be generating jobs \nin the private sector, and yet if we look at February there were no new \njobs in the private sector. The only new jobs that were created were \nGovernment jobs, and it was only 21,000.\n  By the way, they would have to add 128,000 jobs a month just to keep \npace with the new people coming into the job market, just to stay even. \nIn February there were only 21,000 new jobs, and none of them in the \nprivate sector--all of them in Government. As I say, that is 500,000 \njobs short of the necessary number of new jobs that would have to be \ngenerated to meet the President's chief economic adviser's forecast.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a quick question before my \ncolleague continues? I find this give-and-take very helpful.\n  I read an economic report that said although the jobless rate is \nofficially at 5.6 percent, if one factors in the people who have given \nup, it is well over 9 percent. I wonder if my friend could comment on \nthat, because he talked about how important it is to just keep up with \nthe people who are coming in. What about the people who have given up?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If we just think in our own lives who do we know who is \nout of work, and I started thinking about my extended family and my \nclose friends, and you start adding up the number of people who are out \nof work, in my own family there are people who are highly educated, \nhave had really excellent careers who now are approaching 60 years of \nage, are out of work and finding it extraordinarily difficult to find \nnew work. These are people with advanced degrees who have had very \nsuccessful careers, and yet, because of outsourcing, because of this \njob weakness, they are out of work and cannot find new jobs. Not only \ndo we see it in these statistics, but there is another statistic that \nalso tells us something is wrong, and that is the wage growth of \nproduction workers is now starting to fall behind inflation. I think \nthat is why people feel under so much pressure.\n  The Senator from California mentioned the number of people who have \ngiven up looking for work. Once one gets past a certain point, they are \nno longer counted as unemployed because they have been unemployed so \nlong they are no longer included in the statistics. Being out of work \nis not just a statistic; it is not just a number on a page; it is a \nreal person living a real life with a real family who has lost hope, \nwho has lost an opportunity, who has lost a chance. That is why I think \nthere is such growing concern about what is happening.\n  I had a gentleman who is an executive in the machine tool industry \nwho told me, Senator, at this stage of a recovery our order books ought \nto be full. They are not. Something is happening that is structurally \ndifferent than previous recoveries. He said he believes the jobs are \nbeing created, but the jobs are being created in China, in India, in \nMexico. They are not being created in America.\n  That is why I have to say I believe the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia is important. We need to be much more aggressive and \nproactive at creating job opportunity in this country.\n  The Senator from California is offering amendments to provide \nincentives for businesses to create jobs in America. She is also paying \nfor it, which is the responsible thing to do, instead of just sticking \nit onto the debt. I might remind my colleagues that the budget \nresolution before us runs up the debt by almost $3 trillion over the \nnext 5 years, and at the worst possible time, right before the baby \nboomers retire.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I say to the very able Senator from California, who \nearlier showed a chart about how the rate of people participating in \nthe workforce has dropped, what has happened is you have 4.4 million \nworkers today who are working part time for economic reasons. In other \nwords, they want to work full time but they are only working part time.\n  When you compute the unemployment rate, they are counted as employed, \nnot as unemployed, but really they are only partially employed.\n  Then you have another 4.6 million people who are discouraged and not \ncurrently looking for work who want to work. So they have been knocked \nout of the labor force as well.\n  Actually, there are 13.3 million Americans unemployed, and if you use \nthe broadest measure that the BLS prepares, they report an unemployment \nrate of 10.3 percent. That is factoring in everybody. That is your \nbroadest measure and that is not usually the figure that is focused on. \nOrdinarily, when the unemployment rate figure comes down, those other \nfigures shrink as well. But it is not all moving in the right \ndirection.\n  One of the reasons the unemployment rate figure has dropped just a \nlittle bit is because people are dropping out of the workforce and they \nare not looking for a job or they are being shifted from full-time to \npart-time work. I think that is one of the reasons why, as the able \nSenator from North Dakota points out, as he moves around his State, he \nis encountering more and more people who are concerned about the \nunemployment problem.\n  What the administration says is this particular rate is the \nunemployment rate, but that only tells part of the story. That is only \npart of the story. You have to, in effect, complete the story by \nlooking at those who are working part time but want a full-time job. Of \ncourse, if they have been cut from full time to part time, that makes \nit more difficult to support their family.\n  Then there are the people who want a job but they are so discouraged \nand pessimistic that they have dropped out of the effort to find a job. \nThey don't get counted in that unemployment rate.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would say in response to the inquiry of the Senator, in \nterms of what I found at home, North Dakota has one of the lowest \nunemployment rates in the Nation. We have a very low rate of \nunemployment in our State. Yet job anxiety is growing there. Why? It is \nnot because the unemployment rate is high; it is because good jobs are \nnot available. It is because people who are more highly educated, more \nhighly trained, are not able to get jobs commensurate with their \ntraining and education, and this is creating a whole level of people \nwho are what we would call underemployed--underemployed based on their \nprevious job experiences, underemployed in terms of their education and \ntraining.\n  I say to my colleagues, there was a cartoon in the New Yorker \nmagazine that my wife drew to my attention the other day. The cartoon \nwas two guys who kind of looked like deadbeat guys.\n  One guy says to the other: You know, you are out of work, aren't you?\n  He said to the gentleman: I have quit looking. I understand that's \ngood for the economy.\n  No, it is not good for the economy. That I think is what is \nincreasingly of concern to people. These are middle-class people, \npeople with good education, with good training, who had good jobs.\n  I have a relative who was very advanced in a major corporation and \nhis entire division was laid off. These are very highly skilled people, \nvery highly trained, very highly paid. They found all of their jobs \nwere being shipped to India. To add insult to injury, they were asked \nto go to India to train the people to take their jobs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point? The President was \nin Ohio a day or two ago. Of course, Ohio has been badly hit. They have \nlost manufacturing jobs and they are being hard hit by, in effect, the \nflow of jobs overseas.\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n  This morning's paper says we ran a record trade deficit last month of \n$43 billion. That monthly rate translates into well over a $500 billion \nannual trade deficit--a $\\1/2\\ trillion trade deficit. Of course, \npeople say we are exporting goods and that is true. But we are \nimporting far more than we are exporting, so much so, that we have set \na record monthly trade deficit figure. That only again reflects the \nflow of jobs out of this country, overseas, exactly the point the \nSenator is making. In particular, it is the flow of some very good-\npaying jobs.\n  The manufacturing sector has been very hard hit. The Administration \nset up this post of an Assistant Secretary for Manufacturing. They \nwaited 6 months, they didn't nominate anyone, and now it looks as if \nthe person they are nominating they are not going to go through with \nbecause it turns out he was establishing a factory over in China and \ncutting back on jobs in this country. Can you imagine that?\n  I thank the Senator from California for her amendment. She is right \non target. This is an extremely important amendment. The package she \nhas put together is a very sensible package to try to address this \nproblem.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to pick up on a point the Senator was asking \nabout; that is, what are the implications of these massive deficits, \nboth budget and trade?\n  The Senator mentioned yesterday we just got the latest month's trade \ndeficit, $43 billion. Over a year, obviously, that would be a trade \ndeficit of over $500 billion. At the same time we are running a budget \ndeficit of nearly $500 billion.\n  This article from the Washington Post of January 26 caught my eye \nabout the long-term effects of these massive deficits, both budget and \ntrade. I think these are warning signals to us all. We are on a \ndangerous course with these massive deficits. This is what the article \nsaid: Currency Traders Fretting Over That Dependency.\n  The dependency they are talking about is these massive deficits, the \ntrade deficit the Senator from Maryland referenced and the budget \ndeficit.\n  The currency traders, those who trade currency for their living, are \nconcerned over that dependency, the dependency on borrowing--\n\n       They have been selling dollars fast and buying euros \n     [that's the European currency] furiously. The fear is that \n     foreigners will tire of financing America's appetites. \n     Foreign investors will dump U.S. assets, especially stocks \n     and bonds, sending financial markets plummeting. Interest \n     rates will shoot up to entice them back. Heavily invested \n     Americans will not be able to keep up with rising interest \n     payments. Inflation, bankruptcies, and economic malaise will \n     follow.\n\n  If we look at what has happened to the value of the dollar against \nthe euro in the last 2 years, it ought to sober us up about these \ndeficits. The dollar has declined more than 30 percent in value against \nthe European currency in just the last 2 years.\n  I note Warren Buffett, who, as I understand it, is the second \nwealthiest man in the world, second wealthiest American as well, worth \ntens of billions of dollars, has now placed a major bet against the \nvalue of the U.S. dollar.\n  He has made a $12 billion bet against the value of the dollar in part \nbecause of the economic weakness of our country reflected in these \nmassive budget and trade deficits.\n  I believe deeply we have to get serious about the budget deficit and \nthe trade deficit. Why is it the Comptroller General of the United \nStates is warning us these deficits are too large? Why is it the \nInternational Monetary Fund is warning us of the danger of these \ndeficits, that they will put upward pressure on interest rates, which \nwill choke off economic growth, which will choke off job creation, and \nleave us in an even weaker position?\n  Again, I say this is why I believe the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia is so important. It is an insurance policy to prepare for \nthe economic weakness we are already seeing, the job losses we are \nalready experiencing, and to help us prepare for what might yet come.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Sarbanes and Senator Conrad for their \nenormous contribution in support of this amendment, which is really an \namendment that is made up by the contribution of various members of the \nDemocratic caucus, including Senator Dodd, who has just come to the \nfloor. An important amendment ensuring Federal contracts should not be \noutsourced passed this Chamber with flying colors. It is important. As \na matter of fact, I met with my local elected officials and I asked, Do \nyou have any idea whether any of your department jobs are outsourced? \nThey looked at me, and said, I don't know. I will go back and make sure \ntax dollars aren't being used to create jobs overseas.\n  I thank my friend for his contribution to this amendment. I want to \nask my friend a question. It has to do with this whole notion of the \nanxiety in this country. I think anyone watching this debate \nunderstands there are many reasons for people to feel anxious. They \nfeel anxious when there are deficits as far as the eye can see. It is \nstunning to think back to 3\\1/2\\ years ago. There were surpluses as far \nas the eye could see. What mismanagement.\n  I say to my friend the shocking part is--and when I was an economics \nmajor a long time ago we thought when there were big deficits it would \ncreate a lot of jobs. Here we have a circumstance where you have \nrunaway deficits, runaway debt, and no job creation whatsoever. In \nfact, there is a net job loss.\n  I want to say to my friend from North Dakota, when he talks about the \nbudget deficit, the trade deficit, the twin deficits, there is also the \njob deficit. Now you have the tripling. I think my friend made a good \npoint when he talked about people being laid off and then having to \ntrain their replacement workers. I met such a gentleman who was a \nnewlywed. He had a job as a computer program manager and he had to \ntrain his replacement. I cannot tell you the look on this man's face. \nHe is leaving my State. He thought for sure this could never happen in \nthe Golden State. As we know, it is happening in California and all \nover this country.\n  This is a stunning moment in history. That is why this amendment is \nso important.\n\n  The budget document is in fact the priority of the country. If we \nturn our back on the people of this country who need to work for a \nliving, we shouldn't be here, to be honest, because that has to be an \nessential part of what we do to protect the country, from the \nstandpoint of defense, protect workers and make sure they have jobs.\n  I want to ask my colleague this point about the anxiety in the land. \nI think what is feeding it is when your next-door neighbor loses a job, \nor someone in your family loses a job, you begin to feel anxious. When \nyour next-door neighbor loses his health insurance or pension, you \nbegin to get anxious yourself. Then when you pick up the papers--I put \na lot of this together last night, and you can read this. ``Analysts \nGloomy Over Job Creation''; ``Growth In Jobs Is Still Sluggish''; ``Job \nGrowth Falls Short of Forecast''; ``Jobs Slump''; ``Fewer Small \nBusinesses Plan To Hire''.\n  I am saying to my friend I think all of this is creating an anxiety \nin the land.\n  I will ask this question: Given everything we said--it is not \nrhetoric; it is reality; we have shown the numbers. They are real. We \nhave talked about real families. We have seen what is happening. I ask \nmy friend, is not this the time, if there was ever a time, we should \nsay to the American people whom we care about and their families, their \nability to have a quality of life, their ability to educate their \nchildren and send them to college, and their ability to look at the \nfuture with hope and optimism--wouldn't it be the moment we should be \nunited as Republicans and Democrats and Independents here today in \npassing the amendment we put forward which not only will stimulate jobs \ndirectly but will stimulate small businesses by giving them the tax \ncredits they deserve, so they can pay for health care insurance or \ncreate jobs? I ask my friend, is this not the moment in time to make \nthis a priority for this Senate across party lines?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I think it is undeniably the case. \nSomething is very wrong with the economic strategy we are pursuing as a \nNation. We see the evidence in the job market as clearly as it can be \nseen. The fact is we are now 5 million jobs behind what we would \nnormally see in a recovery.\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nLooking at the nine recessions since World War II--I will put that \nchart back up--this should tell us something is off the track. This is \nthe average job recovery of the nine recessions since World War II that \nyou can see 17 months after the peak of the business cycle peak. We see \nthat, for the average for every one of the 9 major recessions since \nWorld War II, the job recovery started soaring 17 months after the \nbusiness cycle peaked. In this case, we are 36 months past the business \ncycle peak, and we still do not see job recovery occurring.\n  At this point, we are now 5.4 million jobs short of the typical \nrecovery for all of the recessions since World War II. If that doesn't \ntell us something is wrong--and the President's forecasts over and over \nhave had to be revised on jobs. Again, this just appeared in the New \nYork Times on Tuesday. In 2002, the President said by the end of this \nyear there would be 138 million jobs in the country. He revised that in \n2003 and said, Whoops, we were wrong in 2002. There will only be 135 \nmillion jobs by the end of 2004. At the beginning of this year, they \nrevised their estimates again, and said, Whoops, we were wrong again. \nThere are only going to be 132.7 million jobs by the end of the year, \nand even now we see we are nowhere close to that forecast. They have \nbeen wrong in 2002, wrong in 2003, and it looks like they are going to \nbe wrong again. Their forecast, looking at this year, would have to add \n500,000 jobs a month, and in February only 21,000 new jobs were \ncreated, a half million behind their forecast for that month, and not a \nsingle one of the new jobs is in the private sector. Every one of them \nwas a Government job.\n\n  The strategy is not working. I don't know what could be more clear. I \nthink it should tell us it is time for a new game plan.\n  I think what the Senator from California has offered is entirely \nconstructive and it is the beginning of a plan. What this country needs \nis a plan. We need a program to go forward.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  At this point, I will yield the floor. I have a colleague who has \nbeen very patiently waiting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes off the amendment. \nIt should not take me longer than that to debunk the rhetoric I have \nheard on the budget for the last hour or the last hour and 45 minutes. \nIt actually hasn't been on the budget. It has been an attempt to say \nthey care more about jobs than the Republicans do. That is not true. \nThere isn't anything that would bear that out. I have to get this in \nthe Record because I am afraid the college students might read this \nstuff or may have been listening. If they use some of the information \nthey heard, they could fail economics class. I don't want that to \nhappen.\n\n  It has been very depressing listening this hour and 45 minutes. This \nis a 20-minute amendment. That is a long time on a 20-minute amendment. \nBut it is the way this process works. It was 50 hours of time, equally \ndivided, and each side can spend it however they want. We will probably \nyield ours back, portions of it, to be able to get to some final votes \nand get this completed.\n  This has been depressing and wrong. The budget document is a few \nassumptions that we use. Granted, it is based on a pile of documents, \nprobably 20 pounds worth of paper. There are all kinds of ways to work \nthe assumptions, but when it comes down to it, we set up a few targets. \nThe specific committees get to arrange the bull's eye in that target \nfor the priorities. Then, finally, the Appropriations Committee, if we \never get to that point, will be able to shoot the real bullets at the \ntarget, spend the real money.\n  This is not spending the money. This is coming up with some \nassumptions or some real numbers based on assumptions. You can use any \nassumptions you want, obviously, if you have been listening to the \ndiscussion.\n  If you listen to the discussion and what I have said about \nassumptions, you might think what they are trying to do is rearrange \nthe deck chairs on the Titanic. It is not the real operation of the \nship. What we are doing is rearranging the deck chairs on the deck of \nthe finest cruise ship in the world.\n  I want to be a lot more positive about what the possibility is for \nthis country and the people of this country and what they can do.\n  First, I want to know how we pay for it. Then I will go into the jobs \npart. We need to know how most of these amendments work, where they \ntell us how to pay. The way they will pay is a tax increase. They can \nsay this is going to be a tax increase just on the rich. From the \ndiscussions I have heard around here, the Democrat definition of \n``rich'' is anyone who makes enough money to pay taxes. If you pay \ntaxes, worry about it; you are part of the rich.\n  They will say it is those who make over $1 million. It would not be \nthe first time we did something against those who make more than $1 \nmillion. Congress once passed a law--this fascinates me--that said a \nCEO could not make more than $1 million in cash compensation. How could \nanybody possibly do that? If the American dream is to make money--I \nreally hope that is not the American dream--but to make enough to \nprovide for their family, to buy a home, and to contribute to their \ncommunity, until we get this country going down that road, we have \nproblems. Right now the emphasis is on how much you make. We try to \nlimit that severely. We have done it with laws.\n  Now we are saying if you get rich, we will take part of your money, \nand we will put it into the economy where we think it will do the most \ngood. It does not matter what you think. It does not matter that you \nhave been investing and creating jobs. That does not count. The \nGovernment will do it for you. By golly, we have some great programs. \nThese programs will create jobs. Yes, they do create jobs because we \nhire a bunch of people to run the programs, who tell the successful \nbusinessmen how to do it better, and a lot of it goes into regulation. \nI will talk more about regulation in a bit.\n\n  In order to do a tax increase, the Finance Committee has to do it. \nThe only thing we have allowed so far are things that deal with the \nfamily. What we would be directing them to do is take away any family \nbenefits.\n  Who are these rich? Some of them are the small businessmen. Every \ndime of revenue that is net revenue for a small businessman becomes \npart of their bottom line taxes for that particular year. They have to \npay taxes on that. When they pay taxes on it, they are pulling out a \nthird. Some would like it to be a half; some would like it to be three-\nfourths. What do they do with what is left? It does not go in their \npocket. If their business is growing, it goes right back into the \nbusiness. If we did not tax them as much, they would put more back into \nthe business. When they put more back into the business, that grows \njobs.\n  Do not tell me you will increase the economy by ripping money away \nfrom people who are creating jobs already.\n  Who cares about jobs the most? Who wants outsourcing? None of us want \noutsourcing. Why does outsourcing happen? Part of it will be because of \na lack of confidence we create in the Senate. We have been talking for \n2 hours now about the rotten economy and how jobs are being outsourced. \nWe are creating an impression among every businessman out there that if \nhe is not outsourcing his jobs, he is cheating his investors. Did \nanyone hear a message different than that? That is not right. That is \nabsolutely not right. We do not have to have the jobs go overseas.\n  When we keep talking about a bad economy, we help create a bad \neconomy. I am reminded of the 1960s ad that used to run on television \nthat I think was partly responsible for pulling us out of a recession. \nIt was a story about a guy who had a hot dog stand. People loved his \nhot dogs. So he added on to his hot dog stand. Pretty quickly he had \nmore hot dog stands.\n  Then his son came home from college and said: Dad, don't you realize \nwe are in the middle of a depression? How can you be expanding? He quit \nexpanding and he laid people off and pretty soon he was out of \nbusiness.\n  If we keep telling people they should not hire because it is tenuous, \nsave your money, put it in the mattress, we will have a little problem \nin this country. We expect to be paid the highest wages in the world, \nand we expect to buy everything for the lowest prices. Where do you \nthink you are going to buy those things from? I hope everyone out there \ndoes a quick inventory on\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nwhat they are wearing and where it was made; what they are driving and \nwhere it was made; what they are listening to and where it was made.\n  You have a responsibility, as well. Government does not solve these \nproblems. You solve these problems. You buy what is made in America, \nthe jobs come back to America, and our people get paid more.\n  Make a law. Right, we can make a law that says you cannot send the \njobs overseas.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. I listened for almost 2 hours to the other side ask a bunch \nof questions. I would like to get my statement completed in 15 minutes \nso we can move on to the vote. There should have been more fairness on \ngive-and-take at the time. There was not. So I will reserve my time to \nfinish my comments.\n  Another reason the jobs go overseas is regulation. What do we \nspecialize in? Regulation. We pile on regulations that make it \nextremely difficult for businesses in the United States to do work in \nthe United States.\n  Lastly, one of the reasons we lose jobs overseas is skills. There are \njobs out there that are not being filled because American people do not \nhave the skills to take those. The ones who do are already employed in \nthat field.\n  I want to tell about a little company in Powell, WY. This is what I \nam hoping for the world. This little company in Powell, WY, makes \ntachometers, highly specialized ones for race cars, and very durable \nones for heavy equipment that vibrates. The guy who designed these and \noriginally made them had the parts manufactured in Taiwan and the \nconstruction of them, the manufacturing of them, in Taiwan.\n  He said: Now, wait a minute. Maybe I can reduce the error rate \nputting these things together and make more money if I use American \nlabor and those great people in Powell, WY. He tried that, and he was \nright. Then what does he say? He said: Let's see, I am having to \nmanufacture them over there, but they have an error rate. Maybe I could \nmanufacture them here. And he is going to do that. Wyoming--the United \nStates--is going to steal a job from Taiwan. That is the creative \ncapability of the people in this country. That is what we can do if we \ngive the people a chance.\n\n  On a more basic level, how can we give them the chance? We passed the \nWorkforce Investment Act. We got it out of the Labor Committee, which \nis usually very contentious, unanimously. We passed it on the floor \nunanimously. Where is that now? Well, the House has already passed one, \ntoo, but we cannot do a conference committee on it. This would be \ntraining for 900,000 jobs a year, better jobs, more skilled jobs, the \nskilled jobs people overseas are getting because we cannot fill them.\n  What is happening to that bill? We are letting it languish because we \nwill not appoint a conference committee. So what are the reasons given \nfor not appointing a conference committee? Well, we don't trust the \nRepublicans to invite us to the conference committee.\n  I want to tell you, I worked with the Senator from Washington State \nand the Senator from Massachusetts in putting together a bill that \npassed the committee unanimously. I worked with them to get it through \nthis floor unanimously. You do not do that without some degree of \ntrust. I have to believe they would trust me to do a conference \ncommittee and include them in the conference committee, and anything \nelse is bunk. You do not have to do every bill, but I cannot believe we \nwill talk about who cares about jobs the most in this country and not \nget a conference committee on the Workforce Investment Act that will \ntrain 900,000 people a year for better jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time would the Senator from \nConnecticut like?\n  Mr. DODD. Three minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague. I know \nthere are other Members who want to be heard on these matters. I will \ntry to be brief.\n  Mr. President, I will show you a chart. I have great respect for my \nfriend from Wyoming. He is a knowledgeable and good Member of this \ninstitution, and he cares deeply about these issues.\n  I cannot help but note, of course, out of all the States--if I am \nwrong maybe someone will correct me--one of the single lowest job loss \nof the 50 States has been the State of Wyoming, according to the \nanalysis we have on job losses in manufacturing.\n  Mr. President, 1,200 jobs have been lost in Wyoming. I am sorry about \nthose losses, but when you compare that to States of similar size--\nneighboring States--Utah has lost 15,000, Colorado has lost 38,000, \nTexas has lost 156,000, Maine has lost 15,000. I am not even mentioning \nlarge States. Iowa has lost 26,000, Missouri has lost 40,000, Arkansas \nhas lost 29,000, Oklahoma has lost 26,000.\n  The point is, we are watching a hemorrhaging on jobs. No one likes to \nrecite all the bad news, but reality says you have to know the facts if \nyou are going to set policy.\n  Unfortunately, no matter what the conditions are in this country, the \nadministration has one answer: cut taxes for the wealthy. When we had a \nsurplus: cut taxes. When we are in a recession: we need to cut taxes. \nJob growth is weak: we need to cut taxes. It is a Johnny-one-note, no \nmatter what the economic circumstances are.\n  All of us who are involved in supporting Senator Boxer's amendment \nare pointing out that this is maybe the critical issue at this hour. \nPeople across the country are worried deeply about job creation. They \nare worried about jobs leaving the country. They are worried about \ncompanies making that decision, and doing so either through tax \nincentives, where we actually encourage, through the Tax Code, to \noutsource, or actually using Federal taxpayer money.\n  I express my appreciation to 75 of my colleagues in this Chamber who, \nlast week--Democrats and Republicans--joined on the amendment I offered \nthat would prohibit the use of Federal taxpayer money to subsidize the \noutsourcing of jobs.\n  If a private company, with their money, wants to outsource, I cannot \ndo much about that. But I do not believe you ought to incentivize that \ndecision by offering someone a tax break to do it or providing direct \nFederal subsidies to do it. We think we ought to be doing everything we \ncan to encourage job growth at home. That does not make you an \nisolationist. That does not make you a protectionist. It just indicates \nto us how serious we think this potential problem is.\n  It is not just us who say this. I would take note that a few days \nago, in the Washington Post, in a front-page article was the story of \nClintwood, VA, and the loss of 270 jobs. Does anyone think a year or 2 \nor 5 years ago the loss of 270 jobs in Clintwood, VA, would have \nmerited a front-page story in the leading newspaper in this city or \narea? I doubt it. Yet the Washington Post, obviously, has some \nsensibilities about what people care about in this area. And the loss \nof 270 jobs in one small town in Virginia, that got sent overseas by \nTravelocity, is yet one more piece of evidence that people are worried \nabout what is going on in this country, particularly when it is \noccurring because we encourage it through our Tax Code or through \ndirect subsidies.\n  I am glad the President finally decided to suggest we have a \nmanufacturing czar. But to fail to check to find out if the person you \nare apparently going to nominate is involved in exporting jobs to a \nfacility in China indicates a lack of sensitivity about this issue. In \nfact, the other day I read where the administration now is going to do \neverything it can to fight the efforts some of us are making to slow \ndown the outsourcing of jobs in the country, particularly when \noutsourcing occurs through Federal subsidies and through tax \nincentives.\n  We do not think the Federal Government ought to be in the business of \npromoting job exportation to another country or suggesting that somehow \nit is all the same, that it does not make a difference if you have the \nloss of a product being produced here or a service being performed here \nand it is now\n\n[[Page S2604]]\n\ngoing overseas, watching someone's job go overseas.\n  You cannot stop it in every case. We are realists. We understand \nthat. But Senator Boxer has put together a very good amendment which, \nin part, highlights the outsourcing issue. She goes into other areas as \nwell.\n\n  The Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program is being cut by 63 \npercent. I listened to the President the other day say: I am against \noutsourcing. What we need to be doing is investing----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just would note that the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership Program is a significant program that helps U.S. \nmanufacturers, small manufacturers with everything from plant \nmodernization to employee training. This cut means that 11,000 small \nmanufacturers are not going to receive services, and 28,000 employees \nwill either be laid off or not hired.\n  So even if you agree with the President that we ought to not be \ntalking about outsourcing, not be talking about manufacturing job loss, \nthat we ought to be investing in small businesses, what is he doing \nwhen he cuts 63 percent of the budget for the Manufacturing Extension \nPartnership Program? That is a complete reversal of his rhetoric on \nthese issues.\n  He also tries to eliminate entirely the Advanced Technology Program, \nwhich spurs cutting-edge research in solving manufacturing problems and \nincreasing competitiveness. Here we are eliminating that program \naltogether and slashing by more than 50 percent the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership Program.\n  That is what we do not understand. He is opposed to doing anything \nabout outsourcing. He is opposed to doing anything to provide tax \nrelief for small manufacturers who need help. And he is going to cut \nthe budget in the two areas that can make a significant difference to \nour manufacturers.\n  I applaud the Senator from California for offering her amendment, and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Texas such \ntime as he desires on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to talk for a few minutes about the \nBoxer amendment, which would raise taxes by $24 billion, and to say why \nI think this amendment is a miscalculation. Unless, of course, the \nintent of this amendment is to try to convince the American people that \nthe American economy is in the tank and offers no opportunity, no \nhope--something this economy has always provided to American workers, \nand I believe still does today.\n  If, in fact, our colleagues across the aisle believe the economy is \ndoing so badly, I wonder why it is that home-ownership is at an all-\ntime high in this country. Interest rates are low. Productivity is \nbooming. The gross domestic product is growing by leaps and bounds.\n  If the economy was really doing badly, which it is not, the last \nthing you would want to do with a slow economy would be to raise taxes \nto make it harder for the job creators in this society to create new \njobs. I would just ask all of my colleagues to consider what is being \nproposed here. I believe it is simply the wrong answer to the \nchallenges that confront us when it comes to encouraging further job \ncreation and an economy which continues to be the envy of the free \nworld.\n  The amendment we are discussing would do exactly the wrong thing. It \nconflicts with every free market principle this country stands for. We \nknow that entrepreneurs, the risk takers, those who invest their money \nto try to create a profit for themselves and their families, are the \nones who create jobs. When they have more money to invest in their \nbusinesses, they create those jobs.\n  Once again, this amendment is the best indicator that there are still \nthose who believe government really does know best, who want to raise \ntaxes on the American people by $24 billion and throw it around at \ngovernment's whim and then expect new jobs to somehow miraculously \nappear.\n  Let's just step back for a moment and see what the whole picture \nreveals. Sometimes it seems the world is moving faster every day. New \ntechnological advancements have given citizens of the 21st century \naccess to instant information; on-demand services are available \neverywhere. We have an ability to communicate faster and more \ncomprehensively than ever before in the history of the world. Yet with \nthese technological advancements and enhanced abilities, many companies \nhave come to the conclusion that when it comes to manufacturing and \ncustomer assistance and many other areas, location no longer matters. \nThere is not a day that goes by that there isn't another article, \nanother report about a company outsourcing some facet of what they do \nto another country, to another part of the globe.\n  Sometimes these changes are noticeable to every consumer, and \nsometimes not in a positive way. Indeed, what we see with this \namendment, and the comments made in the Chamber, demonstrates the \nbacklash that sometimes occurs when jobs leave our shores and go to \nother countries.\n  The fact is, there is a real and discernible benefit to consumers \nfrom the lower prices that come from efficiencies in labor costs. The \ndollars American consumers spend on products and services buy them a \nlot more than ever before.\n  Yet sometimes these changes are hardly noticeable at all. If a small \npart of the newest computer is now made in India instead of Abilene, \nTX, what does it matter to the consumer? It may not matter to them, but \nit matters to Abilene and it matters to the people who live and work \nthere.\n  Yet even as outsourcing continues to be a subject of discussion, even \nas some of my colleagues in this body throw it out as a trend that is \nbad for America, we all seem to have forgotten that it also runs the \nother way.\n  I am proud to say that Texas is one of the leading beneficiaries of \nin-sourcing, which is just a fancy way of saying ``out-sourcing by \nforeign companies on American soil.'' According to the Texas Department \nof Economic Development, Texas benefits from more than $110 billion in \nforeign direct investment in the state. There are 430,000 Texans on the \npayrolls of foreign corporations. There is approximately $5,000 in \nforeign investment in our state economy per Texan. That is a good \nthing. That helps create jobs for hard- working citizens of my state.\n  But I believe we are missing something important in terms of the \noverall context of the debate. The economy is clearly on the right \ntrack back to recovery. The latest numbers bear that out no matter how \nmuch some would try to disparage the booming economy and what is \nreflected in those numbers. That recovery of the economy will take care \nof the joblessness concerns we all share, regardless of partisanship, \nregardless of any other issue. Yet we are facing another problem in \nthis recovery, and this recovery is an opportunity for us to face the \nproblem head on: The real motivation behind outsourcing, behind the \ndesire of a manufacturer of a product or a service to find efficiencies \nin the way they operate so they can grow and continue to prosper and \nhire more people here in America has to do with the labor force.\n  Given our advanced technological capabilities, why would a business \npay someone in America to do a job when they can go to another country \nwhere there is no minimum wage or labor laws or other restrictions on \nwhat they do? The conventional wisdom is that no business will choose \nAmerica merely out of loyalty, that instead they will study the numbers \nand realize it makes more economic sense to run their telephone banks \nin Malaysia, for example, instead.\n  In response, some in this body and elsewhere have concluded that the \nanswer is more job training and funding for education and advanced \nlearning programs. Statistics suggest more and more people are taking \nadvantage of these educational and work-related resources.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently commented:\n\n\n[[Page S2605]]\n\n\n       Generic capabilities in mathematics, writing, and verbal \n     skills are the key to the ability to learn and to apply new \n     skills and thus to earn higher real wages over time.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator such time as he \nmay consume from the resolution to complete his statement.\n  Mr. CORNYN: I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       Generic capabilities in mathematics, writing, and verbal \n     skills are key to the ability to learn and to apply new \n     skills and thus to earn higher real wages overtime. The \n     avenues to acquiring those skills are many, and one effective \n     tool we have developed to facilitate the transition to a new \n     job or profession has been our community colleges. These two-\n     year institutions have been in the forefront of teaching the \n     types of skills that build on workers' previous experiences \n     to create new job skills. Currently almost one in three of \n     their enrollees are age thirty or older, a statistic that \n     suggests that these individuals have previous job experience.\n\n  I support the job training and community college initiatives the \nPresident has endorsed in his State of the Union Message and which Alan \nGreenspan just referred to. They are a good and positive thing. They \nprovide much of the answer to the global competitiveness we now find \nwith globalization. I believe much of the instruction they provide \nought to have been given at the lower levels, but we can't go back and \nchange that. As it is, these programs give many Americans the \nopportunity to change their job track midstream and to pursue greater \ndreams and more fulfilling careers.\n  But that is not enough. If we in Government fail to acknowledge what \nthe outsourcing crisis truly means, if we think more job training alone \nis a sufficient answer to the problem, we are just fooling ourselves, \nand we haven't addressed the real problem.\n  As Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       We've gone astray from first principles. We've lost sight \n     of the rule that individual freedom and ingenuity are at the \n     very core of everything we've accomplished. Government's \n     first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.\n\n  In America today, we are seeing that all too clearly.\n  All too many of our states have reached the point where they are \nsimply no longer friendly toward the free market. Why should a business \nchoose to stay in America where they will have to deal with ever \nexpanding red tape and regulation, where they face exponential legal \nrisks in states without real commonsense tort reform and class action \nreform, where they are virtually guaranteed to pay higher and higher \ntaxes every year?\n  No, raising taxes won't solve this problem. Job training and \neducational programs alone won't solve the problem either. The knee-\njerk response of many in government, to take more money from the \ntaxpayers so we can throw it around, doesn't work.\n  The only way we will solve the problem is when we in the Federal \nGovernment work in concert with those in the states to effect \nfundamental change in our government's attitude toward business and the \nfree market--not just for the benefit of business or indeed for an \nabstract free market, but for the benefit of everybody in this country \nwho wants to work and wants to find a job. We must once again value the \nprinciples of free trade and competition. We must encourage success and \ninnovation, and not punish it. We must renew that old American \nconviction that protecting freedom, not restricting it, is the highest \ngoal of government.\n  The vision of America as a free market paradise is a very real one, \nnot just the stuff of the so-called overexuberant economists. I \nstrongly believe we have the best workforce in the world, the most \ndedicated people you can find. We have in this country innovators and \nthinkers, we have doctors and scientists, and we have all the resources \nthey need. We have people who started businesses in their garage and \nnow create things that change the very way we live and communicate. We \nhave young people who are ready to follow in their footsteps. That is, \nsimply stated, the foundation for a thriving free market economy. It is \nall right here.\n  We still hear the voices of those who say the bureaucrats really know \nbest, and government will take care of you if you will give us more and \nmore of your tax dollars. But the truth is the people across this land \nknow that government doesn't know best, and they know government cannot \ncreate prosperity; that instead prosperity is created by the \nentrepreneurs and risk takers, and the people who work hard every day \nto provide for their families.\n  The truth is, instead of raising taxes, we ought to reduce the tax \nburden on the American people by eliminating the tax increases that \ncome with the expiration of the tax cuts this Congress previously \npassed. There are people, some of whom are in this very body, who still \nhonestly believe we can sue, tax, and regulate our way to economic \ngrowth and prosperity.\n  Finally, I want to say I realize we are in an election season, and \nthere are some who have pinned their political prospects on America \ndoing badly, on unemployment remaining high. When they see that the \nfacts are against the trend they want, that the economy is actually \ndoing better, their only hope for their political prospects is to talk \nabout a ``jobless recovery.'' Well, the economy is recovering; it is \ncreating jobs. But it will not continue to do so if we reverse the \npolicies that have brought us to where we are today. We must ensure \nthat the taxpayers keep more of the money they earn, so they can save \nit or invest it in a small business--which is a great job-creating \nengine in this country--the small businesses that proliferate in this \nNation, which provide jobs by huge numbers to the American people.\n\n  I simply believe we should not let ourselves lose confidence in what \nhas brought us here today. There are those who think they will benefit \npolitically from trash-talking the American economy, from causing a \nloss of confidence by the American people, from saying that we are no \nlonger the land of opportunity and freedom. But the truth is there are \npeople who are dying to come into this country because they see this \nnation as their only hope and only opportunity. There are not people \nknocking down the doors to try to leave this country, because the truth \nis people are voting with their feet. They understand America remains \nthe last, best hope of freedom-loving people everywhere.\n  For those who want an opportunity to achieve part of the American \ndream in the free market system we have in this country--not a \ngovernment command-and-control system, but a free market system is one \nthat best allows them to achieve those hopes and dreams--they recognize \nthat system is what we need to preserve, not defeat. The effect of \npassing this amendment and others that would raise taxes on the \nAmerican people would defeat that system.\n  I hope we don't listen to the nay-sayers, that we don't believe those \nwho would have us lose confidence in our economic system, because I \nthink that provides the best opportunity for a bright future for all \nthe American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I love everybody in this Senate, but I \nwant to finish this bill this week. My guess is we have a few \namendments in the pipeline and we have considered one amendment today \nand we are not quite finished with it. That is not the kind of \ndiscipline we need to finish it. I ask, how much time remains on the \nresolution on both sides?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six hours 50 minutes for the Senator from \nOklahoma, and 5 hours 39 minutes for the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I plan on yielding back some time, as I have said. \nUnfortunately, we started this amendment at 9:30 and we have been on it \nnow for a couple of hours. It is an interesting amendment, but it is \nnot that interesting. I am troubled. I have 6 hours and 50 minutes. Mr. \nPresident, I yield back 4 hours off of our time on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. That time is \nyielded back.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I plan on yielding back additional time. I came in today \nthinking we should have 10 minutes on each side on every amendment \ntoday. I don't want to cut people off from being able to debate their \namendments. My colleague from North Dakota is correctly wanting to have \ntime agreements on a multitude of amendments. I am willing to enter \ninto those, but I am insisting on being able to see the\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\namendment. I know my colleague from North Dakota is trying to get them. \nA lot of people say I want a time agreement, but they are rewriting the \namendment as we speak. That is not fair. We need to have both sides be \nable to analyze the amendments so we will know what we are debating, \nespecially if we are going to be in a very truncated timeframe. If I am \ndebating an amendment and I say it increases taxes by $24 billion, I \nwant to be accurate. I actually insist on accuracy. It bothers me if we \nare not accurate.\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak on the Boxer amendment for a \nmoment. We had a time limit of 20 minutes on each side on the Boxer \namendment. It was breached very significantly primarily on the Democrat \nside, and maybe a little bit on our side. This is an amendment that \nsays we want to do some things to create jobs domestically, but in \neffect it says we want to sock it to the people creating jobs by \nincreasing their taxes.\n  Then it says we will give tax credits if you do such and such. It is \na tax-spend amendment, $24 billion of increased taxes. Incidentally, \nthe taxes we are assuming for next year--and this has an $8 billion tax \nincrease for 2005. What we are assuming in the budget for 2005 is $2.6 \nbillion for child credit and $5.4 billion on marriage penalty. So this \ncould eliminate the child credit and the marriage penalty. I find it to \nbe a very flawed concept.\n  Also, I can't help but think the repercussions they would have if we \nactually did some of what is contemplated in this amendment. We are \ngoing to sock it to companies that have runaway plants. I wonder if \n``runaway plants'' is defined by Microsoft or by Intel or General \nElectric or some of our great multinationals we have in this country. \nIf we are going to tax them at rates that are greatly to the \ndisadvantage to their competitors, this amendment is more or less \nsaying we would like your headquarters, Intel, to be in China, or maybe \nwe should have Microsoft's headquarters in Japan. Our Tax Code actually \nencouraged the location of Chrysler to be in Germany, and this \namendment would make it worse: Let's export jobs and headquarters \noverseas. This may be well intended, it may be a political amendment, \nbut its economic consequence would be a disaster.\n  The Finance Committee is working on a FSC/ETI bill that has broad \nbipartisan support. The essence of it is to be WTO compliant and also \nto assist manufacturers. I do not happen to agree with preferential \ncorporate rates for manufacturers vis-a-vis other corporations, but it \nhas a lot of positive provisions to help make us competitive with \nparticularly our European allies. That bill has bipartisan support. We \nought to pass it.\n  I think the proposal that has been discussed for the last 3 hours \nwould be very detrimental. It is a big tax increase, and since the only \ntax change we are contemplating is keeping the tax laws as they are for \nAmerican families, I am afraid this will be a big hit on American \nfamilies.\n  At the appropriate time, I will urge my colleagues to vote no on the \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the next order of business is the Senator from \nMaryland, Mr. Sarbanes, to offer an amendment. I ask unanimous consent \nthat we set the Boxer amendment aside and consider the amendment of \nSenator Sarbanes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Not on my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I was going to try to get a time limitation because the \nSenator seemed anxious to do that. I am happy to try to cooperate in \nthat effort. Would 30 minutes equally divided be acceptable, 15 minutes \non a side?\n  Mr. NICKLES. That will be more than acceptable. I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be 30 minutes equally divided on the Sarbanes \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might we also lock in the Dorgan amendment? We have a \ncopy of that amendment, and we have gotten an agreement on our side to \nhave 20 minutes equally divided on that amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will agree with that, Mr. President. I amend my \nrequest to include the Dorgan amendment to be 20 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The pending amendment is set aside, and the Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2789\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for himself, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Biden, Mr. Levin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \n     Corzine, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Rockefeller, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2789.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To fully fund the FIRE and SAFER Acts and reduce the debt by \n   reducing the tax breaks for the top one percent of income earners)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $429,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $1,430,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $858,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $143,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $429,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $1,430,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $858,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $143,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $429,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $1,430,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $858,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $143,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $429,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $1,859,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $2,717,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $2,860,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $2,860,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $429,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $1,859,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $2,717,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $2,860,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,860,000,000.\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE FUND FOR FIRE ACT AND SAFER ACT PROGRAMS.\n\n       The Chairman of the committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations \n     to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, \n     discretionary spending limits, and other appropriate levels \n     and limits in this resolution by up to $1,430,000,000 in \n     budget authority for fiscal year 2005, and by the amount of \n     outlays flowing therefrom in 2005 and subsequent years, for a \n     bill, amendment, motion, or conference report that provides \n     additional fiscal year 2005 discretionary appropriations, in \n     excess of the levels provided in this resolution for \n     firefighter assistance grant programs such as those \n     authorized by Title XVII of the FY 2001 National Defense \n     Authorization Act (P.L. 106-398) and by Section 1057 of the \n     FY 2004 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 108-136) and \n     are administered by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I offer an amendment today to fully fund \nthe Assistance to Firefighters grant program, and to fully fund the \nStaffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) Act, which, \nof course, provides for additional staffing.\n  As a Co-Chairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I am \npleased to offer this amendment. I certainly underscore and recognize \nthe significant role which my colleague, Senator Dodd of Connecticut, \nhas played on both the firefighter grant program and the SAFER Act.\n  In his budget for 2005, the President requested only $500 million for \nthe FIRE grant program. This is a cut of close to $250 million, a third \nof the\n\n[[Page S2607]]\n\nfunding for this program from the levels established by the Congress \nover the past two fiscal years. The fully authorized amount for the \ncurrent fiscal year is $900 million, and this amendment would seek to \ntake the program to that level.\n  The FIRE grant program is a competitive grant process that funds \nfirefighting equipment, firefighting vehicles, fire prevention, and \nsafety programs. Unlike many other programs directed toward first \nresponders, these funds go directly to local communities and fire \ndepartments and do not pass through the States.\n  The Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Act, the SAFER \nAct, would provide 4-year grants to career and volunteer fire \ndepartments for firefighter hiring. The Congress authorized this \nprogram in the fiscal year 2004 Defense Authorization Act at a level of \n$1.03 billion, and this amendment seeks to fund that program at the \nauthorized level.\n  Regrettably, the budget the President sent to the Congress, despite \nthe fact he signed the legislation contending the authorization of the \nSAFER Act, contained no money; indeed, no mention of it, as I indicated \nbefore, while the budget he sent to the Congress with respect to the \nfirefighter grant program reduces that program from the previously \nappropriated amounts in two successive fiscal years of approximately \n$750 million to $500 million.\n  The need for both of these programs is very strong; indeed, I would \nsay overwhelming. In December of 2002, FEMA and the National Fire \nProtection Association jointly released the congressionally authorized \nNeeds Assessment of the U.S. Fire Service. The results of this report \nwere startling. Among its findings, the report noted that an estimated \n57,000 firefighters lacked protective clothing; half of all fire \nengines are at least 15 years old; and approximately one-third of \nfirefighters are not equipped with essential self-contained breathing \napparatus, one of the most important and basic safety devices for any \nfirefighter.\n  The need for the SAFER program is equally evident. OSHA has set a \nstandard that dictates that four firefighters are needed to respond to \nany structural fire, two inside the structure and two outside. The \nFEMA-National Fire Protection Association Needs Assessment estimates \nthat, on average, close to half of all fire departments in communities \nof less than 1 million people are forced to respond to emergencies with \nfewer than the four firefighters mandated by these standards.\n  The SAFER Act would go a long way in ameliorating this severe \nstaffing shortage and would provide funding for 75,000 new firefighters \nover the next 7 years.\n  This amendment, which provides the full funding for both the \nAssistance to Firefighters grant program and the SAFER Act, will go a \nlong way in preparing our Nation's firefighters for the hazards that \nface them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, it is all well and good to run \nads on the television that show our firefighters meeting their duty, \ncarrying out their heroic responsibilities. But if we really want to \nhonor our firefighters we need to fund these programs, both to give \nthem the staffing and to provide them the equipment they so desperately \nneed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in response to the suggestion of the \nSenator from Maryland, I point out that this amendment not only \nincreases spending but it raises taxes. It is a specific assumption \nthat tax levels will be increased and spending will be directed with \nthose funds to a homeland security function involving first responders, \nfirefighters.\n  The budget resolution submitted by the President to the Congress asks \nfor $3.6 billion for fiscal year 2005 for first responders. During the \nappropriations process, the Congress is going to determine the exact \nlevel of funding for each program within that general broad category in \nthe budget resolution, but this resolution before the Senate approves \nand suggests the President's requested level is appropriate and that \nought to be the level the Senate approves.\n  Since the events of 9/11, Congress has responded with significant and \ngenerous support for our Nation's firefighters and other first \nresponders. Over $1 billion has been specifically appropriated for \ndirect assistance to firefighters since fiscal year 2002. In addition \nto specific Federal assistance, States and local communities can use \nthe funds available through the Office of Domestic Preparedness to \nsupport the needs of firefighters at the local level. Over $5.7 billion \nhas been appropriated to the State and local grant program through the \nOffice of Domestic Preparedness since fiscal year 2002.\n  For our most threatened communities, the funds available through the \nhigh-threat, high-density urban grant program can also be used to \nassist firefighters. Over $1.4 billion has been appropriated to this \naccount since fiscal year 2003.\n  I do not think Congress has ignored the interests of the first \nresponders, nor has this administration. I know of numerous \nannouncements that have been made in my State, as there have been in \nmany other States, of specific grant allocations throughout the States \nto the local communities that have applied for funds, that have tried \nto upgrade equipment, and improve training opportunities. This is all \nfor the purpose of making sure our homeland will be protected in the \nbest possible way by those who are on the front lines; that they will \nhave what they need to do their jobs, and that they will have the \ntraining to do it safely.\n  This is a very important matter, and I think not only has the \nAppropriations Committee responded through the new Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, but so have the authorizing \ncommittees that have made available these new programs, specifically \nauthorizing them for the benefit of those at the local level who are \nfirefighters and who are called upon to be the first person on the \nscene in the case of a disaster, whether it is a natural disaster or \nwhether it is a disaster that is occasioned by the attack of \nterrorists.\n\n  Like all programs, we are going to continue to listen to those who \nhave the obligation of meeting these responsibilities to be sure they \nhave what they need to do their jobs and to carry out their mission \nsuccessfully. We are working hard to assist them to the best of our \nability.\n  Any Senator has the opportunity to offer an amendment to a budget \nresolution to increase spending for any popular program, but at some \npoint we have to recognize that the committee of jurisdiction has a \nresponsibility, too. That is the responsibility to make the tough \ndecision that it is going to be $1 billion for this program, or $2 \nbillion for that program.\n  These are not easy decisions. But this committee has gone through the \nprocess of reviewing the request from the administration, listening to \nall of the suggestions made in the committee, weighing our \nresponsibilities to provide the moneys we would like to provide and \nthen providing the moneys available to us through the tax process that \nwe can expect to be available for allocation.\n  This is a tough job. It is not a fun job. I respect the work that has \nbeen done by the Budget Committee. As chairman of the subcommittee that \nhas jurisdiction over the funding of the activities of the Department \nof Homeland Security, we try to bring to the process the same kind of \ndiligence and sensitivity to the needs of those who will receive the \nfunds but also to the budget process and to the integrity of the \nprocess so we do not undermine our capacity to get our economy moving \nagain and to continue to grow.\n  Working within the current fiscal constraints and trying to exercise \ngood judgment, we must set priorities. I urge the Senate to reject this \namendment and make the choice to support the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the budget submitted by the President \nreduces funding for grants to local police, fire and emergency medical \nagencies from $4.2 billion in the current fiscal year to $3.5 billion \nin fiscal year 2005, a very substantial cut.\n  This cut comes despite a June 2003 report entitled ``Emergency \nResponders Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared,'' issued by \na commission headed by our former colleague, Senator Warren Rudman of \nNew Hampshire. The title of that report, again, is ``Emergency \nResponders Drastically Underfunded, Dangerously Unprepared.''\n  The President's budget for the firefighter grant program, which \nprovides this badly needed equipment, asks for $500 million. We \nappropriated $750 million in this year's budget and in the previous \nyear's budget. Yet the President is cutting that figure by one-third. \nThe President's budget provides no funding for the SAFER Act, which \nthis Congress passed last fall, and which provides State, local, and \nregional agencies with funds to hire firefighters, paramedics, \nemergency medical technicians, rescue workers, ambulance personnel, and \nhazardous material workers for local fire departments.\n  These fire departments desperately need these funds. The question is \nthen, as the Senator pointed out, how will they be paid for? Well, the \ntax cuts that have been received by the top 1 percent are $45 billion \nannually. A small percentage of that in the single numbers shifted from \nthat purpose to this purpose would enable us to fund these firefighter \nprograms at the fully authorized level.\n  These are questions of choice, and the choice very directly put by \nthis amendment is whether a portion of these outsized tax reductions \nfor the top 1 percent of the population ought not to be shifted to \nenable our first responders to get the equipment and staffing, and get \nthe training which they need in order to handle the situations that \nface them. It is not a sufficient tribute to firefighters, in my \njudgment, to show them on TV ads carrying out their heroic \nresponsibilities and then to fail to provide them with the resources \nthey so clearly need in order to be able to do the job.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 9 minutes on the majority side \nand 4 minutes 18 seconds on the minority side.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. One other point I should have made when I was responding \nto the remarks of my good friend from Maryland was he suggested the \nadministration has somehow failed to fund the so-called SAFER Act. This \nis legislation that was adopted and signed into law last year, at the \nend of the year, almost, November 25, 2003, by the President. The \nbudget process for fiscal year 2005 had already begun. The budget \nsubmissions were on their way, in fact, through the pipeline. Given \nthere will be an opportunity to review the new authorization that was \ncontained in the SAFER Act, which was actually a part of the Defense \nauthorization bill, it will be reviewed as we go through the next \nbudget cycle and it may be reflected as a specific request for funding \nnext year. I don't want to make the presumption as to what the \nadministration's decision will be regarding specific amounts for this \npurpose. It was simply premature, I think, to suggest the \nadministration has failed to fund the SAFER Act. That is the point.\n  I mentioned all the other authorizations the Congress has approved \nand the requests for funding the administration has made for additional \nprograms. I don't think anyone who has been reading the papers or \nfollowing the progress of the financial commitments that have been made \nby the Federal Government to State and local communities for first \nresponders can ignore the fact that there has been a gigantic infusion \nof funding for these purposes. Local volunteer fire departments, \ncommunities that have training facilities and those who do not, have \nbeen able to get money to send people for specialized training. Some \ncommunities have been able to obtain equipment they had never had an \nopportunity to purchase, and wouldn't, under the tax structures of \nthese towns and cities, have a chance to obtain. The response has been \nenormous.\n\n  You can say: Well, more needs to be done.\n  My answer is: More will be done. We are continuing to look for ways \nto support the activities that are important at the local level to \nequip our first responders. Firefighters are certainly included. I am \nproud of the aggressive way the administration has moved to respond and \nto act in a generous way, and to provide the requests and the support \nfor these training and equipment activities. We have special funds \nallocated to high-threat urban areas. I mentioned that over $1.4 \nbillion that has been appropriated to that grant program since fiscal \nyear 2003.\n  I am hopeful we can continue to see the Government respond in a \nthoughtful way to make sure we continue to set the priorities that need \nto be set and support those who are responding to save lives and \nprotect the citizens of this country. I am proud of the work we are \ndoing, too, here in the Congress to support these efforts. There is not \nenough money to satisfy some people, and there never will be. But \nworking together with local communities and State governments to \nidentify the highest priorities, to make sure we allocate the funds in \na fair and reasonable way is our obligation. I think the Budget \nCommittee has done a good job sorting through all the requests and the \nsuggestions that have been made by the Senate for this resolution. I \nthink we should applaud them.\n  I support the committee and hope the Senate will reject this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I again underscore the tremendous need \nfor these resources in order for our firefighters to be able to carry \nout their responsibilities. In June of last year, not even a year ago, \nthe Rudman Commission, headed by our former colleague Warren Rudman, \nissued a report entitled ``Emergency Responders Drastically \nUnderfunded, Dangerously Unprepared,'' that found budget shortfalls in \nthe tens of billions of dollars. We need to address this issue.\n  The history of the administration on this matter is regrettably a \nsorry tale. When we created the Fire Grant Program in 2000, the Bush \nAdministration, when it came in, moved to eliminate the program in its \npreliminary budgetary vision for fiscal 2002. We had to fight the \nadministration to put the program back in its budget request for that \nyear. In the end, it proposed flat funding the program.\n  After the attacks of 9/11--and as I noted earlier, we are now seeing \ntelevision spots showing our firefighters carrying out their heroic \nresponsibilities--Congress appropriated an additional $210 million in \nemergency spending for the program, recognizing its significance. The \nadministration refused to spend the money initially, and eventually and \nreluctantly did so after an outcry from the Congress.\n  In the fiscal year 2003 budget they proposed rolling this Fire Grant \nProgram into the general first responder account. There was great \nconcern in the Congress about dismantling the specific program. We \nappropriated almost $750 million to the program in its own account.\n  Last year the President sought to cut it by a third. Last year the \nCongress--and I give credit to my colleagues for this--restored the \nfunding to close to $750 million.\n  This year the budget submitted to us again cuts it to $500 million \nand there is no money for the SAFER Program, even though it had been \nauthorized back in November.\n  We need these resources. The Rudman Commission has told us in their \nreport, emergency responders are drastically underfunded and \ndangerously unprepared. We need to change that equation and we can \nbegin the process of doing so by providing the resources to fund these \ntwo programs at their authorized level, paying the firefighters the \ntribute they deserve by giving them the protective tools and the \nstaffing with which to do their job.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 4 minutes 20 seconds for the \nmajority, 34 seconds for the minority.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the Senator from Mississippi mind if I make a \ncouple of additional comments and I will be happy to yield him \nadditional time if he wishes.\n  I know some people think we never do enough anywhere. Basically they \nwill want to increase spending everywhere. In this particular area we \nare increasing spending a lot.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has a 15-percent increase, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. That is counting \nbioshield. That is kind of hard to compute. Take bioshield out. It is a \n10-percent increase--a 10-percent increase. Secretary Ridge wants to \nreallocate some of it into higher threat areas. I know some people want \nto use homeland security as basically revenue sharing and give more \nmoney to every city in the area, or every county in the area, maybe \nevery police department or fire department and say this is for homeland \nsecurity. Secretary Ridge said we should reallocate some of these \nmoneys. It is still a big increase. Actually, it is the largest \npercentage increase of any of our major departments, and we should \ndirect this toward the high critical threat area. I compliment him for \nthat.\n  I also say this is money wasted. A lot of money is being wasted. \nMaybe a little tightening might be in order.\n  The District of Columbia used this to outfit leather jackets on the \npolice side; in Maryland, money is used to buy the Prince George's \nCounty prosecutor's office a security system.\n  This is homeland security, but this is all in one pot. We can try to \npretend this is going to this or that, but, frankly, we are giving so \nmuch money to the appropriators. But we are expecting at least a 10-\npercent increase going to homeland security.\n  In Virginia, a small volunteer fire department spent $350,000 on a \ncustom-made fire boat. The Metropolitan Washington Council of \nGovernments used some of the money for janitorial services. The \nDistrict of Columbia Hospital Association shows a formula that \nguaranteed every city hospital a share of an $8 million grant. Prince \nGeorge's homeland security funds, instead of buying protective gear for \npolice officers, they chose to purchase a half-million-dollar digital \ncamera system used for mug shots. The District of Columbia, Leslie \nHotaling, director of the District's Department of Public Works said, \n``If we can tie it to 9/11 and build capacity into our core \nfunctioning, let's do it.'' Her agency spent more than $55,000 on basic \ntraining courses such as map reading and handling problem employees.\n  My point is that Secertary Ridge requested--and he has a very \ndifficult and challenging job--10 percent more money for the Department \nof Homeland Security, and we have provided it for them. He wants to \nreallocate some of it to higher priority areas. I think we are trying \nto give that to him to fulfill that function. Senator Cochran manages \nthis appropriations bill, and he does it very well.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the Sarbanes amendment.\n  Also, I failed to add this amendment raises taxes by $2.9 billion. It \nis another big tax increase.\n  The only taxes we are really assuming in the next couple of years are \nfamily-friendly tax cuts. Maybe that means the 20-percent tax credit \nwon't continue to be as broad as it is. Maybe it means the child credit \nwon't be extended.\n  I urge our colleagues not to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President. I rise in support of this amendment to help \nthe Nation's firefighters safely do their jobs.\n  Specifically, this amendment does three things. First, it restores \nfunding to the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which I \nauthored in 2000 with Senators DeWine, Levin, and Warner. This law \nstands as the first federal grant program explicitly designed to help \nfirefighters throughout America obtain better equipment, improved \ntraining, and needed personnel.\n  Second, this amendment provides funding for the implementation of the \nSAFER Act. This law, which I authored with Senator Warner and was \nenacted last November, authorizes a federal grant program to hire an \nexpected 75,000 new firefighters over the next seven years.\n  Finally, this amendment allocates much-needed funding for deficit \nreduction. The Senate budget resolution, which largely reflects \nPresident Bush's irresponsible fiscal policies, adds a staggering $2.86 \ntrillion to the national debt over the next 5 years.\n  Mr. President, $2.86 trillion dollars! These numbers are totally \nmind-boggling. The Republicans have always claimed that they are the \nparty of fiscal responsibility. Under their Senate Budget resolution, \nhowever, $612 billion will be added to the gross debt from 2004 to \n2005; the next year $569 billion will be added; the next year $553 \nbillion; the next year $553 billion; the next year $563 billion; and \nthe next year $564 billion will be added to the debt. Despite the \nclaims of President Bush and the Budget Committee majority, I see no \nsignificant progress being made at reducing the increases to the debt. \nIn fact, we've gone from record surpluses to record deficits in only 3 \nyears!\n  The offset we are proposing to pay for this amendment is a reduction \nin the tax cuts benefiting individuals with annual incomes over $1 \nmillion. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the \nSenate budget resolution calls for tax cuts which are extremely \nbeneficial to the wealthiest Americans such as accelerating the repeal \nof the estate tax by 1 year, and making permanent the capital gains and \ndividend tax cuts. With the deficit exploding, the country still \nvulnerable to terrorist attack, and our Nation's firefighters in need \nof the resources necessary to respond to emergencies and to save lives, \nit is only right that the top one-tenth of one percent of the \nwealthiest Americans pay their fair share for homeland security.\n  In fact, Mr. President, homeland security is exactly what this \namendment is all about. The defenders on our home front are not dressed \nin combat fatigues. They do not drive tanks on the streets of the \nNation's cities. They wear firefighter uniforms, and they drive fire \nengines. They risk their lives to keep us safe just like our troops \noverseas, and I for one appreciate their efforts greatly.\n  I know that the fire service has men and women who are willing to do \nwhatever it takes to get their jobs done. We have first-rate \nfirefighters throughout the Nation, but they are underfunded, \nunderstaffed, undertrained, and underequiped to deal with many \nemergencies that may arise.\n  The responsibilities of America's firefighters have changed. They \nhave certainly come a long way from the ``bucket brigades'' in colonial \nAmerica, where two rows of people would stretch from the town well to \nthe fire, passing buckets of water back and forth until the fire was \nextinguished.\n  Today, firefighters must do more. They still have their traditional \nresponsibilities of extinguishing fires, delivering emergency medical \nservices, and ensuring that fire codes are inspected. Now the fire \nservice has new homeland security responsibilities, such as responding \nto biological and radiological agents.\n  The reality, however, is that cash-strapped States and cities simply \ndo not have the resources--financial as well as personnel--needed to \nsingle-handedly safeguard their populations. Nor do they have the \nfiscal reserves necessary to deal with heightened warning levels for \nany extended period of time.\n  According to a national Needs Assessment study of the U.S. Fire \nService published in December 2002, most fire departments lack the \nnecessary resources and training to properly handle terrorist attacks \nand large-scale emergencies. The study found that:\n  Using local personnel, only 11 percent of fire departments can handle \na rescue with emergency medical services at a structural collapse of a \nbuilding with 50 occupants. Nearly half of all fire departments \nconsider such an incident beyond their scope.\n  Using local personnel, only 13 percent of fire departments can handle \na hazardous material incident involving chemical and/or biological \nagents with 10 injuries. Only 21 percent have a written agreement to \ndirect the use of non-local resources to handle the situation.\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\n  An estimated 40 percent of fire department personnel involved in \nhazardous material response lack formal training in those duties, most \nof them serving smaller communities.\n  Finally, an estimated 60 to 75 percent of fire departments do not \nhave enough fire stations to achieve widely used response time \nguidelines. Many fire departments often fail to respond to fires with \nsufficient personnel to safely initiate an interior attack on a \nstructural fire.\n  These statistics are startling. The risks that firefighters are \nexpected to respond to have far outgrown the ability of city \ngovernments to equip firefighters to do what we are asking them to do. \nThis situation demands immediate action by the Senate to address these \nconcerns.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration is talking out of both sides \nof its mouth when it comes to helping firefighters. Secretary Ridge of \nthe Department of Homeland Security talks about training and equipping \nfirst responders yet the President's Budget and the Senate budget \nresolution cuts the FIRE Act grant program by $250 million. This \namendment will restore these funds to their authorized level of $900 \nmillion for fiscal year 2005.\n  Mr. President, the FIRE Act grant program has been one of the most \nsuccessful initiatives in recent years. I am currently working closely \nwith Senator DeWine to reauthorize this program for the future. The \nneed is certainly out there in all regions of the country urban and \nrural, large cities and small communities, North and South, East and \nWest--for these competitive, merit-based grants that assist fire \ndepartments with their heaviest burdens. For Fiscal Year 2003, the \nprogram received approximately 19,950 applications from fire \ndepartments across the nation, totaling $2.5 billion in grant requests, \nwhile only $750 million in federal funding was available for such \ngrants.\n  A January 31, 2003 report by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found \nthat 99 percent of program participants were satisfied with the \nprogram's ability to meet the needs of their department. In addition, \n97 percent of the participants reported that the program had ``a \npositive impact on their ability to handle fire and fire-related \nincidents.'' The report concluded that ``overall, the results of our \nsurvey and our analysis reflect that the Assistance to Firefighters \nGrant program was highly effective in improving the readiness and \ncapabilities of firefighters across the nation.'' The FIRE Act grant \nprogram is truly a success story, and it deserves the Senate's full \nsupport.\n  It is surprising to me then that President Bush and the Senate budget \nresolution would slash $250 million from this very successful program. \nIt is also surprising to me that President Bush would show images of \nfirefighters in a campaign advertisement when his budget, as well as \nthe Senate budget resolution, provides not one cent for the SAFER Act, \nwhich would fund 75,000 new firefighters over the next seven years. It \nmakes no sense.\n  The need for additional firefighters on our Nation's streets is \ngreat. According to National Fire Protection Association standards, a \nminimum of four firefighters is required to initiate an interior attack \non a house fire. And 73 percent of departments serving populations \nbetween 10,000 and 25,000 lack such personnel.\n  For fire departments serving populations between 25,000 and 50,000, \nthe number climbs to 82 percent.\n  For fire departments serving populations between 50,000 and 100,000, \n76 percent lack the minimum of four firefighters.\n  And 56 percent of fire departments protecting 100,000 and 250,000 \npeople also do not have the necessary four firefighters.\n  Then it is 41 percent for departments serving 250,000 and 500,000 \npeople, 40 percent for departments protecting populations between \n500,000 and one million people, and 0 percent for departments \nprotecting at least one million people.\n  Just as the FIRE Act provides the equipment and training resources \nfor firefighters to do their job, the SAFER Act complements it by also \nproviding the human resources to meet the challenge of an extended war \nagainst terrorism. Since 1970, the number of firefighters as a \npercentage of the nation's workforce has steadily declined. Today in \nthe United States there is one firefighter for every 280 citizens. We \nhave fewer firefighters per capita than nurses and police officers.\n  We need to turn the trend around now more than ever. Understaffing is \ndangerous for the public and for firefighters. Chronic understaffing \nmeans that many firefighters do not have the backup and on-the-ground \nsupport they need to do their jobs safely. The sad consequence is that \nabout every three days we lose a firefighter in the line of duty. On \nsome days, the losses are unimaginably high. Firefighters need \nreinforcements, and the Congress should be prepared to give them all \nthe help they need. This amendment therefore provides funding for the \nSAFER Act at its FY2005 authorized level of $1.03 billion.\n  In closing, it is important to recall the important role that \nfirefighters have played in American history since its earliest days. \nIn fact, firefighting can be linked to some of our Nation's most \nillustrious personages. Benjamin Franklin established the first \nvolunteer fire department in Philadelphia in 1735. George Washington \nhimself was a volunteer firefighter across the Potomac River in \nAlexandria, Virginia, and he imported the first fire engine from \nEngland in 1765.\n  Of course, on September 11, 2001, 343 members of the New York Fire \nDepartment made the ultimate sacrifice in their efforts to save \nthousands of lives trapped in the World Trade Center. The role played \nby those firefighters who lived and died in the line of duty on that \ntragic day made the Nation proud.\n  On that day and on every other day, they are the first ones in and \nthe last ones out. They risk their own lives to save the lives of \nothers. They stare danger in the face because they know that they have \na duty to fulfill.\n  The Congress has a duty to the fire service as well. We must ensure \nthat there is full funding for the FIRE Act and the SAFER Act, so I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to point out that the examples \nthe chairman of the committee used for the supposed waste of money, \nother than one, did not involve firefighters. You can drag all these \ncats and dogs in from anywhere you want. The only firefighter example \nthat was used was a purchase of a firefighting boat. On the face of it, \nthat may well have been a good expenditure.\n  In any event, these are competitive grants and the judgment on who \ngets the grants and for what purpose is made by the administration. To \nthe extent you can site something, the ultimate responsibility for it \ncomes back on the administration.\n  Furthermore--will the Senator give me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maryland off the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Furthermore, the Senator says if we are going to get \nthis money, $2.8 billion, you would have to--then he mentions all kinds \nof possibilities on the tax side. Obviously, we can't direct specific \ninstructions to the tax committee, but we can point out what the \nopportunities are. The top 1 percent is getting that billion-dollar tax \ncredit. The cost of the Bush tax cut for those making over $337,000 in \n2005--the top 1 percent, over a $337,000 income--$45 billion.\n  We are suggesting very simply that a small portion of that be shifted \nin order to help address the challenges that confront our firefighters.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will speak on time off the resolution.\n  My colleague keeps coming back saying we want to sock it to the \nwealthy. You don't do that in a budget resolution. You tell the \ncommittee to raise more taxes. I will tell you that all we are assuming \nthe committee is going to do is extend present law. This would make it \nso you can't do that. That means low-income people are going to see a \ntax increase, if we don't extend present law. That is what we are \nassuming we are going to do.\n  I know my colleagues would like to raise the 35-percent rate. That is \nwhat corporations pay. A lot of us really do not think individuals will \npay more\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\nthan Exxon. How about a little fairness?\n  I tell my colleagues that this idea of tax and spend, we are always \ngoing to tax that person behind the tree, it is going to be that \nmultimillionaire, that is not the way the Budget Committee works and \nthat is not the way the Finance Committee works.\n  We have defeated these amendments. I hope we will continue to defeat \nthe amendments that sock it to them by raising taxes and increasing \nspending.\n  I hope our colleagues will realize it is not going anywhere, and then \nmaybe we can eliminate a lot of these amendments so we can get some \nbusiness done.\n  I am trying to cooperate with my colleague from North Dakota. But we \nare making very little progress. I know there are a lot of amendments. \nI am trying to be fair to all colleagues if they wish to debate their \namendments. But this idea of spending 3 hours on 2 amendments is not \nvery productive. I hope we will be more successful in moving a little \nmore quickly through amendments, especially ones that are so close to \nbeing repetitive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use \noff the resolution.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the Senator from \nMaryland. The amendment of the Senator from Maryland does two things: \nIt restores the cuts to firefighters that have been made in this \nbudget, and it reduces the deficit. It reduces the deficit. We have \nrecord deficits. The amendment of the Senator from Maryland is a \ntwofer. He restores the cuts to firefighters, the first responders. We \nknow from the disaster of September 11 that one of the biggest failings \nwas our first responders, including our firefighters, who could not \ncommunicate with each other. They had units from different \njurisdictions and they couldn't communicate. That has to be fixed. That \ncosts money.\n  The Senator from Maryland has offered an amendment to restore the \ncuts to firefighters. That makes sense.\n  Second, he reduces the deficit. To pay for it, he takes a tiny \nfraction of the tax cut going to the wealthiest 1 percent in this \ncountry, those earning over $337,000 a year. The total cost of the tax \ncuts for that group in 2005 is $45 billion. The Senator from Maryland \nreduces the deficit and restores the cuts to firefighters by using 1.6 \npercent of that money over four years.\n  This amendment is a serious amendment and it deserves support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized to \noffer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2793\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr.President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2793.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for COPS, Byrne grants, and Local Law \n     Enforcement Block Grants, and reduce the debt by reducing the \n   President's tax breaks for taxpayers with incomes in excess of $1 \n                            million a year)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $344,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $632,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $510,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $610,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $104,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $344,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $632,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $510,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $610,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $104,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $344,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $632,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $510,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $610,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $104,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $344,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $976,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $1,486,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $2,096,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $2,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $344,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $976,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $1,486,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $2,096,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,200,000,000.\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE FUND FOR COPS AND OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT \n                   GRANT PROGRAMS.\n\n        The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations \n     to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, \n     discretionary spending limits, and other appropriate levels \n     and limits in this resolution by up to $1,100,000,000 in \n     budget authority for fiscal year 2005, and by the amount of \n     outlays flowing therefrom in 2005 and subsequent years, for a \n     bill, amendment, motion, or conference report that provides \n     additional fiscal year 2005 discretionary appropriations, in \n     excess of the levels provided in this resolution for the \n     Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program, the \n     Edward Byrne formula grant program, and the Local Law \n     Enforcement Block Grant program at the Department of Justice.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have agreed to a rather short time limit \nfor a debate on my amendment. I know we are facing a lot of votes in \nthe later hours of today and perhaps even tomorrow. So I have agreed to \n10 minutes on each side.\n  This budget that is brought to the Senate deals with choices. We make \nchoices. I have great respect for people who have a differing view than \nmine on the choices of where to spend money and where to save money. \nThey have every right to share views. I respect their views. There are \ntimes with respect to this budget document where we disagree. This is \none of them.\n  My amendment deals with law enforcement. The budget that is before \nthe Senate, consistent with the Administration's wishes, proposes to \ncut $1.6 billion of proven, critically important domestic law \nenforcement programs; then it would restore about $500 million in \nfunding, leaving the budget $1.1 billion short for law enforcement \nprograms. This includes the COPS Program. We know that works, but it \nwould be eviscerated by this budget. The Byrne grant program, that is \nthe most important program to help local law enforcement agencies \naround this country, would be eliminated. The local law enforcement \nblock grant program would be eliminated. We will be $1.1 billion short \nfor these critical law enforcement needs.\n  My amendment restores that money, and, in addition, reduces the \nFederal budget deficit by $1 billion. We simply restrict, just \nrestrict, a very small amount of the tax cut that goes to the folks in \nthis country earning more than $1 million a year.\n  This is just a choice that we have to make, one that says a lot about \nour priorities.\n  Last month I held a meeting in North Dakota, as I have on previous \noccasions. I had county sheriffs, the highway patrol, local police \nofficers there. We were talking about the scourge of methamphetamine. \nWhat a devastating scourge to this country. Methamphetamine is \ndestroying lives. Anyone can buy the ingredients for methamphetamine at \nthe local stores. Then you can cook it up in a trunk or abandoned \nfarmhouse. It is literally like a prairie fire out in rural America. It \nis an enormous challenge to local law enforcement officers. The \nequipment, the communications opportunities, the manpower, needed to \nfight this new meth scourge is very substantial. This is the wrong time \nto be cutting the law enforcement assistance to the states that we have \ngiven previously. So I suggest we restore this money and provide the \nfunding from the tax cut that has been given to those earning over $1 \nmillion a year.\n  This choice that we have to make is also about terrorism. We talk a \nlot about the terrorist threat in this country. The first responders to \nthe next terrorist attack will not come out of the Centers for Disease \nControl or the\n\n[[Page S2612]]\n\nFBI or the Secret Service. The first responders are going to be the \nlocal police officers on the scene, the firefighters on the scene. The \nquestion is, Do they have the training? Do they have the equipment? Do \nthey have the capability, the manpower to deal with these issues? The \nEdward Byrne grants and the COPS Programs and the Local Law Enforcement \nBlock Grants go a long way in making sure that our first responders are \nready.\n  Now we discover the priority of the majority and also the \nadministration is to cut that funding. That is, in my judgment, a very \nsignificant mistake.\n  You know, I was here months ago leading the fight to try to stop \nsending $20 billion of the taxpayers' money to reconstruct Iraq. Why \ndid I feel that way? Because Iraq has the money to reconstruct itself. \nThe Iraqi people can pump Iraqi oil and reconstruct Iraq. The American \ntaxpayer does not need to spend $20 billion for that.\n  I lost that vote. This money is on its way to Iraq. And we have all \nthese law enforcement programs now in Iraq. So the American taxpayer is \ngoing to pay for law enforcement programs for Iraq, which Iraqis could \npay for themselves, and we will cut law enforcement programs in this \ncountry. What kind of priority is that?\n  There are some who take a look at those in politics and say: America \nfirst; that is pretty selfish.\n  It is not selfish, in my judgment, to ensure that we protect the \nAmerican public, that we head off future terrorist threats, that we \nsupport local law enforcement and respond to the scourge of \nmethamphetamine and other issues. If we do not have the funds for that \nbut we have the funds to invest in local law enforcement in Iraq, which \nthe Iraqis could have paid for themselves, there is something wrong \nwith our priorities. Our priorities need to be changed.\n\n  I have talked about the three programs that the budget would cut. The \nproposal is to cut a substantial amount of money from the COPS Program, \n$698 million, $696 million from the Edward Byrne grant program, and \n$224 million from the local law enforcement block grant. After cutting \n$1.6 billion, they create a new program of $500 million, roughly, so \nyou are about $1.1 billion short.\n  Maybe those who say, let's do this, maybe they really think that tax \ncuts for people who make over $1 million are more important than the \nByrne grant. But if you just held meetings with law enforcement \nofficials in your State and understand what they face, the challenge \nthey face every single day, you understand that is a bad choice to be \ncutting these programs.\n  I recall that days after the devastating attack on September 11, I \nwent to Ground Zero with my colleagues. I recall looking into the eyes \nof the law enforcement officers and the firefighters who lost brothers \nand sisters, who were moving up those buildings as the buildings were \ncoming down. They were not punching a timecard. They were not asking \nwhether they were being paid overtime. They were not talking about \nanything other than their job. They ran right into the face of danger. \nMany of them lost their lives trying to save people. That is what law \nenforcement does in this country. This country takes them for granted \nevery day and every night. We go to bed at night feeling safe because \nlaw enforcement is on our streets. This country takes it for granted. \nWe ought to say thank-you to the men and women who wear the badge and \nkeep the peace and keep our streets safe.\n  It is the wrong way to cut the Byrne grant program, the COPS Program, \nand the things that are essential and are needed by local law \nenforcement, and to do that in order to preserve a tax cut for those \nwho make over $1 million a year. It is a bad choice for the country. \nAnd, in my judgment, it is a bad political choice for those who have \ndone it, as well.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will make a couple of comments and \nmaybe Senator Gregg may want to speak. He is more knowledgeable about \nthis program than I am.\n  What is very clear to me to see is that this amendment is another one \nof these amendments on which we had the pleasure of voting. This will \nincrease spending, yes, and it will also increase taxes. We have had \nthat debate several times. I guess we will have it several more times. \nI am happy to debate it.\n  Some think individuals should pay more than corporations. I don't. I \nthink that is bad tax policy. I think the power to tax is the power to \ndestroy. If you have to work more than half the time for the \nGovernment, then you lose your personal freedom.\n  Looking at the COPS Program, I remember the objective of the COPS \nProgram was to have 100,000 new cops on the street. According to the \nfigures I was just handed, we have 118,000 as a result of the COPS \nProgram, a program that started with an enormous Federal subsidy, I \nbelieve. I have to refresh my memory, but I believe the Federal \nGovernment pays 75 percent of the costs of the first year and then \nsomething like 50 percent the next year and maybe 25 percent the third \nyear. Then it is on the community.\n  In other words, local police are supposed to be paid by local \ncommunities. But we said we would give them an additional incentive to \nhire additional police officers basically by a big subsidy, but that \nsubsidy would curtail and it would be the responsibility of the \ncommunity, certainly entirely by the fourth year.\n  Some want to keep it forever. As Will Rogers once said: All Federal \nprograms have something in common: a beginning, a middle, and no \nending.\n  We accomplished the objective, I guess, but yet some people want to \ncontinue it. I have no doubt there are lots of cities that would say, \nHey, we would love for you to pay three-fourths of the cost of a new \npolice officer, because they have people retiring, they have people \nleaving, and so on. So, yes, we would love to have the Federal \nGovernment come in and pay three-fourths of it.\n  I question, How long are we supposed to do that? I do not think that \nis really the Federal Government's responsibility. Maybe it was a \nlittle easier to do when we had enormous surpluses. We do not have \nthose surpluses today. And this really is not the Federal Government's \nresponsibility to be putting police officers in every city.\n  I know we had a city in Oklahoma--I am trying to remember the name of \nthe city--that had no police officers. Yet when the COPS Program came \nin, they thought: We need to have a police officer. We are going to \nhave the Federal Government pay three-fourths of the cost of our police \nofficer for the first year. Oh, we have to get him a car--and on and \non. It was almost comical because they never had a police officer in \nthis town. It probably had a population of 65 or something.\n  But my point is, we have significant increases for the Department of \nJustice. We have significant increases to help the FBI, to help law \nenforcement. I do not think this is that high of a priority for us to \ntry to be subsidizing police departments all across the country. Nor do \nI think it is good economics to say, oh, well, we are going to have the \nupper whatever percent. Everybody knows. I guess I will repeat this \nevery time. All this amendment does is raise taxes. And all we have on \nthe assumption in the budget resolution is that middle-income taxpayers \nare going to get to keep present law. Now, if that goes away because of \na tax increase, the middle-income taxpayers better look out because \ntheir taxes are going up by this multitude of amendments.\n  Incidentally, if it makes any difference, we are counting how many \ntax-and-spend amendments are being offered. And we assume it is going \nto be the millionaires. That is not the way it works. You tell the \nFinance Committee: raise more money, and the Finance Committee is going \nto raise taxes. And you know with this President we are not going to be \nraising marginal rates. The marginal top rate is 35 percent. When Bill \nClinton was elected, it was 31 percent. He took it up to 39.6 percent. \nIt took us this long to get it at 35 percent.\n  Who benefits from that? Entrepreneurs, people who are growing, \nbuilding, and expanding their businesses. When they expand, they create \njobs. Let's not stifle economic growth by some of these ridiculous \nexpansions to try to grow Government.\n  I think these amendments are getting a little redundant, maybe a \nlittle bit repetitive. If our colleagues want to finish, I do not know \nwhy we have to have so many of them.\n\n[[Page S2613]]\n\n  But I urge our colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself time off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I heard my colleague, the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, say that this would increase taxes on those who earn \nover $1 million a year. The cost of the tax cuts, in 2005, to those \nearning over $1 million a year, is $27 billion.\n  I point out to my colleague that when it is a question of job \ncreation, it is an interesting fact. It is true that during the Clinton \nadministration the top marginal rate was increased from 31 percent to \n39.6 percent. And guess what happened to economic activity and job \ncreation. We had 22 million jobs created in this country with the 39.6-\npercent rate. Now we are down to 35 percent, and under this President 3 \nmillion jobs have been lost.\n  If we go back to the Clinton years, the fact is, he put increased \nrevenue into place, cut spending; and we went from 22.6 percent of GDP \ndown to 19 percent of GDP on spending, and raised revenue, because \nPresident Clinton inherited from the previous President Bush the same \nmess this President Bush is creating: record budget deficits. The \nprevious record, before this President, was in his father's \nadministration.\n  When President Clinton came in, he faced a $290 billion budget \ndeficit. He put in place a 5-year plan that cut spending, raised \nrevenue, balanced the budget, stopped the raid on Social Security. And \nguess what. We had 22 million jobs created, with the longest economic \nexpansion in the Nation's history, the lowest unemployment in 30 years, \nand the lowest inflation in 30 years.\n  Now we have this alternative plan, which is to run the biggest \ndeficits in history, run up the debt, and lose 3 million jobs. I would \ntake the Clinton economic years over the economic years of this \nadministration.\n  I want to say, my office was visited this week by State and local \nofficials from back home. They told us the proposed levels in the \nRepublican budget resolution for law enforcement and for the COPS \nProgram is going to do serious damage to law enforcement in our State. \nThat was the message they delivered.\n  The President's budget cuts the COPS Program 94 percent. It is the \nCOPS Program that has put 100,000 police officers on the streets of \nAmerica, including several hundred in my home State. Why we would cut \nthe COPS Program when we face a terrorist threat eludes me.\n  I think the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota deserves our \nsupport.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, last year right about this time I stood in \nthe Senate chamber questioning why an administration that talks so much \nabout the importance of homeland security and first responders would \nsubmit a budget that so drastically shortchanges their needs. I find \nmyself 1 year later still asking the same questions but hearing no good \nanswers.\n  Specifically as it pertains to community policing and other law \nenforcement programs, this budget shortchanges smaller communities and \ngrossly under funds programs that have put more police officers on the \nstreet, reduced crime in rural areas, curbed drug abuse and put at-risk \nyouth back on the right track.\n  Instead of strengthening these programs--programs that we know work--\nwe are pulling the rug right out from under our communities' feet. \nUnder the budget proposal, the COPS program would see a reduction from \n$756 million to $44 million--a staggering 94 percent cut.\n  Let me be clear: Taking away COPS funding will mean less police \nofficers on our streets; it will mean less resource officers in our \nschools preventing violence and drug abuse; It will also mean longer \nresponse times and higher crime rates. This is tradeoff we should never \neven consider, yet alone go through with.\n  Since 1994, my State received $88.4 million in COPS grants, which has \nfunded 1,289 additional police officers and sheriff deputies, 112 \nschool resource officers and more than $11 million in crime-fighting \ntechnologies. Arkansas is not alone; I ask if there is a Senator among \nus that would contest that their State has benefited from the COPS \nprogram.\n  We can't be serious about law enforcement by paring this successful \nprogram to $44 million. Texas alone received nearly $30 million from \nthe COPS program last year. How are we going to fund the entire \ncountry's COPS needs using the budget of what just one State received \nlast year?\n  When I was the Attorney General of my State, I worked closely with \nlaw enforcement to make Arkansas a safer place to live and raise a \nfamily. One thing I know for sure, these police officers operate under \ntight budgets with smaller staffs than most of their urban \ncounterparts. Nevertheless, they put their lives on the line every day \nand we need to make sure they have adequate resources to do their jobs \nproperly.\n  I recently talked with several Arkansas police chiefs about the \nproposed cuts to the COPS program. They told me how important this \nprogram was in their continuing battle to stop the production of \nmethamphetamine throughout Arkansas.\n  Chief James Allen of the Bentonville Police department said the COPS \nprogram has been the biggest single factor in helping his region fight \nthe environmental and social problems created by methamphetamine use.\n  Last year alone, Arkansas police shut down 1,208 meth labs, but more \nare popping up each day.\n  Methamphetamine spreads so easily because it is cheap and easy to \nproduce. It is also extremely addictive and it is tearing rural \ncommunities apart. Law enforcement officials have told me that if \nCongress reduces COPS funding by 94 percent, we would effectively \ndecimate their ability to battle this deadly drug.\n  These law enforcement officers are making a huge difference in our \ncommunities and on top of that, they play the integral part in our \nhomeland defense as first responders.\n  COPS grants have played a critical role in providing additional \nmanpower, technology and training--all of which are necessary to \nenhance community security and contribute to the overall goal of \nnational domestic preparedness. The Chief of Police in Pine Bluff, AR \nDaniel Moses characterized his Homeland Security Overtime grant as a \ngodsend.\n  September 11 made us acutely aware of the need of genuine \npartnerships that involve all segments of our communities and all \nlevels of government--we all have a role in keeping our community safe.\n  Our local law enforcement must be able to respond to whatever may \nconfront them in the future, but how can they properly respond, when \nthey are given a budget that cuts deep into their existence?\n  I would also like to note that in my State, a number of police \nofficers on the front lines of crime prevention are also fighting on \nthe front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are pulling double duty \nfor our country in the Reserves and National Guard. But at the same \ntime, their absence has spread our police forces even thinner.\n  We need to build on what we know works. These law enforcement \nprograms work. But don't take my word for it. Take the word of Attorney \nGeneral John Ashcroft who said not two years ago:\n\n       Since law enforcement agencies began partnering with \n     citizens through community policing we've seen significant \n     drops in crime rates.\n\n  Mr. President, our communities, the people we represent have truly \nbenefited from these programs and taking away its funding would be a \nmajor step backwards in our efforts to fight crime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I forgot to mention at the start that \nSenator Daschle joins me as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. President, it has been suggested that my amendment amounts to a \ntax increase. That is just nonsense. The question before us is this: \nnext year, shall we give a $26 billion tax cut to those who receive $1 \nmillion or more in income and at the same time restore the funding for \nlaw enforcement officials around the country--funding we know works to \nfight crime? Or shall we instead cut funding for law enforcement \nofficials so we can give a $27 billion tax cut to those whose income is \nover $1 million a year?\n\n[[Page S2614]]\n\n  This is not about tax increases. I am sorry. My friend from Oklahoma, \nI am sure, is familiar with Will Rogers, because Will Rogers is from \nOklahoma. What a wonderful man. Will Rogers once said: When there's no \nplace left to spit, you either swallow your tobacco juice or you change \nwith the times.\n  Well, there is no place left to spit with respect to these choices. \nDo you want to cut local law enforcement funding, the Byrne Grant that \nhelps those folks out there today who are keeping this country safe, \nwho are chasing those people who are producing methamphetamine and \naddicting our children? Do you want to invest in law enforcement? Do \nyou want to chase the criminals? Do you want to apprehend them and get \nthem? Or do you want to decide we cannot afford to do that? Let's cut \nback on law enforcement efforts so those who make $1 million a year can \nget an extra $1 billion--from $26 billion to $27 billion--next year in \ntax cuts.\n  One hundred years from now, we will all be dead--everybody in this \nChamber is likely to be dead--and the only thing they will know about \nus is to look at this budget. And they will say: Here were their \nvalues. Here is what they held dear. Here is what they felt was \nimportant for this country.\n  Someone once asked: If you didn't know someone, never met someone, \nand had to write their obituary, and you only had their check register \nwith which to write an obituary, what would you say about them? You \nwould be able to tell something about their value system. The same is \ntrue with the Government. The same is true with choices made in this \nbudget. What is our value system? What do we hold most dear? What do we \nthink makes our country strong?\n  The question for us is, Will this Congress stand up for the men and \nwomen who wear the uniform on the street who keep this country safe?\n  We talk a lot about national security and the threat of terrorism. \nOnce again, let me say, the first responder, in the event of a \nterrorist attack, is going to be a man or woman out there in the local \nsheriff's office, the local police force, the highway patrol. They \nbenefit and their programs benefit from these grant programs that are \nbeing proposed to be cut now by $1 billion. I propose to restore it \nbecause I think it is the right choice for this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could the Chair update us in terms of the \ntime status on the Dorgan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for Senator Dorgan has expired. \nSenator Nickles has 5 minutes 9 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't know if the chairman seeks to use time now on \nthat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be very brief. I was looking at some additional \ninformation about the COPS Program. The grant programs administered \nthrough the COPS Program were 100 percent earmarked in 2004 \nappropriations bills. The administration feels the earmarking has \ngotten out of hand and seeks to eliminate funding in favor of a new \ngrant program located in another account. This new account consolidates \nalmost all State and local law enforcement grant programs and \nactivities. Rather than have the programs spread out over a half dozen \naccounts, it assumes consolidation in one account called justice \nassistance. A lot of the old COPS Program is included in the new \nJustice Assistance Program. Maybe it won't be quite so directed by \nCongress. Maybe it will be more appropriate.\n  I don't know if it is the Federal Government's responsibility to hire \nhundreds more police officers in North Dakota or Oklahoma. I happen to \nbe one who says: We all have to do our fair share. I just don't know \nthat it is the Federal Government's responsibility to be putting police \nofficers in every little town in America.\n  We have accomplished our objective in hiring and training 118,000 \npolice officers. We should say a job well done and not continue this \nprogram forever.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I ask for one minute off the resolution?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield an additional minute off the resolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me say my colleague from Oklahoma talked about the \nCOPS Program--which, incidentally, has been a remarkable program. It \nhas worked very well to reduce crime. He did not mention, for example, \nthe Byrne grant program which today is aiding law enforcement in \ntracking drug dealers, dealing with this methamphetamine scourge.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma described a new grant program that the \nAdministration is proposing, but this new grant program my colleague \ndescribed is going to cut funding for local law enforcement officials \nby $1.1 billion. That is why I felt constrained to come and offer the \namendment.\n  It is about choices. If one feels the assistance we have given local \nlaw enforcement through the Byrne grant program and other programs has \nnot been effective, then one would want to oppose this amendment. But \nif you meet with our law enforcement officers at the state and local \nlevel, they will tell you to a person how incredibly effective these \nprograms have been in bringing them up to speed with training and \nequipment and helping them pursue drug dealers and reduce crime on the \nstreets. If one believes that is important, then one must vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe we have an agreement to next \nconsider an amendment by our colleague and friend from New Jersey, \nSenator Lautenberg. We are almost ready to enter into a time \nlimitation, but I need to consult with the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Inhofe. At this point we will not, but I understand there has \nbeen a general agreement for 20 minutes equally divided or 20 minutes a \nside. Is the Senator from New Jersey willing to have a time agreement? \nI cannot enter into it at this moment, but is he looking for 20 minutes \neach or 20 minutes a side?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. We would like to \nhave 20 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I won't make the request now. I am \ntelling our colleagues, the Senator from North Dakota has about 5 \nhours, maybe a little less now.\n  I ask the Chair, how many hours remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hours remaining are 1 hour 50 minutes for \nthe majority; 4 hours 46 minutes for the minority.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am trying to be fair to everybody, but \nif colleagues keep coming down and taking 40 minutes or an hour on \ntheir amendments, that means a lot of people are going to get zero \ndebate on their amendments. I don't want them to be mad at me, nor do I \nwant them to be mad at my colleague from North Dakota. People will have \nto be restrained in their request or else people later in the queue \nwill have very little debate time. I will leave it at that. I cannot \nenter into a time agreement. I will be happy to talk to Senator Inhofe. \nHe may be more than happy to do that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I think it is important to note at this \ntime the situation we face. It is important for our colleagues to \nunderstand. Senator Nickles could yield back all the rest of his time. \nI would then have 4 hours 46 minutes left. But he would have a right to \nhalf of that time. So it is important for colleagues to understand, \nwhen we say there are 4 hours 46 minutes left on our side, no, there \nreally are not in a functional way. The chairman would verify that.\n  I understand he is unable to enter into a time agreement at this \nmoment on this amendment because he has to communicate with the \ncommittee chairman, but I am saying to other colleagues who are \nlistening, please understand, we are rapidly approaching the time when \nwe have far more requests for time than we have time. The dislocation \nthat occurs here is people hear I have 4 hours 46 minutes left. All the \nchairman has to do is give back his remaining hour 50 minutes, and then \nhe has rights to half of my time. So instead of 4 hours 46 minutes, I \nwould then have 2 hours 23 minutes. I now have pending requests for 4 \nhours of time. It doesn't fit together.\n  We have to ask restraint on the part of our colleagues. I understand \nwe can't enter into a time agreement on this amendment. Senator \nLautenberg\n\n[[Page S2615]]\n\nhas been very gracious in saying he will live with whatever time \nagreement we can produce. Perhaps the best we can do now is to have \nSenator Lautenberg proceed and at the earliest possible convenience of \nthe chairman, if we can enter into a time agreement on this one and \nsubsequent amendments that are pending, I think we could make real \nprogress.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I concur with everything my colleague and \nfriend Senator Conrad said. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment and take up the Lautenberg amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to offer an amendment for myself, Senator Boxer, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Corzine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold for one moment? I would ask the \nSenator not to send his amendment up. I want to make sure we don't do \nthat. I listened to what the chairman said. I will yield to the Senator \ntime off the resolution. I yield the Senator 20 minutes off the \nresolution and ask he not send the amendment to the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for up to 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota \nfor the generous offer he has made to let me have time to describe this \nvery important amendment.\n  As I said, I will offer this amendment for myself and Senators Boxer, \nJeffords, and Corzine. Other cosponsors include Senators Lieberman, \nBiden, Durbin, Clinton, Leahy, Cantwell, Feingold, and Kennedy.\n  My amendment would readjust the budget resolution so we can \nreauthorize the Superfund corporate fee. There are many reasons why \nthis is an urgent matter and the right thing to do.\n  When Congress created Superfund, the operating principle was the \npolluter should pay.\n  I ask that the Chair remind me when 10 minutes of my time have been \nused, please.\n  The Superfund program was created because of a number of blighted \ntoxic sites that were located in cities and towns across the country, \nplaces in Montana and Nebraska and Maine and New Jersey. New Jersey had \nover 100 sites listed on the Superfund list. Today 900 sites have been \ncleaned up, turned over to practical use in these communities where \noften land is precious. To be able to get space that was occupied by \nnothing but toxic materials can create quite a difference in the health \nand the well-being of a community.\n  We started off by saying the people who polluted the area should pay \nfor its cleanup. It was reviewed in the courts and it was challenged \nand debated all over the place. The fact is, it worked. In 1980, \nSuperfund was authorized. In 1986, we reauthorized the collection of \ncorporate fees paid by polluters that would be placed in the Superfund \ntrust fund to pay for the cleanup of these so-called orphan or \nabandoned sites. These are the sites for which an actual polluter can \nbe found. That way, all the taxpayers would not be stuck with the bill \nfor a mess caused by corporate polluters.\n  Editorials and polls nationwide repeatedly showed that Americans want \nthe polluting corporations, not the taxpayers, to pay for the cleanup \nof properties contaminated with dangerous chemicals. In a March 9 \neditorial, this week, the Philadelphia Inquirer said:\n\n       The Senate should put the burden back where it belongs: on \n     polluters.\n\n  Unfortunately, now the trust fund is flat broke and our citizens are \nfeeling the impact. They are discouraged by the fact these toxic sites \nare going to continue to be in the middle of their communities and \nunusable for any productive purpose. Some sites, which should be \ncleaned up in 3 or 4 years, are instead now taking 9 or 10 years \nbecause the funding isn't there. That means youngsters living next to a \ntoxic wastesite could be graduated from high school by the time the \nsite is decontaminated. There are children and families in America \nliving around the corner from toxic dump sites all over the place. It \nis inexcusable.\n  As my colleagues know, such exposure to toxic chemicals cannot be \nundone. EPA scientists report that small children are 10 times more \nlikely than adults to develop cancer when exposed to chemicals. Our \nchildren are the most vulnerable among us. They are especially \nsusceptible to dioxin, arsenic, DDT, and brain-damaging heavy metals \nsuch as lead and mercury, which are often found in the soil and ground \nwater at these Superfund sites. Across the country, each site we clean \nup--and so far, we successfully cleaned up more than 900 sites--reduces \nthe health risks to our children and families. Parents don't want to \nraise their kids under the shadow of a toxic waste site, only to worry \nabout the high risk for cancer, birth defects, and other diseases.\n  The Superfund Program needs additional revenues now. Just as our \nmounting debt is slowing the economy, our failure to adequately fund \nSuperfund is slowing toxic cleanups to a crawl. The administration \nclaims that it supports the ``polluter-pays'' principle and \n``aggressively'' cleans up Superfund sites, but the facts speak \notherwise.\n  This year taxpayers will be asked to bear virtually the entire cost \nof cleaning up abandoned Superfund sites. In the President's fiscal \nyear 2005 budget, the Superfund trust fund column shows a zero--the \ntank is empty. As we look at the timeframe, we can see from 1996, when \nwe had over $3 billion available in the Superfund treasury, almost $4 \nbillion, now, because we have not replenished it, we have used it, \nslowed the process of cleanups, finally in 2003 the fund is down to \nzero.\n  If the people in the communities want those sites cleaned up, they \nare going to have to pay for it. All the taxpayers will have to pay. \nSuperfund is not even a fund anymore. There is nothing in it.\n  It is shameful what the President and this Congress have done to the \nSuperfund. They have emptied it and told polluters: Don't worry, we \nwill make everyone else pay for the mess our friendly contributors and \npolitical allies created. In 1986, taxpayers paid only a small portion, \n8 percent, of orphan site cleanups. In 1995, only 17 percent of these \ncosts came from general revenues. Today, the number is almost 100 \npercent. All taxpayers have taken on the burden of paying for what \npolluters should be paying.\n\n  The GAO recently reported that funding for the Superfund Program has \nfallen by 35 percent in the last decade. It was underfunded by at least \n$175 million in 2003. What does that say? It says that whatever work is \nnot going on, because it is underfunded, the taxpayers are going to pay \nfor it.\n  It is outrageous to suggest that the taxpayers ought to pay for the \nmisdeeds of the corporations that polluted the area. If they pollute \nit, they ought to clean it up and pay for it. What we are talking about \nis a fee that spreads across business lines, where chemicals are \nmanufactured, and oil and gasoline products are handled.\n  Yet one of four Americans, and 10 million children, still live within \n4 miles of a Superfund site. That statistic does not include the 40,000 \nhazardous waste sites which have not made it onto the Nation's priority \nlist. The National Priorities List has something like 1,300 listings. \nThese are the especially toxic and dangerous sites--large sites \ntypically.\n  Fewer sites are being listed, and many of those listed are not \nreceiving sufficient funding. One Superfund manager in my State of New \nJersey said this: EPA is strangling the program.\n  Here are the facts: The rate of site cleanup has fallen by 50 percent \nunder this administration. In other words, they allowed, deliberately, \nthese sites to rot where they are and that threatens the people who \nlive in the nearby vicinities.\n  The listing of new sites on the National Priorities List has fallen \nby 23 percent. There is no action there. We cannot pay our bills. A lot \nof the people who are with the EPA doing that kind of work have seen \nthe end of their jobs in sight and they don't want to stay there. They \nwant to look to see what else is a prospect for them and their family.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. I say to my colleague, since I am \non the floor, I will allot myself another\n\n[[Page S2616]]\n\n3 or 4 minutes before I turn the microphone over to the Senator from \nVermont.\n  Even when a site finally makes it onto the NPL, it will take 11 \nyears, on average, to actually decontaminate this site.\n  My State, unfortunately, has the second highest number of Superfund \nsites, second only to California. We have 113 Superfund sites, and more \nsites are waiting to be listed. My amendment would be the first step \ntoward a solution. It would also reduce the budget deficit by $8.3 \nbillion over 5 years. If you spread the cost around, it becomes \ninfinitesimally small. It has been calculated that two-tenths of a cent \non a gallon of gas would be the cost to taxpayers generally. It is a \nsmall, but appropriate, step for us to take for fiscal sanity. \nReinstating the polluter-pays principle is fair. It has a proven track \nrecord.\n\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  This is a very important amendment. Inscribed on a wall in a side \nroom of the Capitol is a wonderful statement of Theodore Roosevelt \nreminding us that:\n\n       The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources \n     as assets which it must turn over to the next generation \n     increased and not impaired in value.\n\n  The Bush administration is ignoring this sage advice and is turning \nback on the Superfund Program. This program has successfully removed \nPCBs, arsenic, lead, and other toxic waste from almost 900 communities. \nYet this administration refuses to reauthorize the expired Superfund \npolluter-pays fees that were supported by President Reagan, the other \nPresident Bush, and President Clinton.\n  As a result, the Superfund trust fund that once contained $3.6 \nbillion is now essentially bankrupt. The taxpayers are forced to pay \nfor the cleanup of abandoned toxic dumps, instead of the waste-\ngenerating chemical and petroleum industries.\n  The impact of the resulting funding shortfall is illustrated by two \nsites in Vermont. The Elizabeth Mine site in Strafford has been denied \nfunds for the second year in a row to clean up acid mine drainage that \nis leaching into the Connecticut River which flows down to several \nStates. The delay has forced EPA to spend millions of dollars in \nemergency funds to stabilize this site, while still failing to pay for \nactual cleanup.\n  Only a few miles away lies another abandoned Superfund site, the Ely \nMine site. It was added to the National Priorities List in 2001, but \nthe Bush administration has yet to fund the investigation to discover \nthe full extent of the contamination, let alone begin cleanup.\n  These examples illustrate how the Bush administration's refusal to \nsupport reauthorization of the polluter-pays fees chokes off funds for \nsites at all stages in the cleanup process.\n  Not surprisingly, the pace of cleanups completed annually during the \nBush administration has plummeted by more than 50 percent. I, \ntherefore, support the effort to reinstate the Superfund fees because \nevery community deserves clean soil and water without delay.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Lautenberg amendment. I thank the \nChair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. How much time remains of the time that was given to \nme?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes forty-five seconds remain.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what we are looking at is a way to \nrelieve the taxpayers of having to come up with $8.3 billion, relieving \npressure on the budget to the extent of the $8.3 billion.\n  We have so many sites in so many places, as I earlier discussed, in \nStates such as Montana, Nebraska, and Maine. Some of these sites are \nhuge. We see the same situation in Utah. I cannot believe that in this \nbody at this time we would not say the communities across the country \nare being burdened by all kinds of discontinued programs, by all kinds \nof reductions in grants that went to the communities. A lot of the \nprograms have been absorbed into grants, single grants, and let the \ncommunities use whatever they can for whatever they choose to but \nalways at a diminished rate. This is a chance to set the record \nstraight and let the public know this administration does not really \ncare about what happens in these communities; that this administration \nwould rather say to their friends, the polluters, many of which are \nlisted on the contributors list for the campaign: Listen, we excuse you \nbig companies from the dirt and the mess you made in these communities; \nwe forgive you, but we will not pay it any other way except through the \ntaxpayers' pockets.\n  This is a chance to set the record straight. I submit that every \nSenator who casts a vote against this amendment is saying to the people \nin his or her State: It is too bad you have those polluted sites. So \nwhat. Our friends, the companies that created this pollution, are \ncloser to us than you, the citizens, the constituents in our States and \nin our country.\n  It is time we face up to the reality. We had a program that was \nexcellent. It began in 1980. I came to the Senate in 1982. I followed \nit very closely and worked very hard on its reauthorization, which took \nplace a couple of times. The program was going well. Cleanups were \nbeing done faster. People felt more secure about their jobs, those who \nworked to effect these cleanups, because they could see something ahead \nof them in terms of their own family security and their own needs.\n  When these people leave, it will be very hard to find the skills and \nthe specialities that are required to continue this work. They will go, \nand I do not blame them for going. I am sure if it came to my own \nfamily and I had to support them through my job in my profession, I \nwould say that is my first obligation. It is not to take care of the \ncleanup of the polluted sites. The President does not care about it. \nOur friends on the other side of the aisle do not care about it. One \nwonders how cynical people have become about voting, about putting \ntheir trust in politicians, their trust diminishes considerably, except \nnow when people are beginning to feel the pressure of job scarcity, of \ntermination of health plans, and retirement plans at risk. It is a \nwhole different world.\n  I submit that when the vote finally comes on this amendment, the \npeople who are going to vote against it have to examine their \nconscience very closely to make sure they are doing the right thing for \ntheir communities and for their States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nSenator Lautenberg's amendment to provide additional resources for the \nSuperfund trust fund. I think my colleagues would all agree on the \nsuccess of the Superfund Program. Since its inception in 1980, we have \ncleaned up 890 of the most hazardous toxic waste sites in communities \naround the country, including 44 in my home State of Washington. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's enforcement of the ``polluter-pays \nprinciple'' has helped clean up these sites.\n  Unfortunately, since the Superfund fees expired in 1995, American \ntaxpayers have picked up an increasingly large share of cleanup costs \nand today are bearing almost the entire burden of paying for sites \nabandoned by polluting corporations. That is why the amendment before \nus is really about fairness--it holds polluting industries accountable \nand protects public health and safety. I believe a recent editorial in \nthe Seattle Post-Intelligencer makes the point well:\n\n       Washington taxpayers paid only $7 million in 1995 for \n     Superfund program costs. Next year, we will pay between $25 \n     million and $30 million. Americans are now paying for the \n     worst toxic waste sites in the country with our health and \n     our tax dollars.\n\n  This amendment will also help stem the ongoing erosion of funding for \nthe Superfund Program. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, \nthe overall Superfund appropriations have dropped 35 percent in real \nterms since 1993, even while highly contaminated hazardous waste sites \ncontinue to be added to the National Priorities List, the Environmental \nProtection Agency's list of the Nation's most contaminated sites. In \nfact, at the end of fiscal year 2002, the National Priorities List\n\n[[Page S2617]]\n\nhad 1,233 sites in various stages of cleanup.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency's own Inspector General reported \nin January 2003 that the agency is facing Superfund shortfalls \nexceeding $174 million. That means the Bunker Hill site on the border \nof Washington and Idaho is only receiving $15 million this year, even \nthough the Environmental Protection Agency estimated a need for $37.8 \nmillion. To put that in personal terms, I quote directly from the \nInspector General's report:\n\n       The impact of reduced funds for the Bunker Hill site is \n     associated with risk to human health, particularly for young \n     children and pregnant women, from lead contamination in a \n     residential area.\n\n  I think this quote, directly from the Environmental Protection \nAgency, tells us all how critical it is we support this amendment. \nReinstating the fees means that we can shift costs away from \noverburdened taxpayers, protect Americans from exposure to dangerous \ntoxic chemicals, and revitalize properties that blight our nation and \noften inhibit urban redevelopment.\n  Waste sites still threaten more than 65 million Americans who live \nwithin 4 miles of a Superfund toxic waste site. And there are 40,000 \nother sites of concern that have not yet been listed on the National \nPriorities List. There was a very good reason for initiating a \nSuperfund fee 23 years ago, and, until the remaining Superfund sites \nare cleaned up, we should reinstate and maintain this important \nenvironmental fee. I urge my colleagues to support this critical \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for a moment I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are going to try to not let time be \nwasted in quorum calls because time is such a precious commodity at \nthis point. I will take a moment to talk about the budget resolution \nbefore us and what I think are the deficiencies of that resolution.\n  Let me put up this first chart that shows the operating deficits \nunder the budget resolution that is before us. The hard reality is, the \nbudget resolution before us will add nearly $3 trillion to the debt in \njust the next 5 years. Already we have record budget deficits. This \nyear the Congressional Budget Office is saying the deficit will be \nnearly $500 billion. But that does not tell the whole story.\n  Actually, on an operating basis the deficit is even larger because \nnearly $160 billion of Social Security money is being used for other \npurposes as well. So if one looked at an operating basis, the true \ndeficit would be the $477 billion plus another $160 billion. That is \napproaching $650 billion on a $2.3 trillion budget. That is a big \nbudget deficit by any objective measure.\n  Here it is, $638 billion. As we see it, under the resolution that is \nbefore us, this operating deficit never gets below $500 billion as far \nas the eye can see.\n  Some are saying this budget resolution will cut the deficit in half \nin 3 years. Well, that is a certain definition of deficit that does not \nreveal the full story. It does not talk about how much is actually \nbeing added to the debt. The reason for the difference is one includes \nSocial Security trust funds and one does not.\n  Right now the Social Security trust funds are running very large and \ngrowing surpluses. Under the budget resolution before us, all of that \nSocial Security money is being taken over the next 5 years to pay for \nother things.\n  When the chairman of the committee talks about cutting the deficit in \nhalf in the next 3 years and cutting it in an even larger way by the \nfifth year, here is what his assumptions are: He says in the fifth year \nthe deficit will be down to $202 billion. Here are the things he is \nleaving out: Under his resolution, he is also going to take $235 \nbillion from Social Security, every penny of which has to be paid back \nand there is no plan to do it. He is taking $22 billion out of the \nMedicare trust fund, every penny of which has to be paid back and he \nhas no plan to do that.\n  In addition, it would cost $55 billion to fix the alternative minimum \ntax in that year. The alternative minimum tax is the old millionaires' \ntax that is rapidly becoming a middle-class tax trap.\n  Why do I say that? Well, right now only 3 million people are affected \nby the alternative minimum tax. By the end of this 10-year budget \nperiod, there are going to be 40 million people. Those people who \nthought they were going to get a tax cut are in for a rude surprise.\n  On top of that, he leaves out the residual war cost in that fifth \nyear which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, will be $30 \nbillion. So instead of adding to the debt by $202 billion, which one \nmight conclude when he says he is going to run a deficit of that amount \nfor that year, we see he is actually going to be adding to the debt by \n$545 billion.\n  Still lots of things are left out. For example, on war costs, in the \nPresident's budget he has no funding for the war in Iraq, no funding \nfor the war in Afghanistan, no funding for the war on terror past \nSeptember 30 of this year. To the chairman's credit, he has put in $30 \nbillion, although interestingly enough he does not add it to his \ndeficit totals. So it is magic money. It is money that is on paper, \nsays it is available, but he does not count it.\n  Look at what the Congressional Budget Office tells us ought to be the \nmoney set aside for war costs. They say $280 billion is what it is \ngoing to cost over this next period of time. The chairman has $30 \nbillion in his budget resolution, although he does not really provide \nthe money, he does not count it in his deficit calculations. It is, as \nI say, magic money: Now you see it, now you don't. The President has no \nmoney.\n  So I go back to this calculation of what this budget resolution adds \nto the debt and what kind of operating deficits it runs, and they are \nmuch larger than is being revealed. Here is what I mean. From 2004 to \n2005, it will add $612 billion to the debt. The next year, $569 billion \nis added to the debt. These are not my numbers. This is from the \nchairman's own mark. These are from his documents. The third year it \nadds $552 billion to the debt. The fourth year, $563 billion to the \ndebt; the fifth year another $563 billion to the debt. That is a \ncumulative total of nearly $3 trillion to the debt, and all at the \nworst possible time, right before the baby boomers retire.\n  I know my colleague from Idaho is waiting so I am going to wrap this \nup, and I know Senator Nelson is seeking time as well. This is a final \npoint I think is important to understand: The deficit on a unified \nbasis, when Social Security is included and other things are left out, \nis going down. That is misleading us as to our true fiscal condition \nbecause the additions to the debt are basically stable, but if I \nexamine the chairman's proposal he is actually adding to the deficit \nbeyond what would occur if we did nothing in this Chamber.\n  I hope my colleagues are listening. The chairman's budget adds to the \ndeficit in each of the next 5 years by $177 billion over and above what \nwould happen if we did nothing. If we just put the Government on \nautomatic pilot, we would have $177 billion less in deficit over the \nnext 5 years than if we passed this budget resolution.\n  I hope my colleagues study this document very carefully because I \nthink it conceals much of the true financial condition of our country.\n  I yield the floor, because I know colleagues are seeking time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Lautenberg \namendment and also to speak generally about S. Con. Res. 95, which is, \nof course, the underlying budget resolution. I also come from a State \nthat has a very large Superfund site, so one would think I would be in \nsupport of the Lautenberg amendment to fund that site, but I am not, \nand here is the reason why, and why I think it is important we all \nunderstand a tax is a tax is a tax, and what the Senator proposes on \nSuperfund is really a tax on a lot of businesses that are having \ndifficulty at this moment.\n  In fiscal year 2005, the request for Superfund is $1.38 billion, and \nthat is an increase of about $124 million over\n\n[[Page S2618]]\n\nfiscal year 2004. The fiscal year 2005 budget includes a $150 million \nincrease in Superfund cleanups, and that $150 million not only funds \nthe cleanup work already underway in Idaho and the program we have \nplanned out there, but it also includes 15 new construction projects, \nor cleanup projects, involved under Superfund law.\n  Democrats will argue to reinstate the Superfund tax so that, in their \nwords, the polluter pays for the cost of the cleanup. Well, the fact is \nthe polluter already pays under current law. Where there is an \nidentifiable and viable polluter, consistent with the law, they are \nheld liable. Congress has exempted a few small businesses, but in most \ncases, again, where there is an identifiable polluter which has a \nviable company that can obviously be held responsible, they are asked \nto pay, and by law they will pay.\n  That was certainly true in the Superfund area of Idaho, which was an \nold mining area. While some of those mining companies and smelting \ncompanies participated in paying, there is also a tap on the Superfund \nitself for that kind of pay. In 2003, potential responsible parties, or \nPRPs, paid about 87 percent of the cost of new construction.\n  Certainly a great deal of money is coming out of the business sector \nto pay for cleanup under the Superfund law. Historically, PRPs--again, \nresponsible parties--have paid more than 70 percent of the cleanup \nitself. So the law itself is a tax imposed on those companies when they \nare found responsible for the pollution and are by law required to \nclean up the pollutants.\n  Superfund taxes were always unfair. The tax goes where the money is \nand not where the responsibility lies. What we are doing now is \ndirecting it toward the responsible parties. This is not a tax on \npolluters. It is an indiscriminate tax on business, as proposed by \nSenator Lautenberg. The Superfund tax was levied against a broad range \nof businesses.\n  It is interesting there is no correlation between the dollars in the \nSuperfund and the level of funding that goes to Superfund cleanup. \nThere is no delay in cleanups due to a lack of the Superfund tax.\n  As we work to stimulate this economy and get it back on line and get \ncompanies in the business of growing and expanding so they can create \nnew jobs and hire the unemployed, this tax goes, in a broad-based way, \nright at those companies, once again potentially dragging them down.\n  I am on the floor today also to strongly support S. Con. Res. 95 \nwhich the Budget Committee has worked so hard to produce. This is not \nthe kind of budget resolution I wish I was voting on. That is not the \nfault of the chairman of the Budget Committee or the majority of the \ncommittee, and it is not the fault of the President of the United \nStates, and it is not the fault of the tax relief this Congress enacted \nin 2001 through 2003.\n  Where does the fault lie? There has been a lot of fingerpointing by \nall of the amendments that have been brought out here in a great rush \non the part of my Democrat colleagues to crank all these taxes back up \nand stunt the growth that is starting.\n  Where does the fault lie? With an economic cycle that, despite the \ncollective denial of politicians, bequeaths our Nation with a recession \nat least about once every decade. Certainly in my time here in the \nCongress I have watched that cycle go forth. Somehow in the late 1990s \nwe thought the cycle would never come, but it did come. It came in the \nlatter years of the Clinton administration. We were trying to pull it \nout and then along came 9/11. We all know what happened at that time \nwhen terrorists attacked innocent civilians in this country and really \nthrew this country into a phenomenal, quick slowdown. Some will argue \nit took over $1 trillion out of the economy at that time.\n  Where does the fault lie? With the international terrorist movement \nand the foreign regimes who supported it. We saw what happened, \ntragically, in Spain today. No country is immune. Certainly we have had \nto invest mightily to begin to develop a level of protection for the \ncivilian population in this country we really had never had before.\n  With that difficult, perfect combination of things happening, and I \nthink obviously understood by all, what are we dealing with? We are \ndealing with a very difficult time. We, as a Congress, have worked \nmightily to work our way out of that. These circumstances, most of them \nforced upon us, have really been a body blow to our economy, to \nAmerican jobs, and to the current fiscal situation.\n  Something else is also happening. The American people have said, in \nreality, you have spent about as much as you need to spend. We have \ndeficits growing. It is time we get those deficits under control. The \nchairman of the Budget Committee has worked mightily to do that.\n\n  We are in the aftermath of a market slump and an economic slowdown \nthat truly began in 2000, before this President took office. Nobody \ndenies that today, although some would like to point a finger in a \nrather odd direction, at this current President. We are still working \nour way out of this recession in all respects. It is not smooth \nsailing, but clearly the wind is now to our back and it appears the \neconomy is slowly but progressively coming on line.\n  We fought a shooting war against terrorism on two fronts and continue \nto fight terrorism at home and abroad.\n  Unfortunately, in a business world in which most folks play by the \nrules and follow the law, something else has happened: A significant \nhandful of scandals and a legacy of some of the excesses of the 1990s \nthat shook the confidence of the stock market and further depressed the \neconomic downturn. That cyclical downturn already was inevitable. I \nthink I can well remember what Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said when he \nwarned us of an overvalued market and an irrationally exuberant \nattitude, long before the market slumped. So the combination of the 9/\n11 and bad actors out there in the market along with the reality of \ncyclical movements in our country have brought us to where we are today \nand brought the budget to where it is, trying to be fiscally \nresponsible and fund the needed and necessary services of our \nGovernment and at the same time saying we are controlling our spending \nhere and we are not going to overtax America's workforce.\n  Quite another message comes from the other side at this moment. \nSomehow they have an insatiable appetite to continually increase taxes \non working men and women. They will argue they would like to direct it \nat the millionaires of this country. They never really quite define it. \nWe know the vast majority of the taxes paid in this country are paid by \naverage working men and women because they make up by far the vast \nmajority of the cumulative wealth and generated wealth of our country.\n  Given all the circumstances, I believe this is a very good budget \nresolution. I believe we ought to work hard to support it and to refine \nit where we can throughout the process and get on with the business of \ndoing what is responsible here and that is causing our Government to \nfunction in the appropriate fashion.\n  It is a political year. We all know that. It would be a nice surprise \nif the Congress of the United States, at least on budgetary matters, \nand at least through the appropriation process, could show the American \npeople we are going to be responsible, we are going to finish the \nbudget on time, we are going to get our appropriations out on time. \nThen we can get at the business of politics, of deciding who is going \nto run the next Congress and who the next President of this country \nwill be. But it would be amazingly refreshing if we could show the \nAmerican people we can work together.\n  It doesn't appear that is going to happen and that is a real sadness \nof mine. We are working hard to put a budget resolution together and \nyet we see this insatiable appetite on the part of my Democrat \ncolleagues to continually raise the spectrum of more taxes, more taxes, \nmore taxes.\n  I congratulate Senator Nickles, chairman of the Budget Committee. \nThis resolution represents a truly heroic effort of responsible \nmanagement of our budget during a time of trial and challenge in our \ncountry. It is a tough time. We all know that. It is understandable. It \nis unfortunate that several years of international and economic shocks \nand jolts have produced today's record budget deficits. Our \nconstituents today know it. They understand history. But they also \nunderstand responsibility and they have\n\n[[Page S2619]]\n\nhanded us that responsibility and they are suggesting we treat it with \ndue respect.\n\n  The American people, especially after 9/11, showed tremendous \nresilience. They met the challenge. They expect us to meet the \nchallenge. They demand it of us. They demand it of our President. In \nnearly all instances that simply has happened. The President and \nCongress did the right thing in 2001 and 2003. Without tax relief, \nwhere would we be today? We would probably have fewer jobs. Our senior \ncitizens' nest eggs would be lower in value and less secure. Millions \nof low- and moderate-income families would probably have less freedom \nand financial empowerment today than they would without the tax \nreduction. Small business startups and growth would have been stunted.\n  Without the leadership and the effectiveness of this President and \nCongress on matters of defense and homeland security and the economy, \nwe would still be in a recession. We are not in that recession now. We \nare clearly in a recovery mode. This country is struggling along, but \nalways upward, building its job base and bringing people back into the \njob market in a very progressive way.\n  Lots of challenges remain. None of us will argue the difference \nbecause challenges are there. But is the challenge simply to go out and \nburden the economy again by major tax increases? They would suggest \nthat we not extend the current taxes. That is not going to be a tax \nincrease? You ask the average working man or woman, ask the average \nfamily of four, if doing that doesn't constitute a tax increase because \nit takes money away from their spendable bottom line. You darned bet it \nis a tax increase. The very least we can do is assure that we maintain \nthe child tax credit and the marriage penalty relief and the 10-percent \ntax rate which is going to be critical to the working men and women of \nmodest means in this country. That is what this Congress ought to be \nabout.\n  If I have heard the rhetoric once, I have heard it a good number of \ntimes in my years here in Congress. Somehow Government can do it best; \nsomehow an expenditure of the Government dollar is going to cause our \nlives to be better. In instances that is true, such as in areas of \nhealth care and in Social Security. But in instances of good-paying \njobs, Government doesn't create them. It is the private sector that \ncreates them. We ought to be incentivizing in every way we possibly can \nthe very job creator we know about--small business, medium-size \nbusiness, and large business in this country.\n  I strongly support what the Budget Committee has brought forward. I \nthink it is responsible. I am glad we are defeating most of these \namendments that would simply send us into a tax-and-spend spiral, the \nkind we have seen before that more often drove us into a recession than \ndrove us out of a recession. To tighten our belt, to bring the deficit \ndown, and to begin to show a pattern of moving us toward a balanced \nbudget again is the right thing. The chairman of the Budget Committee \nis doing just that.\n  The President asked that we begin to tighten our belt and curtail our \nspending in a variety of areas that are less essential to the \nfundamental responsibilities of our Government. That is exactly what we \nare doing. It is a tough budget. It is not an easy budget. But it is a \nbudget worth voting for. It is a budget worth finalizing so we can get \non with the appropriating process.\n  I hope at the end of the year when we adjourn sine die we can say our \njob was complete; that while it was a very partisan year and a highly \npoliticized year, the Congress came together, got their appropriations \nbills finished, and did their homework. There will be only one way that \nwon't happen--if the other side, in an obstructionist way, decides it \nwon't happen; if they decide every appropriations bill that comes up \nhas to have 50, 60, 90, or 100 amendments and we have to labor day \nafter day after we have worked in a bipartisan way to craft the \nappropriations bills, as we always do.\n  That is our challenge. Let us get our budget resolution complete. Let \nus get reconciliation, the tools that move us forward toward the \nappropriating process so we can complete the year as the American \ntaxpayer and the voter would expect us to do. That is the challenge. \nThe chairman of the Budget Committee and the Budget Committee are \nmeeting that challenge, and I hope we are worthy of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Nebraska is seeking time. \nHow much time would he desire?\n  I yield five minutes off the resolution to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my \ncolleague from North Dakota and commend him for all the work he has \ndone on the budget.\n  I say to my friend from Idaho I think we recognize across the aisle \nit is important for us to work on a bipartisan basis. I agree with him. \nI might take issue with him when he would suggest that any, or all, or \nalways, or never with respect to your friends on this side of the \naisle. I think we are here to work together. I hope we can, without \nclassifying ourselves one way or the other, except to say we are here \nas Americans representing the folks back home by working together and \ngetting something accomplished. I know that is the goal of the Senator \nfrom Idaho. I think a lot of us share that goal.\n\n\n                             Tony Raimondo\n\n  I rise today to come to the defense of a great friend, and more \nimportantly, a great Nebraskan, Tony Raimondo. As many are aware, Tony \nRaimondo was to be nominated this morning as the Bush administration's \nnew manufacturing czar. Late yesterday the announcement was canceled, \nciting scheduling conflicts.\n  I realize there have been speeches in this Chamber that have been \ncritical of Tony's record as a businessman. I am here to say \n``nonsense.'' We all know politics runs the days around here. It is a \nvery political time with the Presidential election. Much is at stake. \nYesterday was no exception to that, and today is not either.\n  I am not going to address what was said earlier. Everyone has a right \nto an opinion. No matter who the Bush administration decided to appoint \nto this position, he or she is going to be run through the ringer. But \nI am here to tell you this Nebraskan isn't going to watch another \nNebraskan get treated like this.\n  Tony Raimondo is a friend of mine, a former business partner of mine, \nand he is not the antijobs CEO he is painted to be.\n  Sure, he has a company in China. He expanded there last year. In \nfact, I had the pleasure to be at the ribbon cutting of his factory \nthere. Next week I will be in Columbus, NE, the headquarters of Tony's \nbusiness, Behlen Manufacturing. I will see many Nebraskans who are \nemployed at Behlen, or are related to somebody employed at Behlen, or \nat least know someone employed by Behlen.\n  Tony is a respected member of the Columbus business community. He is \na Nebraska business leader. He has represented Nebraska business \ninterests around the world and here at home as a prominent member of \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, and he is a good employer.\n\n  Sure, his business has struggled in recent years. It is hard to find \none that hasn't. But he didn't do what others have done. He is fighting \nto keep his business alive and well in Nebraska and in the other States \nwhere it is located. He is fighting to save those jobs. He is fighting \nto not let his employees down, his community, his State, or his \ncountry.\n  He expanded his business to China. He didn't close it and move it to \nChina. With his experience, I think he can show others how to keep jobs \nhere at home and how to expand and diversify their businesses--saving \njobs in America. Tony Raimondo should be held up as an example, not \nderided as a pirate.\n  I am not sure what is happening with the nomination at this point. \nObviously, there is a predictable partisan opposition. But what I am \nnot hearing is any alternative. Should we leave this important position \nempty and watch manufacturing jobs continue to decline or should we get \nsomeone in place to at least try to preserve those jobs, those good-\npaying jobs here in America?\n  I came here to get things done and to do what is right for Nebraska. \nI say let\n\n[[Page S2620]]\n\nus try. Tony Raimondo is not only a good choice for this position but, \nin my opinion, he is the best choice.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the distinguished Senator from the State \nof North Dakota for the time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for \ntaking the time. I also thank him very much for being flexible about \nwhen to come so we can keep the business flowing and not have dead \ntime. I appreciate very much his accommodating the managers.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also want to compliment my colleague \nfrom Nebraska. I very much appreciate his comments concerning having \npartisan work on the budget. I have had the pleasure of working with \nthe Senator from Nebraska. We are very good friends. I hope his \nbasketball team goes in defeat today against the University of \nOklahoma. I wanted to make sure he is aware that could happen. You \nnever know.\n  Senator Inhofe, I believe, wants to speak on the Superfund amendment \noffered by our colleague from New Jersey. In a moment, I will ask to \nset this amendment aside, and we will take up an additional amendment. \nBut let me make a couple of comments.\n  This is a tax increase. We have had a lot of tax increases. This \nassumes it is going to be reauthorized. I hope and expect it will be \nauthorized. But the taxes shouldn't be increased until it is \nreauthorized. That should be done by the authorizers. Chairman Inhofe \nis chairman of that committee. I want to protect his rights. When he \nreturns to the Senate Chamber, I will give him ample time on whatever \namendment we are considering to fully debate the Lautenberg amendment. \nI am willing to consider additional amendments.\n  I tell our colleagues again we have spent a lot of time debating. We \nneed to be moving more amendments or else other people are going to be \nsqueezed on time.\n  I believe the Senator from Iowa has an amendment. It is all right \nwith me if we go to that amendment.\n  The Senator from Connecticut, I believe, has an amendment. We are \nhappy to consider that amendment.\n  I want to notify our colleagues time is running and we are going to \nhave a very late night tonight and, unfortunately, maybe tomorrow. I \nhappen to think it is possible to finish this tonight, but it will take \npeople not offering amendments. It will take people not making long \nspeeches. I don't want to stifle debate. I enjoy debate. But it is \nimportant to get our work done. I see a fairly lengthy list of \namendments yet to be handled.\n\n  I am willing to set aside the Lautenberg amendment for the amendment \nof the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Lautenberg never sent the amendment up.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I guess I will not set it aside. I asked unanimous \nconsent to set aside the Dorgan amendment to consider the Lautenberg \namendment but it was not sent to the desk. We will save a spot for \nSenator Lautenberg to introduce the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I might clarify, I can understand why this may be \nsurprising. We were not able to arrive at a time agreement because you \nneeded to talk to the chairman. We thought it would be more appropriate \nto withhold sending the amendment to the desk until you had a chance to \nconsult with your chairman.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We thought that would be more fair to you.\n  If we could enter into a time agreement on the Harkin amendment, that \nwould help substantially.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If my colleague will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think it would be most appropriate if \nthe Senator from New Jersey did not offer his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have a lot of amendments that the chairman might feel \nthat way about.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will compliment my colleague from New Jersey for his \namendment if he does not offer it. I will oppose it strenuously if it \nis sent to the desk. I urge my colleague to withhold, if he can.\n  Our colleague from Kentucky wants to be heard on the amendment from \nour friend from Iowa. I need to consult with him before we enter into a \ntime agreement. I am perfectly willing to enter into a time agreement \non several amendments.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we get a general understanding of what it is we \nwill try to achieve in terms of a time agreement on this amendment so \nthe Senator from Iowa has some understanding of what we would be \ntalking about, 20 minutes equally divided, as we discussed earlier?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. As I understand the Senator from Iowa, he raises taxes \nonly $80 billion over this period of time, so if we give a minute per \nbillions, this would be 40 minutes a side. I am not sure. I would be \nwilling to do 15 minutes a side, but I need to consult with a couple of \ncolleagues. I am not positive what this amendment does, if it has a \nreserve fund or if it just is a direct tax increase and assumes \nspending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we say initially that in terms of the advice for \nour colleagues that we try to make this 30 minutes equally divided, \nwith an understanding that it may be altered somewhat when you have a \nchance to consult? It would just help those who are managing the \namendment to divide up the time in a way that might make things go \nfaster.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the suggestion by my colleague from North \nDakota. I would like to have an assumption that no amendment gets over \n10 minutes on each side. I mentioned that would be my desire at the \nbeginning of the day. That is still my desire. That would be ample time \nfor discussion. That would be my hope. I hope the standard amendment \ndoes not receive more than 10 minutes a side. That would be my thought. \nMaybe we can do that for the amendment of the Senator from Iowa.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay the pending amendment aside and to \nconsider an amendment to be offered by our colleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to the Senator from Iowa 15 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2799\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself, and Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Bingaman, Ms. \n     Landrieu, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2799.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for increased resources for medical research, \n disease control, wellness, tobacco cessation and preventative health \n     efforts including substance abuse and mental health services, \n  establishing a fund for this purpose, offset by an increase in the \ncigarette tax to $1 and proportional increases in other tobacco excise \n                      taxes and deficit reduction)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $15,600,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2621]]\n\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $23,400,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $31,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $39,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $7,800,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $15,600,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $23,400,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $31,200,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $39,000,000,000.\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . FUND FOR HEALTH.\n\n       If the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate reports \n     legislation with a level of appropriations for function 550 \n     discretionary programs without the use of this Fund that at \n     least appropriates the sum appropriated for function 550 \n     discretionary programs in fiscal year 2004, the Chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may revise \n     aggregates, function totals and increase the allocations to \n     the Committee on Appropriations up to $6,000,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $6,000,000,000 in new budget outlays for \n     fiscal year 2005 and $30,500,000,000 in new budget authority \n     and $30,500,000,000 in budget outlays in fiscal years 2005 \n     through 2009.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on behalf of \nmyself and the major cosponsor is Senator Feinstein; also Senators \nDurbin, Lautenberg, Bingaman, Landrieu, and Lieberman.\n  The Nation's health system is in crisis. There are nearly 44 million \nuninsured individuals. Skyrocketing health costs are leaving more and \nmore people without insurance. We have shortages of health \nprofessionals all across rural America. Everywhere, health providers \nare stretched to the limit. Finally, as the Centers for Disease Control \npointed out just this week, obesity will soon match tobacco use as \nAmerica's No. 1 preventable killer.\n  This is not the time to cut Federal investments in health care. We \nstand on the brink of fantastic discoveries and breakthroughs in \nmedical research. This is not the time to cut short this vital \nresearch, denying hope to tens of millions of Americans with chronic \ndiseases. This is the time to increase our efforts not only to treat \nand cure illnesses, but also to dramatically increase our efforts to \nprevent illnesses. We need major new efforts to promote wellness in our \nhealth care system.\n  And yet, the President has proposed slashing function 550, the health \ncare function in this budget. This is taking America in exactly the \nwrong direction.\n  Accordingly, I am offering an amendment that would increase function \n550 funding by $6 billion in fiscal year 2005 and $30 billion over 5 \nyears.\n  This new funding would go to medical research disease control, \nwellness, tobacco cessation, and preventive health efforts. It would \nhelp to recruit and retain our incredibly talented health professionals \nin this country--especially in rural areas. It boosts research into new \nmedical treatments and cures. It includes funding for mental health and \nsubstance abuse programs. It includes funding for the prevention of \nchronic diseases, which account for 75 percent of our Nation's $1 \ntrillion in health care costs.\n  The Harkin-Feinstein amendment fully offsets this new funding by \nlevying a tobacco user fee of 61 cents per pack. That would bring the \nFederal total to $1 per pack.\n  This user fee will raise enough revenue both to fund the increase in \nfunction 550 and to reduce the deficit--steps that will be good for the \nphysical health of the American people and the fiscal health of the \nfederal government.\n  Bear in mind that tobacco use costs this country billions of dollars \nand millions of lives every year. Tobacco use is the leading cause of \npreventable death in the United States, causing 440,000 deaths each \nyear and resulting in more than $75 billion in direct medical costs. \nSmoking causes chronic lung disease, coronary heart disease, and \nstroke, as will as cancer of the lungs, larynx, esophagus, mouth, and \nbladder. In addition, smoking contributes to cancer of the cervix, \npancreas, and kidneys.\n  This creates an enormous financial burden for the federal government. \nSmoking-caused Medicaid expenditures amount to a whopping $23.5 billion \nannually. Smoking-caused Medicare-expenditures are $20 billion per \nyear. Reducing tobacco use in this country could save American \ntaxpayers billions of dollars annually, while freeing up resources to \ninvest in the country's public health system.\n  Study after study tells us that increases in the price on tobacco \nproducts have significant positive public health effects--especially \nwith children. With a $1 user fee on tobacco products, we can decrease \nyouth smoking by 18 percent. We can keep 105,000 young people from \nstarting smoking in the first place.\n  Despite our efforts in the 1990's to curtail manipulative marketing \ntargeted at children, the tobacco industry currently spends more than \n$11 billion a year to promote its deadly products--that is $30 million \nper day. We should be curbing this threat, this epidemic. And this \namendment will do exactly that.\n  Prevention is the key. Today, Americans are plagued with more and \nmore chronic diseases that are largely preventable. As I said, 75 \npercent of the $1 trillion we spend on health care in the United States \ngoes to the treatment of these largely preventable chronic diseases. \nWithout question, giving Americans an incentive to reduce or quit using \ntobacco products would be an urgent step in the right direction.\n  This amendment offers us a trifecta of benefits: It increases funding \nfor health care services, medical research and prevention. It reduces \nthe deadly pandemic of tobacco use in America. And it makes a solid \ncontribution to reducing the budget deficits that are destroying our \ngovernment's fiscal health.\n  Lastly, let me say that our amendment does not contain any provision \ndealing with the tobacco quota buyout and FDA regulation of tobacco. I \nbelieve we need to do both; both must be done together. This is one \nSenator who will stand here and do everything I can in my power, along \nwith others, to make sure there will not be a tobacco buyout without \nFDA regulation of tobacco.\n  I believe we have to do both because I believe we need to help our \ntobacco farmers, those who are struggling to feed their families in \nsmall, rural areas all over the South and sometimes even to the \nMidwest. They need the tobacco buyout. But we also need to make sure we \nhave meaningful oversight of tobacco use and promotion by the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  With that, Mr. President, I now yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I just checked with Senator McConnell, \nwho I think might be involved in leading the opposition, and he has no \nobjection. So I ask unanimous consent that the time allotted for the \namendment of the Senator from Iowa be 30 minutes, equally divided--the \ntime allotted from the beginning of the debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, just for our understanding, the time used \nso far would be charged to the amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time does this side have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes remain.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his \nleadership on this issue, and I join him wholeheartedly.\n  Funding for public health programs has never been more critical. The \nPresident's budget, for the first time in 10 years, includes a decrease \nin Function 550. This is the portion of the budget that covers cancer \nresearch, AIDS treatments and new discoveries, potential health \nthreats, including anthrax or other biological or chemical attacks--all \nthrough the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease \nControl, the Indian Health Service, and others. If we do not adopt this \namendment, all of those programs are threatened with cuts. Let me speak \nabout how this amendment works. It increases the budget for \ndiscretionary public health programs for fiscal year 2005 by $6 \nbillion. That is a 12-percent increase over the fiscal year 2004 level.\n  Now, a 12-percent increase in Function 550 is supported by more than \n400\n\n[[Page S2622]]\n\nhealth groups. And, this increase is also paid for. It is paid for by a \n61-cent increase in the federal tax on tobacco, which will bring in \nabout $8 billion per year. Mr. President, $6 billion of the $8 billion \ncovers the cost of increasing funding for public health, and the \nremaining $2 billion goes for deficit reduction. It is a prudent step \nto take at this point in time.\n  Now, you might say, why? We know tobacco kills. And we know that \nprevention saves lives. For the first time in my State--California--we \nhave had a drop in lung cancer incidences and death among women because \nof the tobacco prevention programs that are taking place. So I think an \nincrease in the tobacco tax is an appropriate means to support a 12-\npercent increase in cancer research.\n  Let me speak to that for just a moment. We now have seen the mapping \nof the human genome. This holds tremendous promise for finding cures \nfor diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, and cancer, by \nattacking their genetic roots.\n  We have seen advances in genomics, in molecular biology, which have \nmade the development of new, targeted cancer therapies such as Gleevec, \nfor chronic myeloid leukemia; Herceptin, for breast cancer; and, most \nrecently, Avastin, for colon cancer.\n  We now have drugs that are so advanced that they can target just the \nbad cancer cells and not harm the good cells. These drugs are amazingly \neffective and are less toxic for the patient.\n  I have been vice chair of the National Dialogue on Cancer, now called \nC-Change, for 4 years, and co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition for \neven longer than that. If there ever is a time to continue the march to \nsolve major health problems before this Nation, this is that time.\n  This amendment allows that to be done, with a 12-percent increase for \npublic health programs. And it is fully offset. It would be funded from \nan increase in the tobacco tax, a tax that I think is an appropriate \nmeasure--about $2 billion for deficit reduction and $6 billion to fund \nthis amendment.\n  I urge the Senate's approval of this increase in basic health \nfunctions across the board.\n  Mr. President, I yield my remaining time to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  How much time is remaining in support of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will not use that amount of time, just \nperhaps 1 minute, if the Senator will yield it. I will just use 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment and ask unanimous \nconsent to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is an extraordinarily important \namendment. It should be strongly bipartisan. Is there a person \nlistening to this debate who believes there is a Republican or a \nDemocratic approach to research, finding cures for the diseases that \nare affecting America? There has been a strong, bipartisan commitment \nby Democratic and Republican Presidents to invest in research. The \nSenator from Iowa and the Senator from California have the courage to \nstand up today and say: We will not allow this effort to end; it will \ngo forward; and we will fund it in an honest fashion, by raising the \nFederal cigarette tax by 61 cents. They will generate the billions of \ndollars that we need to put back into health care and health research \nso families across America have peace of mind that we are doing \neverything in our power to spare their children and their loved ones \nfrom diseases that are threatening them.\n  The second part, that is equally if not more important, is, as you \nincrease the cost of tobacco products, fewer people buy them, \nparticularly children. A 61-cent increase in the price of a pack of \ncigarettes or tobacco is going to discourage children from taking up \nthe habit, becoming addicted, and, ultimately, losing their lives to \nthis deadly addiction.\n  I commend this amendment. I hope my colleagues will rise to the \noccasion, on a bipartisan basis, to endorse this real investment in \nhealth care and research for America.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from California for \nallowing me to speak.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time does this side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield myself a couple minutes.\n  A lot of people might say: My gosh, Senator Harkin and Senator \nFeinstein and Senator Durbin, a dollar a pack is a lot of Federal tax \non a pack of cigarettes. But this chart shows the history of the \nFederal excise tax on cigarettes going back to 1950.\n  Shown on this side of the chart would be for 1950. At that time, the \nFederal excise tax was 49 percent of the average wholesale price for a \npack of cigarettes--49 percent. Today, it is 14 percent.\n  So those who say that a dollar a pack on that is too much, I point \nout it only brings it up to 30 percent of the average wholesale price \nof a pack of cigarettes. That would be 30 percent; and that would be \nless than what it has been many times in the past.\n  So it is not out of line with what we have had as a Federal excise \ntax on cigarettes, as I said, going clear back to 1950. Then all the \nway up until about 1983 it was more than 30 percent of the average \nwholesale price. So this is not out of line.\n  But what we get for this, as has been pointed out, is we get $30 \nbillion over 5 years to invest in health research, wellness, prevention \nprograms, anti-obesity programs, smoking cessation programs, and \nkeeping our people more healthy. Plus, we also get out of this \namendment about $9 billion in deficit reduction.\n  So this amendment does two things: It raises the Federal excise tax \non a pack of cigarettes from 39 cents to $1, which would bring it up to \nabout 30 percent of the wholesale price, and it takes that money and \nputs it in the health function so we can invest in the health of our \npeople in this country. That is all this amendment does. It does \nnothing else.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it not also true, with the success of this amendment, \nthere will be a dramatic reduction in teenage smoking?\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is absolutely right. We know with this \namendment there will be a dramatic reduction. It is estimated youth \nsmoking would go down by at least 18 percent with this amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his support and for \npointing that out.\n  I reserve whatever time we may have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I think I may have a colleague who wants \nto speak on this; I believe Senator McConnell. I am looking at the \namendment. I can read the purpose, but I will tell my colleagues, you \ncan put whatever purpose you want, but the net essence of the amendment \nis to increase taxes by $39 billion. I appreciate the assumption. I \ndon't know if that scores correctly. I have no idea.\n  I don't know what the tax raises today and I don't know how much \nmoney would be raised if it was increased today $1 a pack. I do know a \nlot of States have been doing this. My Governor in my State of Oklahoma \nis in the process of trying to increase tobacco taxes as we speak. This \nwould conflict with that to some extent because a lot of States have \nbeen doing that. I believe New York and a lot of other States have very \nhefty taxes. This has been primarily an area where the States have \nmaybe the heavier tax between the Federal and the State.\n  This amendment also purports to say it will increase spending. Just \nreading the language, it says, ``If the Committee on Appropriations \nreports the legislation'' such-and-such, then the chairman of the \nBudget Committee may revise aggregates up to. So it doesn't actually \ndirectly increase spending. It does directly increase taxes to the tune \nof $39 billion over the first few years. It assumes there would be a \nlot of new spending. I want to make that clear. Some people are \nassuming it is a direct increase in some functions.\n\n[[Page S2623]]\n\n  Again, to repeat, my colleague from North Dakota and I have done this \nrepeatedly. The purpose does not really mean the Finance Committee is \ngoing to get an instruction to increase taxes, decrease taxes, keep \npresent law, have tax increases. This is a tax increase. I have been on \nthe Finance Committee for a long time. I don't remember ever voting on \nan amendment to increase cigarette taxes. I guess it has floated \naround, but I don't remember a serious debate on increasing the \ncigarette tax and should this be a function to be reserved for the \nStates or for the Federal Government.\n  I will reserve the balance of our time for Members who may be more \nknowledgeable. I didn't know what the excise tax on a pack of \ncigarettes was until my colleague said it is 31 cents. I don't know \nwhat the wholesale price of a pack of cigarettes is. I don't know what \nthe retail price is. I don't know, don't care too much. So maybe this \nis a fight for other people.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Harkin \nAmendment. I'm against raising taxes. And that is exactly what this \namendment is--a tax increase and a large one. Moreover, it is very \nregressive. It raises taxes on many people who can't afford it.\n  However, I share the overall goal of reducing tobacco use. Smoking is \nstill the number one killer in America, though obesity is now a close \nsecond, a should be addressed by Congress. As a heart and lung \ntransplant surgeon, I know very well the results of this deadly habit, \nand I have consistently supported reasonable FDA regulation of tobacco \nwhich focuses on youth consumption.\n  I hope that we can eventually reach agreement on a package that will \ngive FDA reasonable authority to regulate tobacco and provide a buy-out \nfor our tobacco farmers. I encourage my colleagues who support this \namendment to work to accomplish that worthy public health goal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from West Virginia is seeking \ntime. How much time would the Senator want?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Five or six minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nWest Virginia. For the information of the chairman, the Senator has \nagreed to talk about an amendment but not offer it. That is why we are \nasking at this time that he be given 5 minutes to discuss his concern.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the extremely distinguished \nPresiding Officer, Senator Conrad, and Senator Nickles.\n  Last year we had a very interesting scene on this floor in which 75 \nSenators, working with Senator Collins, Senator Nelson from Nebraska, \nand Senator Smith from Oregon and I, and others, passed a $20 billion \nfiscal relief bill for the States. Half of that was devoted to \nMedicaid. It became an extraordinarily important part of what States \ndid to be able to survive.\n  We are once again in a dire fiscal situation. States face the \nprospect of having to cut benefits to kids, particularly poor kids, \nneedy families, and seniors in nursing homes, something which 75 \nSenators voted not to do last year. It passed the House. The President \nsigned it.\n  Forty-two States last year were in a budget deficit situation with \nrespect to Medicaid. It was and is their largest problem. Sluggish job \ngrowth continues to add to that problem. Last month our economy gained \n21,000 new jobs. There are 8 million people out of work, so that is \nonly one job for every 380 unemployed workers. The majority of \nAmericans get their health care through their job, particularly \nmanufacturing jobs, so employment is tremendously important. \nManufacturing has been going down, as the Presiding Officer knows.\n  Even more depressing, about 400,000 Americans have dropped out of the \nworkforce altogether, which to me is the saddest thing that can happen, \nwhere people just kind of give up. The Presiding Officer and I have \nseen that in our States and across America.\n  But instead of working to further ease the budgetary strain on \nStates, Congress has actually made life tougher for States fiscally. \nThe new Medicare law includes at least $1.2 billion in net costs to \nStates in fiscal years 2004, 2005, and 2006. We should be providing \nStates the resources they need to work with Medicare, not enacting \nlegislation that assumes cuts.\n  My amendment, which I will not offer formally, would allow Congress \nto enact legislation simply to extend the enhanced Medicaid match we \npassed last year beyond June 30 of this year. It is not a prescriptive \npolicy, but rather a placeholder that will allow us to help an awful \nlot of people down the road.\n  Some in this body will argue we did this just to be temporary. The \neconomic situation has not stabilized. To the extent we can say the \nproblem is there and there is something we can do to help States, it \nwill make an enormous difference to lots of people. It is interesting \nand sad that 30 States are projecting budget deficits for the fiscal \nyear coming up. Estimates indicate those deficits could total as much \nas $41 billion. In eight States--and I won't name them--the budget \nshortfalls are so large for Medicaid that they exceed 10 percent of the \nentire budget of the State.\n\n  I put this concept, which I believe is tremendously important, before \nthe Senate. It simply allows fiscal relief beyond June 30. It allows an \nextension of what we passed by an enormous amount last year. I hope my \ncolleagues will look upon it favorably.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I might have the attention of the floor manager for a \nminute, does he have 2 minutes for an inquiry available?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator from West Virginia have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am delighted to yield the Senator 2 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, isn't it true that under this resolution \nwe are now considering, there will be no expansion of health care \ncoverage under the existing program; and if the proposal of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia isn't accepted, then what we are going to see are \nhundreds of thousands, even millions of the poorest of the children, \npoorest of the elderly, frailest of our seniors, dropped from any kind \nof health care coverage?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator from Massachusetts is precisely correct. \nThe fact is there is not a nickel's increase from what it was we passed \nso unanimously a year ago, not a nickel's increase.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator agree with me that one of the great \nconcerns across the country is there has been increasing numbers of the \nuninsured, costs have gone up 43 percent? And now without the inclusion \nof the proposal of the Senator from West Virginia, we are putting at \nrisk the poorest of the poor, poor children, frail, elderly people, \nthose in the nursing homes of this country. I commend the Senator from \nWest Virginia. This makes absolute sense and I think it is an absolute \nnecessity. I hope we will have the opportunity to make sure it is part \nof the budget.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself time off of the resolution. \nI want to say to my colleagues that we are rapidly approaching a \ndefining moment of this year's budget resolution. We have just a few \nhours left, and we have requests for much more time than there is \navailable. I remind colleagues of the way this works. Even though I \nhave 4 hours remaining--how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four hours three minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have 4 hours 3 minutes. Senator Nickles has an hour and \n30, something like that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Nickles can yield back all of his time and that \nmeans we functionally have 2 hours left on our side. That is the \nreality.\n  No. 2, we have 50 amendments pending on our side. That is after we \nstarted with 98. We have reduced it to 50. I have never done this \nbefore, but I am going to do it this time. At some point in the very \nnear future, I am going to\n\n[[Page S2624]]\n\nstart voting against amendments offered on either side that spend more \nmoney. I don't think, in light of the massive deficits and debt that we \nhave, even if the amendments are paid for, we should be offering dozens \nof amendments, other than those of extremely high priority.\n  We have had amendments thus far today that have been of an extremely \nhigh priority. I don't believe it is in the interest of this country or \nof this body to have dozens and dozens of amendments, even if they are \npaid for, that add to the spending base, given the level of deficits \nand debt that we have.\n  I have been approached by many members on our side who have asked me \nto deliver this message. I do so at this time. We have lined up, in \naddition to the amendment from Senator Harkin and Senator Feinstein, \none from Senator Byrd, an amendment from Senator Lieberman, an \namendment from Senator Lincoln, and there may be a few more I am not \nyet aware of. But I hope that the message goes out loudly and clearly \nthat we are going to show restraint and dramatically reduce the number \nof pending amendments.\n  Fifty amendments would take us 17 hours of voting. We still haven't \ngotten to the point of beginning the voting. Please, colleagues, I ask \nyou to show some restraint. There is no need for us to come out here \nand offer 50 amendments. This is the time. I hope the phone starts \nringing off the hook in the cloakroom from colleagues who say they have \n8 amendments to offer and they call back and say, I will reduce that to \nthe one that is really a priority.\n  Please, let us not go through another vote-a-rama that takes 17 \nhours. Please let's not do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside, and I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have not \nseen the amendment and we cannot agree to any amendments going to the \ndesk that have not been presented to the ranking member and chairman, \nthose managing the bill. I am constrained to object until we see the \namendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment from myself and \nSenators Kyl, Bingaman, Hutchison, Kennedy, Cornyn, Boxer, Domenici, \nClinton, McCain, Schumer, Graham, Lautenberg, Cantwell, Corzine, \nFeingold, and Edwards. It has to do with the State criminal assistance \nprogram for illegal aliens. We have tried to get floor time and have \nbeen unable to do so.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the advice of my colleagues, we have \nan order here. We have to follow that order. Senators have to come to \nthe managers and present their amendments and get into the queue. The \nnext amendment we have committed to considering is one from Senator \nByrd, also, Senator Lincoln.\n  If Senator Lincoln is ready, we could go to her at this point. I ask \nthe Senator not to send her amendment to the desk, but to seek \nrecognition to present the amendment. Then we will go to Senator Byrd, \nand then we go to Senator Lieberman. That is the order that we have. Is \nSenator Lincoln ready to go?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Off the resolution, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator. I \nask her not to send the amendment to the desk.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object. Is the Senator saying \nI have no right to introduce my amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am saying I am not going to give the Senator time to \nintroduce her amendment at this point. We have an order that has been \nagreed to. We have made commitments to people as to when to present \namendments. We have not seen the Senator's amendment. Until we have \nseen it and gotten it into the queue, other Senators who had \ncommitments made to them are the only ones that we will give time to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. For the record, it is my understanding that the \namendment had been presented to your staff yesterday. We have sought \ntime. I recognize this amendment may not be one of your priorities. It \nis a huge amendment for many States that have very high costs, and I \nhave presented it in the past. It has been unanimously adopted by this \nbody in the budget bill. I offered a separate amendment which was an \nauthorization for $850 million, which passed the Senate and is now in \nthe House. There is no number from the President in the budget. That is \nwhy I am submitting it at this time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I hope the point is clear. The Senator has \nevery right to offer her amendment. The Senator will have a chance to \noffer her amendment. The point is this: We have an order. We have an \nagreement. We are working through those amendments where Senators have \nbeen put in the queue. I am not going to yield time to other Senators \nwho break the line. We have made commitments to Senators for an order \nof recognition. I intend to keep those commitments.\n  Again, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas 10 minutes off the \nresolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2803\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I thank all of my \ncolleagues. This is such an important issue as we look at the budget in \nthe confines of the budget of this country, really in the context of \npriorities. We have a lot of choices and we have a lot of priorities in \nthis country. Each of us as Americans, here in the Senate, our \nconstituents who depend on us tremendously to make sure that the \npriorities of this country are recognized--each of us in our own homes \nand families has to set priorities within the confines of our own \nfamily budgets. We have to look at the year, the circumstances, and we \nhave to figure out what is important to us as a family, important to us \nas part of a community, and what is important in terms of long range \ngoals that we have for ourselves, our families, our communities and, in \nthis instance, our Nation.\n  We also have to recognize that the priorities and choices that we \nmake regarding those priorities have consequences. They have immediate \nconsequences on our families, communities, and our country. They also \nhave long-term consequences on the things that we want to achieve as \nindividuals and collectively as a group. That is why I rise today to \noffer an amendment to the budget resolution to provide $60 billion over \n5 years to reduce the growing number of uninsured Americans and to \nreduce the high cost of health care.\n\n  I do not know about the other Members of this body, but I do know, \nalmost to the individuals who come into my office, whether they \nrepresent corporate America, whether they represent their families, \nwhether they represent the interest of their community and the small \nbusinesses that make up that community, but to a person, almost every \none of them mentions the cost of health care in this country, its \nescalation, and the concern it brings to them as an individual and to \ntheir families, to their businesses, and to their communities.\n  What are we going to do about it? How much of a priority are we going \nto make this issue in terms of the high cost of health care in this \ncountry?\n  One of the most incredible contributors to this high cost of health \ncare is the number of Americans who are uninsured, those who are \nunprepared for what may happen to them or to their family members. It \naffects them, it affects their families, it affects their jobs, their \nemployers, their communities, their health care providers--it affects \nabsolutely everyone.\n  This amendment I offer today will dedicate funding to address this \ncritical issue and to do so in a way that is fiscally responsible. \nUnfortunately, the budget resolution before us does not specify either \nan amount to promote expanding health insurance coverage or a way to \npay for it, which leads me to believe it simply is not a priority, and \nI am here today to make it one.\n  The fact is, the number of uninsured in our country is alarming and \nshould be a national priority. Based on the statements of HHS Secretary \nTommy Thompson last week, it is clear President Bush's administration \ndoes not recognize the severity of this crisis. Secretary Thompson was \nquoted as saying:\n\n       Even if you do not have health insurance in America, you \n     get taken care of. That could be defined as universal health \n     care.\n\n\n[[Page S2625]]\n\n\n  With all due respect to Secretary Thompson, I do not know where he is \ngetting his information. Just look at these simple facts: 20 percent of \nthe working-age adults in Arkansas are uninsured. Nationwide an \nestimated 44 million Americans do not have health insurance.\n  Uninsured families have less access to important screenings, state-\nof-the-art technology, and prescription drugs.\n  Uninsured adults have a 25-percent greater mortality risk than adults \nwith health insurance coverage. An estimated 18,000 deaths among people \nyounger than 65 are attributed to lack of health insurance coverage \nevery single year.\n  Uninsured adults with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, \ncardiovascular disease, HIV infection, and mental illness, have less \naccess to preventive care and have worse clinical outcomes than insured \npatients.\n  Uninsured adults negatively affect our health care providers and the \nlocal economy, too. A community's high rate of uninsured can adversely \naffect the overall health status of the entire community, the financial \nstability of its health care institutions and providers, and access to \nemergency departments and trauma centers.\n  My hospitals in Arkansas will tell you how expensive uncompensated \ncare can be. These facts make it clear. People without health insurance \ndo not get taken care of, as Secretary Thompson said. Those who lack \nhealth insurance do not get access to timely and appropriate health \ncare.\n\n  The fact is Americans without health insurance--children and adults--\nsuffer worse health and they die sooner than those who do have health \ninsurance.\n  The fact is people who lack health insurance are sicker and they die \nsooner. You do not get taken care of if you have no health insurance. \nYou simply fend for yourself.\n  Working families need help with this problem. In Arkansas, the No. 1 \ncause of bankruptcy is high medical bills. If what we want to do is put \nour economy back on track, let us work to provide small businesses and \nindustry the ability to access health insurance and health care for \ntheir workers. We know that works.\n  Last week, I introduced legislation with Senator Durbin and Senator \nCarper to help small businesses gain access to affordable health \ninsurance for their employees. Small businesses are the No. 1 source of \njobs in Arkansas. Small employers say offering health insurance has a \npositive impact on recruitment and retention, employee moral, their \nperformance, and the overall success of their business, their ability \nto succeed and to grow the jobs that will help make this economy \nstrong.\n  What better way to get our economy going again than to help small \nbusinesses to succeed? More than half of the workers in firms under 100 \npeople make less than $25,000. I ask my colleagues, How in the world \ncan someone afford health insurance in the open marketplace on an \nincome at that level? Firms with a high proportion of low-wage workers \nare much less likely to offer insurance, and the fact health insurance \nfor individuals, low-income working families to afford it on their own \ndoes not exist.\n  This budget resolution does not prioritize this growing problem. It \nfails working families because it does not put any money aside.\n  In President Bush's budget, he suggested he wants to work with \nCongress on an offset for this proposed plan. Guess what, Mr. \nPresident. I have one. Let's eliminate the abusive tax loopholes \ncorporations have taken advantage of for years. How long do we have to \nwait, anyway?\n  This amendment is about priorities. Are we going to choose to help \nworking families afford health insurance? Are we going to continue to \nallow corporations to get away with these abuses? We have investigated \nEnron's tax shelters activities, but we have done nothing. We have done \nnothing in those circumstances.\n  We must make the growing number of uninsured in our country a \npriority. It is clear working families are not getting the health care \nthey need. No one can argue with that point. I challenge any one of my \ncolleagues. If they are not hearing the same concerns in their offices, \nI would be surprised.\n  There are a number of bipartisan proposals introduced in the Senate \nto address the high number of uninsured. Let's come together and do \nsomething good for the hard-working folks in this country who cannot \nafford health insurance, those who cannot get access to the most basic \nof preventive medicine. Congress needs to address this issue.\n  The high cost of health care in the United States is giving other \ndeveloped countries an advantage in keeping and attracting jobs. If we \nwant to talk about losing jobs, look at one of the highest costs to \nindustry and to small businesses. It is providing quality health care \nand health insurance that is going to allow them to keep those workers \nand provide them what they need to be good workers and good family \nmembers.\n\n  For each car they build, DaimlerChrysler AG pays out $1,300 in \nemployee health care costs. When they make that car in Canada, they pay \nhardly anything. They depend on a government program to provide that \nhealth care. That is why the big three automakers actually lobbied the \nCanadian Government to maintain their national health care system. If \nwe want to keep jobs in America, let's make it worth their while. Let's \nmake their quality of life comparable in those instances.\n  At a time when jobs are leaving our country, at a time when health \ninsurance premiums are rising by leaps and bounds and working families \nare losing their jobs and what health insurance they may have, Congress \nmust do something.\n  I do not claim my amendment will address every health care need in \nour Nation. Some want to do more, and some think we should do less. I \nbelieve my amendment is a balanced, commonsense approach that will \nadvance this important cause in a meaningful way. I ask my colleagues \nfor their support.\n  We cannot assume people are getting the health care they need, \nbecause they are not. All we have to do is listen to corporate America, \nlisten to small business, listen to our health care providers, most \nimportantly, listen to our constituents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, we cannot continue to turn a blind eye. \nLet's get it done. I urge all Senators to vote for my amendment and \nvote on behalf of quality health care for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am a cosponsor on this amendment, and I ask for 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be glad to yield 2 minutes off the resolution on \nthis amendment to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Might I ask the chairman if we could get a time agreement on this \namendment so we can get that amendment sent to the desk. We will try to \nkeep this queue as orderly as possible.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent that the debate on the Lincoln \namendment be limited to 20 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I yield 2 minutes off the resolution \nto the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I congratulate and commend the \nSenator from Arkansas. She is basically challenging the Senate, saying \nthat when we are considering a $2.4 trillion budget we ought to make a \ncommitment in this budget to a downpayment on health insurance for \nworking Americans. Eighty percent of those who do not have health \ninsurance are from working families. Working families play by the \nrules, work hard, provide for their children, and they are effectively \nwithout this coverage.\n  In the past, the Budget Committee has had a reserve fund that has \nbeen funded on this. In the last budget, $50 billion came out of \nconference for health insurance. It was $89 billion the year before, \nbut it is zero effectively in this budget.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is reminding us of our responsibility. The \nproblem has not gotten less; it has gotten worse, and she is \nchallenging this body to meet its responsibilities, to say to the 43 \nmillion Americans, including\n\n[[Page S2626]]\n\nthe children who are out there, we are committed to making a \ndownpayment. We are not going to have all the answers but we insist, as \na matter of national priority, that we give focus and attention to the \nuninsured. That is what the Lincoln amendment is all about.\n  Goodness knows, of the 43 million Americans, there is not a single \nMember of the Senate who does not have health insurance. There is not a \nsingle Member of the House of Representatives who does not have health \ninsurance. Let's meet our responsibility and begin to treat our fellow \nAmericans the way we treat ourselves.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendment, and I send my amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Mr. \n     Daschle, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Pryor, \n     Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2803.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide $60 billion over five years for greater health \nsecurity for working Americans and their families through a combination \n  of public and private efforts to expand quality, affordable health \ninsurance coverage and cut health care costs by eliminating abusive tax \n                               loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 12, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 12, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 13, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 16, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 17, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 20, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 21, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 24, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 25, increase the amount by \n     $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 3, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 4, increase the amount by $12,000,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have great respect and esteem for my \nneighbor from Arkansas, but this is an amendment that would increase \ntaxes by $60 billion. I think we want to send out a clarion call to \ntaxpayers: Look out. Our good friends on the Democrat side of the aisle \nare after you. They are coming. They are coming after your pocketbooks.\n  We just considered an amendment from our colleague from Iowa for $39 \nbillion. The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, offered an amendment \nfor $24 billion, and there are a lot of other tax increases in a lot of \nother amendments that I guess we will discuss. The $60 billion tax \nincrease that Senator Lincoln is offering proposes to close loopholes.\n  My colleague from Arkansas is on the Finance Committee. We mark up \ntax bills all the time. The Senator should introduce her amendment to \nclose the loopholes. As soon as I found out about the leasing \nprovision, I started talking about we need to repeal it.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee put that in the FSC/ETI bill. \nWe had that bill on the Senate floor, and it will be back in a week. We \ncan make that law. There are other loopholes that need to be closed, \nmany of which the chairman of the Finance Committee has in that bill, \nsupported by Senator Grassley and Senator Baucus and many of us on the \ncommittee, most of those in a very bipartisan way.\n  Now a lot of that is used to pay for the JOBS bill that Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus are trying to pass. The idea of being able \nto lower manufacturing rates, and so on, there are a lot of these \n``loopholes.'' If my colleague has more loopholes, let's talk about \nthem.\n  I asked the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Snow, if he has some \nideas about some loopholes that need to be closed to give me a list. I \nlike to close loopholes. I do not like it when there are real \ninequities and there are people cheating who are not paying their fair \nshare. There are a lot of unreported taxes, for example. So I am \nwilling to do it, but this amendment just basically increases taxes.\n  We can suggest closing loopholes but this raises taxes. In the first \nyear, it raises $12 billion in taxes. It just so happens in the first \nyear we are assuming continuation of present law and that will cost us \n$12 billion. In other words, we continue present law for primarily low- \nand middle-income people, and that will be $12 billion. So this will \ntotally offset that.\n  The net result, if these two amendments are put together, the budget \nresolution and this amendment, it will say zero tax relief in 2005; \ni.e., it will say a tax increase for every family in America, for every \ncouple in America, for everybody who has a child in America. That is \nwhat this amendment is.\n  I want taxpayers to look out. There are a lot of people looking after \nyour checkbook and they are looking to get in your checkbook. Some of \nus are not going to let that happen. I urge our colleagues to vote no \non the amendment at the appropriate time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we lay aside the Lincoln amendment and \nnow take up consideration of the amendment of Senator Byrd and that the \namendment have 40 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2804\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2804.\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the Senate has an obligation to approve a \nbudget resolution that addresses the massive deficits and debt that now \nlie before us. Such a balanced resolution should rely on responsible \nrestraint, on all three elements of the budget: revenues, mandatory \nspending, and discretionary spending.\n  The Senate has an obligation to approve a budget resolution that will \npermit the Congress to enact 13 fiscally responsible appropriations \nbills. This budget resolution utterly fails to meet those tests. \nInstead, the resolution puts the Congress on a course toward long-term \ndeficits, higher debt, and an appropriations process that will \ninevitably produce gimmicks and delays.\n  The budget resolution puts us on a course that will prevent us from \nmeeting the needs of the Nation. Rather than confront record deficits \nwith responsible limits on mandatory and discretionary spending and \nreassessment of the revenue losses produced by the tax cut legislation \nof 2001 and 2003, the Budget Committee produced a myopic budget \nresolution that pretends to address the deficits with ridiculously low \nlimits on domestic discretionary spending.\n  It is not the spending side of the budget that has put the Federal \nbudget back into the deficit ditch. Rather than restoring some sanity \nto our revenue base, the budget resolution that is before us includes \n$144 billion in new tax cuts. According to the House Budget Committee, \nthe tax cuts enacted since 2001 have or will increase our deficits by \n$2.6 trillion for the period from 2001 to 2013.\n  According to the Office of Management and Budget, taxes in 2004 are, \nas a percentage of gross domestic product, the lowest they have been \nsince 1950. Every year, the IRS fails to collect hundreds of billions \nof dollars from delinquent taxpayers and corporations. In 2001, IRS \ndata showed $49 billion in lost revenues from delinquent employment \ntaxes, penalties, and interest owed to the Federal Government. The \nJoint Tax Committee estimates that the cost of tax preferences \nincreased by twice the rate of spending during the last 10 years, from \n$488 billion a year to $730 billion a year, and none of it--none--is \nrequired to be reviewed annually by the Congress.\n  Yet there is nothing in the budget resolution to increase tax \nenforcement or to close tax loopholes. Instead, this budget resolution \nheaps more tax cuts on top of the huge back-loaded tax cuts already \nenacted. This budget resolution pretends to reduce deficits by focusing \ncuts on one very small piece of the budget pie, domestic discretionary \nspending. Unlike the Tax Code or mandatory programs, discretionary \nspending is the only piece of the Federal budget required to be \nreviewed every year by the Congress, and it is the only part of the \nbudget that is squeezed routinely for savings, even though there is an \nabundance of potential savings from excesses in the other areas of the \nbudget.\n  Here are the facts. Domestic discretionary spending comprises less \nthan 17 percent of the Federal budget. No one should believe cutting \ndomestic discretionary spending by itself can produce balanced budgets.\n  I remind Senators that according to the White House's own budget \ndocuments, if we were to eliminate every penny of nondefense spending \nin fiscal year 2004, we would still run a deficit of $65 billion.\n  The mathematics in this resolution just do not work. The budget \nresolution cuts discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2005 by \n$1.9 billion and outlays by $12.1 billion below the request of the \nPresident. For nondefense, non-homeland security programs, the \nresolution cuts budget authority for fiscal year 2005 by $11.2 billion \nbelow the level necessary to keep pace with inflation. Outlays for \nnondefense programs face even deeper, unsustainable cuts; that is, \n$11.2 billion in cuts in education, health care, veterans medical care, \njob training, transportation, and other critical priorities. Such cuts \ndo not have the support of the American people or their Representatives \nin Congress.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee called upon \nthe House Budget Committee to increase veterans spending by $2.4 \nbillion. Recently, the Senate passed a bill increasing funding above \nthe President's request for highway and mass transit programs. The \nSenate Finance Committee has requested more funds for tax enforcement. \nThe Senate Small Business Committee called for increases in small \nbusiness loans. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee called for \nincreases for the Coast Guard. None of these increases are included in \nthis resolution. Yet we engage in this charade, framed by the Bush \nadministration, about how discretionary spending is bloated and how \nfunding cuts are the absolute one and only way to reduce the deficit.\n  Under the President's budget, by 2009, education and training \nprograms will be cut 7 percent below levels necessary to keep pace with \ninflation. Environmental programs will be cut by 20 percent, law \nenforcement programs by 16 percent, veterans medical care by 17 \npercent. The President tells us that we are in the midst of an energy \ncrisis, but his budget cuts energy programs by 27 percent in 2009.\n\n  Remember No Child Left Behind? In 2009, the title I program will be \ncut by $260 million below levels approved for 2004, adjusted for \ninflation. Overall, domestic programs would be cut by 12 percent in \n2009.\n  Does this budget resolution restore those cuts? No. No. No. Instead, \nthis budget makes it next to impossible for the Federal Government to \nmeet its obligations to children, to seniors, and to veterans. It digs \na deep hole for funding education; a deep hole for funding health care; \na deep hole for funding environmental programs, such as clean and safe \ndrinking water. This budget puts the President's political priorities\n\n[[Page S2628]]\n\nfirst and it puts the American people last. This budget resolution will \nforce cuts to domestic discretionary programs by almost $1 billion \nbelow the President's totally inadequate request for fiscal year 2005. \nIt is a slash-and-burn program. Ignore the consequences. We must cut, \ncut, cut.\n  The resolution is $11.2 billion below the amount necessary to keep \npace with inflation. During the next 5 years, the budget resolution \ncuts domestic programs such as veterans, education, and transportation \nby $107 billion below the amount necessary to keep pace with inflation.\n  What is going on here?\n  This Nation is suffering from neglect--neglect. Our schools are \nbreaking apart; our health care system is in disarray; Social Security \nand Medicare face bankruptcy; America's veterans have to wait for weeks \nupon weeks for basic medical care; our homeland security network is \nriddled with massive gaps. Even though terrorists struck our Nation \n2\\1/2\\ years ago, this very day protections at home are little improved \nfrom that fateful day.\n  Why? Why do we face such major crises in so many critical areas? The \nanswer is simple. The Bush White House and this Congress have failed to \nlive up to the promises made to the American people.\n  Today, the President is scheduled to participate in the \ngroundbreaking for the 9/11 memorial in New York City. It was 2\\1/2\\ \nyears ago today that those planes struck the two towers, the Pentagon, \nand the field in Pennsylvania. But are we safer? Hardly. The security \nof this Nation is on thin ice. The Bush administration has held back \nsupport for critical investments in homeland security, in police \nofficers, in firefighters, in border, airport and seaport security. As \na result of this White House's foot dragging, America is woefully \nunprepared to prevent or respond to another terrorist attack.\n  Police officers, firefighters, and paramedics throughout this country \nhave sent a clear message to this Capitol; namely, they need more \nFederal help to best do their job. Law enforcement grants are proposed \nto be cut by $1 billion.\n  The President, in his budget, puts first responders last in line for \nFederal funding. The President's budget proposes to cut grants that \nequip and train police, fire, and emergency medical services personnel \nby $733 million. Fire grants alone are to be reduced by 33 percent.\n\n  These cuts come despite continued warnings--from think tanks, from \ncommissions, and from first responders themselves--that our Nation is \nnot adequately prepared to respond to another act of terrorism.\n  Congress has a responsibility to protect the Nation. It must focus on \nthe country's many serious vulnerabilities and invest dollars where \nthey are most needed. But it seems as though the only time this \nCongress is willing to increase funding is for our defense forces \noverseas. Defenses here at home are left to scramble and scrape.\n  My amendment would increase the levels of the 2-year caps on \ndiscretionary spending contained in the resolution to sustainable \nlevels. These levels would allow Congress to responsibly move forward \non the appropriations process.\n  This amendment provides sufficient resources, including $11.2 billion \nin fiscal year 2005 and $7.4 billion in fiscal year 2006 to make sure \nthat the level of activity for domestic programs that the Congress \napproved and the President signed into law for 2004, can be maintained \nin 2005 and 2006, after adjusting for inflation.\n  We will hear during the debate that spending is out of control. It \nreally is not. We have seen an increase in the 3 years since President \nBush took office, but what programs have received those increases? The \nincreases have been for defense, homeland security, and the response to \nthe September 11 attack. In fact, 91 percent of the spending increases \nsince 2001 have been in those three categories. According to staff \nanalysis, increases for domestic programs, excluding homeland security, \nhave barely kept pace with inflation over the last 2 years.\n  If you think the Congress should restore the President's proposed \ncuts of $1 billion in State and local law enforcement grants, you \nshould be for this amendment. If you voted for the Senate highway bill, \nyou should be for this amendment. If you think that veterans should not \nhave to pay special charges and membership fees for health care, if you \nthink that veterans already paid their dues at Iwo Jima, Pork Chop \nHill, and the Mekong Delta, then you should be for this amendment.\n  Anyone who wants to characterize this amendment as excessive spending \nis not paying attention to the needs of their constituents. Nor are \nthey paying attention to the bottom line. This amendment would reduce \nthe deficits below the levels assumed in the budget resolution. The \namendment assumes additional revenues from the elimination of waste in \ntax expenditures, through increased tax enforcement and compliance, and \nthrough the partial repeal of the excessive tax cuts for the wealthiest \nAmericans enacted in recent years.\n  This Senate must not continue to tell the American people that we are \nenacting legislation to better educate our children and to provide \nadequate care for military veterans--- those men and women who are \nenduring service in the powder keg called Iraq and will need care--\nbecause we are not providing the money. We do not pay for our promises \nand that is nothing short of flim-flam and fraud pulled on the American \npeople. To starve basic domestic needs and feed the country only feel-\ngood rhetoric is the worst kind of posturing. Let us stop misleading \nthe taxpayer and deliver what we promise.\n  This amendment is balanced. It is fair. It is responsible. We should \nnot ignore the needs of our constituents. I urge the adoption of my \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to again send a message out to our \ncolleagues just as strongly and as clearly as I can. We are very close, \nI believe, to having presented our major amendments. I believe very \nstrongly that this year less is more. I hope colleagues will refrain \nfrom offering additional amendments unless they are just \nextraordinarily important and they are able to convince the managers \nand the leadership they simply must be offered.\n  We are now on the fourth day of deliberations on the budget \nresolution. We have had an opportunity to debate this in a full and \nvirtually complete way. We are on the brink of having been able to \ncomplete the offering of all our major priority amendments.\n  I am asking my colleagues, please refrain from offering additional \namendments. I hope very much we will have a meeting on our side to \ndiscuss how we proceed from this point.\n  I thank all of our colleagues who have debated. I thank all of our \ncolleagues who have offered these key amendments. I want to especially \nthank Senator Byrd for his courtesy and his willingness to accept the \nlimitation on time.\n  The next Member in our order is Senator Lieberman.\n  I see the chairman has returned.\n  Again, I am asking all of our colleagues who have pending amendments \non our side, please review them with a fine-tooth comb. Unless they are \nabsolutely essential, I ask you, I urge you not to offer the amendment. \nAnd for the first time I have ever done this on a budget resolution, I \nam very close to the point where I will begin opposing amendments \nbecause I feel so strongly we should not offer substantially more \namendments than we already have. I am very close to the point of taking \nthe position that I will oppose amendments. We have had a good \nopportunity to debate. We have had a good opportunity to consider major \namendments. We can have some additional high priority amendments. But \n50 additional amendments, no. That is not reasonable. It is not fair to \nour colleagues. Please, let us show some restraint.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to echo everything my colleague \nfrom North Dakota said.\n  I know I have complained to Senator Byrd in the past about \ndeliberations on the budget process. I said I dislike vote-aramas. In \nthe past, management of budget bills has many times stacked the votes. \nWell, there won't be any votes and people would have long debates, and, \ntherefore, not really consider very many amendments until late\n\n[[Page S2629]]\n\nThursday night. We haven't done that, frankly in large part because of \nmy relationship and respect for Senator Conrad. We said we wanted to \navoid the vote-arama. Last year was probably the worst vote-arama in \nSenate history. To me, it is very demeaning to the Senate. We cast 51 \nrollcall votes, most of which were jammed together, most of which had 1 \nminute of debate each, and no one knew what they were voting on. It was \nnot a pretty picture. It wasn't good for the Senate. I want to do what \nis right for the Senate. I have heard Senator Byrd say that. I happen \nto agree with him.\n  I appreciate his amendment. I don't support his amendment, but I \nappreciate it. It is a substantive amendment. As Senator Conrad said, \nwe are willing to take substantive amendments and debate them and \ndiscuss them and give Members ample time to consider them. But we do \nnot need to have repetitive amendments. We do not need to have endless \namendments. We do not need to have sense of the Senates. And we do not \nneed to have people staying here until 1 o'clock in the morning voting, \nwhere they are like zombies and don't really recognize what they are \nvoting on.\n\n  I want to make a couple comments on the amendment before the Senate \nright now, the amendment by my colleague and friend, Senator Byrd. This \namendment would increase taxes by $24.5 billion. It increases spending \nby about $18 billion. I urge our colleagues to defeat it.\n  We have had a lot of amendments that will increase taxes and increase \nspending. We are going to be voting on that several times--maybe even \nmore times. I hope we don't continue voting on it. I think people are \nmaking their points. I understand a lot of people want to tax more and \nspend more. That is understood. I do not know how many times we would \nhave to vote on it.\n  The tax assumption we have in the bill before us for 2005 is $12.3 \nbillion in tax reduction. But in reality we are assuming present law \nwill be extended. If you extend present law--no tax cut, but basically \nextend present law--that costs us about $12.3 billion.\n  This bill increases taxes by about $11.2 billion. In other words, you \ncould not extend present law. It nets out. It would tell the Finance \nCommittee, don't do it. The net result would be a lot of families in \nOklahoma and in other places around the country--if they have four \nkids, it would be a tax increase of $2,200, if they have taxable income \nof $58,000. These are not necessarily wealthy individuals.\n  I know the top line of this says: We want to reduce tax breaks for \nthe upper 1 percent. I urge colleagues, if you know of some tax breaks \nthat need to be closed, Chairman Grassley is going to have a bill on \nthe floor when we return from this recess week after next. Offer those \namendments to close the tax breaks, and if they are legitimate, I may \nwell support you. That is the time to do it. But I think a lot of these \nso-called closing tax breaks are not there or Senator Grassley and \nSenator Baucus already have them in their bill or they are planning on \nputting them in the bill. I am all for closing them. And I could \nmention other provisions. I am for closing them. But let's do it on the \ntax bill.\n  This is basically saying, let's have a tax increase of $24 billion \nand increasing spending by $18 billion.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, the chairman, \nSenator Bingaman is in the Chamber. He would be willing to take 5 \nminutes to describe an amendment, and I am wondering if we could give \nhim that time. My intention would be to give him 5 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  I would ask him, because we have just given the amendment to the \nother side, not to send his amendment to the desk at this moment but to \ndescribe it. I would give him 5 minutes off the resolution. If the \nSenator needs more time, I would add time. We need unanimous consent to \nallow him to speak on his amendment without sending it to the desk and \nset aside Senator Byrd's amendment for the moment.\n  I ask the Senator, would that be acceptable?\n  Mr. BYRD. When may I briefly respond to Mr. Nickles?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator prefer to do that at this moment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Just briefly, if I may.\n  Mr. CONRAD. An entirely reasonable request.\n  Thank you, I say to Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may resume and take a bit more of my \ntime.\n  It is not spending that has put us back into the deficit ditch. \nSpending for 2005 is estimated to be about 20 percent of the gross \ndomestic product. That is significantly less than during the Reagan \nadministration or during the administration of President Bush's father. \nOn the other hand, revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product \nare the lowest since 1950.\n  This amendment produces just enough spending to cover the levels \napproved by this Congress and signed by the President for fiscal year \n2004, adjusted for inflation. This is a disciplined amendment that sets \nreasonable limits. This amendment is not about increasing taxes.\n  In July 2003, at a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on waste, \nfraud, and improved uses for taxpayer funds, GAO Comptroller David \nWalker testified that tax compliance and collection activity declines \nare a ``high risk'' concern for the GAO.\n  As of September 2001, IRS data showed that employers owed $49 billion \nin delinquent taxes. IRS and Federal payment records indicate that 1 \nmillion taxpayers owed about $26 billion in delinquent taxes as of \nFebruary 2002 and were still receiving some type of Federal payment.\n  Our own budget chairman, at a hearing this year with Treasury \nSecretary Snow, expressed his concerns about tax compliance and its \neffect on the revenue side of the budget.\n  The Senate should at least make some effort to ensure we are \nenforcing our current tax laws and that delinquent taxpayers are paying \ntheir fair share before we cut education, health care, and veterans \nprograms for citizens who actually pay their taxes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I now yield to Senator Lautenberg for the \npurpose of sending forward his amendment that we earlier discussed I \nwill give him a minute off the resolution to send his amendment to the \ndesk, and then go to Senator Bingaman for 5 minutes to discuss his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I reserved time for the Senator from \nOklahoma to speak on the amendment. He has not done that, so I will \ncontinue to reserve 7 minutes for my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2765\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Conrad, \nfor yielding me some time to describe an amendment I intend to offer \nand would like to have the Senate consider and vote on.\n  This is an amendment which can be best summarized by reading it. It \nis only a sentence long. And it says:\n\n       It shall not be in order in the Senate to consider a bill, \n     amendment, motion, joint resolution, or conference report \n     that increases the number of taxpayers affected by the \n     alternative minimum tax, except for a measure that extends \n     expiring provisions relating to the child tax credit, the 10-\n     percent tax bracket, and the marriage penalty.\n\n  Mr. President, this is what I would call a first-things-first \namendment. I heard the President, in his State of the Union speech--and \nwe have all heard him on numerous occasions--talk about how we need to \nmake permanent the tax cuts.\n  We had a hearing in the Finance Committee where Secretary Snow, our \nSecretary of the Treasury, came in and said: We need to make permanent \nour tax cuts. And my question to him was: What about this looming \nproblem that we all know about, which is called the alternative minimum \ntax?\n  Now, the alternative minimum tax was put in place with the idea that \nvery wealthy individuals should not be able to avoid all taxes. If they \ncalculate their taxes and they figure out some way to determine they do \nnot owe anything, then they have to also calculate on the basis of the \nalternative minimum tax and at least pay that amount.\n  That was the idea behind it. Unfortunately, with the changes we made \nin the tax law and with the changes in the economy and the tax \nstructure, we are now to a circumstance where we are beginning to see \nmore and more people affected by the alternative minimum tax. If we \nwere to do what the President has urged--that is, make all these tax \ncuts permanent--then the number of people who are adversely affected by \nhaving to calculate their tax pursuant to the alternative minimum tax \nwould go up very dramatically. Instead of it affecting a couple million \npeople, we are talking about it affecting 30 million people by the year \n2012.\n  My amendment says, let's do first things first. Let's figure out how \nto resolve this problem of the alternative minimum tax, and let's not \nbe bringing bills to the floor and passing legislation unless we have \n60 votes in the Senate in favor of it. Let's not be passing legislation \nto worsen the situation and to require more and more Americans to fall \nunder these provisions of the alternative minimum tax. To me, it is a \nstraightforward, commonsense thing to do.\n  I asked Secretary Snow in this same hearing: How much is it going to \ncost to fix the problem?\n  His answer was: We don't know. We are working on that.\n  I said: When are you going to know?\n  Well, we are going to know maybe a year from now.\n  That is not an acceptable answer for the Senate or for the Congress \nor for the American people. We should not be making permanent tax cuts \nand further cutting taxes unless we know the extent of the revenue loss \nthat is involved in fixing this alternative minimum tax problem.\n  All this does is set up a point of order. It says, if you are going \nto bring a bill to the floor that adds more Americans to this roster of \npeople who have to calculate and pay their tax pursuant to the \nalternative minimum tax, then you have to get 60 Senators to agree to \npass that bill or else it does not pass.\n  It is a very constructive proposal. It is one that would strengthen \nthis budget resolution substantially. I hope all Members will support \nthe amendment when the time comes for me to offer it.\n  I am advised by my colleague, Senator Conrad, this is not the \nappropriate time. Therefore, I will not send the amendment to the desk. \nAgain, I appreciate the chance to explain the amendment so my \ncolleagues will know what is involved. As I say, I hope we can get a \nvery strong bipartisan vote in favor of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I advise the Senator, we have now had a chance to \nshow the amendment to the other side. If the Senator would like at this \nmoment to send his amendment to the desk, that would be appropriate.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, if our colleague would decide not to send \nhis amendment to the desk, I would be much more favorably inclined to \ndiscuss it.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this is the kind of good government \namendment that I was counting on my colleague from Oklahoma supporting. \nI am sure the more he studies it, the more merit he will see in the \namendment. I will be glad to send it to the desk at this point, if now \nis the correct time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. To further inform my colleague, I believe a budget point \nof order lies against the amendment. I don't know that will change his \ndesire about whether to send it to the desk, but I am fairly certain \nthat a budget point of order does lie against it. I would urge you to \nconsider maybe keeping it at a good verbal discussion but not sending \nit to the desk. But you certainly have that right to do so.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to my colleague from \nOklahoma, I would certainly want to send it to the desk and have the \nopportunity to call it up for a vote at the appropriate time, if that \nis appropriate at this time. I do send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2765.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, last week we observed the first \nanniversary of the Department of Homeland Security, the largest \nreorganization of the Federal Government in almost a half century. With \nthat anniversary came a round of reflection on the status of our \nhomeland defenses. There was general agreement on the verdict. Yes, we \nare stronger and safer at home, thanks to the creation of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and other steps that we have taken \nsince September 11, 2001. But no, we are not nearly as safe as we \nshould be. We are not as safe as we should be because this \nadministration has not given homeland security the focused leadership \nand resources that it demands.\n  The Gilmore commission, led by former Virginia Governor James \nGilmore, a distinguished Republican leader, recently warned of \ncomplacency about the terrorist threat and decried the lack of a clear \nstrategy to bring about improved security. Other expert panels, one of \nthem convened and led by former colleagues Warren Rudman and Gary Hart, \ncalled the Nation ``still unprepared'' to respond to another September \n11 attack and said that our first responders were ``drastically \nunderfunded.''\n  Homeland security will not come cheap. On first responders alone, one \nof the expert panels I described told us they believe it would take $98 \nbillion over 5 years to bring our defenses at home up to where they \nneed to be. Yet the administration proposes a stunning 30-percent cut \nin resources for firefighters, police officers, and emergency medical \npersonnel.\n  The President's budget for fiscal year 2005 fails to acknowledge, \nmuch less address adequately, the new threats we face as a nation, \nshortchanging the homeland side of our war on terrorism.\n  That is why I rise today to offer this amendment that would add $6.8 \nbillion to the administration's homeland security budget.\n  Let me describe where the money would go: $4.4 billion of that amount \nwould go toward helping our first responders, the firefighters, the \npolice officers, the emergency medical personnel, the hundreds of \nthousands of people who every day go to work, put on a uniform to serve \nnot only as first responders but really, if we use them well, as first \npreventers of terrorist attacks. I also propose $900 million in \nadditional resources for port and container security, widely \nacknowledged as a continuing vulnerability to terrorists who will \nstrike always where we are undefended, and our ports and containers are \ntoo greatly undefended.\n  I am calling here for $500 million to better prepare for the threat \nof bioterrorism, which recent intelligence reports say continues to be \na focus of the terrorist groups around the world. I am asking for $500 \nmillion for additional border personnel as well as for needed equipment \nand technology for border security, so we will not see a repeat of the \nterrorists who came into America to carry out the evil deeds of \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  I am asking for $\\1/2\\ billion to make further advances on aviation \nsecurity and for greater protection of other modes of transportation--\nrail, bus, mass transit--that remain too unprotected. About $2.5 \nbillion of this amendment is needed just to restore cuts that the \nadministration's budget makes in some of these homeland security \nfunctions from fiscal year 2004 spending.\n  For example, in this amendment we restore the administration's $1 \nbillion cut to the State homeland security grant program, the main \nsource of assistance to State and local governments and first \nresponders, an unacceptable cut. The amendment also would restore more \nthan $1 billion in cuts to proven first responder programs in the \nJustice Department: the local law enforcement block grant, the Edward \nByrne Memorial grant program, and the Community Oriented Policing \nServices Program, widely and appreciatively known as COPS.\n\n[[Page S2632]]\n\n  If someone asked whether we have been safer since September 11 from \nanother attack, I just say: Thank God, we have been safe. But this is \nnot an overreaction.\n  Mr. Tenet testified before the Armed Services Committee the other day \nand he said that al-Qaida and more than two dozen other terrorist \ngroups around the world are still in eager pursuit of chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and nuclear weapons. Their No. 1 goal--not \ntheir only goal--is to carry out another ``spectacular attack'' on the \nUnited States. Those are the terms they use, ``spectacular attack,'' \nwhich they are convinced will break our will and certainly disrupt our \neconomy.\n  We cannot let that happen. We must defend our homeland and protect \nour infrastructure and our people where we are vulnerable, through the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, with the kinds of funds that are \nauthorized and appropriated in this amendment.\n  We have a long way to go before we fulfill the promise each of us has \nmade that our Federal Government would adequately secure the American \npeople when they are at home. We have to approach this profound \nresponsibility with the same unity, the same resolve, and the same \nresources we have brought to the war on terror overseas. That is why I \nhave introduced this amendment and asked for my colleagues' support.\n  Allow me to lay out, more specifically, what this amendment would do \nand why it is so necessary.\n  I am advocating $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2005--above the \nPresident's request to help ensure that first responders have the \nequipment, training, and other resources they need to prevent, prepare \nfor and if necessary respond to acts of terrorism.\n  We all remember the heroic role police, firefighters and other first \nresponders played on 9/11, as our Nation responded to the horrific \nattacks of that day and braced for untold sequels that might be soon to \nfollow. Less visible is the role many of these officials also play in \nattempting to prevent acts of terrorism here at home: State and local \npolice are the eyes and ears of the community that may first detect a \nterrorist plot on U.S. soil or intercept a terrorist before he or she \ncan strike. We owe these front line homeland security troops more than \nour admiration we owe them our full financial support.\n  Yet a distinguished panel convened by the Council on Foreign \nRelations found these first responders wanting for the tools they must \nhave to confront a terrorist attack: firefighters without their own \nradios or breathing equipment; police departments without protective \ngear to respond to an attack with a chemical, biological or \nradiological agent; and nearly all without interoperable communications \nequipment. This is unacceptable and must be changed.\n  Let's start with the work that must be done just to undo the harmful \ncuts sought by the administration. First, my proposal will restore the \nadministration's drastic $1 billion cut to the State Homeland Security \nGrant Program, which is the main source of assistance to state and \nlocal governments and first responders for emergency planning, \nequipment, training, exercises, mutual aid agreements, and other \npreparedness activities. There is bipartisan support for restoring \nthese cuts, reflecting the reality that all states face certain \nhomeland funding needs and need a steady, predictable source of money--\nas this program provides--to plan wisely.\n  My amendment will also restore more than $1 billion in cuts to key \nfirst responder programs in the Justice Department: the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant (LLEBG), the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant \nProgram (BYRNE), and the Community Oriented Policing Services Program \n(COPs). These programs provide vital aid to help communities hire more \npolice officers and equip them with the tools they need. Funding levels \nfor these three programs have declined more than $1.8 billion since \nfiscal year 2002, representing a dangerous and unwise reduction at a \ntime when the threat from terrorism, but also domestic crime, has \nclearly increased.\n  The amendment would also provide $400 million to restore a 33 percent \ncut in the vital Fire Act program, which provides direct support to \nthousands of fire departments around the country, and to bring it to \nfull funding. And it restores a $9 million cut to the Emergency \nManagement Planning Grants program, which supports the capacity of \nstate and local governments to respond to emergencies of all kinds.\n  All of these programs are integral to the strength of our first \nresponders and it is incomprehensible that we would cut them at a time \nthe terrorist threat remains high. But we must do more than just hold \nthe line we need to dramatically improve our homeland defenses in our \ncommunities.\n  My proposal would provide $1 billion in new funding to be dedicated \nto helping first responders obtain interoperable communications \nequipment so they can ``talk to one another'' when responding to \nevents. The lack of communications interoperability has received \nsubstantial attention since the September 11, 2001 attacks revealed \nmajor problems with communication between police and fire fighters at \nthe World Trade Center in New York. But the problem is hardly unique to \nNew York. Federal officials involved with this issue report that at \nbest--only 14 States have communications equipment that allows public \nsafety agencies to talk to each other during a terrorist attack or \nother emergency. The price tag for fixing the problem nationwide has \nbeen estimated as high as $18 billion, and the lead Federal official on \nthis issue has stated that, at the present rate, it will take 20 years \nto achieve full interoperability in our country. This is much too long.\n  Yet, the President's 2005 budget actually takes a step backwards by \neliminating relatively small grant programs at FEMA that were dedicated \nto interoperability. Instead, funding for interoperability must now \ncompete with funds for protective gear, training, exercises, and other \nequipment. My proposal would dedicate $1 billion specifically for \ninteroperability to provide a significant lift to States' efforts to \novercome a critical obstacle facing emergency responders across \nAmerica. In addition to equipment, this would include funding necessary \nfor planning, evaluation, deployment, and training on the use of modern \ninteroperable communications.\n  Another $1 billion in this amendment would go to fully fund the SAFER \nAct, staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response, that is \nnecessary to hire 10,000 additional fire fighters. According to the \nInternational Association of Fire Fighters, the shortage of fire \nfighters has reached crisis proportions. Two-thirds of all fire \ndepartments do not have adequate staffing, falling below the accepted \nindustry standards developed by the National Fire Protection \nAssociation and, more to the point, putting those firefighters who are \non the job in danger. The SAFER Act, which Congress finally passed last \nyear due to the outstanding leadership of my colleague Senator Dodd, \nauthorizes $7.6 billion in grants over 7 years to career, volunteer, \nand combination fire departments hire new firefighters. At a time when \nbudget cuts have forced some local jurisdictions to actually reduce the \nnumber of first responders, this funding is necessary to help protect \nfirefighters and to provide the emergency response capabilities \ncommunities want and expect.\n\n  Virtually every expert analysis of terrorist threats to the United \nStates focuses on the critical issue of port security. Small wonder--\nmillions of containers arrive at U.S. ports each year, coming from all \nparts of the globe and subject to only limited, if any, inspection. The \nports are at once a tempting portal into the U.S. for dangerous cargo, \nand a vital economic conduit that--if shuttered due to a terrorist \nassault--could cause devastating disruption of the Nation's economic \nlife's blood. Earlier this year, the FBI testified that terrorist \norganizations are looking ``for any holes in the port security system \nto exploit.'' Yet in the face of such risk, the administration proposes \nto cut spending on port security grants and eliminate Operation Safe \nCommerce, an innovative program to improve the security of container \ntraffic into this country. In addition, the President's budget puts \nCoast Guard fleet and equipment modernization on a slow boat--at the \nadministration's pace, the Deepwater modernization program will take 22 \nyears. A 22-year modernization is practically an oxymoron.\n  My amendment would provide $900 million in additional resources for \nport\n\n[[Page S2633]]\n\nand container security. About half of that would go to restore \nOperation Safe Commerce and to improve physical security at our ports. \nBring port security grants--at only a suggested $46 million in the \nPresident's budget--to $500 million. The Coast Guard has estimated it \nwill cost $7.5 billion--and $1.5 billion this year--just to provide all \nports with minimum security measures and implement the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act. The grants help finance measures such as \nfencing and surveillance to better secure the ports and--with them--our \nvital trade links. Operations Safe Commerce has explored new \ntechnologies to track container traffic and can provide a valuable \nthink tank for new approaches to secure their travel into our country.\n  The rest of the money would go to accelerating the Deepwater program, \na 22-year Coast Guard fleet modernization program. Since 9/11, we have \nturned to the Coast Guard again and again for a growing roster of \nhomeland security needs--even as we expect them to continue their \noutstanding work on non-defense missions such as fisheries enforcement \nand search and rescue. Yet this outstanding agency operates with \nvirtually the oldest naval fleet in the world--39th out of 41. Senators \nfrom both parties--and even the Heritage Foundation--have called for \nmore money for Deepwater. Not only is it the right thing to do, it will \nactually save money in the long run since the longer Deepwater takes to \ncomplete, the more the Coast Guard must spend on maintenance of the \ndecaying fleet.\n  More than 2 years after the anthrax attacks demonstrated our \ncountry's vulnerability to bioterrorism, our efforts to protect the \nAmerican people against biological attacks remains disorganized and \nunderfunded. Indeed, a recent report by the Trust for Public Health \nconcluded that communities are ``only modestly better prepared'' to \nrespond to a bioterror attack than they were before 9/11. Yet here \nagain, the administration actually wants to cut spending--contradicting \nthe opinion of even its own official responsible for bioterror \npreparedness.\n  The President's budget cuts $105 million from Centers for Disease \nControl grants to help public health agencies prepare for bioterrorism, \nand another $39 million from a program to help hospitals expand their \ncapacity to treat victims of a bioterror attack. Where bioterror is \nconcerned, these health officials are our first responders and we must \ngive them support commensurate to the threat. It is true that The \nPresident would provide some new money for surveillance to detect a \nbioterror attack, but this will be of limited use if we have no \nresources to respond to an attack once we detect it. One public health \nofficial likened it to ``laying off firefighters while investing in new \nhoses and ladders.''\n  Therefore, my amendment would add $500 million for bioterror \npreparedness, to restore those cuts and significantly expand the \nhospital grant program. The health community has identified more than \n$11 billion in additional needed medical supplies, protective gear for \nstaff and other essentials to respond to a bioterror attack. At the \ncurrent pace, it would take more than 20 years before hospitals could \nprovide even basic care in the event of such an attack. We must speed \nup this effort, and my amendment would help us begin down that road. \nThe investments we make here will have the added benefit of improving \nour capacity to respond to naturally occurring diseases, such as a \nsevere flu outbreak.\n\n  Our border officials process more than 440 million visits each year, \nand police more than 7,000 miles of border with Canada and Mexico. In \nthe immediate aftermath of 9/11, Congress recognized we must spend more \nto make this system work--to facilitate lawful visitors and trade, \nwhile weeding out and halting those who pose a threat. We passed the \nPatriot Act and the Enhanced Border Security Act, both of which called \nfor significant new border personnel. But since then we have fallen \nshort--hundreds upon hundreds short--of meeting those targets. Indeed \none of the only targets that was met--posting 1,000 Border Patrol \nagents along the Northern Border--was reportedly achieved only by \nshifting agents from the Southern Border. This is not real homeland \nsecurity.\n  My amendment would provide $500 million for additional border \npersonnel, as well as for needed equipment and technology for border \nsecurity. The needs are extensive and include portable, interoperable \ncommunications equipment, surveillance systems and fingerprint \nidentification equipment. As US VISIT--the entry/exit system mandated \nby Congress--is expanded to land ports, we will need expanded \nfacilities to process visitors. Total implementation costs for the \nprogram could reach $10 billion.\n  Border security can make a difference. The September 11th Commission \ndiscovered that one alert inspector in Miami had apparently stopped one \nof the would-be hijackers simply by conducting a probing interview at \nthe airport. But we cannot expect such high performance if critical \nhomeland defense workers such as these are overworked and poorly \nequipped.\n  We know from 9/11, and from terrorist attacks around the world, that \ntransportation networks pose a tempting target to would-be attackers. \nThis knowledge spurred Congress to create the Transportation Security \nAgency in record time. Now we must give the agency the resources to \nfulfill its mandate. My amendment would provide $500 million to make \nfurther inroads on aviation security and expand to other modes of \ntransportation, which have been largely neglected thus far.\n  Although TSA has made headway on aspects of passenger and baggage \nscreening, much work remains to close known gaps in our aviation \nsecurity. Specifically, I would direct additional funding to developing \nsystems to screen air cargo, to screen passengers for explosives, and \nto screen airport workers with access to aircraft.\n  About a quarter of all air cargo travels on passenger planes. Yet, \ndespite all the added precautions we've developed for air passengers \nand their bags, this cargo remains largely uninspected--only about 5 \npercent is screened. All-cargo jets pose a similar vulnerability. We \nmust also develop effective systems to screen cargo and implement \nshort-term solutions at once. Another vulnerability is explosives: \ncurrent passenger screening only detects metallic threats, such as guns \nor knives, not explosives. Yet we know this is not an obscure threat--\nwould-be terrorist Richard Reid was able to bring about 10 ounces of \nexplosives onto an American Airlines flight and was only stopped from \nigniting them by an alert passenger on board. There are promising \ntechnologies in this area, but we must spend money to develop them. \nFinally, many airport workers with access to aircraft and sensitive \nareas of the airport receive little scrutiny. We must do better.\n  However incomplete the work on aviation security, the federal effort \nto secure other modes of transportation has hardly begun. According to \na recent news report, we have intelligence suggesting that al-Qaida is \nlooking at derailing trains, possibly carrying hazardous material. GAO \nhas also identified vulnerabilities regarding rail shipments of \nhazardous materials, as well as protective measures that have not yet \nbeen taken. Yet despite such concerns, little has been done to assess \nthe risks to our rail system or to deploy countermeasures. Similarly, \nwe know from the deadly sarin attack on the Tokyo subway and suicide \nbombers on Israeli buses, that mass transit presents an inviting target \nto possible terrorist activity.\n  The American Public Transportation Association has identified at \nleast $6 billion in transit security needs, such as video surveillance \nand chemical and biological detection systems. But DHS has released \nonly $115 million in transit security grants thus far, and no money is \nset aside for this purpose in the President's budget.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nLieberman, to address shortfalls in homeland security funding in the \nPresident's FY05 Budget Request. As a cosponsor, I believe this \namendment would go a long way to ensuring that our homeland security is \nnot shortchanged.\n  I am disappointed that the President's budget request cuts taxes for \nthe wealthy at the expense of funding homeland security programs. Our \namendment would restore $2.5 billion in proposed budget cuts and \nincludes an additional $7 billion to strengthen\n\n[[Page S2634]]\n\nexisting programs. It would also reduce the deficit by offsetting \nspending with tax cut reductions for those earning more than $1 million \na year.\n  Our amendment takes an important step to prepare our first responders \nby restoring $1 billion for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, \nwhich provides first responders critical funding for emergency \nplanning, training, and equipment.\n  This program is crucial for all States, especially States like Hawaii \nwith smaller populations, since a portion of this funding is evenly \ndistributed among all States.\n  Our amendment also takes important steps to ensure that homeland \nsecurity funding is allocated where it is needed most. It provides $1 \nbillion in much needed funding to address first responder shortfalls \nfor interoperable communications equipment and $600 million for \nhospitals and public health agencies to respond to emergencies.\n  I am equally disappointed that the President's budget request fails \nto address the serious funding gaps for port security. In fact, the \nAmerican Association of Port Authorities has expressed great concern \nthat the President's FY05 budget contains no Federal funds to meet port \nsecurity requirements.\n  The amendment takes important steps to secure our ports and our \neconomy by providing $1 billion for port and container security and \nCoast Guard modernization. This funding is critical to Hawaii, where 98 \npercent of imported goods are transported by sea. This is not just a \nmatter of security for Hawaii or coastal States, but the security of \nour Nation.\n  According to a Council on Foreign Relations Homeland Security Task \nForce report entitled, ``America--Still Unprepared, Still in Danger,'' \nif our Nation's ports suffered a weapons of mass destruction attack, \n``the response right now would be to shut the [entire] system down at \nan enormous cost to the economies of the United States and its trade \npartners.'' The Task Force report estimates that if American ports were \nto be closed to containerized cargo for longer than three to four \nweeks, global shipping container trade would grind to a halt.\n  Our amendment also includes $500 million for aviation security, which \nwould provide for systems to screen air cargo and passengers for \nexplosives. This is an important step towards ensuring adequate funding \nfor security devices needed to detect dangerous material and to prevent \na potential crisis.\n  We must ensure that our homeland security is not shortchanged. This \nis why I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. At this time, I yield 2 minutes of the time I have \nallowed to the Senator from New York for his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Connecticut for \nhis leadership. I will be brief. In 2 minutes, one has no choice. This \nsubject could and should have a long debate. I understand the time \nconstraints.\n  We heard of the awful, terrible terrorist attack in Spain. There is \nsome debate as to whether it is ETA, the Basque separatist \norganization, or al-Qaida. Now signs are beginning to point to al-\nQaida. I am getting asked by my people whether this could happen in New \nYork, Chicago, Los Angeles, or anywhere else? The obvious answer is \nyes.\n  We are not close to doing what we should be doing on homeland \nsecurity. We are not helping our first responders, who are desperate \nfor more help in terms of their patrols and the equipment. They have \ncut out money for interoperability of radio, which we in New York City \nlearned was so important on 9/11.\n  In port security, we are wide open and we are doing very little. \nTruck security--what if they use bombs in trucks to blow up buildings, \nor railroad stations, or whatever else? Brazil is way ahead of us on \ntruck security, I hate to say. The northern border is still wide open \nand empty. Our immigration lists don't match up with our FBI lists, \nwhich is allowing terrorists to slip into this country.\n  None of this is lack of technology. This is all lack of dollars. This \nbudget talks tough on homeland security, but it doesn't do the job. The \nterrible tragedy in Spain today should remind us we are just as wide \nopen and vulnerable, but we don't have to be.\n  I salute my colleague from Connecticut on his amendment because it is \nso needed, so desperately needed. We are doing everything we can to \nfight the war on terror overseas. I have been supportive of that war. \nBut the bottom line is that we are not doing close to enough at home to \nprotect us. Money will help. If there was ever a consensus where we \nneed more dollars, it is here. We are not doing it.\n  I hope this Senate, in a bipartisan way, will rise to the occasion \nand support the amendment my friend has offered and of which I am proud \nto be a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask for an \nadditional minute of my colleague from Connecticut who has a related \nmatter.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. DODD. One minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will give a minute off the resolution to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I heard my colleague mention the tragedy \nthat occurred in Spain, with the tremendous loss of life there as a \nresult of a terrorist attack, and we don't know whether it was ETA or \nanother organization. I inform my colleagues that we drafted a \nresolution expressing our sense of outrage over these events.\n  I chair the United States-Spain Council every year and have developed \nstrong friendships with the people there. I know the budget matters are \ngripping our attention, but I ask the managers at some point to find a \nfew minutes this evening to set aside the budget and express our sense \nof solidarity with the people of Spain, as well as our great sense of \nloss of what occurred. It is in connection directly to what my \ncolleagues are offering on this amendment on homeland security, which I \nsupport.\n  I hope we might express our unanimous support for the people in \nSpain.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator makes a very good point. I \nthink I speak for everybody when I say our hearts and minds are with \nthe people of Spain after the terrible tragedy they suffered. We will \nseek to find a way to express our condolences to the people of Spain \nbefore we complete our work before the break. I thank the Senator for \nbringing that matter to our attention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are continuing the assault on \ntaxpayers. Next, in the not too distant future, we are going to be \nvoting on a lot of tax increases. This would increase taxes by $13.7 \nbillion and increase spending by $6.8 billion. That is a 40-percent \nincrease. We fully funded the President's request of a 15-percent \nincrease but, obviously, that is not enough for some individuals.\n  I will now yield management of this amendment to Senator Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I rise \nto oppose the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut. The \nSenator from Connecticut serves as the ranking member on the Committee \non Governmental Affairs, which I am privileged to chair.\n  We have worked very hard together on the issue of homeland security \nand have held many hearings during the past year to evaluate the \nprogress that the new Department is making. But I believe the Senator's \namendment is ill advised.\n  I strongly support increased funding to help secure our communities, \nbut we must target those additional resources to programs that address \nour greatest vulnerabilities, from our ports to our borders to even our \nfarms. We must also make sure each and every State builds and maintains \na baseline level of homeland security preparedness and response \ncapability.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Connecticut would increase funding \nfor many State and local homeland security programs by more than $7 \nbillion over the President's budget request. That is simply not \nresponsible in this fiscal climate.\n  I also fear if we pour that amount of additional money into the \nsystem, it will not be well and carefully spent.\n\n[[Page S2635]]\n\n  Many of us met this past week with municipal officials from our home \nStates. I heard from my municipal officials in Maine that they are \nspending the homeland security money that we are giving them very \nwisely to improve their training, to perform joint exercises, and to \npurchase new equipment.\n  Since September 11, according to Secretary of Homeland Security \nRidge, Congress has appropriated some $13 billion in homeland security \nassistance for first responders, States, localities, and other \nentities. This year, the President will allocate an additional $3 \nbillion through the Office of Domestic Preparedness for many of these \nprograms.\n  I do believe we need to provide additional funding in some areas--\nport security, for example, and the basic homeland security grant \nprogram--to continue to build that baseline capacity and also to \naddress one of our biggest vulnerabilities, and that is the \nvulnerability of our seaports. But I believe Senator Lieberman's \namendment does not target resources in the most effective manner.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. The Lieberman amendment provides \n$600 million for new biosecurity spending. The administration's budget \nalso includes more than $100 million for a new biosurveillance \ninitiative and makes more than $2.5 billion available in fiscal year \n2005 for bioshield. I simply do not believe the additional funding that \nis contained in Senator Lieberman's amendment is required, given the \nsubstantial investment the President's budget already makes in \nbiosecurity.\n  Again, I hope to be offering either a joint or my own version of a \nhomeland security amendment later in the budget debate. I believe the \nproposal I will be putting forward better balances the need for fiscal \nrestraint as we work to improve the security of our homeland.\n  I urge that the Lieberman amendment be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, further responding to the amendment, I \nurge Senators to reject the amendment. The administration has requested \nsubstantial increases in funding for homeland security. Although it is \na new Department, the Department of Homeland Security was funded at a \nvery generous level, about $30 billion of funding, during the current \nfiscal year.\n  States and localities are submitting plans to the Office for Domestic \nPreparedness on their priorities in terms of equipping and training \nfirst responders and equipping the States to modernize their emergency \nmanagement agencies. A tremendous amount of money is being spent this \nyear, and a request is made for even more money next year.\n  The Budget Committee has analyzed the needs and the ways these funds \ncan be utilized and has come up with a very thoughtful and, in my \njudgment, responsible recommendation to the Senate on this subject.\n  I support the Budget Committee's conclusions and their \nrecommendations. It is always easy to say we can use more money, we can \nadd more money for every good-sounding program in Government, and this \nis certainly one that is very important. None is more important than \nour national security and homeland security. But we do have the funds \nthat we need, that we can spend in an efficient way and in a responsive \nway to the threats that exist to try to help us do a better job of \nprotecting the homeland.\n  The President has given strong leadership on this issue. The Congress \nhas responded in a very generous way, both bodies of Congress working \ntogether to accommodate the needs we have in these areas.\n  I hope we can support the Budget Committee chairman and reject this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, is the Senator from Connecticut seeking \nadditional time for wrap-up?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the ranking member \nof the Budget Committee. I will take 3 additional minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate my good friend and \ncolleague from Maine. She said ``reluctantly'' opposed the amendment, \nbut opposed it nonetheless, and the Senator from Mississippi. My own \nfeeling about this is, just as I have fully supported funding for the \nwar on terrorism abroad--and it has been a considerable amount of \nmoney. We had a tremendous debate and controversy around the $87 \nbillion supplemental last year, and we will have another supplemental \nthis year, but at least $50 billion for the war on terrorism, \ncritically necessary to our security, for the advancement of our \nvalues, and to our freedom. In the same way, $6.8 billion, less than we \nwill give to the international war against terrorism, is critical for \nthe homeland side of the war against terrorism, to raise our defenses, \nto protect our people.\n  As I said at the outset, we have made real progress in the last year \nas a result of the work that the Department of Homeland Security has \ndone, but I do not think anybody--including the folks over there--\nbelieve we have done enough to secure the safety of our people.\n  We provide for funding. It is a deficit reduction amendment, a $6.8 \nbillion deficit reduction, paid for by the now familiar tax cut for \nmillionaires. It is fiscally responsible.\n  Can we afford it? I say we can't afford not to afford it. This is \ntoday's primary way in which we are fulfilling our constitutional \nresponsibilities to provide for the common defense and to ensure \ndomestic tranquility.\n  This ought to be nonpartisan because it is like national security. We \nalways used to say partisanship stopped at the Nation's borders. Since \nour enemies have attacked us within our borders, when it comes to \nhomeland security, we ought to be joining across party lines to do what \nis right to protect our people.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senate Budget chairman and ranking \nmember. I ask that when the vote is taken, it be done by the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from \nMassachusetts need?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think my colleague and cosponsor, the Senator from \nConnecticut, wants 4 minutes. I will take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield 5 minutes off the resolution to \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and 4 minutes to the Senator from \nConnecticut off the resolution as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2725\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I offer this amendment \non behalf of myself, Senator Dodd, Senator Clinton, Senator Corzine, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Schumer, Senator Reed, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Kohl, Senator Lincoln, Senator Levin, Senator \nLieberman, Senator Reid, Senator Bingaman, Senator Durbin, Senator \nMurray, and Senator Pryor.\n  This amendment is about education. It is about higher education. It \nis about the children whose family average income is $15,000 a year. It \nis about 4.8 million children in this country who receive Pell grants--\nyoung people, gifted, talented, bright, smart, who come from families \nwith limited incomes and cannot survive even with the Pell grants, \nunless they get additional help because of the increase in the cost of \ntuition over the last 3 years.\n  Over the last 3 years, the tuitions in our public schools have \nincreased from $3,700 to $4,700. That is a 26-percent increase. \nCurrently, the Pell grants are $4,050. This would raise it to $5,000. \nAlmost 500,000 more low-income students will receive Pell grants. The \naverage Pell grant will increase by $600. Not everyone will go up to \nthe full $5,100, I should say, but the average grant will go up $600 \nand the maximum Pell grant will increase by $1,050. This effective \nincrease in the Pell grant offsets the explosion that has taken place \nwith tuitions across this country paid for by the $10 billion--$5 \nbillion for the cost of\n\n[[Page S2636]]\n\nPell grants and $5 billion for deficit reduction from the top limits.\n  If we are talking about priorities in this country, we are talking \nabout not leaving children behind. Middle-income, working families are \nhaving a difficult time on health care, education, and employment. This \nmakes sure about one-quarter of all of the children who are attending \nhigher education come from families of $15,000 or below, 4.8 million. \nThis amendment is going to make sure some of the most gifted, talented \nyoung people in this country are going to be able to continue their \neducation.\n  I remind my colleagues of President Bush's statement he made when he \nwas running for President of the United States in Hampton, NH, in the \nyear 2000: It is known for a fact that Pell grant aid significantly \naffects the ability of a child to attend college or stay in college. A \nchild eligible for a Pell grant will be affected by the size of the \nPell grant. I am going to ask Congress to bolster the first-year aid--\nat that time from $3,300--to $5,100 per recipient of the Pell grant.\n  This is what President Bush promised. The year was 2000. We have an \nopportunity now in 2004 to fulfill this promise. The need has never \nbeen greater. This is a defining issue, whether this institution is \ncommitted to the cause of higher education and educational opportunity. \nEveryone in this body understands education is the key to opportunity \nfor our future. It is the key to our economy. It is the key to our \nnational security. It is a key to our democracy. It is in our national \ninterest, our national defense, and our national economic interest. \nMost of all, it is an issue of fairness, decency, and national priority \nto have an increase in the Pell grants. I hope the Senate will accept \nthis proposal I offer on behalf of myself and my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. \nHe is my very good friend. He did not get as excited today as \nyesterday. I do not know if that is good or bad.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator want to give me 3 more minutes?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think it is good. I think it is good.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire is not in the Chamber yet, but \nhopefully he will be here.\n  I will make a couple of comments. One, we have assumed in the budget \na significant increase for Pell grants already. This is another one of \nthese things that no matter what we put in, there is going to be an \namendment to increase it. I understand that. I recognize that. The \nhistory is this Congress, and frankly in the last few years since \nSenator Gregg has been chairman and Arlen Specter has been chairman and \nGeorge Bush has been President, the amount for Pell grants has risen \nand risen dramatically, from about six point some billion dollars under \nPresident Clinton's last year to all the way now up to $12.5 billion. \nSo there have been dramatic increases in Pell grants.\n  In the year 2001, it was $8.7 billion. In our budget it is right at \n$13 billion. That is a significant increase.\n  If this amendment was adopted, Pell grants would increase from 2004 \nto 2005 by 48.2 percent. We have had a lot of amendments. We had one \njust a moment ago dealing with homeland security offered by my very \ndear friend whom I respect greatly, Senator Lieberman, that would have \nincreased the homeland security function by 40 percent. This increases \nPell grants by 48.2 percent between 2004 and 2005.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How can you possibly figure that when now it is $4,050 \nand the average Pell increase was $600, that is 48 percent?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Well, because that is what my staff told me, and if I am \nincorrect, I will be happy to revise and edit my remarks. Again, I wish \nSenator Gregg was doing this.\n  My staff informs me it would increase from $4,050 to $5,100 under the \nSenator's amendment, and that would increase the cost by 48.2 percent. \nIt is not just the maximum amount of the award. The maximum amount of \nthe award would be going up some 20-odd percent, but there are a lot of \nawards, not just at that amount but also at other amounts.\n  That is a very significant increase, 48 percent in 1 year. Funding \nhas gone up dramatically in this program, as I just mentioned. When \nthere is an increase from $8.7 billion under our resolution to $13 \nbillion--and looking at the Senator's amendment it would increase that \namount from $13 billion an additional $4.9 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield myself an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator could add $4.9 billion because it says it \nwould increase spending by $4.9 billion for 2005. If we add that to $13 \nbillion, that is taking a $13 billion program to an $18 billion \nprogram. My very able staff did very good work. I think that is 48 \npercent.\n  Again there has to be some kind of limit. I happen to like the idea \nof doing some good things in Pell grants. We have assumed a 7.4-percent \nincrease, almost $1 billion increase for Pell grants in 1 year. My \ncolleague and friend from Massachusetts wants to multiply that times \nfive. I do not think we can afford that.\n\n  His amendment also says, well, we want to raise taxes to do it and \nwould raise taxes by $9.8 billion. I also want to say this is kind of \nclever, but it does not sell. Many of our colleagues' amendments say we \nare only increasing taxes 1 year to pay for the spending 1 year. There \nis no way in the world if the taxes and spending are increased by $4.9 \nbillion in 1 year that is not going to be continued or to be assumed. \nSo I mention, yes, that tax increase would be extended year after year \nand so would the spending increase.\n  I want to warn taxpayers, there are a lot of amendments out here. We \nare going to start voting on these amendments momentarily. My colleague \nfrom North Dakota has been urging me, let's get the votes started. I \nwould like to advise our colleagues momentarily we are going to start a \nlong list of rollcall votes. I want to advise taxpayers to look out \nbecause almost every one of these votes will raise your taxes.\n  I will tell the spenders of the world, almost every one of these will \nincrease spending. We will have a chance to vote.\n  I see my colleague from Oklahoma is in the Chamber and I reserved \nsome time for him to speak on the Lautenberg amendment. I do want to \nlet our colleagues know momentarily we are going to begin a series of \nrollcall votes and it is very much my intention to run them very hard. \nWe will have 15 minutes on the first one. I hope not much more. On \nsubsequent votes, we are going to hold them to as close to 10 minutes \nas the managers can. If Senators miss votes, they miss votes. Most of \nthese votes are going to become pretty obvious how they are going to be \ndetermined before too long. Hopefully we will not waste too many hours \nin the process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I join the chairman in saying we need to \nmove to votes as quickly as possible and we need to be disciplined in \nhow much time we spend on those votes. I think it is in the interest of \nall of us to proceed expeditiously.\n  I do not share the chairman's characterization of these \namendments. These amendments, in a limited number of high-priority \nareas, are doing two things. They are adding resources but paying for \nthem, and not only paying for them but in addition providing deficit \nreduction. Remember, the budget resolution before us will add nearly $3 \ntrillion to the national debt over just the next 5 years. So the \namendments on our side to restore some of the cuts in funding to the \nCOPS Program to put police on the street, to restore funding for the \nfirefighters who are the ones we expect to respond to any bioterror \nthreat, to provide a program to expand job opportunities in this \ncountry, to provide expansion of health care opportunities for people \nin our country--each one of these amendments is completely paid for.\n\n  In addition to that, we have provided for deficit reduction so at the \nend of the day our Nation is burdened with less deficits and less debt.\n\n[[Page S2637]]\n\n  In our amendments we have turned in some cases to closing egregious \ntax loopholes, tax scams that are unfair to all taxpayers of our \ncountry. Others of our amendments are paid for by turning to those \nprivileged few who earn over $1 million a year and we have asked them \nto just slightly reduce their tax cuts. Remember, in 2005 the cost of \nthe tax cuts going to those who earn over $1 million a year, the cost \nof their tax cuts for that 1 year alone will be $27 billion. For those \nwho earn over $337,000 a year, the top 1 percent, the total cost of \ntheir tax cuts for that 1 year is $45 billion.\n  We don't think it is unreasonable to take a tiny fraction of those \ntax cuts and use them to improve the education of our children, to \nrestore the cuts that have been made to the COPS Program that has put \n150,000 police on the street, to slightly reduce the tax cuts of those \nearning over $1 million a year to restore the cuts to firefighters or \nto expand health care coverage in this country when we have over 40 \nmillion people who do not have health care coverage, or to slightly \nincrease Pell grants so we are providing expanded educational \nopportunities in a way that will make our country more competitive in \nthis global economic environment.\n  We think those are the priorities of the American people, to reduce \nthese deficits, to reduce this buildup of debt, and to restore the cuts \nin certain high-priority areas: law enforcement, police on the street, \nfirefighters, education for our kids. Those are the priorities of the \nAmerican people. Those are the priorities of American families. We \noffered those amendments on our side.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Connecticut, if \nhe is seeking time?\n  Mr. DODD. I thought I had 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator had been previously yielded 4 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. I will maybe take less than that. I associate myself with \nthe comments of Senator Kennedy and Senator Conrad in this debate.\n  It was 200 years ago this year that Thomas Jefferson said that any \nnation that ever expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was \nand never possibly can be.\n  That was at the outset of the 19th century. Here we are, gathered in \nthis great Chamber at the outset of the 21st century and we are arguing \nwhether we can afford to give those who are the wealthiest in our \nsociety a little bit less of a tax cut than they otherwise might be \ngetting in order to see to it that a significant majority of our young \npeople get the opportunity of a higher education which they are being \ndenied, not because they lack the drive or determination or absolute \ndesire to acquire the skills necessary to improve the quality of their \nlives and the lives of all of us in this country but because they lack \nthe means.\n  What I hear my colleague saying is the total amounts are going up. \nWhat has not gone up is the amount of money we provide to each student. \nBecause of a declining economy--and we are talking about families here \nwith incomes of $15,000 a year or less who qualify for Pell grants--we \nhave seen a growing number of families and a growing number of students \nwho want to go on and get a higher education.\n  In 1975, Pell grants paid for somewhere around 80 percent of a \ncollege education. That is a generation ago. Today, I don't need to \nremind people who may be listening to this discussion, $5,000, even at \na public institution, doesn't necessarily cover even 50 percent of the \ncost of a higher education. Nevermind, the cost at private \ninstitutions. In fact, at public colleges and universities, tuition has \ngone up some 26 percent since President Bush took office and 77 percent \nof all students attend public institutions. This Pell increase, up to a \nlittle more than $5,000, really will help students and their families, \nstudents who want to get an education and want to contribute to the \nwealth of this Nation.\n  We now know, in the coming years, in the next 10 years, 80 percent of \nthe 23 million new jobs we hope are going to be created will require \nthat a person applying for them have more than a high school \neducation--80 percent of the 23 million jobs. What are we doing in this \nyear, this year, to prepare those students so they can acquire the \nskills necessary to get the jobs that will require that someone have \nadditional education beyond high school?\n  We are asking today, in this amendment, that the most wealthy in our \nsociety take a little less of the tax cut President Bush has offered \nthem in order to pay to see to it that more and more Black and Hispanic \nchildren in this country, those who primarily fall into Pell income \ncategories, can get Pell grants to go on and get an education.\n  I don't know of many affluent people who would disagree with this \nrequest. The very beneficiaries of the tax cut, I suspect, if you \npolled them, would say, I'll take less of a tax cut if in fact you put \nthose resources to seeing to it that people who come from the poorest \nfamilies in our society, who have the intelligence and ability to go on \nand get an education, will qualify for an additional amount of money \nunder the Pell grants.\n  That is what the Senator from Massachusetts is asking. We ought to be \nsupporting that on a bipartisan basis. I can't imagine, as we talk \nabout job creation and talk about this Nation remaining No. 1 in the \n21st century, that we want to shortchange the ability of qualified \nyoung people to go on to higher education. Pell grants make a huge \ndifference. We are unfortunately depriving these kids of the necessary \ndollars they need, and all because we are not asking the most affluent \n1 percent income earners to take a little bit less of a tax cut than \nthey might otherwise be getting.\n  I urge the adoption of the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy was questioning my math. \nHe said where did I get this answer that it increased by 48 percent. I \nsaid I got it from my staff. Now I did it myself. I regret to inform my \ngood colleague from Massachusetts, but my staff was right. It just so \nhappens when you add $4.9 billion that is called for by his amendment \nto the $12.9 billion we have in our resolution, that totals $17.8 \nbillion. Last year we spent $12 billion. That is a 48.2 percent \nincrease. Actually, I calculated it at 48.3 percent. That is an \nincrease in 1 year.\n\n  Pell grants, as I showed by the chart, have already risen \ndramatically. They have grown by 47.3 percent since 2001. Senator \nKennedy's amendment would have it grow by more than that in 1 year. \nThat is not affordable. That is not sustainable, not if you believe in \ndeficit reduction.\n  I have heard so many people make speeches about deficit reduction and \nbe critical of our President, but that is not the way people are \nvoting. They are voting for more spending, and then this hypothetical \nwe are going to raise somebody else's taxes. I don't think you can have \nprograms grow at 48 percent. Senator Lieberman had an amendment that \nwould grow homeland security by 40 percent. I don't think you can have \nthat kind of growth rate in expenditures and ever say you are serious \nabout deficit reduction.\n  During the debate on the Lautenberg amendment, I said I wanted to \nrefer to my colleague who happens to be chairman of the committee, the \nauthorizing committee that overseas Superfund, for his comments in \nrelationship to the Lautenberg amendment.\n  I notify our colleagues it is my expectation that we will begin a \nseries of rollcall votes in the very near future.\n  I yield my colleague from Oklahoma such time as he desires.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator withhold?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2725\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for Mr. \n     Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 2725.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S2638]]\n\n   (Purpose: To create a reserve fund to finance an increase in the \nmaximum Pell Grant that keeps pace with the rate of increase in public \n  college tuition, extend Pell Grants to 500,000 new recipients, and \n           lower the national debt by closing tax loopholes)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $2,352,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $7,253,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $196,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $2,352,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $7,253,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $196,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $2,352,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $7,253,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $196,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $2,352,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $9,606,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $9,802,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $9,802,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $9,802,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $2,352,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $9,606,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $9,802,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $9,802,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $9,802,000,000.\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of the adjournment resolution which is at \nthe desk. I further ask unanimous consent that the concurrent \nresolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con.

Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from Oklahoma \nsuch time as desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2703\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I compliment the senior Senator from \nOklahoma. He is doing a great job in handling this most difficult \nissue.\n  We go through this every year, and I believe we are going to finally \nget something done tonight. I certainly hope we will and that we will \nhave what we all will be proud of.\n  I can't help but comment. I happened to come in when my friend, the \nSenator from Connecticut, was leaving the Chamber. It seems as if the \nargument you hear from the liberal side of this body is the fact that \nall of this came about as a result of the tax cuts of this \nadministration. I feel compelled to remind this body of the history of \nthese tax cuts. It was not a Republican idea. Ironically, one of the \ntruly great Democrat Presidents of this country, John Kennedy, was the \nguy who came up with the concept. He said--and this is an exact quote--\n\n       We need more revenues to run these programs that we have \n     and the best way to increase revenues is to reduce marginal \n     rates.\n\n  That was back in the 1960s, and it worked.\n  There is a recognition of the problem we have right now. This \nadministration inherited a recession, and they are coming out of it by \nhaving the very tax reductions to add to the amount of revenues coming \nin. This is going to work. It is working today. If you do not think it \ndoes, let us remember what happened back in the 1980s.\n  In the 1980s, the total amount of money that was raised from marginal \nrates was $244 billion. In the 1990s, it was $466 billion. That was the \n10-year period of the largest tax reductions on marginal rates in the \nhistory of America. It had the result of increasing--not decreasing--\nthe amount of revenue.\n  The formula used was for each 1-percent increase in economic \nactivity, it creates $46 billion of new revenues. John F. Kennedy knew \nthat, Ronald Reagan knew that, and we ought to know that today, but we \nignore history.\n  Now my friend from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, is coming up with \nanother one of his favorite tax increases. I have never seen a tax \nincrease he didn't like. But this seems to be one of his favorite ones.\n  We are going to have a big tax increase to vote on in just a few \nminutes. It is called the Superfund tax.\n  There is a lot of doubletalk. On the one hand, they blame the \nadministration for U.S. job loss and lack of competitiveness. At the \nsame time, they want to impose a tax that expired in 1995 on some of \nthe most fragile industries that are not going to make it.\n  People say reinstating the Superfund tax will be a deficit-reduction-\nreducing measure. I am not sure that is necessarily true. What you are \ngoing to do is drive a lot of people out of business who are already \novertaxed.\n  I think if I could single out one argument I find the most \noffensive--and I hear it as chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee over and over and over--every time we have a committee \nhearing, they talk about ``polluter pay.'' Polluters are paying today. \nThat is the whole concept. When a polluter pollutes, that polluter \npays.\n  In fact, historically, PRPs--potentially responsible parties--since \nSuperfund started, the average of all cleanups has been 70 percent in \nthe average year of those cleanups which are cleaned up by industries \nthat have polluted.\n\n  This is interesting because in 2003, that 70 percent jumped to 80 \npercent.\n  In other words, all but 13 percent of the cleanups took place and \nwere paid for by the polluters.\n  The antijobs and the protax supporters also ignore the fact that the \nSuperfund tax, on its face, is unfair. It has nothing to do with taxing \ncompanies and industries that pollute. If an industry falls into a \ncertain category--say you are going to have your taxes go up. It has \nnothing to do with whether or not they have ever polluted. In fact, oil \nand petroleum companies have paid more than 50 percent of the Superfund \ntaxes but were responsible for less than 10 percent of the liability on \nSuperfund sites.\n  That is historically accurate. I would defy anyone to challenge it. \nAs a result, this is an especially unfair tax to American families who \nhave to pay more at the pump.\n  Furthermore, Superfund tax supporters argue that cleanups have slowed \ndown as a result of the amount of money lost from the trust fund. That \nisn't true at all. In fact, we had testimony in our hearings this last \nweek that there is not a correlation between the amount of money in the \nSuperfund reserve and the amount of cleanup.\n  In 1996, the tax fund was at its highest level. Yet the amount spent \nby the Clinton administration in 1996 for Superfund cleanup was at a \n10-year low.\n  This year's Superfund budget request is around $1.4 billion. But wait \na minute. Let us look at what they are proposing.\n  In this amendment, they propose an $8.5 billion tax increase. This is \nthe same thing we went through, by the way, last year. There has never \nbeen a correlation between the amount of money raised by a tax and the \namount of money that has been spent.\n  For those who are responsible for contamination, they are already \nbeing held liable for cleanup costs under Superfund. No one is getting \nlet off the hook, and I will challenge right now the other side to name \none viable polluter who is not being held accountable for the Superfund \ncontamination they caused.\n\n[[Page S2639]]\n\n  Here we are again with the same amendment. We have had it several \ntimes before. Senator Lautenberg danced this thing out again. We beat \nit the last time 57 to 43. I will be down here to remind people how \nthey voted before. They will forget.\n  I honestly believe the only issue here is if you want to increase \ntaxes on the American people by $8.5 billion in one vote, this is your \nopportunity to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are very close now to starting to vote.\n  Again, I ask our colleagues who have amendments in the queue to come \nso that they could make their final argument before the vote with 1 \nminute to each side. I think that would be reasonable.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate everyone's patience. For the \ninformation of our colleagues, we are going to have a series of votes \nstarting momentarily.\n  I am going to yield to my colleague and former chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for a few moments. I notify our colleagues we expect several \nvotes to begin momentarily. We are trying to warn everybody, we would \nlike everybody to be prompt and we would like for everybody to stay on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from New Mexico such time as \nhe desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak for 2 minutes on the fiscal year 2005 \nbudget resolution currently pending before the Senate. In particular, I \nwant to focus for just a little bit on the budgets for scientific \nresearch.\n  The funding for the National Institutes of Health should be my \nstarting point. In the omnibus bill of 2003, thanks in large part to \nthe leadership of President Bush, we met our commitment; that is, in \n2003, we met our commitment to double the funding for NIH.\n  Senator Nickles remembers that clearly, that a couple of Senators \nstarted and everybody followed, and a resolution was adopted that \nsaid--it was incredible to many of us, but we did it--let's double the \nNIH. President Bush helped us, and we did that.\n  Allow me to explain these numbers. In 1998, we spent $13.7 billion on \nthe National Institutes of Health for cancer, for all of these various \ndiseases, heart conditions, and mental illness. When the commitment was \nfulfilled, we spent $27.1 billion for medical research.\n  We need not stop there, however. Last year, we further increased it \nto $27.9 billion. This means we have spent $145.9 billion in the last 7 \nyears on the National Institutes of Health--a 109-percent increase. \nThis year we are planning on further increasing the budget of NIH to \n$28.7 billion.\n  I join the President in supporting the work the NIH has done and \ncontinues to do. But I am somewhat chagrined when I see the current \nbrochures and documents of the NIH complaining about the fact this \nPresident, who funded them at the highest increased levels in their \nhistory, who this year says we can only afford inflation--instead of \nsaying, the President who supported us the most says we cannot keep on \nwith that kind of increase, they end up critical that this year he did \nnot increase their funding as much as he did in the past, saying: We \nmust have more. He is not funding us enough.\n  I tell you, when I read that, it is a good thing they are not down \nhere asking for more money, as far as this Senator is concerned, \nbecause I would be on the side of saying: Enough is enough.\n  In fact, I would like to give you a couple other thoughts about how \nimpressive their work has been.\n  The human genome project--for those who do not understand or \nremember, that project is the genome project, spelled: G-E-N-O-M-E. Not \ntoo long ago, the human genome was completed, in terms of mapping it, \nmuch ahead of schedule. The completion of this work was only the \nbeginning.\n  More than 300 genes for human diseases, from cancer to deafness to \nbirth defects, have already been identified. It means in the past we \nwould spend years of research at maybe three major institutions to \nlocate a gene for diabetes. The mapping of the human genome says we are \nin the process of mapping every genetic point of every major disease in \nthe human body at every location. We will know where they are. Then \nlet's hope the great scientists in the future will begin to cure those \nincurable diseases.\n  The NIH is doing amazing work in developing techniques to detect, \ndiagnose, and treat many of the most devastating diseases humans face, \nsuch as cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.\n  I hope that we can continue to fund this important agency at these \nrecord levels.\n  I am concerned, though, that we have collectively failed to be as \naggressive when it comes to funding basic scientific research in other \nagencies.\n  Basic research is defined as systematic study directed toward greater \nknowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and \nof observable facts without specific applications towards processes or \nproducts in mind.\n  The technologies transitioned from basic research are the foundation \nof applied programs and eventually fielded systems.\n  Put another way, basic research is the engine that makes our national \ndefense, homeland security, and economic superiority possible.\n  However, basic scientific research is not funded in a single place as \nwith medical research at NIH.\n  The correlative type research to NIH is something we call in America \nbasic research--physics, computer science, chemistry, engineering, et \ncetera. We have no central focus point for that in America. I am not \nsure we should or should not. It is just a fact.\n  In 2004, the sum total of expenditures for that was $11 billion, and \nthat included the Veterans' Administration--we assume some of what they \ndo is science--Interior, EPA, NASA, DOE. This is compared to $8.8 \nbillion for these programs in 1998.\n  In the same period of time these programs have increased 35 percent, \nwhile NIH increased by over 100 percent. I do not think America can \ncontinue to dominate the world, invent the products, maintain our \nstandard of living with that kind of disparity for too much longer. The \ntime has come to spend money on basic research, just as we have on \nmedical research.\n  It is important to note much of our scientific research is done at \nour universities. They have plenty of research in medical science and \nmedical science problems. But I guarantee you, Mr. President and fellow \nSenators, they are very short on research for the basic sciences.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from a State that has great wealth. They \ndevote great quantities of that wealth to their schools, and then say: \nSpend it on science. Go look at the University of Texas and a few other \nof your universities and see where you put your money. You put it \nthere. But America does not put it there across the board.\n  I put this statement in comparing the two only because to keep them \nat such a disparate level of a 100-percent increase in 10 years in one \nand 30-some percent in the other is not going to keep America great.\n  I am hopeful when we finish with this resolution, we will get on to \nthinking a little bit about where we are going the next decade, and \nmaybe we should start a resolution saying basic science ought to be \nincreased over the next decade in a substantial way, maybe even as we \ndid with the National Institutes of Health. I only wish I could see the \nway clear to find the money. I would be here offering that resolution \nright now.\n  Our future is just as certainly tied to our basic science moving up \ninto a parity position with wellness research. Eventually wellness \nresearch will come up against insolvable problems. At least the \ntechnology of application won't work because we won't have the physics \nsolved, the physical science.\n  With that, I thank the Chair for giving me a few moments and hope \nevery\n\n[[Page S2640]]\n\nnow and then somebody in a position to do something about this can join \ntogether and see if we can't get this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 319\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are going to begin our series of \nrollcall votes momentarily. First, I ask unanimous consent that after \nthe first vote in this series, the Senate then proceed to a resolution \nat the desk regarding the recent bombings in Spain; provided further \nthat following the reporting of the resolution, there be a brief moment \nof silence; provided further that each leader be recognized for up to 5 \nminutes each, Senator Allen and Senator Dodd be permitted to speak up \nto 2 minutes each; I further ask consent that the Senate then proceed \nto a vote on adoption of the resolution with no intervening action or \ndebate; further that following the vote the preamble be agreed to and \nthe motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, this does not define what \nthe first vote in the series would be.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that with \nrespect to the voting sequence, the Senate proceed to the votes in \nrelation to the pending amendments in the order offered, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order to those amendments; finally, there \nbe 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to each vote; and after \nthe first vote, that the time limit for each vote be limited to 10 \nminutes.\n  The sequence of votes will be as follows: Boxer amendment No. 2783; \nSarbanes amendment No. 2789; Dorgan amendment No. 2793; Lautenberg \namendment No. 2703; Harkin amendment No. 2799; Lincoln amendment No. \n2803; Byrd amendment No. 2804; Bingaman amendment No. 2765; Lieberman \namendment No. 2807; and Kennedy amendment No. 2725.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the \norder dealing with the Spanish resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are now ready to call upon Senator \nBoxer for her 1-minute description. I would also say if the sponsors \nare not ready, we don't need descriptions and we will move forward with \nrollcall votes. We are going to be very tight with time. Senators \ncannot assume there is going to be an extra 10 minutes on the rollcall \nvotes. We are not going to allow that to happen, or we are going to try \nnot to let it happen.\n  I believe the Senator from California is ready.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2783\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1 minute let me give it to you \nstraight: We have seen a loss of 3 million jobs in the last 3 years. \nThis is not sustainable. Our people are hurting. What this amendment \ndoes is gives us a chance to do something about it. We give tax credits \nto businesses, if they pay for health insurance, if they create \nmanufacturing jobs. What we do is boost up some of the wonderful \nprograms that are working in advanced technology, manufacturing \nextension. We increase investments in basic science. We close the \nloophole so if companies move abroad, they can't get special tax \nbreaks, and we don't allow Federal funds to be used to offshore jobs.\n  We pay for it by saying to the millionaires of this country: Instead \nof getting back $120,000, you will get back $80,000. That is multiple \ntimes what a minimum-wage worker will get. Millionaires will still get \nback $80,000 a year under the Bush tax cut. We are asking them to make \nthat sacrifice because we need the jobs.\n  I urge an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment offered by our friend from \nCalifornia increases taxes by $24 billion over 3 years. Basically it \nwould wipe out all the tax relief we have in the bill in the year 2005 \nfor the child credit and marriage penalty. But it doesn't add any \nfunding for jobs programs. We hear it does. It has a reserve fund that \ncould increase spending, maybe, if a few things happen. The resolution \nbefore us fully supports the FSC/ETI bill, the JOBS bill Senator \nGrassley and Senator Baucus are working on. If you want to help us be \nmore competitive, to create more jobs, that is certainly the approach. \nIt is a bipartisan approach and has a much greater likelihood.\n  The proposal suggested by our friend from California, frankly, would \nmean an exodus of jobs from the United States. It would be telling \nmultinational corporations, you should not be in this country. You have \ntax advantages for being in other countries. I don't think we should be \nencouraging the headquarters of companies such as Intel or Microsoft \nand others to be leaving the United States.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2783. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, next we will have a vote on the Sarbanes \namendment No. 2789. I have two comments, but first I tell my \ncolleagues, we are going to cut these votes off. I am warning \neverybody, and I urge colleagues to stay on the floor. We are going to \ntry to keep all of these amendments limited to 10 minutes. In fact, I \nask unanimous consent that the following amendments be limited to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That order has been entered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. As soon as we have order, I ask the Chair to call upon \nthe Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment would fully fund the \nassistance to firefighter programs, the firefighter grant, and the \nSAFER program up to the authorized amount. I urge my colleagues stand \nwith our firefighters. \n\n[[Page S2641]]\n\nWarren Rudman, in a report, said, ``emergency responders drastically \nunderfunded, dangerously unprepared.'' Don't let that situation \ncontinue.\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Maryland is correct. This budget contains \na $250 million cut in FIRE Act grants. There have been over 19,000 \nawarded since the program was established from 33,000 departments \nacross the country. These fire departments absolutely need the \nequipment and training resources. In addition, the SAFER Act will put \n75,000 new firefighters on the street over the next seven years. Recent \nstudies by major organizations indicate there are chronic shortfalls in \nthe numbers of people who serve in paid and volunteer and combination \ndepartments.\n  This is a good amendment. We are asking those who make more than $1 \nmillion a year to take a little less of a tax cut than they would \nordinarily get. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. This amendment, as most of the amendments we are going \nto be facing in this sequence of 10 votes, increases taxes. This one \nincreases taxes by $2.86 billion next year. That happens to be about \nthe same amount of money we assume for the child tax credit next year. \nBut it doesn't add any money for firefighters, zero. What it does is \npromise a possible $1.3 billion increase in spending later in the year, \nif the appropriations bills do such and such.\n  I think it is a gimmick. The facts are, if it did go to firefighting, \nthat would be a 157-percent increase over last year. That is \nridiculous. We put in 10 percent for homeland defense as requested by \nthe President. What the Secretary is trying to do is move more of that \nmoney into high-threat areas, not necessarily in every little rural \nfire department in Oklahoma, which, frankly, is not a Federal \nresponsibility. Terrorism is not a threat in most of the rural \ncommunities.\n  I urge opposition to the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2789.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is absent \nattending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to a resolution that is at the desk regarding the recent \nbombings in Spain; provided further that following the reporting of the \nresolution there be a brief moment of silence; provided further that \neach leader be recognized for up to 5 minutes each, and that Senators \nAllen and Dodd be permitted to speak for up to 2 minutes each. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that the Senate then proceed to a vote on \nthe adoption of the resolution with no intervening action or debate; \nfurther, that following that vote the preamble be agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 319) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate with respect to the deadly terrorist attacks against \n     the people of Spain that occurred on March 11, 2004.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now observe a moment of \nsilence.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the efforts of our colleagues, \nSenators Allen and Dodd, we have this resolution before the Senate \nexpressing our condolences to the people of Spain. We will shortly vote \non this resolution.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I rise. In a phone call earlier today, \nI told the Ambassador of Spain what the Senate will tell the people of \nSpain tonight through this resolution: We are with you; you are not \nalone in your grief.\n  This morning in Madrid, Spain, at the height of rush hour, 10 \nterrorist bombs ripped through railway trains and stations killing over \n190 people and wounding 1,240 more. Mothers, fathers, students, \nchildren, were struck down as they went about their normal daily life--\na tragedy we in the United States known only too well.\n  Spain did not learn about the need to defend democracy or how to \nfight terrorism on September 11, 2001. Sadly, this lesson was thrust \nupon the Spanish people long ago. Their response to our darkest moment \nwill long be remembered in America. As the people of Spain mourn their \nvictims tonight, we mourn with them.\n  We do not yet know the identity of the culprits. Officials are \npursuing every lead. But whoever committed this atrocity will be found \nand they will be punished. I say to the people of Spain: America is \nwith you. We stand in front of you, in back of you, to your left, and \nto your right. We grieve with the families who bear so much sorrow and \nwe grieve for their loved ones whose lives have been so unjustly cut \nshort. We will not forget this day. We will fight until the last \ncowardly murderer is brought to justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join in thanking Senators Allen and \nDodd for their work on this resolution. I join the majority leader in \nexpressing strong support for the efforts in the Senate this afternoon. \nIt is entirely fitting and appropriate that we observe the moment of \nsilence for the victims of this heinous attack on the citizens of Spain \nthis morning. Our prayers are with the Spanish people as they search \nfor survivors, care for their injured, and mourn their losses.\n  Just last month, we heard a moving speech in the House Chamber from \nPresident Aznar. He made clear to us America does not stand alone in \nthe war on terror. He made clear that the terrorists who attacked us on \nSeptember 11 would fail, and he made clear that we would succeed \ntogether.\n  The resolution says to President Aznar and his people that the \nAmerican people will give the Spanish people everything they have given \nus: Our unshakable commitment that we will link arms to care for the \nvictims and their families, our solemn word that we will not flinch in \nthe face of these cowardly attacks, our enduring pledge that we will \njoin forces to bring the perpetrators to justice. That is because this \nwas not an attack on Spain alone but on all of us.\n  I have already heard from Americans who are desperately trying to \nreach\n\n[[Page S2642]]\n\nfamily members who are in Madrid this evening, terrorized to think \ntheir loved ones were victimized in the attack. Families from all over \nthe world are experiencing the same fears. The object of terrorism is \nto bring fear to the hearts of free people, to divide friend from \nfriend and ally from ally. But America will never abandon its Spanish \nallies. We will not tire in the fight against tyranny.\n  Today we renew our resolve to defeat terrorism around the world. We \nwill bring these murderers to justice and make clear to all terrorists \nthat they will never, never prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Frist, the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, and also my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, all of whom worked together on this \nresolution.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on European Affairs of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I share the resolve of my colleagues.\n  The American people have experienced our September 11. For the people \nof Spain, March 11 is a day they will not forget. We, the Senate, \nexpress our outrage and shock and that of our fellow American people \nover these terrorist attacks that occurred today. The Senate of the \nUnited States joins with President Bush in expressing our deepest \ncondolences and in saying that we will stand shoulder to shoulder with \nour friends, the people of Spain, in this war on terrorism.\n  The Senate also, in unity, expresses our solidarity with the people \nof Spain in these very difficult hours. We especially send our sincere \ncondolences to the families whose have lost loved ones and the well \nover 1,000 who have been severely injured by these despicable terrorist \nacts.\n  We call on other nations to join with us once again in condemning \nsuch monstrous acts and attacks on the innocent people wherever they \nmay be, whether they are in the Pentagon, the World Trade Center, or in \ntransportation facilities in Madrid, Spain. We need to help identify \nthe perpetrators of these attacks and bring them to swift justice. We \nexpress, as Senators, our readiness to consult with the King of Spain, \nthe President of the Spanish Government, Jose Maria Aznar, the Spanish \nCortes, and other public authorities about our joint efforts to combat \nterrorism.\n  President Aznar said ``We shall not forget.'' We in the United State \nsay to President Aznar and the people of Spain: Siempre recordaremos. \nWe will not forget either. We will always remember.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, even though the Senate is extremely busy \nwith respect to consideration of the Senate budget resolution, the \nrecent tragedy in Spain makes it terribly important that the Senate \npause from its regular business this afternoon to speak with one voice \nabout our profound outrage and sorrow with respect to what transpired \njust a few short hours ago in Madrid. The resolution which has been \nintroduced by Senators Frist, Daschle, myself, and others is an \nopportunity for the Senate to send its condolences to the people of \nSpain.\n  I would also like to bring to the attention of my colleagues that a \nbook of condolences will be open at the Embassy of Spain tomorrow, \nMarch 12, and Monday, March 15. In addition, a funeral service for the \nvictims of this heinous attack will be held at St. Matthews Cathedral \non Monday, March 15, at 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. President, I know I join all my colleagues when I express how \ndeeply disturbed I am by today's bombings in the Spanish capital of \nMadrid, and I strongly condemn those responsible for what is a heinous \ncrime against human life. These horrific attacks--the deadliest in \nSpain's history--have now left over 180 innocent people dead and more \nthan 900 wounded. Such carnage is almost unimaginable, and I know that \nI join with all Americans in expressing my outrage over these acts of \nviolence.\n  I also join with my fellow Americans in expressing my solidarity with \nthe Spanish people and the families of the innocent victims. This is a \ntime of great distress and pain for them--it is a memory that will long \nendure in their hearts and minds. And I know that in the difficult days \nahead, America and the Congress will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with \nSpain, just as Spain supported America through some of our darkest \nhours after September 11, 2001.\n  In so many ways, Spain's friendship has been invaluable to the United \nStates. Spain has been a critical partner in the fight against \nterrorism, a true ally during the war in Iraq, and an important \neconomic partner in the global marketplace. And indeed, through my \nroles as a United States Senator and Chairman of the U.S.-Spain \nCouncil, I have seen firsthand the immense depth and strength of the \nUnited States-Spain bond.\n  This bond continues to flourish because our countries and our peoples \nshare the fundamental values of freedom and democracy. In today's \ncomplicated world, the United States and Spain are true friends. And I \nwould like to say to the Spanish people--rest assured that during this \ntime of tragedy, your nation has no greater friend than the American \npeople.\n  As my colleagues are aware, these horrific terrorist attacks have \noccurred only days before Spain is to hold its general elections. The \nattacks were likely meant to disrupt Spain's strong democratic \ninstitutions. And they were surely aimed at the values of freedom and \ndemocracy that both Spain and the United States hold dear.\n  Although it is not yet clear who was behind these attacks, I have a \nmessage for them, wherever they are. The values that Spain and America \nshare will not be broken by cowardly acts of terror; the friendship and \ncooperation between our nations will continue. And despite your \nefforts, elections will be held--the Spanish democracy will continue to \nthrive.\n  In times of need, we grow more united. And together, we will move \nforward to ensure that this world is safe for freedom-loving people \neverywhere.\n  I thank the majority leader and minority leader for putting this \nresolution forth this afternoon. It is a timely resolution to take a \nfew minutes out from the budget resolution to share our collective \nthoughts and to express them to the people of Spain over this \nincredible tragedy. I associate myself with the remarks that have been \ngiven by the majority leader, the Democratic leader, and my colleague \nfrom Virginia who have spoken eloquently about our feelings.\n  I recall vividly the day after September 11 reading Spanish papers. \nThe headlines in the Spanish papers in Madrid and Barcelona said the \nfollowing in Spanish: Nosotros somos, Americos.\n  I think, tonight, all Members in the Senate would want to say to the \npeople of Spain in this moment: Nosotros somos, Espanolas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I would like to add a few comments to what has \nbeen so eloquently said.\n  There has never been a time in the 500-year relationship between \nSpain and what is now the United States of America in which there have \nbeen stronger bonds of genuine friendship and empathy for each other, \nparticularly at a time of tragedy such as this that exists today.\n  I spoke early today with the Ambassador of Spain to the United States \nand he described what his country was experiencing as their September \n11. Just as they came forward with such effectiveness and genuine \nremorse when we experienced our tragedy, we share those same feelings \ntoward theirs today.\n  May the bonds of our friendship give strength to both Spanish people \nand our people as we have experienced the consequences of terrorism on \nour own soil. Our hopes and our prayers are with our brothers in Spain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 319\n\n       Whereas on March 11, 2004, terrorists detonated a total of \n     10 bombs at 6 train stations in and around Madrid, Spain \n     during morning rush hour, killing more than 190 people and \n     injuring more than 1,200 others;\n       Whereas these attacks constitute the worst acts of \n     terrorism ever experienced in Spain;\n       Whereas no organization has claimed responsibility for the \n     terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas the terrorist organization known as ETA, which has \n     been responsible for the deaths of more than 800 people \n     during its decades long campaign to establish an independent \n     Basque State, is a prime suspect as the perpetrator of these \n     cowardly acts of terrorism against innocent people;\n       Whereas officials in Spain initiated another line of \n     investigation to identify the perpetrators of the terrorist \n     attacks after a van was found with detonators and an Arabic-\n     language tape of Koranic verses;\n       Whereas President Jose Maria Aznar has stated that ``we \n     shall not forget'', bravely declared that Spain would not \n     change its policies because of terrorist pressure, and \n     declared three days of national mourning;\n       Whereas the President of the European Parliament has stated \n     that the terrorist attacks are ``a declaration of war on \n     democracy'', Pope John Paul II has described the attacks as \n     ``despicable'', and the United Nations Secretary General Kofi \n     Annan expressed profound shock and indignation over this \n     ``senseless killing of innocent people''; and\n       Whereas President George W. Bush has already called \n     President Aznar to offer his condolences and to assure him \n     that ``the United States stands resolutely with Spain in the \n     fight against terrorism in all its forms and against the \n     particular threat that Spain faces from the evil of ETA \n     terrorism'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses the outrage and shock of the people of the \n     United States over the terrorist attacks that occurred in and \n     around Madrid, Spain on March 11, 2004;\n       (2) joins with President Bush in expressing its deepest \n     condolences and pledges to remain shoulder to shoulder with \n     the people of Spain in the war on terrorism;\n       (3) expresses its strong solidarity with the people of \n     Spain during their difficult hour, and its deep condolences \n     to the families of the victims of these despicable terrorist \n     attacks;\n       (4) calls on all nations to join with the United States in \n     condemning the monstrous attacks on the innocent people of \n     Spain and in attempting to identify the perpetrators of the \n     attacks and bring them to account;\n       (5) expresses its readiness to consult with representatives \n     of King Juan Carlos, President Jose Maria Aznar, the Spanish \n     government, the Spanish Cortes, and other public authorities \n     about joint efforts to combat terrorism more effectively;\n       (6) commends the United States Embassy in Madrid for its \n     prompt offers of assistance to the Government of Spain, and \n     for its efforts to determine the welfare and whereabouts of \n     United States citizens who may have been affected by the \n     terrorist attacks; and\n       (7) urges the executive branch to continue to provide all \n     possible assistance to Spain in order to identify and bring \n     to account the perpetrators of the terrorist attacks that \n     occurred on March 11, 2004, in Madrid and of other terrorist \n     attacks against the people of Spain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2643-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2643-S2644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                            2005--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. And there is a minute on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the Dorgan amendment raises taxes by $2.2 \nbillion to increase funding for the COPS Program by $1.1 billion. He \nsays $2.2 billion is the tax increase that will be for millionaires, \nbut we have said this time after time, you cannot specify to the \nFinance Committee what taxes will be raised.\n  The bottom line is, the easiest taxes out there right now that are \nexpiring at the end of this year are the $1,000 child tax credit, the \nmarriage penalty reduction, and the expansion of the 10-percent tax \nbracket. These are middle-class people, middle to lower income people. \nWe don't want to raise taxes on middle to lower income people. We \nencourage Members to vote no on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLeahy, Feinstein, Schumer, Kennedy, Sarbanes, Rockefeller, Corzine, \nStabenow, Harkin, Boxer, Durbin, Kohl, and Dodd be added as cosponsors \nto my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Biden, Senator Daschle, and many others. This would \nrestore $1.1 billion to law enforcement grants that have been cut in \nthis budget. My colleague, Senator Biden, is the author of the COPS \nProgram, the Byrne grant program, and others. I just finished a round \nof meetings dealing with methamphetamine in North Dakota. Most of you \nhave had the same experience. Law enforcement officials from across the \ncountry will tell you these grant programs are critical to their \nability to continue to fight this methamphetamine scourge and other \nissues. We should restore that funding.\n  We do this and pay for it by simply limiting the tax cut for those \nabove $1 million a year. Next year they will receive $27 billion in tax \ncuts; that is, those Americans with income of $1 million a year or \nmore. Under this amendment, they will only receive $26 billion in tax \ncuts. We will restore the funding for law enforcement across this \ncountry for the COPS Program, the Byrne grant, and the law enforcement \ngrant program.\n  I offer this on behalf of myself, on behalf of Senator Biden, Senator \nDaschle, and others.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Senator \nConrad and I also are going through the list of other amendments that \npeople want us to consider. We urge Senators not to push us to votes on \nthese amendments. If we vote on all the amendments, we are going to be \nhere not only very late tonight but very late tomorrow night.\n  I do not think most of these amendments and the amendments on our \nside require rollcall votes. We are going to work to see if we can \naccept some amendments, and we are going to work to see some amendments \nbe dropped. I urge the cooperation of our colleagues.\n  We will go now to the Lautenberg amendment, after my colleague makes \nsome comments. I urge the clerks, we are going to move these votes. We \nhave another six votes. We are going to try to adhere to the time \nlimits as closely as possible. All remaining rollcalls will be 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am advised that we have eight more votes \nstill on this list. There may be some variance between us.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Seven.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Seven more votes on this list, and then I have in my \nhand, after having gone Member to Member, 34 more amendments on which \nMembers are insisting a rollcall vote. Seven votes will take us about \n2\\1/2\\ hours. Thirty-four more votes would take us another 11 hours, \nand that does not count the votes on the other side. That is 11 hours \nstraight of voting in addition to the 2\\1/2\\ hours now.\n  I say to our colleagues, we are masters of our own fate. If everybody \ninsists on having rollcall votes on all of their amendments, we will be \nhere until 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning, and then we will be here \nuntil late tomorrow night. That is where we are at the moment.\n  Hopefully, people will relent and agree to try to get amendments \naccepted or dispatch with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from New Jersey has \nan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2703\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have an amendment to reinstate the \nSuperfund tax that was in place for so many years and produced a very \nsuccessful program.\n  It has been said that I want to tax people. Don't believe that this \nis a tax-free exchange, as we heard from the Senator from Oklahoma \nbefore when he accused me of loving taxes. He loves taxes, but he wants \nto put it on the average citizen. He does not want the polluters to \npay. He said that very directly.\n  He raised a question rhetorically, I guess, that asked: Who among \nthose who are accused of polluting did not pay their fair share? I will \ntell you one. Halliburton. Halliburton never pays their fair share \nwhere they can get it and owes the Defense Department $61 million in \novercharges; Halliburton which manages to put their business offshore \nso they escape taxes.\n  Is that the example we want to look at, not whether the people who \nhave been paying the taxes, the average working person, will pay two-\ntenths of a cent more per gallon?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is very important everyone knows this \nis nothing but a huge tax increase on businesses, on industries. Many \nof them are very frail at this time. They have nothing to do with \npollution. Polluters-pay is happening right now.\n  Since the inception of this program, 70 percent of the sites have \nbeen cleaned up and paid for by people who polluted. Last year, it was \n87 percent. Where there is a polluter that can be found, that polluter \npays. That system is working.\n  If you have to have an $8.5 billion tax increase on various \nbusinesses--and right now we have businesses going out of business--\nthen this is your opportunity to do it. This is a huge tax increase, \n$8.5 billion. We do not need it, and it is unfair.\n  By the way, we resoundingly defeated this amendment several times \nbefore. The last vote was 57 to 43. Many Democrats voted with us in \nvoting against this tax increase. I encourage them to do the same now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2703. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is absent \nattending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n\n[[Page S2645]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment does what 400 public health \norganizations around the country say is vitally needed. It increases \nfunction 550 health spending by 12 percent. That is $6 billion in the \nnext fiscal year and $30 billion over 5 years. It also provides for $9 \nbillion in deficit reduction over the same 5 years.\n  The amendment pays for this needed investment with a revenue measure \nthat delivers more public health benefits. We raise the current Federal \ntax on cigarettes by 61 cents a pack, from 39 cents to $1 a pack. This \nwould provide $30 billion for public health over 5 years, and $9 \nbillion of deficit reduction.\n  I showed this chart earlier. If you think $1 a pack is a lot of \nmoney, I point out in much of the history of the Federal excise tax on \ncigarettes we were as high as 49 percent of the average wholesale price \non a pack of cigarettes. We are now down to 14 percent. This amendment \nwould only raise it to 30 percent of the average wholesale price.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter supporting this amendment be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                 January 29, 2004.\n\n      It's Time To Make Public Health Funding a National Priority\n\n       Dear President Bush and Members of Congress: The health of \n     all Americans is at risk from an unprecedented range of \n     threats, including: chronic diseases and disabilities, \n     infectious and food borne illnesses, biological and chemical \n     terrorism, mental disorders and substance abuse, catastrophic \n     injuries, and a shortage of healthcare providers and trained \n     public health workers.\n       Our nation's public health system will not be able to \n     respond adequately to these threats without additional \n     resources for the continuum of medical research, prevention, \n     treatment and training programs. We urge you to increase \n     discretionary funding for public health through the Function \n     550 budget allocation in Fiscal Year 2005 by 12 percent. This \n     investment is critical to improving the health, safety and \n     security of our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     AAHP-HIAA, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment would do one thing. It \nwould increase taxes by $39 billion over 5 years. That is really half \nof what we are assuming we are going to do to help American families. \nSo this is going to cut the tax cut. That will mean, to preserve \npresent law, it is going to cost about $80 billion. This is going to \ntake half of that away. My colleague might hope it is going to be used \nto raise tobacco taxes, and so on, but that doesn't mean that would \nhappen. This tells the Finance Committee to raise $39 billion.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I draw my colleagues' attention to the \namendment offered earlier today by myself and many others. I cannot \nthink of anything that could help us in this Nation redirect our \neconomy, rebuild the fabric of our country, help our families, our \nworking families, our military families, our children across this \nNation, than looking at what we can do for the uninsured in this \ncountry. The number of uninsured in our country is alarming. It should \nbe a priority in this budget debate.\n  As we look at the budget debate we are dealing with, we should think \nabout priorities and the choices we have to make and the consequences \ndown the road if we do not make the right priorities and the right \nchoices.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to take a look at what we are doing. \nWe are providing for the uninsured. We are making sure it is not paid \nfor by increasing taxes, but cutting loopholes, cutting corporate \nloopholes that have existed, which we have all agreed are wrong. We \nneed to do something about it. Redirecting those resources to the \nuninsured is the correct thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. The Lincoln amendment increases taxes by $60 billion over \nthe next 5 years while purporting to help the uninsured. The budget \nresolution already contains a reserve fund for the uninsured. The \nresolution reserve fund is budget neutral and allows the chairman to \nchange allocations for both the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee and the Finance Committee.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2804\n\n  Mr. President, the Senate should ensure that delinquent taxpayers pay \ntheir fair share of taxes before we cut vital domestic investments for \ncitizens who actually pay their taxes.\n  With that savings, we can restore the spending for our schools, \nveterans, and homeland security that is cut by this budget resolution.\n  The Senate should adopt a budget resolution that will permit the \nenactment of the 13 fiscally disciplined appropriations bills without \nforcing the Congress to use gimmicks to meet unrealistic spending \ntargets.\n  This amendment sets responsible limits on discretionary spending for \nfiscal years 2005 and 2006, just enough to fund the levels, adjusted \nfor inflation, that were approved by the Congress earlier this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from West \nVirginia. This amendment increases taxes by $24.5 billion over the next \n2 years. That basically is going to wipe out the continuation of \npresent law that we have scheduled for low-income, middle-income \nfamilies. I hope our colleagues will not support the amendment.\n  It also spends most of the money, or it purports to spend the money, \nmaybe, if the appropriators get it and it is reallocated, and so on. It \nbasically is an amendment that would greatly increase taxes by $24 \nbillion. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. It \nwould create a 60-vote point of order against tax legislation that \nwould have the effect of forcing more taxpayers into having to pay the \nalternative minimum tax. The point of order would not lie against tax \nlegislation that extends the expiring marriage penalty relief, the 10-\npercent tax bracket, or the child tax credit, but it would lie against \nother tax legislation.\n  We have about 3 million people who paid the alternative minimum tax \nlast year. It is expected to go up over $30 million by 2010. This \namendment doesn't fix that, but this amendment would keep the situation \nfrom getting worse by us passing legislation that adds more taxpayers \nto that group.\n  I think this is a very meritorious amendment and I urge support for \nit.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman's amendment creates a \nnew point of order against specific policies that might be reported to \nthe Finance Committee. It is not at all related to the budgetary \neffects of such legislation and is not appropriate for inclusion in the \nbudget resolution. It is not germane.\n  I raise a point of order against the amendment pursuant to section \n305 of the Budget Act because the amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget \nAct, I move to waive the applicable section of the act for the purpose \nof the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, we are a Nation at \nwar. It is a war against terrorism. It is a war that is being fought \nabroad and at home. A day or two ago, this Senate overwhelmingly \nrestored $7 billion to the Department of Defense budget, in part to \nassist our military in fighting the war against terrorism overseas. At \nhome, we have not adequately funded the homeland side of the war \nagainst terrorism. We have not adequately funded the Department of \nHomeland Security. This amendment would do that: $6.8 billion, $4.4 \nbillion of which would go to first responders.\n  It is outrageous that at this time of conflict, there are police and \nfire departments all over America that are letting firefighters and \npolice officers go, just when we need those first responders. That is \nabout as foolish as an army laying off soldiers in the middle of the \nwar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just to inform our colleagues, we are going to have a \nvote on the Lieberman amendment and then on the Kennedy amendment. Then \nwe are going to try to organize a bunch of other votes. So we are \nmaking progress.\n  I thank the minority leader and also my colleague Senator Conrad. We \nare making good progress. We have amendments on both sides. I know a \nlot of people want to get some of these considered. We are going to \nmove as quickly as possible. Let's get through these next two votes and \nthen we will see where we go. I urge our colleagues to expect a late \nnight tonight. We have a lot of work today. It is possible we could \neven finish tonight if we all cooperate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Very briefly, if we could ask all colleagues who have \namendments that they still want considered, it would be enormously \nhelpful to us if we could get copies of those amendments. We are trying \nto work out as many amendments as we can. We need to have the actual \namendment to be able to do that.\n  One other thing we should say, we have been asked if there is going \nto be a window. We do not intend to have a window. We intend to keep \npressing ahead and those who are next in line should expect that they \nwould only have 2 minutes a side to do their amendments. So when they \nare preparing their presentations, if they would understand they would \nhave no more than 2 minutes, so we are not going back after we finish \nthis round to some longer explanations of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will comment on the amendment of my \ngood friend Senator Lieberman. This amendment would increase taxes by \n$13.7 billion over the next 5 years. It spends $6.8 billion, or \npresumes to spend $6.8 billion on homeland security. That would be a \n40-percent increase over this year. We have already provided in the \nbudget a 15-percent increase over last year.\n  My colleague mentioned defense. We just increased defense spending 7 \npercent over last year. Homeland security is 15 percent. I don't think, \nfrankly, we can afford 40 percent. I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nthe Lieberman amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2807. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

It is \nour intention to keep plowing ahead. We are making good progress. We \nare accepting some amendments. We may have to have a few more rollcall \nvotes but I hope not too many.\n  Senator Kennedy will be the next in the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2725\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in higher education, with children from \nfamilies earning $15,000, 4.8 million children receive Pell grants. \nThat makes up one-quarter of all the children attending higher \neducation in this country. What we have seen in the last 3 years is the \ncost of public education has increased 26 percent. This amendment takes \nthe Pell grants from $4,050 to $5,100; average increase, $600; average \nincrease, 27 percent, just for the increase on the tuition for public \ncolleges.\n  I refer to the statement made by President Bush in New Hampshire \nwhere he said:\n\n       It is a known fact that Pell grant aid significantly \n     affects the ability of children to attend college. I am going \n     to ask Congress to bolster the Pell grants to $5,100.\n\n  That is what this amendment does. It is a $5 billion cost offset in \nterms of the deficit reduction paid for by the highest taxpayers in the \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to my colleague from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the Senator from \nMassachusetts repeating what was said in New Hampshire. One thing I \nsaid in New Hampshire was I don't believe we should be increasing taxes \non the American public disproportionately. This amendment increases \ntaxes by $9.8 billion. It does not necessarily fund the Pell grant \nprogram, but in this bill, under the leadership of Senator Nickles, we \nhave funded the Pell grant. We have increased it by almost $1 billion, \nand we continue a large commitment to this program, which is very \nappropriate and which is being undertaken in an aggressive way in the \nbudget as\n\n[[Page S2648]]\n\npresented. So I would vote against this tax increase, and mention to \nthe people in New Hampshire that I continue to oppose taxes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 2725. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I announce that the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. \nJohnson) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is absent \nattending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 51 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Reid\n  The amendment (No. 2725) was rejected.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we now have two or three sense-of-the-\nSenates. I will just tell everybody, Senator Conrad and I have decided \nwe are not going to have any rollcalls on sense-of-the-senates, at \nleast that is not our intention. We are willing to agree to a couple as \nlong as they will keep debate to the sense-of-the-Senates very brief, \nlike 1 minute.\n  I believe Senator Feinstein or Senator Mikulski has one. Senator \nMikulski has one, I believe, and we would be happy to consider it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I say to the chairman, mine is not a \nsense of the Senate. Mine is a regular amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I apologize to my colleague. Yours is a \nregular amendment, but we made it deficit-neutral, so we are willing to \naccept your amendment. So if you send it to the desk, we will accept \nit.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much. Why don't I just get busy to do \nthat?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2820\n\n  Mr. President, it is with enthusiasm that I send my amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Reed, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2820.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a deficit neutral reserve fund to provide a $4,000 \n                          tuition tax credit)\n\n       On page 28, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 304. RESERVE FOR FUNDING OF HOPE CREDIT.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or \n     joint resolution, or an amendment thereto is offered or a \n     conference report thereon is submitted, that increases the \n     Hope credit to $4,000, makes the credit available for 4 \n     years, and makes the credit refundable, the chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget may revise committee allocations for \n     the Committee on Finance and other appropriate budgetary \n     aggregates and allocations of new budget authority and \n     outlays by the amount provided by that measure for that \n     purpose, if it would not increase the deficit for fiscal year \n     2005 or for the total of fiscal years 2005 though 2009.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment is very straightforward. It \nhelps middle-class families continue to pursue the American dream. My \namendment provides for a tuition tax credit of up to $4,000 to help pay \nfor college.\n  Our colleagues know our middle-class families are stressed and \nstretched. They do not know how they can afford to send their kids to \ncollege. College tuition is on the rise, but financial aid is not \nkeeping up. Our students are graduating with so much debt that it is \nlike their first mortgage.\n  We believe the benefits of education accrue to the individual. We \nbelieve that college is important to families. But it is also important \nto our economy.\n  If our country is going to be safer, if we are going to have a \nstronger economy, we need to be smarter. This means public investments \nin giving families the opportunity to go to college will also accrue to \nour society.\n  We need to invest in human capital. My amendment will make college \naffordable to middle-class families. It will give help to those who \npractice self-help.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to accept my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Maryland. \nThere is no objection to the amendment on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2820.\n  The amendment (No. 2820) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. \nColeman, has an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2821\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. COLEMAN], for himself and \n     Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 2821.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide $1.9 billion to increase the maximum Pell Grant \nfrom $4,050 to $4,500 by reducing spending in other Federal government \n     programs, except education programs, by a commensurate amount)\n\n         On page 15, line 16, increase the amount by \n     $1,884,000,000.\n         On page 15, line 17, increase the amount by $452,000,000.\n         On page 15, line 21, increase the amount by \n     $1,394,000,000.\n         On page 15, line 25, increase the amount by $38,000,000.\n         On page 23, line 5, decrease the amount by \n     $1,884,000,000.\n         On page 23, line 6, decrease the amount by $452,000,000.\n         On page 23, line 10, decrease the amount by \n     $1,394,000,000.\n         On page 23, line 14, decrease the amount by $38,000,000.\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \ncomments of my colleague from Maryland regarding higher education, and \nmy colleague from Massachusetts in regard to Pell grants.\n\n[[Page S2649]]\n\n  We need to support our students. Pell grants are now at $4,050. This \namendment will move the maximum grant to $4,500.\n  The cost of this amendment is $1.9 billion. It is paid for by \nreducing spending in other Federal programs, except education, by a \ncommensurate amount.\n  This is the kind of investment we have to make. This is good for our \ncountry. It is good for our young people. It is good for our future. I \nurge my colleagues to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are going to accept this amendment on \nthis side, but I do want to indicate, there is no new money here. This \nis cutting other programs across the board to fund this priority. It is \nimportant to understand there is no new money here. But with that, we \naccept the amendment on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2821.\n  The amendment (No. 2821) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from California, \nMrs. Feinstein, has a sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n2 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2753\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is amendment No. 2753, on behalf \nof Senators Hollings, Breaux, Dodd, Corzine, Schumer, Biden, Mikulski, \nMurray, Graham of Florida, and Collins.\n  This amendment does not cost. It is a sense of the Senate, and it \nessentially would allow large ports that need to produce security to do \nthis through multiyear contracting or letters of intent. There is a \nreal problem in going year by year with budget funds for port security. \nThe port of Los Angeles-Long Beach is 15 miles long. They are the \nsecond and third largest ports in the Nation. It simply cannot do what \nis necessary to be done to secure the port unless there is some form of \nmultiyear funding agreement. This amendment would allow that to take \nplace, at least in terms of voicing the Senate's view.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we think this is an excellent amendment \nthat will enhance port security. We know we have a problem with port \nsecurity. The Senator has come up with a creative contribution. We urge \nour colleagues on both sides to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Hollings, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Dodd, \n     Mr. Biden, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Graham of Florida, \n     and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 2753.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR PORT \n                   SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the United States, the system of maritime commerce, \n     including seaports and other ports, is a critical element of \n     the United States economic, social, and environmental \n     infrastructure.\n       (2) In 2001, ports in the United States handled \n     approximately 5,400 ships, the majority of which were owned \n     by foreign persons and crewed by nationals of foreign \n     countries, that made a total of more than 60,000 calls at \n     such ports.\n       (3) In a typical year, more than 17,000,000 cargo \n     containers are handled at ports in the United States.\n       (4) Maritime commerce is the primary mode of transportation \n     for international trade, with ships carrying more than 80 \n     percent of such trade, by volume.\n       (5) Disruption of trade flowing through United States ports \n     could have a catastrophic impact on both the United States \n     and the world economies.\n       (6) In addition to the economic importance of United States \n     ports, such ports form a critical link in the United States \n     national security structure, and are necessary to ensure that \n     United States military material can be effectively and \n     quickly shipped to any location where such material is \n     needed.\n       (7) Terrorist groups, including extremist groups such as al \n     Qaeda, are likely to consider, formulate, and execute plans \n     to conduct a terrorist strike against one or more of the \n     ports in the United States.\n       (8) Terrorists have conducted attacks against maritime \n     commerce in the past, including the October 2002 attack on \n     the French oil tanker LIMBERG and the October 2000 attack on \n     the USS COLE in Yemen.\n       (9) It is critical that port security be enhanced and \n     improved through the adoption of better formulated security \n     procedures, the adoption of new regulations and law, and \n     investment in long-term capital improvements to the structure \n     of the United States most critical ports.\n       (10) Effective funding to provide adequate security at \n     United States ports requires a commitment to provide Federal \n     funds over multiple years to fund long-term capital \n     improvement projects.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the budget of the United States should provide adequate \n     funding for port security projects and not less than the \n     amount of such funding that is adequate to implement an \n     effective port security plan;\n       (2) the implementation of the budget of the United States \n     should permit the provision of Federal funds over multiple \n     years to fund long-term security improvement projects at \n     ports in the United States; and\n       (3) the Secretary of Homeland Security should, as soon as \n     practicable, develop a funding plan for port security that \n     permits funding over multiple years for such projects.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 2753.\n  The amendment (No. 2753) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the next amendment is an amendment by \nSenator Daschle on the Indian Health Service.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2774\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 2774.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for himself, \n     Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Wyden, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Akaka, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Inouye, and \n     Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 2774.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

RESERVE FUND FOR INDIAN HEALTH SERVICE CLINICAL \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations \n     to the\n\n[[Page S2650]]\n\n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, discretionary \n     spending limits, and other appropriate levels and limits in \n     this resolution by up to $3,440,000,000 in budget authority \n     for fiscal year 2005, and by the amount of outlays flowing \n     therefrom in 2005 and subsequent years, for a bill, joint \n     resolution, motion, amendment, or conference report that \n     provides additional fiscal year 2005 discretionary \n     appropriations, in excess of levels provided in this \n     resolution, for Indian Health Service clinical services, \n     included in this resolution for the Department of Health and \n     Human Services.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week's Congress Daily included a \nstory that still troubles me deeply and gets at the heart of why I am \noffering this amendment.\n  HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson, in response to a question about why the \nBush administration is providing funding for universal health care in \nIraq, but not in America, replied:\n\n       Even if you don't have health insurance in America, you get \n     taken care of. That could be defined as universal health \n     care.\n\n  I don't think Secretary Thompson is callous, so he must be \ndesperately out of touch. Either way, it's shocking to hear the \nnation's top health care official claim that America has universal \nhealth care.\n  More than 43 million Americans are uninsured. According to the \nNational Institute of Medicine, uninsured Americans who access \nemergency rooms or free clinics get about half the medical care of \nthose with health insurance--they live sicker and die sooner than those \nwith insurance. Approximately 18,000 Americans die unnecessarily each \nyear because of lack of health care. And the problem isn't just \nuninsured Americans. Millions more Americans are under-insured.\n  There are 2.5 million Native Americans in this country who--\ntheoretically--have insurance. All too often, they get abysmal health \ncare--or none at all. America is obligated--by law and by treaty--to \nprovide free health care for American Indians--a commitment we made to \nIndian people when the U.S. Government took their lands. America is not \nhonoring that commitment. Native Americans suffer higher rates of many \nserious illnesses--including diabetes, heart disease, and Sudden Infant \nDeath Syndrome--than the rest of the population. Yet Indian Health \nService funding is wholly inadequate.\n  The Indian Health Service makes up only one-half of one percent of \nthe HHS budget. Its budget has consistently grown at a far slower rate \nthan the rest of the HHS budget. That means that the health system with \nthe sickest people and the greatest need gets the smallest increases. \nThat just doesn't add up.\n  In per capita terms, the United States spends about $5000 per year on \nhealth care for the general U.S. population. Contrast that with what \nthe Indian Health Service spends per capita on health services for \nNative American men, women, and children: about $1900 per year. To put \nthat in further perspective, you should know that's one-half of what \nthe Government spends per capita on Federal prisoners' health care--\n$3800. The U.S. Government spends twice as much on Federal prisoners' \nhealth care as it spends on Native Americans' health care.\n  The result: American Indians live sicker and die younger than every \nother ethnic group. This has created what the U.S. Commission on Civil \nRights calls a ``quiet crisis.'' Care is rationed in Indian Country \nthrough the use of a literal ``life or limb'' test. In many cases, you \nare denied care, or care is delayed, unless you are at risk of \nimmediate loss of your life or a limb.\n  Secretary Thompson should come to Indian Country to hear some of the \nstories I hear when I talk to people on the Cheyenne River Indian \nReservation or in Pine Ridge or at the Sioux San Hospital in Rapid \nCity. Secretary Thompson, there is no universal health care in Indian \nCountry. Just ask anyone who lives there. Secretary Thompson should \napologize to Native Americans for his comments. More than that, he \nshould make a commitment to fight for the funds the Indian Health \nService needs to meet its obligations.\n  Democrats tried repeatedly last year to persuade our colleagues to \nfully fund at least one part of the Indian Health Service budget: \nclinical services. They refused, repeatedly. Last year, several of my \nRepublican colleagues came to the floor to say: ``You're right--the \nhealth care situation in Indian country is abysmal, and it's unfair. \nIndian people do deserve better, but we just can't afford it. We can \nafford tax cuts for the wealthy elite, and we can afford billions on \nIraq, but we can't afford to give Native Americans the health care \nwe've promised them.''\n  Mr. President, that is just not acceptable. My friends on the other \nside may be willing to offer that excuse, but I am not. And they can no \nlonger claim that they ``didn't know'' how bad Indian Country's health \ncare crisis truly is. So we are trying again this year. We are offering \nthe Senate a chance to finally right this indefensible wrong.\n  Our amendment would create a reserve fund to allow a $3.44 billion \nincrease in IHS clinical services. This is not enough to provide health \ncare services to every eligible American Indian and Alaska Native. It \nwould, however, provide sufficient funds to serve the current IHS user \npopulation--the people who currently depend on the Indian Health \nService for their care.\n  The cost of this amendment, along with additional deficit reduction, \nis fully offset by eliminating abusive tax loopholes or reducing tax \nbreaks for individuals with incomes over $1 million per year. And don't \nbe fooled by promises made in a competing amendment to make unspecified \ncuts in domestic discretionary spending.\n  That amendment does nothing to raise the Appropriations Committee's \nbudget allocation, and does nothing to put additional money in the IHS \nclinical services account. That funding isn't real, and those promises \nare empty. At best, it would rob Peter to pay Paul.\n  If America can afford to spend billions of dollars building hospitals \nand providing health care in Iraq, we can afford to honor our treaty \nobligation to provide health care for American Indians.\n  I realize we have obligations around the world. But we also have \nobligations here at home. Millions of Americans want to know, when is \nit their turn? When do we start paying attention to their needs? When \ndo we take care of our own? We don't have universal health care in \nAmerica, despite what Secretary Thompson thinks. And we certainly don't \nhave universal health care in Indian Country. This amendment gives us \nthe chance to offer Indian people the bare minimum of services that \nmost of us take for granted and would consider essential. I hope we \ndon't waste it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2651-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2651-S2699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S2651]]\n\nSenate\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                            2005--Continued\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this important \namendment offered by Senator Tom Daschle. The Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs, of which I am a member, has held hearings on the \nPresident's fiscal year 2005 budget request for Indian programs. We \nhave heard from Indian country about the inadequate funding provided \nfor many programs in Indian country. We have heard that American \nIndians and Alaska Natives have a life expectancy six years less than \nthat of the rest of the United States population, with rates of \ncardiovascular disease being twice as high for native peoples.\n  Native people die at a rate 500 percent higher than other Americans \nfrom tuberculosis and 390 percent higher from diabetes. With the \ntechnological advancements that we have made in these areas, most of \nthese illnesses could be prevented if basic health care were available. \nUnfortunately, the President's budget provides $2.1 billion for IHS \nclinical services, leaving a shortfall of over 60 percent for fiscal \nyear 2005.\n  The time is now and we must provide Indian country with the ability \nto ensure that native peoples are given access to essential health care \nservices. I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment, and \nI thank my dear friend, Senator Daschle, for offering this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this is another one of these amendments--\nwe have had a dozen of them now--that says we are going to pay for this \nby increasing taxes on wealthy people. I don't know how many times we \nhave to vote on it. Then I look at the spending. It says we will \nincrease spending by $3.4 billion from 2.1 to 5.5. That is a 164-\npercent increase. It is a big tax increase. It is a humongous spending \nincrease. I urge my colleagues to vote no.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2774.

The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2822\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for herself and \n     Mr. Campbell, proposes an amendment numbered 2822.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To increase funding for the Indian Health Services)\n\n       On page 16, line 12, increase the amount by $282,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 13, increase the amount by $251,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 17, increase the amount by $28,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 21, increase the amount by $2,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2652]]\n\n       On page 23, line 5, decrease the amount by $282,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 6, decrease the amount by $251,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 10, decrease the amount by $28,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 14, decrease the amount by $2,000,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment also relates to the \nIndian Health Service. This amendment would increase the budget for the \nIndian Health Service by $282 million. This is intended to track the \nrecommendation that the Indian Affairs Committee sent to the Budget \nCommittee in its views and estimates letter.\n  It provides the funding for those priorities that were set out in the \ncommittee's list. We are looking at increases for clinical services, a \n50-percent increase for services to urban Indians, a $90 million \nincrease for contract support costs and an additional $61 million for \nhealth facilities construction. This amendment would make all of these \nincreases possible.\n  Of particular interest to me, the amendment enables an additional $10 \nmillion increase in funding for sanitation facilities construction, \nwhich is incredibly important to my home State. 40 percent of the unmet \nneed for sanitation, as identified by the Indian Health Service, is in \nAlaska.\n  This amendment also envisions a substantial funding increase for the \nCommunity Health Aide Practitioner Program, which the Indian Health \nService regards as a national model.\n  The increases in this amendment are defensible. We recognize we have \na long way to go when it comes to improving the health condition of our \nNative peoples, but I think this is a good and reasonable step in that \ndirection.\n  I urge Members to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Murray as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nMurray on this side. We strongly support the amendment and hope our \ncolleagues will accept it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate has just missed an opportunity \nto fund the basic health care needs of the current Indian Health \nService user population. We had a chance to provide a $3.44 billion \nincrease for IHS clinical services. Unfortunately, we lost that chance \nbecause not a single Republican Senator was willing to apply toward \nIndian health a small fraction of the revenue that will be raised from \nclosing tax loopholes that allow people to avoid paying their fair \nshare of taxes.\n  Some may view this budget resolution as an insignificant exercise. It \nis not. Unless we do something to increase the funding available to the \nAppropriations Committee--specifically the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee--it will be next to impossible to increase Indian health \nfunding to any significant degree.\n  I hope my colleagues will stop and think about the weight of the \ndecisions they are making today. Because its budget is so woefully \ninadequate, the Indian Health Service is forced to use a literal ``life \nor limb'' standard to ration health care for Indian men, women, and \nchildren--people whose health care is supposed to be guaranteed. Indian \npeople are suffering--some are literally dying--because we are failing \nto provide them the kind of care that most Americans, and every single \none of us, take for granted.\n  We have been here before. We had this same debate last year. Then, \nlike today, my Republican colleagues opposed a real increase for IHS \nclinical services and instead offered a phantom increase that was one-\ntenth of the amount of the increase needed to meet the basic health \ncare needs of the current IHS user population.\n  The only difference this year is that the ``increase'' they are \noffering is less than one-tenth of the amount of the increase needed to \nmeet the basic health care needs of the current IHS user population, \nand even less than the amount they offered last year.\n  Of course, any increase for the Indian Health Service is welcome. I \nwill be glad if we can treat even one more Indian child the way that he \nor she deserves to be treated. But my colleagues should know that the \nMurkowski amendment does not add one penny to the Appropriations \nCommittee's allocation. It does not increase the amount of money \navailable to the subcommittee appropriators who must find the funding \nthis amendment claims to provide. It leaves the Indian Health Service \nto compete for funds with Indian education, tribal colleges, tribal \ncourts and police, reservation roads, as well as the Denali National \nPark, Mount Rushmore, and all the other important priorities that \nsubcommittee funds.\n  The function 920 account is not a secret pot of money from which to \ndraw. This amendment--if it is not dropped in conference the way last \nyear's amendment was--would force the Appropriations Committee to cut \nthe domestic discretionary programs already severely shortchanged under \nthis scandalous budget resolution. Remember, this budget resolution \nalready cuts domestic discretionary spending by $14.6 billion compared \nto last year.\n  Will the money come from our national parks? No Child Left Behind--\nand we know they are being left behind? HUD? NIH? COPS? Perhaps the \nBIA's reorganization initiative? I might support that cut.\n  They will not tell us which programs they would cut, because they \nknow our domestic discretionary accounts can't absorb any more cuts, \nand because this amendment isn't real. It will not add a penny to the \nIHS clinical services account.\n  Will the phantom money be there after the House and Senate \nRepublicans return from conference? It certainly was not last year.\n  That money was missing from the fiscal year 2004 Interior \nappropriations bill, too, when 45 Republican senators blocked my \namendment to make real their professed $292 million commitment to \nIndian health.\n  Yet again, my colleagues on the other side are making a specious \nargument. At the same time they're refusing to close loopholes that \nallow people who owe taxes to avoid paying their fair share, at the \nsame time they are proposing new tax cuts for millionaires, they are \nsaying this country cannot afford to honor its treaty obligation--and \nits clear moral obligation--to Native Americans.\n  I hope the Senate will reject that argument and put us on the road to \nrighting this indefensible wrong.\n  Senators can vote for this amendment, but no one should be confused \nabout its impact. I can assure you that Native Americans will not be. \nStill, I will support this amendment with the hope that the conferees \nwill find a way to provide a real increase for the Indian Health \nService.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2822.\n  The amendment (No. 2822) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, Senator Dodd is next on our side with an \namendment. I ask Senator Dodd to proceed at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

RESERVE FUND FOR THE 21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING \n                   CENTERS PROGRAM.\n\n       The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     shall revise the aggregates, functional totals, allocations \n     to the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate, \n     discretionary spending limits, and other appropriate levels \n     and limits in this resolution by up to $1,000,000,000 in \n     budget authority for fiscal year 2005, and by the amount of \n     outlays flowing therefrom in 2005 and subsequent years, for a \n     bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, or conference \n     report that provides additional fiscal year 2005 \n     discretionary appropriations, in excess of levels provided in \n     this resolution, for the 21st Century Community Learning \n     Centers program in the Department of Education.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment deals with afterschool \nprograms. I know most of my colleagues are tremendously supportive of \nthis program. When we passed the No Child Left Behind Act 2 years ago, \nwe insisted that we fund, to the extent possible, $2 billion for \nafterschool programs.\n  Over the last 2 years, we have only funded half of that program, \nserving a little more than 1 million children when the need exceeds 2 \nmillion children. I think all of us have given talks in our States \nabout the value of afterschool programs. The President himself has \ntalked eloquently about it, saying afterschool programs keep kids safe, \nhelp working families, and improve academic achievements. He is \nabsolutely right. But we are leaving more than 1 million children \nbehind as a result of not fully funding at the authorized levels \nafterschool programs.\n  I am asking, with this amendment, that we fund with an additional $1 \nbillion to reach more than 1 million kids who could really use this \ncritically important program. Over the years this body has \noverwhelmingly supported afterschool initiatives. This is an \nopportunity for us to live up to the requirements that we insisted upon \nwhen we passed the No Child Left Behind Act 2 years ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to be supportive of this effort. We pay for the \n$1 billion by reducing the tax cut for the most affluent Americans by \n$1 billion. That is a tiny fraction that can serve over 1 million \nchildren in afterschool programs.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was hoping my colleague from \nConnecticut, my very good friend, since the hour is getting late, would \naccept a voice vote. Maybe not yet. Maybe people will start considering \nthat option. Most people know how the votes might come out.\n  This is a $2 billion tax increase. Again, it is only directed at the \nmillionaires or the upper income bracket, but, of course, that is not \nwhat the Finance Committee gets. The Finance Committee gets a \nresolution that says raise revenues.\n  Then I look at the function it hopes to have the money go to. It \nwould increase by 100 percent. I keep hearing people say we want \ndeficit reduction, but I keep seeing programs grow by 100 percent, 140 \npercent.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2822. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we are making very good progress. For the \ninformation of our Members, I think momentarily we will be able to \ndispose of seven or eight amendments.\n  I believe the Senator from Georgia wishes to discuss an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I had an amendment I intended to offer, \nbut after consultation with the committee chairman, the hour is late \nand I probably would have wound up withdrawing the amendment anyway.\n  What my amendment sought to do was to make a correction in an \namendment that was presented at the full committee markup. At that \nmarkup, there was an amendment passed relative to the issue of payment \nlimitation in the farm bill.\n  Payment limitation in the farm bill doesn't mean a whole lot to \nanybody unless you are a farmer. Farmers, as long as they are treated \nequally, have no problem with the various farm programs we have under \nthe farm bill. But what has happened with the payment limitation is we \nhave rewritten the farm bill during the middle of the farm bill and \nthat is not fair.\n  What my amendment sought to do was to take one portion of the overall \nfarm bill, which is the ethanol portion, and simply equalize payments \nto those growers of corn who participate in the ethanol program, add \nthe payments they receive--and they don't receive them directly. We \nwould have to figure out, through a complicated formula, how much they \nget, add the amount of money to their payment limitation portion so it \nwould equalize. They would be equal with every other farmer across the \ncountry with respect to payment limitation.\n  It would be a complicated situation, and I think at some point in \ntime down the road, if those who insist on revision of the payment \nlimitations do so prior to the expiration of the farm bill, we are \nsimply going to come back with an amendment. We will come back with an \namendment at a later time to seek\n\n[[Page S2654]]\n\nto do that. However, I hope all Members of the Senate who come from \nagricultural States will continue to work together for the interest of \nour farmers and make sure we carry out the terms of the current farm \nbill. When it expires in 2008, we will again look at all these issues \nand decide what is fair to the American consumer and for the American \nfarmer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, No. 1, I thank my colleague from Georgia \nfor his brief discussion and for not offering the amendment. I think if \nhe offered the amendment we might be here a little while.\n  I believe the chairman of the Agriculture Committee would like to \nmake a few comments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I want to express my opposition to the \nprovision in the budget resolution that shifts $1.221 billion over the \nnext 5 years from farm programs to other programs under the \njurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee.\n  This provision assumes reducing statutory payment limitations for \nfarm program payments to producers of wheat, feed grains, oilseeds, \ncotton and rice from $40,000 to $20,000 for direct payments and from \n$65,000 to $30,000 for counter-cyclical payments. In addition, the \nproposal would include certificate transactions and loan forfeitures \nunder the marketing loan program's payment limitation.\n  I oppose this provision for a number of reasons. First, the 2002 farm \nbill, enacted less than 2 years ago, has already reduced payment \nlimitations compared to the 1996 farm bill by establishing a means test \nfor farm program benefits in which individuals with over $2.5 million \nin adjusted gross income are ineligible for payments unless at least 75 \npercent of that income comes from agriculture. Moreover, the 2002 farm \nbill's limit of $105,000 for the sum of direct and counter cyclical \npayments is 12 percent less than the 1977 farm bill's limit on \ncomparable purpose deficiency payments after adjustment for inflation. \nSenators should remember that these payments do not necessarily \nrepresent profit to the farmer, but rather this shows that in real \nterms, we already have reduced farm program supports in two separate \nways.\n  Second, the 2002 farm bill established a Commission on the \nApplication of Payment Limitations to analyze and to make \nrecommendations regarding these issues in a report to the President and \nto the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. The Commission, which \nis composed of 10 individuals who possess a tremendous amount of \nexperience in, and knowledge about, U.S. agriculture, released its \nreport in August of last year. The Commission's first and primary \nconsensus recommendation was that no substantial changes should be made \nto the 2002 farm bill's system of farm program payment limitations \nuntil the farm bill is reauthorized for the 2008 and later crops. The \nCommission reasoned that the multiyear nature of farm bills provides \nstability for production agriculture and that producers, their lenders, \nand other agribusiness firms make long-term investment decisions based \non this multiyear legislation. The Senate should follow the \nCommission's recommendation and should not make changes in farm program \npayment limitations.\n  Third, southern cotton and rice farms tend to be larger, and the \ncosts of production are much greater, than wheat, corn, and soybean \nfarms in other regions. The Grassley provision would reduce government \npayments to cotton and rice producers. Moreover, the provision would \nseverely complicate crop farmers' ability to use the marketing loan \nprogram, particularly during periods of low market prices when \nproducers need it most. The marketing loan program, as its name \nimplies, helps farmers market their crops by providing them with \nbenefits when market prices fall below government established loan \nrates. In such situations, program benefits offset the impact of low \nprices with a minimum of government involvement in the marketplace. \nThis provision would, for the first time, require that loan program \ncertificate transactions and loan forfeitures be included under the \nprogram's payment limitation. The provision, if implemented, would mean \nthat once a producer reaches the limit, marketing loan benefits would \nbe cut off regardless of the market situation.\n  Fourth, the budget resolution should provide us with a broad plan for \nFederal revenues and expenditures but leave policy decisions within \nthat budget framework to the authorizing committees. This proposal \nviolates that principle by attempting to dictate policy to the \nAgriculture Committee without having any impact on the overall level of \nFederal expenditures. It simply shifts over $1 billion in payments from \none group of farmers to another. That is a decision that should be made \nby the Agriculture Committee--not the Budget Committee.\n  Fourteen major agriculture and commodity organizations have written \nto the Budget Committee opposing changes in the farm bill. The budget \nresolution, as adopted, would make changes in the commitments that were \nmade to farmers and ranchers in the Farm Bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters from farm groups and \nproducers who oppose the Grassley provision be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 1, 2004.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Nickles and Ranking Member Conrad: On behalf \n     of the undersigned U.S. farm and commodity organizations, we \n     write to express concern over the agricultural provisions of \n     the budget proposal submitted by the administration for \n     fiscal year 2005.\n       Under the President's plan, the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture's budget authority for discretionary programs in \n     2005 would be reduced about $1.7 billion or 8.1 percent \n     compared to the spending levels adopted for the current \n     fiscal year. When the increased spending for additional \n     homeland security responsibilities are included, the \n     effective reduction in budget authority for traditional USDA \n     programs climbs to nearly $2.1 billion or 10 percent of total \n     discretionary spending authority.\n       Due in part to weather related production shortfalls in \n     many parts of the world, including the U.S., over the past \n     three years and modest improvements in both export and \n     domestic market conditions, commodity program support and \n     related payments declined by about $4.8 billion in FY 2004 \n     compared to the August 2003 baseline. The five-year cost of \n     the farm bill is now projected to cost $14.6 billion less \n     than projected by the Congressional Budget Office in its \n     August 2002 estimates which were made shortly after the 2002 \n     farm legislation was enacted. These savings represent \n     additional ``real'' dollar reductions in federal expenditures \n     for commodity program outlays that are not fully considered \n     in the budget process.\n       When all these factors are considered, production \n     agriculture and rural communities are being asked to take a \n     disproportionate reduction in important programs, including \n     conservation, research, energy, rural development, and \n     international food assistance, that were authorized in the \n     bi-partisan farm legislation signed by the president in 2002.\n       Agricultural producers and rural communities have yet to \n     recover from the effects of the agricultural recession which \n     for many began in 1997 and the severe economic losses \n     associated with ongoing weather disasters that have occurred \n     since the 2001 production year for which assistance has been \n     minimal.\n       As you consider a budget for FY 2005, we urge that you \n     oppose reductions in the commitments made in the 2002 farm \n     bill. As such, we urge that you oppose the adoption of a \n     resolution that either incorporates the President's \n     agriculture spending proposals or includes reconciliation \n     instruction to the agriculture authorizing committee.\n       Efforts to enhance economic opportunities for America's \n     farmers and rural communities require that the federal budget \n     be able to accommodate a meaningful economic safety net for \n     producers, expand our nation's resource conservation, \n     renewable energy and agricultural research activities while \n     addressing a broad range of rural development and global \n     hunger needs.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Corn Growers Association,\n         American Farm Bureau Federation,\n         Farm Credit Council,\n         National Association of Wheat Growers,\n         National Cotton Council,\n         National Farmers Union,\n         National Grain Sorghum Producers,\n         National Grange,\n         National Grape Cooperative,\n         R-CALF USA,\n\n[[Page S2655]]\n\n         Soybean Producers of America,\n         U.S.A. Rice Federation,\n         U.S. Rice Producers Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n                                                    March 3, 2004.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee,\n     Dirksen Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Nickles: I am writing today on behalf of the \n     National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and our 33,000 \n     grower members regarding the Fiscal Year 2005 Budget \n     Resolution now under consideration by your committee. While \n     we recognize the concerns over rising federal budget \n     deficits, NCGA strongly opposes any action that reopens the \n     2002 Farm Bill, including amendments that reduce payment \n     limits within the farm safety net programs. Today's farm bill \n     is a carefully balanced measure that required give and take \n     among farm organizations and multiple stakeholders.\n       NCGA believes that proposals to further restrict farm \n     support payments are extremely divisive as well as \n     inequitable for those producers who must make sound, long \n     range business and financing decisions based on the current \n     farm bill provisions. Changes that would impose even more \n     restricting payment limits will cut off support to producers \n     when they most need assistance--at times of extremely low \n     prices. The fact is today's farm bill includes more stringent \n     limitations than those of the previous farm policy. NCGA \n     continues to support those limitations on direct and \n     countercyclical payments as well as marketing loan benefits.\n       While our grower members remain very supportive of \n     additional funding for new conservation initiatives, \n     nutrition programs, and rural development value-added grants, \n     it is the view of NCGA that amendments to achieve budget \n     savings for these programs at the expense of the farm safety \n     net would result in more harm than good. We can ill afford to \n     undermine a policy that is designed to restore long-term \n     fiscal discipline in agriculture spending. The Congressional \n     Budget Office's recent projection of $8 billion dollars in \n     reduced expenditures over the next ten years underscores the \n     need for Congress to maintain a steady course and keep its \n     commitment to the 2002 Farm Bill.\n       Finally, NCGA urges the Committee to consider the work of \n     the Payment Limitations commission. This bipartisan committee \n     authorized by Congress thoroughly reviewed the data from \n     agriculture policy experts, opposing points of view from \n     individual producers and farm organizations and recommended \n     no substantial changes prior to the expiration of the 2002 \n     Farm Bill. The Commission, in fact, suggested administrative \n     and enforcement practices that call for improvements to \n     better implement the current law.\n       Again, NCGA recognizes the difficult task before you and \n     the members of the Senate Budget Committee. We appreciate \n     your leadership and careful consideration of our growers' \n     concerns as you proceed with your work on the FY 2005 Budget \n     Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dee Vaughan,\n                                                        President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank our colleagues from Mississippi and Georgia, \nbecause collectively they saved the Senate probably about two hours. I \nthank both of our colleagues for their cooperation. We are having very \ngood cooperation. We are getting rid of a lot of amendments. I know \nthere are a few that people want to have votes on, so please be patient \nand we will try to have voice votes on every other amendment we \nconsider tonight.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum for a very brief \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe that the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee has an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2823\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Senator Bingaman and I have an amendment \nthat has been agreed to on both sides. I call up amendment No. 2823 and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2823.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To return to the original scoring of the energy savings \n                     performance contract program)\n\n       On page 43, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n       (c) Energy Savings Performance Contract Program.--In \n     recognition that the energy savings performance contract \n     program recoups its costs through guaranteed savings without \n     increasing budgetary outlays, the Congressional Budget Office \n     shall score the energy savings performance contract program \n     under title VIII of the National Energy Conservation Policy \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) as zero. For the purposes of any \n     point of order under any concurrent resolution on the budget \n     and the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the cost of the \n     energy savings performance contract program under title VIII \n     of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 801 \n     et seq.) shall be zero.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the Energy \nSavings Performance Contract Program. It is a program that costs no \nmoney. It is all paid for by the savings that are accumulated. This has \nbeen cleared on both sides. Everyone is for it. I can't find anyone who \nis against it. The problem arose when CBO started scoring this after \nnot having scored it. By its very nature, it will not cost any money.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me congratulate my colleague, \nSenator Inhofe, for putting this amendment forward. It is a very \nmeritorious amendment. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I just inquire of the sponsor, what \nis the cost of this amendment and what is the source of the funding for \nit?\n  Mr. INHOFE. There is no cost to it. This is the Energy Savings \nPerformance Contract Program that allows a company to go into an Air \nForce base to show them how they can, through energy savings, save $2 \nor $3 million a year. Then they are compensated from the savings, and \nfrom that point forward it goes back to the recipient. There is no \ncost.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my understanding is this is directed \nscorekeeping. The committees are told this doesn't cost any money, but \nit does cost money. I was willing to take this amendment when I was \nunder the impression this didn't cost any money. But if we are going to \nstart down the road of saying things that cost money don't cost money, \nthen we have a real problem. I have a real problem with that amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. May I respond? There is no cost to this program, because \nno public dollars are involved. It is where someone goes in and finds \nways to save energy and, if they are successful in doing that, they \nmerely pay the money back. The Government doesn't get involved at all \nin the program. So there is no cost.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it was said nobody objects. I object. I \ndon't insist on a vote, but I am going to conference, and neither of \nthose Members advocating it are going to conference.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the interest of moving things along, I \nwant to register, to the extent there is directed scoring here, strong \nopposition. We cannot go down the path of saying things don't cost \nmoney. Maybe there is a view that it doesn't. But if the scorekeepers \nsay it does, and we start telling them it doesn't, that creates a \nserious problem. I am not going to insist on a vote. I have confidence \nthis will be taken care of in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2823) was agreed to.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 2831, 2833, 2717, 2699, and 2794\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Oklahoma if we \nmight take the package of seven we reached agreement on.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am happy to do that. I compliment our \nstaffers, and I see them running to the floor.\n  We have four amendments our joint staffs have worked on: One, Senator \nConrad's amendment on tribal colleges; one by Senator Bingaman on the \npediatric vaccine reserve fund; one by Senator Wyden on healthy \nforests; and one by Senator Kennedy on the SCHIP.\n  We have reviewed those, and I believe they have been approved by both \nsides.\n  I add one additional amendment by Senator Thomas and Senator Conrad, \nNo. 2794, dealing with rural health.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these five amendments be considered en \nbloc.\n\n[[Page S2656]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, these five are fine. We have an agreement \non both sides on these five.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments were agreed to en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2831\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding tribal colleges \n                           and universities)\n\n       At the end of the resolution, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES AND \n                   UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) American Indians from 250 federally recognized tribes \n     nationwide attend tribal colleges and universities, a \n     majority of whom are first-generation college students.\n       (2) Tribal colleges and universities are located in some of \n     the most isolated and impoverished areas in the Nation, yet \n     they are the Nation's most poorly funded institutions of \n     higher education. While the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Assistance Act, or ``Tribal College Act'' provides \n     funding based solely on Indian students, the colleges have \n     open enrollment policies providing access to postsecondary \n     education opportunities to all interested students, about 20 \n     percent of whom are non-Indian. With rare exception, tribal \n     colleges and universities do not receive operating funds from \n     the States for these non-Indian State resident students. Yet, \n     if these same students attended any other public institutions \n     in their States, the State would provide basic operating \n     funds to the institution.\n       (3) While Congress has been increasing annual \n     appropriations for tribal colleges in recent years, the \n     President's fiscal year 2005 budget recommends a $5,500,000 \n     decrease in institutional operating funds. This represents \n     the third consecutive year that the President's budget \n     proposed decreases that Congress must restore.\n       (4) Because of congressional budget restorations, the \n     tribal colleges funded through titles I and II of the \n     Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act are \n     within $19,000,000 of full funding at their authorized level.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced \n     by tribal colleges and universities and assumes that priority \n     consideration will be provided to them through funding of the \n     Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, the \n     Equity in Educational Land Grant Status Act, title III of the \n     Higher Education Act, and the National Science Foundation \n     Tribal College Program; and\n       (2) such priority consideration reflects the intent of \n     Congress to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding \n     authorization goals for tribal colleges and universities.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2833\n\n (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for expansion of the pediatric \n                     vaccine distribution program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. RESERVE FUND FOR EXPANSION OF PEDIATRIC VACCINE \n                   DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or \n     joint resolution, or an amendment thereto is offered or a \n     conference report thereon is submitted, that expands the \n     pediatric vaccine distribution program established under \n     section 1928 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396s) to \n     include coverage for children administered a vaccine at a \n     public health clinic or Indian clinic and repeals the price \n     cap for pre-1993 vaccines, the chairman of the Committee on \n     the Budget may revise allocations of new budget authority and \n     outlays, the revenue aggregates, and other appropriate \n     aggregates to reflect such legislation, provided that such \n     legislation would not increase the deficit for fiscal year \n     2005 and for the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2717\n\n  (Purpose: To increase investments in implementation of the Healthy \nForests Restoration Act to benefit national, forests, the environment, \n                local communities, and local, economies)\n\n  On page 11, line 9, increase the amount by $343,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 10, increase the amount by $84,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 14, increase the amount by $84,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 18, increase the amount by $84,000,000.\n       On page 11, line 22, increase the amount by $53,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 1, increase the amount by $38,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 5, decrease the amount by $343,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 6, decrease the amount by $84,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 10, decrease the amount by $84,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 14, decrease the amount by $84,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 18, decrease the amount by $53,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 22, decrease the amount by $38,000,000.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2699\n\n(Purpose: To prevent unspent SCHIP funds from reverting to the Treasury \n  rather than being used to provide coverage for low-income children)\n\n       On page 26, line 4, after ``measures'' insert ``and \n     including legislation to reallocate and maintain expiring \n     SCHIP funds rather than allowing such funds to revert to the \n     Treasury''.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2794\n\n  (Purpose: To restore discretionary funding levels for crucial rural \n health programs, such as the rural health and outreach grant program, \n   the rural hospital flexibility grant program, the small hospital \n    improvement program, telehealth, trauma programs, and rural AED \n     programs to fiscal year 2004 levels and offset this change by \n           reductions in overall government travel expenses)\n\n       On page 16, line 12, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 13, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 5, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 6, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2699\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, every child deserves a healthy start in \nlife, but too many children do not receive it. Their parents work hard, \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, but all their hard work is not enough \nto buy the health insurance their children need.\n  The consequences for the 8 million children who are uninsured are \ndevastating. Three hundred thousand children suffer from asthma and \nnever see a doctor because they are uninsured. Three hundred and fifty \nthousand children with recurrent earaches or severe sore throats never \nsee a doctor because their families are uninsured. Uninsured children \nare more likely to miss school, have worse grades, and are less likely \nto succeed later in life.\n  While the 8.5 million children who remain uninsured challenge our \nconscience as a nation and tell us how much more needs to be done, for \nmillions of these low- and moderate-income children of working parents, \nthe Child Health Insurance Program has been a lifeline and safety net.\n  The CHIP program has been extraordinarily successful in providing \nhealth insurance coverage to children. Even as the number of uninsured \nadults has risen dramatically, the number of uninsured children has \nactually fallen. Almost 6 million children are now enrolled in CHIP and \ngetting the care they need and the care they deserve.\n  The children's program has had growing pains--it took longer than \nanticipated for the program to get off the ground and even today, more \nthan 4 million children are uninsured even though they are eligible for \neither Medicaid or CHIP. Yet, the program is working well and the only \nlimitation to its continued expansion is lack of funds. More than $1 \nbillion in unused CHIP dollars are due to revert to the Treasury this \nyear at the same time that many states are running out of CHIP dollars. \nIt would be tragic if these funds are lost to the children who need \nhelp, and it would be a sad commentary on our national priorities if we \nallow it to happen.\n  Last year, we faced a similar situation and, with overwhelming \nbipartisan support, we passed legislation to keep expiring CHIP funds \navailable for children. We need to take the same decisive action this \nyear. This amendment gives the Congress the flexibility to meet this \nneed. It would clarify that the existing, budget neutral reserve fund \nto address the needs of the uninsured could be used to prevent CHIP \nfunds from reverting.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment and it deserves bipartisan support. \nSick children belong to no political party. And members on both sides \nof the aisle have an obligation to act now, as they have in the past, \nto meet their needs.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2810, As Modified\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also believe there is a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution by the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Pryor, dealing \nwith LIHEAP. That is at no cost, and we have no objection to that sense \nof the Senate as well. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2810), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2657]]\n\n(Purpose: Stating the sense of the Senate regarding the Low-Income Home \n  Energy Assistance Program and the weatherization assistance program)\n\n       At the end of title V, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States is in the grip of pervasively higher \n     home energy prices;\n       (2) high natural gas, heating oil, and propane prices are, \n     in general, having an effect that is rippling through the \n     United States economy and are, in particular, impacting home \n     energy bills;\n       (3) while persons in many sectors can adapt to natural gas, \n     heating oil, and propane price increases, persons in some \n     sectors simply cannot;\n       (4) elderly and disabled citizens who are living on fixed \n     incomes, the working poor, and other low-income individuals \n     face hardships wrought by high home energy prices;\n       (5) the energy burden for persons among the working poor \n     often exceeds 20 percent of those persons' incomes under \n     normal conditions;\n       (6) under current circumstances, home energy prices are \n     unnaturally high, and these are not normal circumstances;\n       (7) while critically important and encouraged, State energy \n     assistance and charitable assistance funds have been \n     overwhelmed by the crisis caused by the high home energy \n     prices;\n       (8) the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (referred to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') and the companion \n     weatherization assistance program (referred to in this \n     section as ``WAP''), are the Federal Government's primary \n     means to assist eligible low-income individuals in the United \n     States to shoulder the burdens caused by their home cooling \n     and heating needs;\n       (9) in 2003, LIHEAP reached only 15 percent of the persons \n     in the United States who were eligible for assistance under \n     the program;\n       (10) since LIHEAP's inception, its inflation-adjusted \n     buying power has eroded by 58 percent; and\n       (11) current Federal funding for LIHEAP is not sufficient \n     to meet the cooling and heating needs of low-income families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) an adequate increase in funding for each of fiscal \n     years 2005 and 2006 to carry out the LIHEAP program;\n       (2) an adequate increase in funding for fiscal year 2005 \n     and an adequate increase in funding for fiscal year 2006 to \n     carry out the WAP program;\n       (3) appropriations, for these programs, of sufficient \n     additional funds to realistically address the cooling and \n     heating needs of low-income families; and\n       (4) advance appropriations of the necessary funds to ensure \n     the smooth operation of the programs during times of peak \n     demand.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank our colleagues. We are making \ngood progress. We have a few more to go. We might have to have a couple \nmore votes. I want people to be patient and expect as much.\n  My colleague from Kentucky has been waiting and he is ready to offer \nan amendment. Possibly it can be accepted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I might ask that we hold off until we \nhave had the ranking member of the Finance Committee look at that \namendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of all colleagues, we \nare still shopping a few more amendments. We are trying to get \nbipartisan agreement on about half a dozen amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2832\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Enzi and Senator Cantwell have an \namendment which I believe both sides have agreed to. I send the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickes] for Mr. Enzi and Ms. \n     Cantwell, proposes an amendment numbered 2832.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: Increase funding for the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) by \n          $250 million in FY 2005, by increasing Function 500)\n\n       On page 15, line 16, increase the amount by $250,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 17, increase the amount by $32,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 21, increase the amount by $166,000,000.\n       On page 15, line 25, increase the amount by $44,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 4, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 5, decrease the amount by $250,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 6, decrease the amount by $32,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 10, decrease the amount by $166,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 14, decrease the amount by $44,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 18, decrease the amount by $5,000,000.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, and also Senator Cantwell. Again, this is going to save \nus about 45 minutes because they had different amendments and they came \nto a compromise.\n  I compliment them for that and urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can we slow down a minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what does the amendment do?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could we ask a sponsor to briefly describe the amendment \nfor colleagues.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this bill provides $250 million for the \nWorkforce Investment Act training, and it takes it out of 920.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2832) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2780\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Clinton, we have an \namendment that establishes a reserve fund for addressing minority \nhealth disparities, an agreement on both sides.\n  I ask for approval of our colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for Mrs. \n     Clinton, for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 2780.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for addressing minority health \n                              disparities)\n\n       On page 28, after line 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.__ . RESERVE FUND FOR ADDRESSING MINORITY HEALTH \n                   DISPARITIES.\n\n       If the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate reports a \n     bill or joint resolution, or an amendment thereto is offered \n     or a conference report thereon is submitted, that addresses \n     minority health disparities through activities including \n     those at the HHS Office of Minority Health, the Office of \n     Civil Rights, the National Center on Minority Health and \n     Health Disparities, the Minority HIV/AIDS initiative, health \n     professions training, and through the Racial and Ethnic \n     Approaches to Community Health at the Centers for Disease \n     Control and provides not to exceed $400,000,000 in new budget \n     authority for fiscal year 2005, the chairman of the Committee \n     on the Budget may revise allocations of new budget authority \n     and outlays and other appropriate aggregates to reflect such \n     legislation, provided that such legislation would not \n     increase the deficit for fiscal year 2005 and for the period \n     of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is long past time for our country to \nface up to the fact of the health care crisis for minorities. African \nAmericans infants are twice as likely to die from Sudden Infant Death \nSyndrome as white babies. African Americans ages 55 to 64 are three \ntimes as likely to die from stroke as whites. HIV infection in African \nAmerican women is four times the rate in white women. For almost every \ndisease, African Americans are more likely to live sicker and die \nsooner.\n  These troubling health statistics are not unique to African \nAmericans. Latinos, American Indians, Alaska Natives, and a number of \nAsian American populations face significantly higher rates of illness, \ndisability, and death from acute or chronic diseases.\n  The administration says it is committed to improving minority health \nbut the Republican budget doesn't reflect this commitment. Instead, as \nthe health crisis continues to escalate, the budget stays the same or \nis actually reduced for some programs.\n\n[[Page S2658]]\n\n  This amendment is a specific step to improve minority health and \nminority health care. It creates a deficit-neutral reserve fund for \naddressing minority health disparities through federal health agencies \nand programs. By contrast, the President's budget cut funding for the \nOffice of Minority Health and sets the budget of the Office for Civil \nRights so low that the office will be virtually powerless to carry out \nits mission. Our amendment provides more funds for both offices.\n  With additional funding, the CDC's REACH program, which funds \ncommunity-based efforts to reduce disparities, will be expanded, and so \nwill the Minority HIV/AIDS program. Greater support is needed for the \nNational Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities, and our \namendment will provide it.\n  The President's budget essentially zeroed out funds for training in \nthe health professions, including programs that support diversity \ntraining and cultural competency programs. Yet, just a year ago, on the \nbirthday of Martin Luther King, Jr, the President said, ``We should not \nbe satisfied with the current number of minorities on America's college \ncampuses.'' Diversity programs in medical schools and in the health \nprofessions deserve continued funding, and our amendment will provide \nit.\n  Minority Americans will suffer unfairly from the administration's \nneglect. We can't turn a blind eye to the health needs of a quarter of \nour population. The need is too great and I urge the Senate to do the \nright thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have reviewed the amendment and have \nno objection.\n  For the information of our colleagues, that eliminates a couple of \namendments. I thank our colleagues for cooperation and urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2780) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Landrieu, is next on \nthis side. She is prepared to go.\n  I say to Senator McConnell, the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee has looked over his amendment, and that is not something we \ncould accept at this point. I don't know if he is interested in going \nforward with the amendment at this stage.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from North Dakota, I would like to \ngo on and offer the amendment. I am perfectly content to have it laid \naside and have a vote. I will ask for a vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. There should be some discussion on this amendment. It is \na very important amendment. This is an amendment that raises a point of \norder against any revenue measure which has the effect of an increase \nin the tax rate at the top bracket. I don't think that is something----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I just ask what the Senator wants to do at \nthis point. Does he want to proceed on a discussion? This is obviously \nsomething that cannot be accepted and would require some discussion at \nthis point.\n  What is the desire of the chairman?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe we have had lots and lots of \nvotes. I hope we can avoid any more votes, but my guess is we will have \nto have some. My guess is we will have a vote on NIH--maybe not; maybe \nthat can be agreed to. We may have to have a vote on this. That is \nfine. You just mentioned an additional amendment, and that was Senator \nLandrieu?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Landrieu has a pending amendment, Senator Durbin \nhas an amendment pending, Senator Schumer has a pending amendment, \nSenator Graham of Florida, Senator Reed, Senator Levin.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Don't keep pointing. It is not fair to tell our \ncolleague from Kentucky he does not get a vote and we have six people \nraising their hands.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let's be clear. No one on our side is saying the Senator \ncannot get a vote. He certainly can get a vote. The point is it will \ntake a vote and some discussion. There is a point of order that lies \nagainst his amendment. The Senator has every right to seek a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will ask my colleague to call upon one of his \ncolleagues to offer an amendment that will require a vote. In the \nmeantime, we will see if we cannot negotiate an agreeable arrangement \nfor the Senator from Kentucky to have a vote on his amendment and on \nthe NIH.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Landrieu would be next on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2775\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask to call up amendment No. 2775.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2775.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for eliminating the Survivor Benefit Plan--Social \n  Security offset for military widows and widowers while reducing the \n  debt, offset by the elimination of tax benefits to individuals and \n   corporations that avoid United States taxation by establishing a \n       foreign domicile and other tax loopholes and tax shelters)\n\n       On page 3, line 9, increase the amount by $876,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 10, increase the amount by $1,054,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 11, increase the amount by $998,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 12, increase the amount by $1,066,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $1,520,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, increase the amount by $876,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, increase the amount by $1,054,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, increase the amount by $998,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, increase the amount by $1,066,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, increase the amount by $1,520,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $876,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $1,054,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $998,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $1,066,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $1,520,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, increase the amount by $876,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, increase the amount by $1,930,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, increase the amount by $2,928,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, increase the amount by $3,994,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $5,514,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by $876,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, increase the amount by $1,930,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, increase the amount by $2,928,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, increase the amount by $3,994,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, increase the amount by $5,514,000,000.\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

On behalf of myself, Senator Murray, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Lincoln, Senator Daschle, Senator Reid of Nevada, Senator \nNelson of Florida, Senator Johnson, Senator Clinton, and on behalf of \n5.5 million members of the military coalition and their families, I ask \nmy colleagues to consider giving us the 51 votes necessary to pass this \nimportant amendment tonight. This amendment will restore the full \npension promised and counted on by widows and widowers of our military \npersonnel. This particular group of patriots is ironically the only \ngroup of Federal employees to see their\n\n[[Page S2659]]\n\npension plan reduced by an average of 37 percent.\n  If we receive 51 votes in this Chamber tonight, there will be 250,000 \nwidows, primarily, some widowers, who will see their pensions \nincreased, and over a million potential widows and widowers will see \ntheir pension increased.\n  For the State of Alabama, 6,000 families will be directly affected; \nthe State of Georgia, 9,000 families; Maryland, 5,700; North Carolina, \n8,000; Ohio, 5,000; Pennsylvania, 7,000; South Carolina, 6,000; Texas, \n21,000; and Virginia, 13,000. If we do not pass this amendment, all of \nthese families and widows will receive hundreds of dollars less per \nmonth than they were counting on and we promised.\n  The offset would be to make sure that people who earn money in the \nUnited States and try to flee and go other places and claim that they \nare patriots, we would let them pay the tax so these real patriots, the \npeople who moved every 2 years and put their lives on the line and then \ncounted on their pension, would really get it.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma will say it costs money and it will close a \ntax loophole for those who flee so they do not pay taxes to support our \ntroops. This body should pay the pensions of the military widows and \nwidowers. That is what my amendment will do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. We just need a little time to look at the amendment. I \ngot caught off guard. We will consider your amendment. If the Senator \ndoes not mind, we will set it aside temporarily and try to dispose of \nit in a very short period of time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum. We need a little break to assess \nwhere we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, \nthis is where we stand at this moment on this side. We are down to \nabout 10 amendments that would require votes if we are not able to work \nthem out.\n  Let me list, on our side, the amendments and the rough order. Please \ndo not hold me to this specific order, other than the first five, \nbecause it is really the first five that we have made commitments on: \nSenator Landrieu, the amendment she has already offered; Senator Levin, \non homeland security; Senator Durbin, on global AIDS; Senator \nLautenberg, on debt limit; Senator Schumer, an amendment that relates \nto the Energy bill; and then, in addition to that, Senator Dayton, on \nIDEA; Senator Graham, on Pell grants; Senator Byrd, on bioshield; \nSenator Lincoln, with respect to the childcare tax credit; and Senator \nKennedy, on Medicare.\n  Those are the remaining major amendments on this side. I think that \ngets them all. There is also an amendment that is cosponsored by a \nnumber of people on our side as well as people on the other side. We \nalso have a Reed amendment on higher education; and Pryor on IRA, that \nwas not agreed to. We also have an amendment that is in negotiation, I \nmight say, from Senator Leahy, on nutrition.\n  On the other side, there is an amendment from Senator Dole on \nnutrition. There are amendments on the other side that maybe the \nchairman could review.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have a couple, three on our side that \nmay require votes. I think we may be able to work out a few of these \nwithout votes. That is my intention. It is my hope. I am relatively \nsure we are not going to agree to Senator Dayton's amendment. If he \ninsists on a rollcall vote, we can vote on that. We need to have a \nrollcall vote, I believe, on NIH. We only have a couple on our side. \nAnd we have had very few on our side.\n  I might just mention, we agreed to about four, six Democrat \namendments, and you agreed to one or two of ours. We need a little more \ncooperation. I think we can finish tonight. That would be my intention. \nI apologize because I know for some colleagues it is getting very late, \nbut I am afraid if we come back tomorrow we might have 20 votes. I do \nbelieve we can continue plowing ahead.\n  I thought when we agreed to Senator Pryor's one amendment, that was \nit for the night. Maybe we did not have quite the understanding I \nthought we did.\n  I would suggest this. Let's lay aside Senator Landrieu's amendment \nbecause we might be able to work that one out. I am not familiar with \nwhat Senator Levin's amendment is. I am familiar with Senator Dayton's \namendment. We can dispose of that very quickly. Pell grants--we have \nalready had four amendments on Pell grants, and we adopted an amendment \non Pell grants. I do not think we need another vote on Pell grants, is \nmy initial thought.\n  I would suggest, let's put one or two of these in the votes, and then \nmaybe we can work out the rest of these while we are voting on a couple \nof amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I recommend, in terms of the order \non this side, if we are putting aside Landrieu, with the hopes of \nperhaps working that out, that we go to Senator Levin. He is next on \nour side.\n  If the chairman would want to go to your side?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Could you give me a hint what his amendment might be?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Staff has a copy.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Still, I do not know what it is.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have to ask for people's patience, because, please \nunderstand, the staff of the chairman of the committee and my staff now \nhave in a queue a whole series of amendments that have been shared on \nboth sides but have not necessarily been evaluated fully by staff on \nboth sides.\n  Senator Levin's is on homeland security.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have voted on homeland security four \nor five times.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is a Levin-Collins amendment. It halts deliveries to \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the next 50 million barrels given \nthe price of gasoline and jet fuel.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let's look at it. I haven't looked at it yet. If the \nSenator wants to call up an amendment for a rollcall vote, I suggest we \ndo the Dayton amendment. I remember that from last year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is not next on our list. Next on our list after \nLevin--and perhaps that can be worked out, the Levin-Collins amendment; \nit is not additional money--is the Durbin global AIDS amendment. That \nis the next in our line.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Again, we have an amendment that Senator Lugar has on \nglobal AIDS in foreign affairs. Maybe they can get together and we can \neliminate a vote on both of those.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with one of \nthe most critical environmental issues in our Nation today. That is the \ninfrastructure needs of our cities and counties across the Nation. We \nhave a very significant unmet need in our water infrastructure that is \ncritical for the clean water and safe drinking water promises we have \nmade to our people. Accordingly, this amendment will add approximately \n$3.2 billion to the clean and safe drinking water revolving loan funds, \ngiving them the ability to significantly enhance the opportunities for \nour communities across this Nation to assure clean and safe water.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise before you today as a cosponsor \nof the Crapo amendment to increase the funds available for the clean \nwater and the drinking water State revolving funds.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of endorsement for the Crapo \namendment from the League of Conservation Voters, the League of Cities, \nvarious environmental organizations, labor, water and wastewater \ninfrastructure groups be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Association of State and Interstate Water pollution \n           Control Administrators,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2004.\n     Re Crapo/Sarbanes/Jeffords amendment in Support of Clean \n         Water Revolving Fund.\n\n       Dear Senator: The nation's rivers and lakes are our most \n     precious natural resource for drinking water and \n     environmental protection. The Budget Amendment offered by \n     Senators Crapo, Sarbanes and Jeffords would provide $3.2 \n     Billion in budget authority for the Clean Water State \n     Revolving Loan Fund (CWSRF). State Water Pollution Control \n     Programs are in significant need of these funds.\n       The CWSRF has been an extremely effective and efficient \n     mechanism to address point and nonpoint sources of pollution. \n     Increased capitalization not only will protect the \n     environment and public health, but also create jobs and \n     provide funds for securing the nation's water infrastructure. \n     Analysis suggests that at least $3 Billion is needed annually \n     to adequately capitalize the Fund. The return on Federal \n     investment in the CWSRF is excellent--over 1.97 times or is \n     nearly double the Federal capitalization.\n       The CWSRF has served the nation well, helping to achieve \n     environmental and public health goals and meet Clean Water \n     Act requirements. The Crapo/Sarbanes/Jeffords Amendment would \n     enable States to better meet the extremely large water \n     pollution control needs in local communities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Robbi Savage,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Water Environment Federation\n\n                                                    March 9, 2004.\n\n Support the Crapo/Sarbanes/Jeffords Amendment to Budget $5.2 Billion \n                for the Clean & Safe Drinking Water SRFs\n\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned organizations strongly urge \n     you to support the amendment by Senators Crapo, Sarbanes and \n     Jeffords to provide $3.2 billion in budget authority for the \n     Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) and $2 billion in \n     budget authority for the Drinking Water State Revolving Loan \n     Fund. The SRFs help local communities meet water quality \n     standards, repair and replace old and decaying pipelines and \n     plants, protect public health, and ensure continued progress \n     in restoring the health and safety of America's water bodies.\n       This investment is a much-needed down payment to improve \n     our nation's water and wastewater treatment plants. Your \n     support for additional funding for the SRFs would help \n     stimulate the economy, create jobs and provide funds for \n     securing our water infrastructure for generations to come. \n     Water infrastructure in the U.S. has become antiquated, with \n     many pipes as much as 50-100 years old. The funding increase \n     provided by this amendment is essential to protect our \n     nation's rivers and lakes and to assure clean water for \n     communities across the country.\n       When the Clean Water Act was passed more than thirty years \n     ago the federal government made a commitment to the American \n     people to clean up the nation's waters. At that time the \n     federal government funded 75 percent of the costs of \n     maintaining a clean water infrastructure in America; today \n     the federal government funds a mere 5%. At the current rate \n     of expenditures, the gap in funding for clean water \n     infrastructure would be more than half a trillion dollars by \n     2019.\n       We support this amendment because it increases water \n     funding substantially this year and takes a step toward a \n     longer-term solution for our nation's water needs.\n       Maintaining clean and safe water remains one of our \n     nation's highest priorities even though funding its continued \n     improvement is one of our greatest challenges.\n       $5.2 billion for the Clean & Safe Drinking Water SRFs.\n       We urge you to support the amendment to the Senate Budget \n     Resolution that would provide $5.2 billion for the Clean \n     Water and Safe Drinking Water SRFs.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jack Hoffbuhr,\n       Executive Director, American Water Works Association.\n     Diane VanDe Hei,\n       Executive Director, Association of Metropolitan Water \n     Agencies.\n     William Bertera,\n       Executive Director, Water Environment Federation.\n     Steve Hall,\n       Executive Director, Association of California Water \n     Agencies.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2004.\n     Re oppose S. Con. Res. 95, the Senate Budget Committee mark; \n         support pro-environmental amendments to the Fiscal Year \n         2005 Budget Resolution.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the political voice of the national environmental community. \n     Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation.\n       LCV urges Congress to oppose S. Con. Res. 95, the Senate \n     Committee Mark of the Fiscal Year 2005 Budget Resolution \n     which disproportionately targets programs that protect our \n     environment and natural resources, threatening clean air, \n     clean water, national parks, wildlife, and other critical \n     priorities. We urge you to protect our environment by voting \n     for all amendments that would provide needed resources to \n     protect the environment. In particular, we urge you to \n     support:\n       Lautenberg (D-NJ)--Boxer (D-CA) amendment to reinstate \n     Superfund ``polluter pays'' fees. Superfund waste sites \n     remain a serious public health threat. Taxpayers have picked \n     up an increasingly large share of the bill for cleanups since \n     the polluter pays fee expired in 1995, while overall funding \n     for the program has dropped by 35 percent. As a result, EPA \n     completed only 40 cleanups last year, half the average number \n     of cleanups during the mid to late-1990s. The Lautenberg-\n     Boxer amendment would reinstate the polluter pays mechanism, \n     providing nearly $1.6 billion in annual revenue and enabling \n     more cleanups to be completed.\n       Crapo (R-ID)--Sarbanes (D-MD)--Jeffords (I-VT) amendment to \n     increase clean water funding. Three decades after enactment \n     of the Clean Water Act, 40 percent of our nation's waters are \n     still too polluted for fishing and swimming. In addition, EPA \n     has estimated that over the next 20 years over $535 billion \n     in water infrastructure funding will be needed. This \n     amendment would provide a combined $5.2 billion for the Clean \n     Water State Revolving Fund and Safe Drinking Water State \n     Revolving Fund, enabling the federal government to help \n     states maintain and improve water and wastewater \n     infrastructure.\n       While we appreciate the need for Congress to address our \n     nation's fiscal problems, we oppose using this need as cover \n     for starving critical environmental programs while leaving \n     larger budget problems unresolved. We urge you to oppose the \n     Budget Committee mark, and to vote for needed spending \n     increases for clean water, healthy communities, national \n     parks, wildlife preservation, and the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on these issues in compiling LCV's 2004 Scorecard.

To address these limitations \n     effectively will require the development of new and \n     innovative partnerships and joint ventures if we are to \n     maintain and improve the nation's water quality goals and \n     priorities. All levels of government have a vested interest \n     in clean water and safe drinking water and total financial \n     responsibility for these objectives cannot be solely the \n     responsibility of local governments. Clean and safe water \n     have economic consequences, not only in municipalities, but \n     also of statewide and national significance. Therefore \n     investments in these objectives must also be shared.\n       We believe a reinvigorated federal financial partnership is \n     essential to assist local governments in maintaining and \n     enhancing this critical infrastructure and urge you to \n     support the Crapo-Sarbanes-Jeffords amendment allocating $5.2 \n     billion for fiscal 2005 for the Clean Water and Drinking \n     Water State Revolving Funds.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    Charles Lyons,\n     President, Selectman, Arlington, MA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 9, 2004.\n     Re support Senate Budget Resolution of $5.2 billion for Clean \n         & Safe Drinking Water SRFs.\n\n       Dear Senator: We write on behalf of our millions of members \n     who urge you to protect human health and the environment by \n     supporting the amendment sponsored by Senators Sarbanes, \n     Crapo, and Jeffords to provide $3.2 billion in budget \n     authority for the Clear Water State Revolving Loan Fund (SRF) \n     and $2 billion in budget authority for the Drinking Water \n     State Revolving Loan Fund. The SRFs help local communities \n     meet water quality standards, repair and replace old and \n     decaying pipelines and treatment plants, protect public \n     health, and ensure continued progress in restoring the health \n     and safety of America's water bodies.\n       This investment is a much-needed down payment to improve \n     our nation's water and wastewater treatment plants. Your \n     support for additional funding for the SRFs would help \n     stimulate the economy, create jobs and provide funds for \n     securing our water infrastructure for generations to come. As \n     the recent crisis with lead contamination from old pipes in \n     Washington, D.C. highlights, the nation faces a serious \n     drinking water problem as aging infrastructure deteriorates. \n     Water infrastructure in the U.S. has become antiquated, with \n     many pipes as much as 50-100 years old. The funding increase \n     provided by this amendment is essential to protect our \n     nation's rivers and lakes and to assure clean water for \n     communities across the country.\n       When the Clean Water Act was passed more than thirty years \n     ago the Federal Government made a commitment to the American \n     people to clean up the Nation's waters.

We need not remind you of the \n     pervasive anxiety shared by many Americans concerning our \n     economy and the so-called ``jobless recovery'' which persists \n     throughout the country. Congress needs to invest and grow the \n     economy through these types of water infrastructure \n     investments.\n       Please support the Sarbanes, Crapo and Jeffords amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Raymond J. Poupore,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. In the clean water arena, the budget before us today \nfails to recognize the staggering water resource needs of this Nation.\n  A recent poll by Frank Luntz, a well-known Republican pollster, \ndocuments the widespread support among Americans for Federal \ninvestments in clean water protections.\n  The poll showed that 91 percent of Americans are concerned that our \nwaterways will not be clean for our children and grandchildren.\n  It showed that 91 percent of Americans agree that if we are willing \nto invest billions of dollars annually in highways and airways, we \nshould be willing to make the necessary investments in our Nation's \nwaterways.\n  It showed that 90 percent of Americans believe that a Federal \ninvestment to guarantee clean water is a critical component of our \nNation's environmental well-being.\n  The Water Infrastructure Network in 2000 estimated $380 billion \ndollars are needed for clean water and drinking water over 20 years.\n  The EPA in 2002 estimated $270 billion are needed for clean water and \n$265 billion are needed for drinking water.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated a range of $132 and $388 \nbillion are needed for clean water and $70 and $362 billion are needed \nfor drinking water.\n  In light of these statistics, the administration responded with a 37-\npercent cut in the fiscal year 2005 budget.\n  This is truly astonishing.\n  In the last 5 years, an extremely broad consensus has emerged that \nmore money is needed for water infrastructure.\n  Time after time Americans express their outrage at the weakening of \nclean and safe water protections and express their willingness to pay \nto maintain water quality standards.\n  However, time after time, these strong statements fall on deaf ears \nin this administration.\n  The administration seems to recognize the need for water \ninfrastructure in Iraq, but fails to recognize it here at home.\n  The administration seeks close to $3.5 billion for water and sewer \nservices repair in Iraq, at the same time that it seeks a $500 million \ncut, close to a 40 percent reduction for clean water infrastructure \nspending, at home.\n  The administration seeks $775 million for water resources \nimprovements in Iraq, and a 5 percent cut for the Army Corps of \nEngineers at home.\n  It is the Army Corps of Engineers that is executing many of the \npublic works improvements in Iraq using expertise built at home.\n  The administration's cut was accompanied by a lengthy discussion of \nhow that cut was actually an increase due to outyear assumptions about \nspending.\n  My only reaction to these types of statements is that Americans can't \nget cleaner water with outyear assumptions.\n  The District of Columbia can't get lead-free pipes today with budget \ngimmicks and future promises.\n  The residents of Washington and our entire Nation need clean and safe \nwater now.\n\n[[Page S2662]]\n\n  Some say that the reductions proposed by the administration are only \npart of the budget game--that the administration really hopes that \nCongress will reinstate previous funding levels.\n  Perhaps this would be believable if these were isolated instances \nwhere this administration completely failed to support clean and safe \nwater programs.\n  But this is not an isolated instance.\n  This reduction was proposed against the backdrop of systematic \nactions to weaken, rollback, and fail to enforce clean and safe water \nprotections.\n  The fiscal year 2005 budget is not the proposal of an administration \nthat has made clean water a priority.\n  It is the proposal of an administration that from day one until the \npresent has systematically turned its back on the 90 percent of \nAmericans who are concerned about water quality.\n  I can only hope that those Americans are paying attention to today's \ndebate.\n  In 2004, I joined my colleagues, Senators Crapo and Sarbanes in \noffering an amendment to the fiscal year 2004 budget resolution that is \nsimilar to the amendment we offer today.\n  It was accepted without controversy by the full Senate, but later \ndropped in conference with the House.\n  It is time that we all start listening to the Americans who tell us \nover and over again that clean water is important to them. It is time \nto send a strong statement to the House of Representatives and the \nPresident that we will not stand by while water quality needs are \nshortchanged.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Crapo amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Crapo and Jeffords in, once again, offering this amendment to \nboost Federal funding for the clean water and safe drinking water state \nrevolving funds, SRF, from the level recommended in the budget \nresolution, $2.191 billion to $5.2 billion--$3.2 billion for the clean \nwater SRF and $2 billion for the safe drinking water SRF. The amendment \nis similar to the amendment which we offered to the fiscal year 2004 \nbudget resolution and which was agreed to by voice vote, but \nregrettably not approved by the House-Senate conference committee.\n  I spoke last year about the compelling need for increasing Federal \nsupport for our Nation's water infrastructure, and I just want to \nunderscore some of the key arguments today.\n  The President's fiscal year 2005 budget and this resolution once \nagain severely shortchange, in my judgment, the funds needed by State \nand local governments to upgrade their aging wastewater and drinking \nwater infrastructure. The President's budget provides only $1.7 billion \nfor both State revolving funds, split equally. This budget resolution \nrecommends $2.191 billion for both funds--which represents the fiscal \nyear 2004 enacted level of funding, but that is still far short of what \nis needed.\n  Despite important progress over the last three decades, EPA reports \nthat more than 40 percent of our Nation's lakes, rivers, and streams \nare still too impaired for fishing or swimming. Discharges from aging \nand failing sewerage systems, urban storm water and other sources, \ncontinue to pose serious threats to our Nation's waters, endangering \nnot only public health, but fishing and recreation industries. \nPopulation growth and development are placing additional stress on the \nNation's water infrastructure and its ability to sustain hard-won water \nquality gains.\n  Across the Nation, our wastewater and drinking water systems are \naging. In some cases, systems currently in use were built more than a \ncentury ago and have outlived their useful life. For many communities, \ncurrent treatment is not sufficient to meet water quality goals.\n  In April 2000, the Water Infrastructure Network, WIN, a broad \ncoalition of local elected officials, drinking water and wastewater \nservice providers, State environmental and health administrators, \nengineers and environmentalists released a report, ``Clean & Safe Water \nfor the 21st Century.'' The report documented a $23 billion a year \nshortfall in funding needed to meet national environmental and public \nhealth priorities in the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act \nand to replace aging and failing infrastructure.\n  In May 2002, the Congressional Budget Office released a report that \nestimated the spending gap for clean water needs between $132 billion \nand $388 billion over 20 years and the spending gap for drinking water \nneeds at between $70 billion and $362 billion over 20 years.\n  In September 2002, the EPA released a ``Clean Water and Drinking \nWater Infrastructure Gap Analysis'' which found that there will be a \n$535 billion gap between current spending and projected needs for water \nand wastewater infrastructure over the next 20 years if additional \ninvestments are not made. This figure does not even account for \ninvestments necessary to meet water quality goals in nutrient impaired \nwaters, such as the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The need for additional investment in wastewater and drinking water \ninfrastructure is clearly documented. But, States, localities and \nprivate sources can't meet the funding gap alone. States are currently \nfacing the worst fiscal crisis in 50 years and cannot afford to make \nnew investments in clean water and drinking water infrastructure. Water \npollution is an interstate problem that demands a Federal response. \nWater from six States flows into the Chesapeake Bay. Even if Maryland \nhad the resources to complete construction of all needed wastewater \ninfrastructure, the Chesapeake Bay cleanup efforts will only be \nsuccessful if similar investments are made in the five other States in \nthe Chesapeake Bay watershed. Without Federal assistance, however, it \nis unlikely that the upstream States will make a substantial investment \nin the water quality of the Bay. The Congress understood the interstate \ndynamic of pollution in 1972 when a bipartisan majority passed the \nClean Water Act and began funding waste treatment infrastructure. In \n1979 and 1980, the Congress provided $5 billion in clean water \nconstruction grants alone to assist municipalities with wastewater \ninfrastructure needs. Over the years, budgetary pressures and other \nfactors have reduced that funding level, and in fiscal year 2004, we \nprovided only $1.34 billion in clean water State revolving loan funds.\n  It is vital that the Federal Government maintain a strong partnership \nwith States and local governments in averting the massive projected \nfunding gap and share in the burden of maintaining and improving the \nNation's water infrastructure. Municipalities need significant \nresources to comply with Federal clean water and drinking water \nstandards. In the 107th Congress, House and Senate committees approved \nbills to authorize $20 billion over 5 years for the clean water act \nSRF, underscoring the recognition that something must be done to \naddress this funding gap. An increase in funding for the clean water \nSRF to $3.2 billion and for the drinking water SRF to $2 billion in \nfiscal year 2004 is the first step necessary to meet the Federal \nGovernment's longstanding commitment in this regard.\n  This is an investment in the health of Americans and in a clean \nenvironment that will pay substantial dividends. Wastewater treatment \nplants not only prevent billions of tons of pollutants each year from \nreaching our rivers, lakes, streams, and coasts, they also help prevent \nwater-borne diseases and make waters safe for swimming and fishing.\n  According to the Water Infrastructure Network:\n\n       Clean water supports a $50 billion a year water-based \n     recreation industry, at least $300 billion a year in coastal \n     tourism, a $45 billion annual commercial fishing and shell \n     fishing industry, and hundreds of billions of dollars a year \n     in basic manufacturing that relies on clean water. Clean \n     rivers, lakes, and coastlines attract investment in local \n     communities and increase land values on or near the water, \n     which in turn, create jobs, add incremental tax base, and \n     increase income and property tax revenue to local, state, and \n     the federal government. Some 54,000 community drinking water \n     systems provide drinking water to more than 250 million \n     Americans. By keeping water supplies free of contaminants \n     that cause disease, these systems reduce sickness and related \n     health care costs and absenteeism in the workforce.\n\n  They also create jobs--indeed tens of thousands of jobs--and provide \nstimulus to the economy. Each $1 billion in sewer and water \nimprovements creates an estimated 40,000 jobs. With more than $5 \nbillion in water infrastructure projects ready for construction, these\n\n[[Page S2663]]\n\njobs would be created immediately with Federal assistance. According to \nOMB, every Federal dollar invested in water infrastructure generates up \nto $4 for project loans, so the potential for job creation from this \namendment is tremendous.\n  As I stated earlier, the case for this amendment is compelling. \nToday, maintaining clear, safe water remains one of our greatest \nnational and global challenges. This budget resolution should not, and \nneed not, come at the expense of human health or a clean environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and help address the \nmassive funding gap that looms on the horizon. Failure to act now risks \nundermining 30 years of progress in cleaning up our Nation's waters.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, several analyses of the water \ninfrastructure funding gap have been released. The analyses show gaps \nranging from $3 billion a year to $23 billion a year. Regardless of \nwhich number one chooses, the evidence is mounting that we as a nation \nare not investing enough in the infrastructure that provides Americans \nwith clean and safe water.\n  Much of that gap is due to the rising cost municipalities must incur \nto meet ever-growing Federal regulations. Regulations that are kicking \nin at a time when many treatment plants are exceeding their expected \nlife time.\n  Clearly, if the Federal Government is going to continue imposing \ninsurmountable costs on our towns, it must be willing to put forth a \nfair share of the money. As the Chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, I am working with two of the sponsors of this \namendment, Senator Jeffords and Crapo, to craft a water infrastructure \nbill.\n  One thing that we have had in common throughout these negotiations is \na belief that more money is needed. I was very pleased to see that the \nbudget committee restored the funding cut to the clear water SRF.\n  However, cutting or even level funding the program is not the answer. \nWe simply must find a way to provide more resources to these programs, \nfulfill our obligations and then allow the States to run their programs \nwithout further Federal contributions, as Congress always intended.\n  While I very much support my colleagues' efforts to get more money \nfor these programs, I have not yet settled on what I believe is the \nappropriate level. I am supporting this amendment in concept and urge \nmy colleagues to also vote yes. As chairman of the EPW Committee, I \nassure my colleagues that we are on the verge of a true crisis.\n  I support the Crapo-Jeffords amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2784.\n  The amendment (No. 2784) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am speaking now to the chairman of the \ncommittee. May I ask him a question, please, or his counterpart?\n  You were going through a list of amendments. We all try to be \nprepared so we can be helpful to you. I heard an amendment by the \nSenator from New York. I asked the Senator from New York, who is on the \nfloor, if she had one. She didn't. It had something to do with the \nenergy bill. Are you aware of what that is? Could we ask the other side \nwhat the amendment of the distinguished Senator from New York regarding \nthe energy bill is. Who knows? You don't know either.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We don't have the amendment in our hands. We are seeking \nto get it. We will share it with the Senator as soon as we have it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senator Pryor would like to discuss his amendment. I \nyield him 2 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I have an amendment today that deals with \nIRA accounts. I would like to set up a situation where people who have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits--they are entitled to no more \nunemployment benefits--could access up to $15,000 in their own IRA \naccount--it is their own money--in order to meet whatever short-term \nneeds they have. We have already done this in other context. We have \ndone this when it comes to first-time homeowners. We have done this \nsending your children to college. But now the Senate needs to give \nstrong consideration to expanding this for people who have exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefits. Right now you have a fairly hefty penalty, \nand there are tax consequences for doing that. I would like to suspend \nthose.\n  But today, because the hour is late and because we are working with \neverybody here, I want to just announce to my colleagues that I will be \nworking on this and be looking for the very next available legislative \nvehicle to get this done.\n  Hopefully at some point in the next few weeks I will offer this \namendment. I will ask for a rollcall. I will not do it tonight. But I \nwant to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider it. I \nthink it is something that has value and something that we can do to \npossibly help thousands, maybe tens of thousands or more Americans get \nthrough this very difficult time.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask that we recognize Senator Graham to \ndiscuss his amendment on Pell grants. I give him 2 minutes off of the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, Senator Clinton and I have been \nconcerned about the status of the nontraditional college student, the \nadult who comes back to college at 35 or 40 to get some additional \nskills or, particularly, in these changing economic times, to get a new \nskill that has economic value.\n  Most of our student financial aid programs are thinking about the 18-\nyear-old student coming directly from high school. As an example, Pell \ngrants do not apply to summer school. Many adults wishing to get \nthrough their training as rapidly as possible go year round. There are \nalso some costs that are not recognized in the Pell grant, such as \nchild care. Very few 18-year-olds have a need for child care; lots of \n35-year-olds do.\n  One of the key parts of the amendment we were going to offer was to \nincrease the amount of the basic Pell grant to $4,500, which is what \nSenator Coleman has done with his amendment. So Senator Clinton and I \nare not going to offer our amendment, since that part has already been \naccomplished. That represented the overwhelming amount of the cost of \nthis program.\n  Recognize that when we get to the Higher Education Reauthorization \nAct, or some other appropriate legislation, we will be offering \namendments to deal with these aspects of Pell grants that do not \nrespond to the realities of the nontraditional student.\n  We look forward to coming back on this field of battle at the \nearliest opportunity. We will not offer the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nsetting a remarkably good example at 5 minutes after 10 o'clock. If \nthere are any other Senators who want to withdraw their pending \namendments, or not offer an amendment at this time, they would be \ngreeted with open arms and have a very positive effect on their \nlegislative proposals when we return after the break.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield, I think we should elevate \nthem to higher office. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from \nFlorida and thank him for his cooperation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 2837, 2838, 2839, and 2733, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have at least four more amendments\n\n[[Page S2664]]\n\nthat we have agreed to. We are working to see if we cannot agree to a \ncouple of others in the queue.\n  First, we have an amendment by Senators Lincoln, Baucus, Snowe, and \nBreaux. I believe it has been cleared.\n  Another is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment by Senators Grassley, \nLugar, and others, dealing with agriculture research.\n  Another is an amendment by Senator Snowe and others dealing with SBA. \nOur staff said it is agreed to.\n  Another amendment is by Senators Sessions, Cornyn, Graham, and \nNelson, and Shelby, dealing with NASA funding. We ask that these \namendments be agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the four amendments that were sent to the \ndesk referenced by the chairman have no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendments? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendments Nos. 2837, 2838, 2839, \nand 2733.\n  The amendments were agreed to, en bloc, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2837\n\n (Purpose: To prevent tax increases for families who receive the child \n                              tax credit)\n\n       On page 25, line 3, after ``2009'', insert ``, and to \n     increase outlays by not more than $2,000,000,000 for the \n     period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.''\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2838\n\n   (Purpose: Expressing a sense of the Senate for support of funding \n          restoration for agriculture research and extension)\n\n       At the end of title V. add the following:\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, moving right along. I believe the Senator \nfrom Michigan and the Senator from Maine have an amendment. \nUnfortunately, I feel compelled not to agree to that amendment. Maybe \nwe can dispose of it very quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator how long it \nwill take to describe this amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We would like perhaps 3 or 4 minutes on our side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I give 3 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will divide that time with the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2817\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Collins, Senator Clinton, and Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, and Ms. \n     Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 2817.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To lower crude oil prices resulting from the cancellation of \nplanned future deliveries of oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and \nusing the funding made available to provide $1.7 billion in funding for \nhomeland security grants for first responders, firefighter assistance, \n               and port security, and to reduce the debt)\n\n       On page 4, line 4, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 12, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 3, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 4, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 5, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 6, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 13, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n       On page 10, line 14, decrease the amount by $1,700,000,000.\n\n     SEC.   .

STATE HOMELAND SECURITY GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, of the funds for the \n     Department of Homeland Security, $800,000,000 shall be \n     allocated for the State Homeland Security Grant program; \n     $250,000,000 for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant \n     program; and $275,000,000 for Port Security Grants. It is \n     further the sense of the\n\n[[Page S2665]]\n\n     Senate that the State Homeland Security Grant Program shall \n     be increased by $220,000,000 in order to provide for a more \n     equitable formula for distributing funds.\n\n     SEC.   . STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the increased funding \n     for the Homeland Security Department programs shall come from \n     the cancellation of planned future deliveries of oil to the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have skyrocketing gas prices and oil \nprices in most parts of the country. The major reason for this is \nprivate sector inventories are low. The major reason private sector \ninventories are low is we, at the same time, have seen a decline in \nthose inventories of 50 million barrels in the last 2 years.\n  We have deposited in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve approximately 85 \nmillion barrels. Even the staff of the Department of Energy a year ago \nsaid the following:\n\n       Commercial petroleum inventories are low. Retail product \n     prices are high, and economic growth is slow. The Government \n     should avoid acquiring oil for the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve under these circumstances.\n\n  We would halt the deposit of oil in the Reserve, and we would use the \nmoney, approximately $1.7 billion, to restore a number of accounts in \nthe Homeland Security Department; namely, we would restore about 80 \npercent of the money cut from the Homeland Security grant program; $250 \nmillion we would restore to firefighter grants to bring them up to last \nyear. We would add money for port security, $150 million for deficit \nreduction, and about $220 million for an equity account.\n  This is a twofer. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator \nfrom Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it makes no sense at all for the Federal \nGovernment to put further pressure on the oil supplies through large \npurchases for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time when oil \nprices are at record high levels.\n  Through proper management of the Reserve, we can ease the economic \nimpact drastically rising gasoline prices are having on the American \nfamily.\n  There are three different studies which demonstrate suspending \ndeliveries of oil to the SPR at this time would decrease gas prices by \nanywhere from 10 cents to 25 cents per gallon.\n  I want my colleagues to know the Reserve is currently 92 percent \nfull. So halting these deliveries will have no impact at all on our \nnational security, but will be of great benefit to American consumers.\n  In addition, our legislation would transfer the savings to restore \ncutbacks in homeland security. We would increase the basic Homeland \nSecurity grant program our States and communities rely upon so it would \nbe equal to the level of last year.\n  We would include a restoration of funding for the FIRE Act, again to \nlast year's level. And finally, we would invest in port security which \nexperts tell us is one of our greatest vulnerabilities. The remainder \nof the funding would be used for deficit reduction.\n  This amendment makes good common sense. It will help relieve the \npressure on gasoline prices, while at the same time allowing us to \ndevote more resources to strengthening our homeland security and \nreducing our deficit.\n  I yield back to Senator Levin any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I regret I cannot accept this amendment. \nI will follow the will of the Senate. This is basically saying let's \ntake out $1.7 billion from SPR and spread it around in homeland \nsecurity. We are fully funding the President's request for homeland \nsecurity which is 15 percent over last year, 10 percent if you take out \nbioshield.\n  We already have several amendments on homeland security. I urge our \ncolleagues not to support the amendment.\n  I call upon the chairman of the Energy Committee, Senator Domenici, \nto conclude.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will only use 1 minute. First, I have \nthe greatest respect for the distinguished Senator from Maine, but let \nme say to everyone here, you all remember, SPR is to put oil in the \nground in case we have an emergency. We use it in an emergency.\n  The Energy Information Administration's last forecast predicts by the \nyear 2025--and SPR is future thinking; it is not today; it is thinking \nin the future--they say by the year 2025, we will be 70 percent \ndependent on imported oil.\n  The point of it is, we can never have too much oil in SPR. The idea \nwas a good idea. It is even a better idea today. To say we ought to \nstop filling it so we can start filling gaps in a budget, especially \nsaying we take care of all the inland security problems by not taking \ncare of SPR, seems to me to be the wrong thing to do.\n  I could find a lot of things to do in Government. If we could just \nsell all the oil in SPR, we could take care of every program in this \nGovernment. My colleagues could all go home. We would have about $150 \nbillion. We could just spread it everywhere. That is much the same as \nsaying: Quit buying it and what you were going to buy, spend on other \nthings.\n  I hope we do not adopt the amendment. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, oil and gasoline prices are at or near \nrecord-high levels. Oil and gasoline supplies are at or near record-low \nlevels. If there are any disruptions in oil or gasoline supplies or \nproduction, there will be an insufficient amount of oil and gasoline to \nmeet demand, and prices will skyrocket even further.\n  Yet, incredibly, in the face of this crisis, the administration is \ndecreasing rather than increasing the supply of oil. Day after day, \nmonth after month, regardless of how high the cost for acquiring this \noil, the administration is taking millions of barrels of oil off the \nmarket and depositing them into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. By \ntaking this badly needed oil off the market and placing it in the SPR, \nat extremely high prices, the administration is increasing the price of \noil and gasoline.\n  The Levin-Collins amendment will increase Federal revenues by \napproximately $1.7 billion by, in effect, directing DOE to delay the \nfilling of the SPR. The amendment will lower oil and gasoline prices by \nincreasing oil and gasoline supplies in the commercial inventories. It \nwill improve our overall energy security by moving us away from the \nbrink of a crisis in supply. Moreover, it is both sound fiscal and \nresource management policy to put oil on the open market when prices \nare high, and place them into reserves later when prices are low.\n  As nearly every American knows, gasoline prices are at record-high \nlevels. The average price of a gallon of gasoline, nationwide, as well \nas in my home State of Michigan, is $1.74 per gallon. In some states it \nis even higher. In California, for example, the average price for a \ngallon of gasoline is $2.18 per gallon.\n  Crude oil prices also are at near-record prices. Spot prices are over \n$37 per barrel. Futures prices for oil for the next several months are \nat or near $37 per barrel as well.\n  A major reason oil prices are so high is that the amount of crude oil \nin private sector inventories in the United States is at record low \nlevels. Crude oil inventories are now lower than at any time in the 28 \nyears that the Department of Energy has been tracking them. Oil prices \nare directly related to the amount of crude oil in inventories, since \noverall supply levels depend on both amounts produced and amounts in \ninventory. This is why prices are so high.\n  One of the reasons that supplies of oil are so low is that since late \n2001 the Department of Energy (DOE) has been steadily taking millions \nof barrels of oil off the market and placing them into the U.S. \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). In late 2001, the Reserve held about \n560 million barrels of oil. Today it holds nearly 650 million barrels. \nDOE anticipates that at the current fill rate it will reach its goal of \nfilling the SPR to its current physical capacity of 700 million barrels \nin the middle of 2005.\n  Clearly, now is not the time to be taking more oil off the market \nwhen the price of oil is so high. We need more oil and gasoline in \nrefineries.\n  The Levin-Collins amendment is simple. It would, in effect, result in \nthe deferral of the deposit of the 53 million barrels of oil that DOE \ncurrently plans to ship to the SPR over the next year. Assuming an \naverage price of $33 per barrel--which is based on the current\n\n[[Page S2666]]\n\nfutures prices for oil for the next 14 months, as well as the trend in \nspot prices over the past year--this would yield over $1.7 billion in \nFederal revenues. This will help lower oil and gasoline prices for \nconsumers and businesses as well. This amendment is a win-win for \nconsumers, taxpayers, and the Government.\n  The Levin-Collins amendment would apply these funds to strengthen our \nhomeland security. We cannot expect our first responders to be well-\ntrained, properly equipped and fully staffed to protect us, if we cut \ntheir funding sources. Our amendment restores $800 million to the State \nHomeland Security Grant program, which will bring the total funding for \nthat program up to $1.5 billion; adds $250 million to the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant program; and $275,000,000 for Port Security Grants. \nThe amendment will also provide $155 million for deficit reduction.\n  Finally, the amendment provides an additional $220 million to the \nState Homeland Security Grant Program in order to provide for a more \nequitable formula for distributing funds under that program.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Can we voice vote the amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That depends on how loud the voices are.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2817.

I believe we have the amendment of Senator Byrd \nwhich will be agreed to momentarily. I am not positive. I need to run \nthat by Senator Gregg. I think we are going to be able to work out the \namendment of Senator Lincoln. We do expect a couple of amendments on \nour side. I believe Senator McConnell has an amendment and I hope he \nwould be recognized next.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2840\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n  The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McCONNELL] proposes an amendment \nnumbered 2840.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit future income tax hikes on upper incomes that \nfail to exempt small businesses that file individual income tax returns \n    as partnerships, sole proprietors, or subchapter S corporations)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECTION OF SMALL BUSINESSES FROM TAX HIKES ON \n                   ``THE RICH'' POINT OF ORDER.\n\n       (a) In General.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill, amendment, resolution or conference \n     reports that would--\n       (1) raise federal income taxes on upper incomes households, \n     and\n       (2) fail to exempt small businesses that bear most of the \n     burden of the top marginal tax rates.\n       (b) Waiver.--This subsection may be waived or suspended in \n     the Senate only by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of \n     the Members, duly chosen and sworn.\n       (c) Appeals.--Appeals in the Senate from the decisions of \n     the Chair relating to any provisions of this subsection shall \n     be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by the appellant and the manager of the bill, \n     joint resolution or as the case may be. An affirmative vote \n     of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and \n     sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of the ruling \n     of the Chair on a point of order raised under this section.\n       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, a small \n     business shall be any individual or enterprise that files \n     federal individual income tax returns as a partnership, sole \n     proprietor or subchapter S corporation.\n       (e) Determination of Impact on Small Businesses.--For \n     purposes of this section, the impact of any income tax \n     legislation on small businesses shall be determined on the \n     basis of estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the \n     Senate.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, talking about taxes, it is essential to \nremember small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Small \nbusiness entrepreneurs create more than two out of every three new jobs \nand generate roughly half of our Nation's gross domestic product. Yet \nthey are saddled with the heaviest tax burden.\n  Small businesses predominantly pay their income taxes using \nindividual income tax returns, which means they frequently pay the \nhighest marginal tax rate. While they file less than 1 percent of all \ntax returns, small businesses account for more than 31 percent of all \ntax payments. Make no mistake, these are not highly paid executives or \npeople living off their investments; these are ordinary people trying \nto make a living as they pursue the American dream.\n  Who pays the tax on the rich? Seventy-nine percent of the top rate \nliterally falls on small business. To ignore this small business tax \nfactor is to risk breaking the backbone of our economy. This point of \norder which this amendment would establish would protect small \nbusinesses from tax hikes on the rich.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kentucky for \nraising this issue. I have been very concerned about our small \nbusinesses and how they fare as well. That was one of the reasons I \nrequested information from the IRS on this very issue concerning how \nour small businesses are affected.\n  Addressing this argument about small business and cutting the top \nrates: According to the IRS statistics we received back from the IRS, \nonly 3.8 percent of small business and farm returns have income over \n$200,000. So you have to earn $319,100 before you even make it to the \ntop tax bracket. All of your income up until that amount is taxed at \nthe lower rate.\n  If you look at the statistics that the IRS brings to us, 62 percent \nof small businesses and farm returns in this country have incomes of \n$50,000 or less.\n\n[[Page S2667]]\n\nThey do not fall into this top category of income that is being \ndiscussed.\n  I appreciate the Senator bringing this up so we can really talk about \nwho falls into this category.\n  I ask my colleagues to recognize we are talking about taxable income, \nwhich is after expenses. This is take-home pay, take-home pay for these \ncompanies. This is the money that is not being invested in new plants \nor new equipment, this is not money that is going to employment, \nincreasing jobs which we know our small businesses are capable of if \nthey have the resources to invest there. This is taxable income after \nexpenses, so it is taxable income that has really gone to the bank \nalready. I think it is very important for us to recognize what we are \ntalking about.\n  It also might be of interest to my colleagues tonight to know that \nafter I had a very similar discussion about these statistics with the \nSecretary of the Treasury, he called me the other day and told me he \nhad reviewed my charts and found them accurate.\n  He said they were hard to read but they were accurate. They are a \nlittle bit small. But I think it is so important for us to recognize. \nThe reason it hit home for me is because Arkansas finds itself actually \nin a little bit higher circumstance than that. Well over 62 percent of \nour small businesses in Arkansas are our largest employers. Roughly \nupwards of 70 percent find themselves in that 50 percent or less \ncategory. Again, this is after expenses. This is what they are taking \nhome.\n  I know my colleague in his amendment talks about individual income \ntax returns as a partnership, or a sole proprietor, or subject chapter \nS corporation.\n  But I encourage my colleagues to understand that these are \nflowthrough entities. If you are talking about these individuals and \nthese groups, they are very small as a percentage of what we are \ntalking about in small businesses.\n  These are individuals who might file schedule C or schedule S.\n  I think it is so important for us to look at the numbers. I agree \nwholeheartedly with my colleagues that small businesses are the engine \nof this economy. They are the ones that provide the most jobs. Most of \nthe jobs in Arkansas are provided by our small businesses.\n  It is important we accurately look at the resources we are trying to \nput back into the hands of small businesses so they can reinvest and \ngrow the jobs we know we need to continue to build on this economy. I \nhope we will take a look at the numbers which have been provided. We \ntalk some about upward mobility. I know that has been discussed as well \nby many of our colleagues about the opportunity that Americans want to \nhave, the potential they want in order to reach those upper brackets.\n  But, quite frankly, if you look at the upward mobility in my State, \nin 1991 the per capita personal income was about $15,175. Today, it is \n$22,750. That is an increase of about 33 percent over the decade. But \nArkansans, on average, are still earning less than $23,000 a year. Less \nthan 10 percent of our Arkansans earn over $200,000 a year. I just try \nto make this point.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at incomes in their own States. When \nyou find in other States such as ours that 50 percent of the people \nhave an adjusted gross income of less than $25,000 and over 80 percent \nroughly have an adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 a year, we \nhave to look at putting money into the pockets of people who are going \nto grow this economy. We have to keep a balance.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at what is happening. If you talk \nabout upward mobility, it will take a 1,400-percent increase in income \nto reach those upper margins that are being talked about from where \nmost of our small business and other income earners in our State are. I \nhope my colleagues will take a second look at what he is trying to \npropose.\n  I hope my other colleagues realize, if what we want to do is make \nsure we are growing the economy and protecting small businesses, we \nneed to look at the statistics the IRS has given us about where those \nsmall businesses are and where those resources lie.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is not a small business amendment. It \nis purportedly a small business amendment. It is not. Why? As the able \nSenator from Arkansas stated, only 2 percent--only 2 percent--of small \nbusinesses are in the upper bracket. The remaining are not. They are \nnot small businesses.\n  More importantly, this is an amendment that makes it much more \ndifficult to raise taxes on the wealthiest top bracket than it is in \nthe effort to raise taxes on the middle-income taxpayers. It provides \nfor a point of order on any revenue measure that would have the effect \nof raising taxes on the top bracket. It only applies to the top \nbracket. It wouldn't apply to any other bracket. We don't want that.\n  I can't for the life of me understand why the Senator from Kentucky \nis on the floor even daring to offer that amendment. At the appropriate \ntime, I am going to suggest that the amendment is not germane because \nit is not germane. I can only do so when all time is yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will be very brief and then I will be \nprepared to relinquish whatever time I have.\n  According to the Office of Tax Analysis of the U.S. Treasury, last \nyear, January 7, 2003, I repeat, small business owners, entrepreneurs, \nand farmers account for more than two-thirds of the top bracket income \ntax returns and receive 79 percent of the top bracket tax relief. That \nis what this amendment is all about. I hope the Senate will approve it.\n  I have no further observations to make, if the Senator would like to \nmake his motion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane, and \ntherefore I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is absent \nattending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina).

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CHILD NUTRITION \n                   FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Federal child nutrition programs have long played a \n     critical role in providing children in the United States with \n     quality nutrition from birth through secondary school;\n       (2) recognizing the value of these benefits to children in \n     the United States, Congress has an enduring tradition of \n     bipartisan support for these programs;\n       (3) children in the United States are increasingly at \n     nutritional risk due to poor dietary habits, lack of access \n     to nutritious foods, and obesity and diet-related diseases \n     associated with poor dietary intake;\n       (4) many children in the United States who would benefit \n     from Federal child nutrition programs do not receive benefits \n     due to financial or administrative barriers; and\n       (5) Federal child nutrition programs are expected to be \n     reauthorized in the 108th Congress.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume that in \n     making appropriations and revenue decisions, the Senate \n     supports the retention in the conference\n\n[[Page S2669]]\n\n     report for this concurrent resolution of the additional funds \n     provided in this concurrent resolution for the \n     reauthorization of Federal child nutrition programs.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, last year I gave my maiden speech on the \nissue of hunger. I believe now, just as I did then, that we must make a \nconcerted effort to eradicate this problem. It is the silent enemy that \nlurks in too many American homes. I am not one to duck tough issues. \nAnd this is a problem that I know we can conquer with both sides of the \naisle working together. There are a number of areas where one could \nfocus in this effort, and the amendment I send to the desk represents a \ngood first step toward strengthening the National School Lunch program \nwhich is very popular and effective.\n  Under the current program, children from families with incomes at or \nbelow 130 percent of poverty are eligible for free meals. Children from \nfamilies with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of poverty \nare eligible for reduced price meals--charging no more than 40 cents \nper meal. This may seem like a nominal amount, but that is not what I \nam hearing in North Carolina and from folks around the country. To \nquote the resolution from the North Carolina Department of Education, \n``many families in the reduced price income category are finding it \ndifficult to pay the reduced fee and, for some families, the fee is an \ninsurmountable barrier to participation.\n  Sharlyn Logan, the Child Nutrition Supervisor for Cumberland County \nSchools in North Carolina says--. . . ``In many of our schools, we \ndaily see children with no money. Many times we allow the child to eat \nand the Child Nutrition program takes a loss. When the problem \npersists, we will provide a peanut butter sandwich and milk at no cost \nto the child to insure they receive some nutritional sustenance. This \nmay be the only meal they receive.''\n  Recently, I spoke at the American School Food Service Association's \nannual banquet, where I was inspired by more than 1000 enthusiastic \npeople who have devoted their careers to making sure children get the \nnutrition they need. You probably saw them on the Hill wearing their \nbuttons that said ``ERP''--eliminate reduced price. They are on the \nfront lines on this issue, and they have tremendous passion. It was an \nevening that I will never forget.\n  They will be the first to tell you that these income eligibility \nguidelines are inconsistent with other federal assistance programs. For \nexample, families whose incomes are at or below 185 percent of poverty \nare eligible for free benefits through the WIC program--the Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. It just \nmakes sense to harmonize these income eligibility guidelines allowing \nus to clarify this bureaucratic situation. Doing so would enable us to \nimmediately certify children from WIC families for the National School \nLunch and Breakfast programs.\n  More than 500 State and local school boards have passed resolutions \nurging the Congress to eliminate the reduced price category, thereby \nexpanding free lunches and breakfasts to all of those children whose \nfamily incomes are at or below 185 percent of poverty. In addition, \nthe Association of School Business Officials, the National Association \nof Elementary School Principals, and the American Public Health \nAssociation have endorsed this idea.\n\n  This is the right thing to do. For this reason, I was pleased to \nintroduce S. 1549, to eliminate the reduced price meal program in \ngraduated steps over a 5 year period. Since introduction of this \nlegislation, colleagues on both sides of the aisle have joined me, and \ntwo bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives.\n  The amendment that I have at the desk does not provide funding for \nthe total elimination of reduced price meals over a five year period as \nlaid out in S. 1549. Rather, it would enable the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee to permanently increase the eligibility guideline for free \nschool meals from 130 percent of poverty to 140 percent of poverty--the \nfirst step of the graduated approach outlined in S. 1549--when the \nCommittee reauthorizes the Child Nutrition programs. Of course, we will \nstill have a long way to go to eliminate the reduced price category, \nbut progress is better than status quo, any day.\n  Hunger and malnourishment among children--that's a battle that can be \nwon. This is not a partisan issue, and enactment of this amendment will \nmark the first step in our crusade to strengthen the National School \nLunch program and begin to address a serious problem for many families \nin need across this country--and especially those who have been laid \noff and are out of work. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the American School Food Service Association, Child \nNutrition Forum, the Association of School Business Officials, the \nNational Association of Elementary School Principals, the American \nPublic Health Association, and organizations in 44 States have passed \nresolutions endorsing elimination of reduced price meals.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Budget Committee \nreported out a budget resolution that provided $232 million for the \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry to enable the \nextension of several expiring provisions of child nutrition law. This \nwas the amount that Agriculture Committee Chairman Cochran and I noted \nin our letter to the Budget Committee would, at a minimum, be necessary \nto ensure that children who qualify for benefits under current law \nwould not lose them.\n  However, more is clearly needed. Given the nutritional risks to \nAmerican children today and the numerous unmet needs that exist in \nFederal child nutrition programs, I commend Senators Dole and Leahy for \ntheir bipartisan effort to provide additional funding for federal child \nnutrition programs. If these additional funds remain in the conference \nreport, they will help the Senate Agriculture Committee to take \nimportant steps in pending child nutrition legislation. The need for \nadditional funds is significant, including, for instance, the expansion \nthe Summer Food Service Program and the fruit and vegetable pilot \nprojects, lowering area eligibility for the Child and Adult Care Food \nProgram, helping children who still face financial barriers to \nparticipate in the National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs, and \nimproving the entire nutritional environment in American schools.\n  If additional funds are provided in the conference report, it is, \nhowever, critical to understand that, by relying on function 920 to \noffset this amendment, a number of critical issues remain. The use of \nfunction 920 fails to specify the source of the new funds, meaning that \nthey could accrue either by increasing the national debt or as a result \nof unspecified program cuts. Of course, the question of the actual cuts \nthat may be specified is an important one. I am particularly concerned \nthat any cuts that fall within the jurisdiction of the Senate Committee \non Agriculture could pit one set of interests against another in a way \nthat could reopen the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act passed \njust 2 years ago. Neither the members of the committee nor the \ninterested stakeholders in the agriculture and nutrition communities \nwould be well served by such an unfortunate situation. I, and I believe \nmy colleagues on the committee, would be very hesitant to pit the needs \nof rural America against the similarly important needs of needy \nchildren and working families.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment our colleague, Senator Dole \nfrom North Carolina and Senator Leahy for cooperating. They saved us a \nlot of time by putting their amendments together.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2844) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Specter, has \nprobably been more patient than anyone for the last 3 days. He has been \nrequesting an opportunity to offer an amendment, so I yield to the \nSenator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2741, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2741 and send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], for himself \n     and Ms. Collins, proposes an amendment numbered 2741, as \n     modified.\n\n\n[[Page S2670]]\n\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: Increase discretionary health funding by $2,000,000,000)\n\n       On page 16, line 12, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 16, line 13, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 5, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 6, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, \nthis is an amendment which seeks to add $1.3 billion to funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, with an offset against function 920, \namounting to one-sixth of 1 percent on administrative costs.\n  I express my concern about offering an amendment at 11:04 p.m. for a \nrollcall vote, but as stated by the chairman of the Budget Committee, I \nhave been patient waiting for 3\\1/2\\ days to offer this amendment. And \nI do so because of the importance of funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, which has made such enormous progress against \nmany deadly maladies.\n  Last year, we had a spirited debate, at about this same hour, on an \namendment I offered for a $1.5 billion increase, which required 60 \nvotes, and failed with 52 votes in the affirmative--8 votes short of \nthe 60 necessary at that time.\n  The National Institutes of Health have made phenomenal progress \nagainst the most deadly diseases: autism, stroke, obesity, Alzheimer's, \nParkinson's, spinal muscular atrophy, scleroderma, ALS, muscular \ndystrophy, diabetes, osteoporosis--a variety of cancers: breast, \ncervical, and ovarian; lymphoma, multiple myeloma, prostate, \npancreatic, colon, head and neck, brain, and lung--pediatric renal \ndisorders, multiple sclerosis, deafness and other communication \ndisorders, glaucoma, macular degeneration, sickle cell anemia, heart \ndisease, spinal cord injury, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, arthritis, \nschizophrenia and other mental disorders, polycystic kidney disease, \nhepatitis, Cooley's Anemia, primary immune deficiency disorders, \nstroke, and obesity.\n  But I would supplement this list for the Record, Mr. President. When \nthose disorders and diseases are articulated, they cover some 128 \nmillion Americans. This increase in funding is necessary if the NIH is \nto proceed with very important research.\n  For example, the NIH cannot initiate the necessary clinical trials to \ntest four new drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The \nexperts have testified we are within 5 years of a cure on Parkinson's.\n  Without this kind of funding, there is no clinical trial for a \npromising new drug treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the \nNIH must postpone the production and clinical testing of four potential \npandemic influenza vaccines for a year or more. And we know the \ntremendous impact on the influenza problem.\n  Without this funding, the NIH cannot launch a clinical trials network \nto test new therapies for age-related macular degeneration, nor can NIH \nlaunch an initiative to identify and test approaches to reducing \ncardiovascular disease that are specific to American Indian and Alaska \nNative populations.\n  Without this funding, NIH cannot use its clinical trial networks to \nlaunch trials on the consequences of the use of more than one \npsychiatric medication by the severely mentally ill.\n  I have a long additional list. I see the impatience of the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, and I share his impatience. I understand the \nhour, so I ask unanimous consent that the full next of the test trials \nwhich cannot be undertaken by the NIH be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n 10 Examples of NIH Research That Can Not Be Funded Under This Budget \n                               Resolution\n\n       (1) The NIH cannot initiate the large clinical trials \n     necessary to test 4 new drugs for the treatment of \n     Parkinson's disease.\n       (2) The NIH cannot conduct a clinical trial of a promising \n     new drug for the treatment of ALS (Lou Gehrig's Disease).\n       (3) The NIH must postpone the production and clinical \n     testing of 4 potential pandemic influenza vaccines by one \n     year or more.\n       (4) The NIH cannot launch a clinical trials network to test \n     new therapies for age-related macular degeneration, which is \n     the leading cause of vision loss among Americans over 65.\n       (5) The NIH cannot launch an initiative to identify and \n     test approaches to reducing cardiovascular disease that are \n     specific to American Indian and Alaska Native populations.\n       (6) The NIH cannot use its clinical trial networks to \n     launch trials on the consequences of the use of more than one \n     psychiatric medication by the severely mentally ill.\n       (7) The NIH cannot support research to rapidly develop \n     computer-assisted, image-guided microsurgery, which could \n     replace traditional surgery.\n       (8) The NIH cannot test milk thistle, a promising dietary \n     supplement, for the treatment of liver diseases.\n       (9) The NIH cannot launch chemical counterterrorism \n     research to combat nerve agents.\n       (10) The NIH cannot proceed with a project to identify at \n     birth hundreds of single gene defects associated with mental \n     retardation, and other fatal or disabling conditions.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in conclusion--the two most popular words \nof any speech--in a budget of $2.4 trillion, funding of $30 billion is \nnot too much on this major problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from \nPennsylvania. He is persistent, to say the least, on this subject.\n  The night is late. I see my colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, \nwishes to speak. I will yield my colleague 1 minute--2 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, I say to the Senator, while he has been waiting \nhowever long he has been----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Would the Senator like 2 minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe 3. I probably won't use it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield my colleague from New Mexico 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fellow Senators, I normally get up to argue a case when \nI think I can win. And sometimes--not too often--I get up to argue a \ncase on the floor of the Senate because I think the case deserves my \nargument, even if I do not think I am going to win. And who in the \nworld would think any Senator could deny this money to the National \nInstitutes of Health? You surely would have to be a bigger Senator than \nfrom New Mexico to argue this kind of case and win.\n  I want to tell you something: You have heard about people in the \nFederal Government who want more and more and more for their agencies. \nWe have nicknames for them. You have some; I have some. I hate to say \nit. The NIH is one of the best agencies in the world, but they have \nturned into pigs, pigs. They can't keep their ``oinks'' closed. They \nsend a Senator down here to argue as if they are broke.\n  Will you listen to what has happened to NIH in 5 years and you tell \nme that they should get this much money? And while you are doing that, \nask about the rest of the sciences. Is America going to survive on NIH \nalone? When will we run out of physicists? When will we run out of \nscientists? Do you know what? We already are. We are importing them \nfrom all over the world.\n  You go ask NIH what they need most and they will say: We need \nscientists to come and join us.\n  And what do we do? I will tell you. The lead agency for America, \nsupposedly, that invests in nonmedical, non-NIH research, is the NSF. \nDo you want to know how much they get? The NSF gets $3.6 billion a year \nfor basic research. How does that strike you? Well, maybe that wouldn't \nstrike you at all unless you knew how much NIH got. NIH, this year, \nwith the increase they are going to get, will be $28.7 billion without \nthis amendment. NIH has spent $145 billion over the last 7 years. And \nguess what that is. That is a 109-percent increase in a period of 7 \nyears. Do you have it?\n  They wrote these little brochures, and they ought to be embarrassed. \nThey came to my office and I told them: You are lucky you have old Bob \nMichel along with you because, as far as you doctors are concerned, I \nwould kick you out of here so fast you\n\n[[Page S2671]]\n\ncouldn't find the door. But I will let Bob stay here for a minute and \nargue. They got these kind of reports saying: Well, we are so sorry the \nPresident has let us down this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for an additional minute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He has only given us inflation. After all these years, \nhe only gave us inflation this year. And they almost sound as if he is \nagainst them, the President who has funded them more than any President \nin history. Then we come down to the floor underfunding the National \nScience Foundation, underfunding research that is going to take place \nat NASA, underfunding science at DOE. It is never enough. Come to the \nfloor with another amendment saying: This isn't enough. Our ``oink'' \nsomehow is not full, and come down here and say: We can't do this; we \ncan't do that.\n  Of course, when you are a big science institute, you can invent \nsomething every day that you ought to do. I tell you, a 109-percent \nincrease in 7 years is enough. If I had a little time, they wouldn't \nget it because I tell you, I would substitute for these other \nimpoverished programs and make you choose. I would make you say you \ndon't want to put any money in NSF. You want to put some more in this \none. But I can't do that on this bill. I will get it done one of these \ndays. We are going to have a choice of keeping on funding this place or \nfunding some other science in America before we have none left.\n  I am sorry I took your time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, 1 minute in reply?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining? I \ndon't have the additional time to yield, I tell my colleague?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Thirty seconds in reply?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor of the amendment has time as well \nas the manager.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield my colleague from Pennsylvania 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The NIH did not send this Senator anywhere. My views \narrive from my own research. When I hear the Senator from New Mexico \ndisagreeing with the research, I think about how many times he has come \nto me and I have helped him on funding for mental health. That is a \nvery vital part of what NIH is doing, a matter of great importance to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, just as so many of these maladies are \nimportant to every Senator in this Chamber.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nhe is the sponsor of the amendment. He has an hour's time on his \namendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am sorry if I inferred that somebody \nsent you here. I don't mean that. I can only tell you what they told \nme. They told me yesterday that you would be here because they asked \nyou. That is all I have to say.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back on the amendment, \nthe question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2741, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe amendment offered by Senator Lugar and myself to restore the \nInternational Affairs function 150 account to the President's requested \nfunding level and add additional resources to the fight against global \nHIV/AIDS.\n  Now is not the time to take a step backwards in our commitment to \nensuring that the international affairs budget remains a vital tool of \nAmerican foreign policy in the fight against terror and global poverty.\n  Our amendment adds $1.4 billion in funding for the international \naffairs budget to exceed the President's request of $31.5 billion for \nfiscal year 2005\n\n[[Page S2672]]\n\nby $300 million. Last year, the Senate accepted a Lugar-Feinstein \namendment that restored $1.15 billion to the fiscal year 2004 \ninternational budget.\n  As I stated last year, I strongly believe the United States should \ndevote additional resources to the international affairs budget above \nthis amendment. Nevertheless, in this difficult fiscal environment, I \nfully understand that this amendment is the best opportunity to \nmaintain the momentum of increasing the international affairs budget \nand demonstrating the importance of our foreign aid programs.\n  I also understand that the offset used in this amendment--the \nfunction 920 account--is not ideal, but the Lugar/Feinstein amendment \nis the best vehicle we have at this time to restore the President's \nrequest, provide additional assistance to the fight against global HIV/\nAIDS and help the United States sustain a leadership role in bringing \nhope to the developing world and fighting global terror.\n  The statistics about our international affairs budget are well known \nto some of my colleagues but they are worth repeating to underscore the \nimportance of acting now to provide additional funds. The United States \nspends approximately one percent of our budget on foreign aid, barely \none-tenth of one percent of GDP.\n  According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, the United States in recent years ranks next to last among \n21 industrialized donor countries in per capita foreign assistance.\n  We can do better and I am pleased that over the past few years the \nadministration, Congress, and the American people have come together to \npush for greater commitments to our international affairs budget.\n  In the simplest terms, foreign aid programs provide assistance to \nthose in need. They help countries combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, \nbuild schools to fight illiteracy, train doctors to provide care for \nmothers and their newborn children, and help indigenous peoples prevent \nenvironmental degradation.\n\n  In addition, foreign aid programs protect our embassies and foreign \nservice personnel, built export markets for our goods and services, and \nspread America's message of freedom and democracy around the world.\n  In the post September 11 world, however, the international affairs \nbudget has taken on an increased significance. It has become \nincreasingly clear that we cannot rely on our military might alone to \nprotect our citizens and advance the U.S. foreign policy agenda. As \nRichard Sokolsky and Joseph McMillan of the National Defense University \nhave written:\n\n       The events of September 11th have a direct impact on \n     American national security . . . A robust and focused foreign \n     assistance program is one of the weapons we must have to \n     prevail.\n\n  Our troops have performed magnificently in overthrowing Saddam \nHussein in Iraq and the Taliban in Afghanistan while combating al-Qaeda \naround the globe. Nevertheless, the costs in terms of lives and \nresources have been substantial and we can expect additional costs for \nmany years to come.\n  Increasing the foreign aid budget allows us to attack the conditions \nthat foster terror and autocratic governments--poverty, illness, \ndisease, illiteracy--at a far lower cost and with less bloodshed than \nmilitary interventions in the future. We should not wait until a nation \nhits rock bottom to build schools, open hospitals, and provide food to \nthose in the developing world who so desperately need it.\n  As Secretary of State Colin Powell has stated:\n\n       We have to make sure that, as we fight terrorism using \n     military means and legal means and law enforcement and \n     intelligence means and going after the financial \n     infrastructure of terrorist organizations, we also have to \n     put hope back in the hearts of people.\n\n  By acting sooner rather than later, we not only have a better \nopportunity to promote stability, economic prosperity, and vibrant \ndemocratic institutions, but we also protect our own national interests \nand the lives of all Americans.\n  Sometimes our values and intentions are misconstrued and \nmisrepresented around the world. I am increasingly concerned about the \nnegative perceptions of the United States and Americans that abound in \nthe Middle East and other parts of the developing world.\n  We are a generous people and foreign aid represents the best of our \nvalues and demonstrates our commitment to seeing other peoples rise \nfrom the ashes of poverty. When we succeed in this endeavor, we change \nhearts and minds and protect our own. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \n2005 budget resolution. The Budget Committee has presented the Senate \nwith a product of intense labor. Its members are determined to produce \na budget resolution in a timely manner, and I have confidence that we \nwill get this job done. I applaud the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Nickles, for his leadership and the way he has moved this \nprocess forward.\n  My amendment would increase funding for the foreign affairs account \nby $1.1 billion, an amount that would bring the budget resolution up to \nPresident Bush's request for this purpose. In cooperation with Senator \nDurbin and others, my amendment has been modified to reflect an \nadditional $300 million to address the global AIDS epidemic. The \namendment would be offset by Section 920 Allowances.\n  Much of our discussion in this budget will focus on taxes, health \ncare, education, and Social Security. These issues will be fought out \nin the context of highly partisan perspectives. But even as we maneuver \nfor advantage in these areas, we must recognize that international \nthreats, particularly the threat of catastrophic terrorism, puts all \nthese domestic objectives at risk. The threat of catastrophic terrorism \nnow exists as an overarching negative condition on investor confidence, \ninsurance cost and availability, trade flows, energy supplies, budget \nflexibility, the amount of national assets devoted to increasing \nproductivity, and many other factors that are crucial to our economy.\n  Our future economic prospects rest squarely on our Government's \nability to defeat terrorism and to secure weapons and materials of mass \ndestruction to a degree that encourages investment, improves public \nconfidence, and protects the economy against severe economic shocks. If \nthe United States fails to organize and stabilize the world, our \neconomy will never reach its potential.\n  The bottom line is this: for the foreseeable future, the United \nStates and its allies will face an existential threat from the \nintersection of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. This is the \ndomestic issue of our time, because virtually any large-scale idea to \nimprove life in America will be circumscribed by the economic \nlimitations imposed by this threat.\n  In the 30 months since the September 11 attacks, the United States \nhas refined its military capabilities, created a Department of Homeland \nSecurity, improved airport and seaport security, and scrutinized the \nefficiency of our intelligence services. We have carried the fight \nagainst terrorism to Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  But to win the war against terrorism, the United States must assign \nU.S. economic and diplomatic capabilities the same strategic priority \nthat we assign to military capabilities.\n  Today we are experiencing a confluence of foreign policy crises that \nis unparalleled in the post-Cold War era. Our Nation has experienced \nthe September 11 tragedy; we have gone to war in Afghanistan and Iraq; \nwe have been confronted by a nuclear crisis in North Korea; and we have \nundertaken a worldwide diplomatic offensive to secure allies in the \nbroader war on terror. We have experienced strains in the Atlantic \nAlliance, even as we have expanded it. We are still searching for a \npeace settlement in the Middle East. We are trying to respond to the \nAIDS pandemic in Africa and elsewhere. In our own hemisphere, we have \nexperienced a crisis in Haiti that requires immediate attention. We are \nassisting a war against drugs and terrorism in Colombia, and we have a \nchallenge to democracy in Venezuela. Mexico, Brazil and other nations \nare becoming increasingly important to our economy.\n  The ability of our military has not been in doubt. What has been in \ndoubt are factors related to our diplomatic strength and our standing \nin the world. Can we get the cooperation of the U.N. Security Council? \nCan we secure the\n\n[[Page S2673]]\n\nnecessary basing and overflight rights? Can we limit anti-American \nreactions to war in the Arab world? Can we secure allied participation \nin the work of reconstructing Iraq? Can we prevent poverty and disease \nfrom destabilizing countries throughout the developing world? The \nanswers of these questions have depended largely on the diplomatic work \ndone by the State Department. The answers will depend in the future on \nthe work funded by the very budget that we discuss today.\n  Under President Bush and Secretary of State Powell, foreign affairs \nspending has received important increases since September 11, 2001. But \nwe dug a very deep hole for ourselves during the mid- and late-1990s, \nwhen complacency about the role of our diplomats led foreign affairs \nspending to be greatly devalued. This year, the Budget Committee \nlistened to our arguments sympathetically and provided what it believed \nit could, given difficult budgetary constraints. But I believe \nrestoring full funding of the President's 150 Account request is the \nappropriate step at this point in the process.\n  Last week the Foreign Relations Committee passed our State Department \nand Foreign Assistance Authorization bills by a unanimous vote. These \nbills were constructed through bipartisan work, and they reflect \npriorities valued by many of our Members. We stayed within the limits \nof the President's budget request. We believe that the President's full \nbudget request for the 150 Account is necessary to fund critical \npriorities, including embassy security, non-proliferation efforts, \nchild survival and health, and programs that fight the spread of AIDS.\n  I concluded by saying that Americans demand that U.S. military \ncapabilities be unrivaled in the world. Should not our diplomatic \nstrength meet the same test? Relative to our international needs and \nthe risks that we are facing, this amendment is modest. If a greater \ncommitment of resources can prevent the bombing of one of our \nembassies, or the proliferation of a nuclear weapons, or the spiral \ninto chaos of a vulnerable nation wracked by disease and hunger, the \ninvestment will have yielded dividends far beyond its cost.\n  I thank the co-sponsors of this amendment: Senators Feinstein, \nDurbin, DeWine, Hagel, Murray, Jeffords, Chafee, Cantwell, Smith, \nLautenberg, Santorum, McCain, Biden, Sununu, and Levin. Senator \nFeinstein, the lead co-sponsor of my amendment, has been a champion of \nthe 150 Account and has worked closely with me during the budget \nprocess, both last year and this year. I also want to specifically \nthank Senator DeWine, who had two amendments to increase the 150 \nAccount that were focused on Haiti and child survival and health \nprograms. He has co-sponsored this amendment as a way to make \nadditional funds available for these purposes. These are extremely \nimportant priorities, and both have been a big part of our discussions \nin the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I thank the Budget Committee and Chairman Nickles for their help and \ncounsel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lugar and Senator Durbin \nfor working together to clear this amendment so we could get this \naccomplished without a rollcall vote. We appreciate that very much.\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Lugar, as well as Senator \nNickles and Senator Conrad. What we achieved with the Lugar-Durbin \namendment is this: We will increase the funding to fight global AIDS by \nalmost $500 million. We are still short of what we need to meet our \npromised goals when the President made a historic commitment for the \nUnited States to deal with this war on AIDS. But we are moving closer.\n  The bipartisan cooperation this evening with Senator Lugar has \nallowed us to move closer to that moment, and it is equally good news \nfor Members gathered here. It eliminates a need for me calling up my \namendment and a vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as \ncosponsors of Senator Lugar's amendment. These were sponsors of my \namendment. Senators Bingaman, Lautenberg, Schumer, Stabenow, Clinton, \nFeinstein, Kerry, Kohl, Levin, and Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is all time yielded back? If so, the question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 2845.\n  The amendment (No. 2845) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues for their \ncooperation on eliminating two amendments.\n  Mr. President, I call upon the Senator from Alaska who has an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2846\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Ms. Murkowski], for herself, Mr. \n     Specter, Mr. Bond, Mr. Ensign, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. \n     Campbell, Mr. Graham, Mr. Allen, Mr. Stevens, and Ms. \n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 2846.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To increase Veterans Medical Care by $1,200,000,000)\n\n       On page 19, line 21, increase the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 22, increase the amount by $1,080,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 1, increase the amount by $108,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 5, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 20, line 9, increase the amount by $1,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 5, decrease the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 6, decrease the amount by $1,080,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 10, decrease the amount by $108,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 14, decrease the amount by $5,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 18, decrease the amount by $1,000,000.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Specter, \nBond, Stevens, DeWine, Cornyn, Campbell, Graham, Allen, Ensign, and \nMikulski, I propose the following.\n  Many of us have had the opportunity this week to be visited by \nveterans from our respective States, folks who are in town for their \nannual convention and meetings. I am pleased to offer an amendment that \nwill boost the spending for our veterans health care. This would be an \nincrease in veterans health care by $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2005.\n  This is a relatively straightforward amendment. The funds will come \nfrom function 920 and offset the spending increase. The budget, as it \ncurrently stands, provides $70.4 billion for fiscal year 2005 veterans \nprograms. So this would be an increase of $9 billion or 15 percent from \nthe current fiscal year.\n  We need to look at what our veterans have given to this Nation and \nthink about what we should do as we help them. When we look at this \namendment, we help eliminate the wait list for veterans in need of \nmedical care, hopefully shorten the time it will take to process a \nveteran's disability claim and to process our veterans' benefits in a \ntimely manner.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murkowski and also \nSenator Mikulski for their leadership in putting this amendment \ntogether. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we need to be clear with our colleagues, \nthere is no new money. This is rearranging debt. To the extent that \nmeans it is not terribly real, that is the reality. I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to comment briefly at this \ntime to express my support and cosponsorship, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, of the amendment that has been offered \nby the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski, pertaining to veterans' \nmedical care funding.\n\n[[Page S2674]]\n\n  Senator Murkowski's amendment would increase funding for most \ncritical discretionary account of the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nVA, VA medical care account, by $1.2 billion. According to materials \ndistributed by the Budget Committee, the resolution reported out by the \nBudget Committee had already proposed to increase such funding by $1.4 \nbillion. Thus, approval of the Murkowski amendment will up VA medical \ncare spending, relative to the Congressional Budget Office-computed \nbaseline, by $2.6 billion. This number compares quite favorably to the \nmedical care appropriations ``plus up'' of $2.1 billion that the \nRanking Member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Bob Graham, \nand I indicated was necessary in the ``views and estimates letter'' \nthat we provided to the Budget Committee on March 4, 2004. It also \ncompares quite favorably to the two record-breaking increases of $2.4 \nbillion and $2.9 billion that have been provided by Congress in the \npast 2 fiscal years for the VA medical care account. Clearly, this \nCongress--and this President--are fulfilling the commitment that we, as \na nation, owe to those who have served.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. It is good for \nveterans, and it is good for the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2846.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2846) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2847 And 2848, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have two amendments that have been \nagreed upon by both sides of the aisle. One is an amendment by Senator \nGrassley, and an amendment by Senator Byrd and Senator Cochran. I ask \nfor their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes amendments \n     numbered 2847 and 2848, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

(referred to in \n     this section as the ``EEOICPA'') is intended to ensure the \n     timely payment of uniform and adequate compensation to \n     covered employees suffering from occupational illnesses \n     incurred during their work for the Department of Energy.\n       (2) The Department of Labor is responsible for implementing \n     the provisions under subtitle B of the EEOICPA, relating to \n     claims for radiation related cancers, beryllium disease, and \n     silicosis. The Department of Labor has, within its area of \n     responsibility, processed over 95 percent of the 52,000 \n     claims it has received, and is processing these claims in an \n     average of 73 days.\n       (3) As of the date of enactment of this resolution, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services has not promulgated \n     the regulations required under section 3626 of the EEOICPA \n     for allowing claimants to petition to be members of the \n     Special Exposure Cohort. Special Exposure Cohorts provide a \n     presumption in favor of the claimant for radiation related \n     cancers if--\n       (A) it is not feasible to estimate radiation dose with \n     sufficient accuracy; and\n       (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that the health of the \n     class of workers may have been endangered.\n       (4) The Department of Energy, which is responsible for \n     implementing subtitle D of the EEOICPA, relating to \n     occupational illness caused by exposure to toxic substances \n     at Department of Energy facilities, finalized its regulations \n     on August 14, 2002. The Department of Energy has processed 1 \n     percent of the 22,000 claims received through the Department \n     of Energy physicians panels since its regulations were made \n     final.\n       (5) The Department of Energy has no willing payor for up to \n     50 percent of the claims that its physicians panels determine \n     to be related to exposure to a toxic substance at the \n     Department of Energy. As a consequence, many claimants with a \n     positive determination from the physicians panel will be \n     denied benefits. Many States, including Alaska, Colorado, \n     Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, New Mexico, Idaho, and \n     Nevada, may not have a willing payor.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) claims for occupational illness, which are determined \n     to be caused by exposure to toxic substances at Department of \n     Energy facilities under subtitle D of the EEOICPA, should be \n     promptly, equitably, and efficiently compensated;\n       (2) administrative and technical changes should be made to \n     the EEOICPA to--\n       (A) improve claims processing and review by physicians \n     panels to ensure cost-effective and efficient consideration \n     and determination of workers' claims;\n       (B) provide for membership in additional special exposure \n     cohorts; and\n       (C) address eligibility issues at facilities with residual \n     radiation; and\n       (3) the President and Congress should work together at the \n     earliest opportunity to develop a plan that effectively \n     resolves the issue of a lack of a willing payor for many \n     claims that are determined under subtitle D of the EEOICPA to \n     be related to exposure to a toxic substance at Department of \n     Energy facilities.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2848\n\n        (Purpose: To correct the scoring for Project Bioshield)\n\n       On page 43, strike lines 11 through 20, and insert the \n     following:\n       (b) Funding for Bioshield.--The chairman of the Committee \n     on Budget of the Senate shall revise the aggregates, \n     functional totals, and allocations to the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate, discretionary spending limits, \n     and other appropriate levels and limits in this resolution by \n     $2,528,000,000 in budget authority for fiscal year 2005, and \n     by the amount of outlays flowing therefrom in fiscal year \n     2005 and subsequent years for Project Bioshield, for a bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, or conference report that makes \n     appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for \n     the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this budget resolution contains a back-door \ncut that could result in an 8 percent cut in the budget for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. In addition, the resolution contains a \nprovision that will undermine the Pell Grant higher education program. \nThis amendment, which is cosponsored by the chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the Homeland Security and Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittees, \naddresses these issues.\n  Project Bioshield is a new program, first requested by the President \nin February of 2003, that will expand the Federal Government's \npreparedness for a bioterrorist attack by making it easier to purchase \nthe most effective pharmaceuticals and vaccines.\n  The fiscal year 2004 budget resolution, the discretionary limit for \nfiscal year 2005 was set at $814 billion. Above and beyond the $814 \nbillion limit, the resolution assumed $5.6 billion for Project \nBioshield as mandatory spending for legislation considered in the \nSenate. In the House, the budget resolution assumed that funding for \nbioshield would be discretionary.\n  To help resolve the difference between the House and the Senate, the \nPresident submitted a formal budget request on September 12, 2003 for \n$5.6 billion of advanced appropriations as discretionary spending in \nthe fiscal year 2004 Homeland Security Appropriations Act. Congress \napproved the request and the President signed the first Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations Act into law.\n  Six months later, Chairman Nickles has decided to disregard that \nagreement. His budget resolution now assumes that the $2.5 billion of \nProject Bioshield funding that is available for the next 4 years will \nall count against the $814 billion limit for fiscal year 2005, forcing \nthe Appropriations Committee to absorb the cost.\n  What this means is less funding for first responder grants, less \nfunding of the Coast Guard, less funding for border security, less \nmoney for FEMA to respond to disasters and less money to implement our \nimmigration laws. This is unacceptable. My amendment will restore the \nProject Bioshield scoring treatment that was requested by the President \nand approved by the Senate last September and strike the language in \nthe resolution concerning Pell Grants.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this amendment would strike section 404 \nfrom the budget resolution, and provide for the release of the reserve \nfunds originally intended for Bioshield in addition to appropriations \nprovided for\n\n[[Page S2675]]\n\nthe Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2005.\n  The fiscal year 2004 budget resolution established a $5.593 billion \n``reserve'' for Project Bioshield, outside the fiscal years 2004 and \n2005 discretionary caps.\n  This fiscal year 2005 budget resolution, as reported, assumes that \nthe $2.5 billion advance appropriations for Project Bioshield will now \nbe scored against the fiscal year 2005 cap.\n  At the same time, it imposes in section 404(b) a new procedural \nbarrier to prohibit the Senate Appropriations Committee from getting \ncredit for reducing Bioshield funds to live within the cap.\n  The effect is that the Senate Appropriations Committee, unlike the \nHouse, will have to find an additional $2.5 billion in spending \nreductions. This will likely have an adverse impact on ongoing \nprograms, including essential homeland security activities.\n  Advance appropriations were provided to ensure that a stable source \nof funding would be available for this initiative.\n  No new scorekeeping precedent needs to be established to protect this \nprogram.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one of these is an amendment Senator Byrd \nalluded to yesterday. Of these amendments was one Senator Byrd had \nmentioned that Senator Conrad had on his list. It is an amendment that \nis very complicated, and I will work with Senator Byrd and also Senator \nCochran who raised it, and Senator Judd Gregg, all who are involved in \nbioshield and how it was scored. We will try to score it correctly, and \nwe will work with our colleagues in a manner to do that. We are happy \nto accept that amendment. The second amendment is an amendment by \nSenator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a very complex scoring issue. It \nmay take some work after it leaves the Chamber tonight to get this \nright. We very much appreciate the fact that all the parties have \nworked together to avoid a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back. Without objection, the \namendments are agreed to, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2847 and 2848) were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I want to thank our colleagues. We are making progress. \nI especially want to thank Senator Ensign who just withdrew his \namendment on firewall. I am sure that will save us a substantial amount \nof time.\n  On our side I believe we have amendments still pending. It would be \nthe Kyl amendment and, I am hopeful, final passage.\n  If Senator Conrad would look at this, I believe we have both agreed \nto clear an amendment of Senator Specter and Senator Harkin.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we are down to maybe two \namendments on our side.\n  I see Senator Lautenberg is standing up.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does Senator Conrad want to go with Senator Lautenberg's \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. Chairman, I think it would be useful to do that. This \nhas a bit of a complexity.\n  Mr. NICKLES. This is late at night, and I urge our colleagues to \nconfine their statements to 1 minute each. As a matter of fact, I ask \nunanimous consent that statements made on behalf of and in opposition \nto any remaining amendments be limited to 1 minute each.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I call upon our colleague and friend from \nNew Jersey to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2797\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2797.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 25, strike lines 4 through 8.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to make \nclear to the American people what it is we do here tonight. It is far \nfrom certain all the Members of the Senate are totally familiar with \neverything that is enmeshed in the arcane language and complicated \nprocesses in this budget resolution.\n  Our amendment says as we see deficits hemorrhaging and the debt limit \nstretched to $7.4 trillion, we want to be certain it is known this \nbudget bill carries hidden in its mystical language an increase of $664 \nbillion with instruction to the Senate and the House to go up to a \ntotal of $8 trillion on the debt limit; therefore, virtually \nautomatically permitting more borrowing to take place without review \nand direct approval.\n  Can my colleagues imagine how the American people will feel if \ntonight we add $2,400 worth of debt to each and every one of them and \ngive them in exchange an average of $200 in tax relief? Imagine, $2,400 \nworth of debt and $200 worth of cash. It makes Shylock look like an \namateur.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so we can defer any \nattempt to increase our debt limit unless it is clear to all what we \nare going to do by taking our debt limit through the roof. I hope we \ncan get support for this so we can have an intelligent debate \nspecifically on the debt limit at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I hope we do not need reconciliation to pass a debt \nlimit. I do know it is important to pass a debt limit. This is a \npolitical season. Maybe people want to play games with it and offer \nunlimited amendments. I do not know that we would do that. We did not \ndo that last year. We actually passed the debt limit in 1 day, I \nbelieve. I hope we can do it in 1 day and I hope we can do it outside \nof reconciliation. We should be able to do it. This gives us at least \nsome additional protection to make sure the full faith and credit of \nthe United States is adhered to, that we pay our bills on time.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote no on the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2797.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is absent \nattending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 42, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 57 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--42\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham (FL)\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham (SC)\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n\n[[Page S2676]]\n\n\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Edwards\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Reid\n  The amendment (No. 2797) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu).

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I \nhave sponsored, along with Senator Nelson of Florida and Senator \nColeman of Minnesota, to increase the amount of funding that we can \nprovide to the people of Haiti. It is a commonsense amendment, as it \nrecognizes the reality of the situation in Haiti right now. It \nrecognizes that we have a lot of work ahead of us in Haiti and that it \nis going to require considerable resources and a long-term commitment. \nAnd, it mirrors the suggested $150 million budget benchmark which was \nincluded in S. 2144, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, which was \npassed out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week.\n  As many of my colleagues know, over the last 9 years since I have \nbeen in the Senate, I have traveled to Haiti 13 or 14 different times. \nAnd, if I have learned anything in the course of those trips, it is \nthis: There is no other nation in our hemisphere like Haiti.\n  Haiti is different. Haiti is unique. No other nation in our \nhemisphere is as impoverished. Today, at least 80 percent of all \nHaitians live in dire poverty, with at least 75 to 85 percent \nunderemployed or unemployed. Per capita annual income is less than \n$400.\n  No other nation in our hemisphere has a higher rate of HIV/AIDS. \nToday, AIDS is the number one cause of all adult deaths in Haiti, \nkilling at least 30,000 Haitians annually and orphaning 200,000 \nchildren.\n  No other nation in our hemisphere has a higher infant mortality rate \nor a lower life expectancy rate.\n  And no other nation in our hemisphere is as environmentally strapped. \nHaiti is an ecological disaster, with a 98-percent deforestation rate \nand extreme topsoil erosion.\n  Despite its radical differences, Haiti remains in our backyard. It is \nintrinsically linked to the United States--by history, geography, \nhumanitarian concerns, the illicit drug trade, and the ever-present \npossibility of waves of incoming refugees. Haiti's problems are\n\n[[Page S2677]]\n\nour problems, and we are not going to be able to do anything about any \nof these problems unless Haiti, the United States, and the \ninternational community are willing to take several bold, radical \nsteps.\n  First, the international community must help Haiti restore a \ndemocratically elected government--one free of corruption and the \ninfluence and involvement of violent, human rights abusing thugs and \nkillers.\n  Second, we must free Haiti of its $1.17 billion in foreign debt.\n  Third, we must increase trade and create jobs. Along with Congressman \nClay Shaw, I have written a trade bill--the ``Haiti Economic Recovery \nOpportunity Act,'' S. 489. If enacted, this legislation will help \nrestore some of those jobs and create new ones.\n  Fourth, we must help Haiti develop a self-sufficient system of \nagriculture.\n  Fifth, we must help Haiti restore the rule of law. The international \ncommunity needs to resume programs for mentoring magistrate and judges, \nand the new Haitian Government needs to create a functioning \ndisciplinary body to oversee the entire judiciary.\n  Sixth, we must help Haiti establish an independent, professional \nnational police force--one capable of quelling the violence of the \narmed thugs who threaten the streets of Haiti with abandon.\n  And finally, the international community should immediately restore \nthe direct aid to the government that was suspended under Aristide, so \nHaiti can rebuild much-needed institutions and infrastructure for the \ndelivery of food, humanitarian aid, and health care.\n  In 1994, prior to Mr. Aristide's reinstatement of power--during a \ntime of military dictatorship, under Lieutenant General Cedras--our \nassistance to Haiti was far greater than it is today. Back in 1994, we \nprovided $69.5 million. In fact, our assistance to Haiti reached an all \ntime high in 1995, when it spiked to $235.2 million. The following \nyear, it drastically fell by over half to $104.9 million. Four years \nlater, it fell even more--down to $58.2 million. And today, we are \nlooking at a $54 million budget. It simply isn't enough. That is why \nour amendment is so important.\n  Ultimately, the United States can't ``fix'' Haiti, nor can the \ninternational community. But we can improve the situation, and we can \nhelp Haiti begin to help itself. But, it is going to take a serious, \nsustained commitment. Things won't change overnight, and we must remain \ncommitted to Haiti for as long as it takes for reforms to take root and \nfor a democratic system of government to emerge. The first step in this \nprocess is providing a realistic level of funding for these efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2850, 2697, and 2715) were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, our colleague from Minnesota has been \nvery patient, and I appreciate that. I wish to recognize our colleague \nfrom Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this amendment has three parts. First, it \nincreases the Federal funding for special education to the 40-percent \nshare that was promised for the last 27 years. This year the Federal \nfunding for special education is less than half of what was promised 27 \nyears ago. In my State of Minnesota, this broken promise for special \neducation means cuts in Federal programs that occur across all schools \nfor all students, and it also means higher property taxes for the \ncitizens of my State.\n  I can't believe the other States in this Nation don't encounter the \nsame problems when the Federal Government doesn't fund one of its two \nmost important commitments to education at even half the level it has \npromised for over a quarter of a century.\n  The second amendment would reduce the Federal deficit by $1 million a \nyear for each of the next 5 years. To pay for this, I would increase \nthe top tax rate from 35 percent to 38.5 percent. The average income of \nAmericans in that top tax bracket is over $1.1 million. Of course, they \ndon't pay that top rate. Their income from dividends and from capital \ngains is now taxed at 15 percent. With the lower rates and other \nloopholes, most of America's multimillionaires and billionaires pay \nlower tax rates than most middle-class working Americans.\n  The question is, Whose needs are more important america's \nschoolchildren who have the greatest needs or America's superrich who \nhave the greatest connections?\n  The answer is we have seen at least a dozen times tonight that the \nsuperrich are the best connected people in America. All of these \nphantom family farmers and struggling small business owners of \ncompanies the size of Lockheed whose incomes exceed over $1.1 million a \nyear, none of whom are located in Minnesota, but they are out there \nsomewhere.\n  I call up my amendment and will agree once it has been read to accept \nthe decision on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Dayton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2786.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON.

RESERVE FUND FOR VETERANS' MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance or the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the Senate reports a bill or joint resolution, or \n     an amendment thereto is offered or a conference report \n     thereon is submitted, that (1) provides an increase in \n     veterans' medical program funding and (2) is fully offset by \n     an assessment on lawyer fees paid under the tobacco \n     settlement, the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of \n     the Senate may revise the allocations of new budget \n     authority, outlays, the revenue aggregates and other \n     appropriate aggregates by not more than $1.7 billion for the \n     period fiscal year 2005 to 2009 to\n\n[[Page S2679]]\n\n     reflect such legislation, provided that such legislation \n     would not increase the deficit for fiscal year 2005 and for \n     the period of fiscal years 2005 through 2009.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the full reading of the \namendment, but it probably is not clear from its reading, so let me \nexplain what the amendment would do.\n  This amendment restores at least $1.7 billion to the Federal Treasury \nto be used for veterans health care, paid for by blocking tobacco \nlawyers from extracting obscenely excessive and unethical attorney fees \nfrom the multistate tobacco settlement. The amendment caps future fee \npayments from this agreement at $20,000 an hour. In an 8-hour day that \nis more money than, of course, our salary.\n  The amendment does not apply to any fees from any cases that have \nalready been judicially reviewed and approved by the court and would \nonly apply prospectively, to fees paid in the future, out of the \ntobacco settlement taxes that have not yet been collected. The trial \nlawyers still will receive billions of dollars under this amendment. So \nfar, they have received in the billions of dollars. At $20,000 an hour, \nI suggest this amendment would impose perhaps a one yacht per lawyer \nper day rule.\n  It is actually a serious proposition. The people who are being ripped \noff here are, of course, the people who are supposed to benefit from \nthe tobacco settlement. But the fees in some of the cases amount to \nmore than $100,000 an hour and ultimately involve little or no original \nlegal work.\n  Do not take my word for it. These fees are indefensible and \noutrageous. Even some in the trial bar are in agreement. Here is what \nnoted plaintiffs' lawyers, including tobacco lawyers, have had to say \nabout the tobacco fee award. Michael Ciresi, a pioneer in the tobacco \nlitigation who represented the State of Minnesota in its lawsuit, and \nwho is no doubt familiar with these lawsuits, said the Texas, Florida, \nand Mississippi lawyers' fees awards ``are far in excess of these \nlawyers' contribution to any of the state results.''\n  Washington, DC lawyer tobacco industry opponent John Coale has \ndenounced the fee awards as ``beyond human comprehension,'' stating \nthat ``the work does not justify them.''\n  Even the Association of American Trial Lawyers, the Nation's premier \nrepresentative of the plaintiffs' bar, has condemned attorneys' fees \nrequested in these State tobacco settlements. Here is what the \nPresident of ATLA noted:\n\n       Common sense suggests that a one billion dollar fee is \n     excessive and unreasonable and certainly should invite the \n     scrutiny [of the courts.] ATLA generally refrains from \n     expressing an institutional opinion regarding a particular \n     fee in a particular case, but we have a strong negative \n     reaction to reports that at least one attorney on behalf of \n     the plaintiffs in the Florida case is seeking a fee in excess \n     of one billion dollars.\n\n  Finally, to get the academic side of it, quoting from Professor \nLester Brickman, professor of law at Cardozo Law School and a noted \nauthority on legal ethics and attorneys' fees:\n\n       Under the rules of legal ethics, promulgated partly as a \n     justification for the legal profession's self-governance, \n     fees cannot be `clearly excessive.' Indeed, that standard has \n     been superseded in most states by an even more rigorous \n     standard: Fees have to be `reasonable.' Are these fees, which \n     in many cases amount to effective hourly rates of return of \n     tens of thousands--and even hundreds of thousands--dollars an \n     hour, reasonable? I think to ask the question is to answer \n     it.\n\n  The choice before the Senate is we can either allow the tobacco \nsettlement to continue to be diverted to pay $100,000 an hour fees to \nbillionaire lawyers or we can put the excess of those fees to a proper \nuse, serving a national need, such as veterans health benefits, while \nstill allowing the tobacco lawyers to earn up to $20,000 an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona is on to an \ninteresting concept and I will offer a second-degree amendment to \nexpand a good idea. The amendment which I will offer will suggest we \ncan also offset the expenses of veterans health care by profits paid to \nand penalties paid by sole-source contractors doing business in Iraq.\n  I took a look at some of the companies doing business in Iraq. It \nturns out they are making not only outrageous profits, but they are \nunder investigation by our Government. Sole-source contractors, such as \nHalliburton and Bechtel--and as you look at some of the figures, I \nwould concede some of the figures relative to fees are stunning but, \nfrankly, Halliburton puts them to shame. Halliburton's Kellogg Brown & \nRoot subsidiary is under mounting scrutiny since last fall over \nsuspicions that a fuel contract the company signed in May overcharged \nUnited States taxpayers by $61 million, up to the end of September and \n$20 million a month since then.\n  This is rather lengthy. I will try to get it together quickly because \nthere are so many things Halliburton has been involved in. Let me go \nthrough the chronology of Halliburton and how we believe they \nsubstantially overcharged the taxpayers. Incidentally, this is not a \npartisan observation. The Pentagon has turned Halliburton in to the \nSEC. Let me go through the chronology.\n  December 11, 2003, a Pentagon audit finds substantial overcharging in \n$1.2 billion of Halliburton fuel sales in Iraq;\n  January 14, 2004, Pentagon audit asks Defense inspector general to \nlaunch a formal investigation;\n  January 22, Halliburton discloses two workers took large kickbacks as \npart of a $6.3 million overcharging scheme involving a Kuwaiti-based \ncompany;\n  February 1, investigators find Halliburton overcharged more than 16 \nmillion for meals at a United States base in Kuwait;\n  February 3, total overbill for meals rises to $36 million.\n  This keeps growing. February 16, the company agrees to withhold \nbilling on additional $140 million in food services. Now the numbers \nare really adding up quickly.\n  March 10, Defense inspector general asks Justice Department to begin \nthe investigation of Halliburton. Halliburton has multiple contracts \nvalued at up to $188 billion to support the Army and repair oil fields \nin Iraq. And the profits, I might add for my colleagues, they are \ngenerating obviously allow them to run some very fine television \nadvertising.\n  I hope my colleagues have all had a chance to see the patriotism of \nHalliburton and its advertising, but we cannot seem to find the \npatriotism when it comes to their doing business with the Government. \nThey are overcharging taxpayers, we are being penalized, they are under \ninvestigation, and the Senator from Arizona has come up with a \nwonderful idea. We should tap into the excess profits and penalties of \nsole-source contractors in Iraq to help veterans health care.\n  I am sorry we turned down the amendment of the Senator from South \nDakota: $2.7 billion for veterans health care the other night was \ndefeated. Of course, I understand why the other side defeated it. We \nwanted to cut the tax break for the wealthiest Americans from $140,000 \na year to $112,000 a year. That was an outrageous idea rejected by the \nSenate. We said the veterans have to wait for another day.\n\n  The day has arrived. We are going after the tobacco settlement. We \nare going to add Halliburton and Bechtel into this. Frankly, we are \ngoing to find excess profits and penalties that can make a difference.\n  The Members of the Senate may recall not too long ago the Senator \nfrom Vermont offered a very valuable amendment during the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill on profiteering by contractors in Iraq. If I am not \nmistaken, I believe it passed by a vote of 97-0 in the Senate.\n  If it is appropriate, I ask the Senator from Vermont, I don't believe \nthat amendment survived the conference committee on the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I could respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am not yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator only yields for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Vermont would like to ask a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time in opposition is controlled by the \nminority bill manager. The Senator can yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. May I ask the Senator from Illinois a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask the Senator from Illinois if he was aware of the \nfact the\n\n[[Page S2680]]\n\ncommittee in conference, even though there was bipartisan support for \nthe war profiteering amendment that was based word for word on what we \nused after World War II, after the Korean war, I was told the \nleadership in the House said they were under orders from the White \nHouse to remove the war profiteering.\n  Did the Senator from Illinois know the White House came in and said \nwhat was generally called the Halliburton amendment had to be taken out \nof the committee of conference?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I was not aware of that. And if I am not mistaken, I \nthink the Senator from Vermont modeled his amendment after a World War \nII amendment on profiteering. It is amazing to me we struck the \nlanguage on profiteering in the omnibus bill, and now look what has \nhappened with Halliburton and other companies. They are being \ninvestigated. They are being charged with gouging taxpayers. We are \nlosing money. Frankly, I do not think it is reasonable for taxpayers to \nhave to pay this. The Senator from Arizona is on to a good idea.\n  Let me give you a couple other examples he might be interested in. \nAccording to a recent NBC News report, another politically connected \nPentagon contractor, DynCorps, is hiring senior people to train Iraqi \npolice at a cost to American taxpayers of some $400,000 a year per \ntrainer. Counting living expenses, tax liability, and reimbursements, \nit is worth about $50 million so far. It turns out the contract only \nhad one bidder. It is expected to generate about $800 million in \nrevenue to DynCorps over the next 2 years.\n  Let me say, when the Senator from Arizona yields back his time, I \nwill be offering a second-degree amendment. We will have a chance to \nvote on Halliburton before we get to the tobacco settlement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would respectfully ask my colleague from \nIllinois to withdraw his second-degree amendment. If he wishes to have \na vote on the amendment----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no pending second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. If the Senator does not wish to lay down his second-degree \namendment, then that is fine, because we have not had any second-degree \namendments yet. If it is not his intention to lay it down, then we can \nproceed to a vote on the amendment I have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when the Senator from Arizona yields back \nhis time, I will be offering the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me renew my request, with all due respect \nto my friend from Illinois. I do not know how many scores of amendments \nhave been voted on by this body in the last 48 hours or so, most of \nwhich have been offered by Members on the Democratic side. We have not \nsecond-degreed a single one of those amendments. I have checked.\n  Of course, it is possible to get a vote on an amendment. Everybody \naround here knows that. At this late date, I just wonder if my \ncolleagues want to go through the time and the process that requires. I \nhave no objection to my colleague having a vote on the proposal which \nhe says he is going to propound here as soon as I yield back my time. \nBut I also think he should permit me to have a vote on the amendment I \nhave laid down, as we have done for every one of the other amendments \nhere. Therefore, again, I would ask my colleague, if he wishes to lay \ndown an amendment and have a vote on that amendment--and I certainly \nwould not do anything to get in the way of that or object to it--that \nhe permit a vote on this as a freestanding amendment. Because if that \ndoes not happen, then it is going to take us a very long time tonight. \nBut we will still get a vote on each of these amendments.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields to the Senator from Illinois?\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we have made great progress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The time on this amendment is \ncontrolled by the Senator from Arizona and the minority manager.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to my colleague, \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator would yield for a question, I understand \nyour request is to have a vote on your amendment and to have a vote on \nthe Durbin amendment back to back. Is that your request?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if the Senator from Illinois wishes to lay \ndown an amendment, I have, as I said, no objection to having a vote on \nhis amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If the Senator will yield further, I want to thank my \ncolleague from North Dakota because it has been very much because of \nhis leadership--and I think we have helped as well--that we have not \nhad a second-degree vote yet, and I do not think we should. We have \ndone that because we have worked together.\n  I wish for us to continue working together. I wish for us to have, if \nnecessary, a vote on the Kyl and Durbin amendments, and a vote on--I \nbelieve Senator Kennedy has an amendment. I would hope we could do that \nby voice, but it looks like we need a rollcall vote on that. I think we \nmay be able to take Senator Landrieu's amendment, and then we can vote \non final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this has been 4 long days and 4 difficult \ndays in which the two sides have worked together with a remarkable \nspirit of cooperation and good will.\n  I would call on my two colleagues--both Senator Kyl, whom I like and \nrespect, and Senator Durbin, about whom I feel the same way--and ask \nthem both to allow those two votes to go away. They can come back on \nother vehicles at a later point.\n  Here we are, at 12:30, with an amendment that has a political agenda \nand calls for a political response. I think it is not appropriate, at \n12:25, after we have worked together for 4 days with substantive \ndisagreements which we have dealt with in an orderly and cooperative \nway. Can't we just withhold on this budget resolution and deal with \nthis issue on a later vehicle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would respond to the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee, what he says is absolutely true. Everything has been \ndone, up until now, by comity. And I complimented--I am not sure you \nheard it, but to the Senator from North Dakota, I complimented his \nhandling of this issue as much as the chairman's.\n\n  As the chairman of the Budget Committee will acknowledge, I had been \nwaiting for a long time to offer my amendment. He urged me to wait, to \nwait, to wait. Had I offered it earlier, this issue would not even be \nbefore us. Many of the other amendments that were offered had political \novertones. I think we all have to acknowledge that. I will acknowledge \nmine does. I think you would have to acknowledge an awful lot of the \namendments that have been offered here on which we had rollcall votes \nhad political overtones. We all understand that.\n  I do not need to take any more time on this. I simply put forth an \namendment that took me about 5 minutes to discuss. I would like to get \na vote on it. I have no objection to the Senator from Illinois offering \nhis proposal and getting a vote on that. We can probably get this done \nquickly instead of talking about it, and just get it done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Do the Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, perhaps before I yield back the time, I would \nlike to ask my colleague from Illinois if he would be willing to have \ntwo back-to-back votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator may yield for \nthat question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, of course I would yield to a question. I \nwould say, I am not going to withdraw the second-degree amendment. I \nwill\n\n[[Page S2681]]\n\nnot ask for any further debate. We can have up-or-down votes in the \ninterest of time. But I think because of the comity that has been \ndisplayed to this point, perhaps if both amendments retreated and were \nsaved for another day, it would be in the best interest of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2849 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this has been a remarkably good 4 days for \nthe Senate. On a bipartisan basis, we have debated this budget \nresolution. Yes, there have been differences. Yes, there have been \ndebates. But it has been at a high level with a good tone. Can't we end \nit on that basis? If we cannot, there are other alternatives open. I \nhope my colleagues are listening because there are other alternatives \nopen. The alternatives open are to offer amendment after amendment \nafter amendment after amendment, and we can be here all night and all \nday tomorrow and all day Saturday and all day Sunday and all day \nMonday, and we can just keep on voting.\n  Either this is resolved in a responsible and respectful way or I can \nassure my colleagues we have hundreds of amendments that are all \nprepared that we have just spent hours talking our colleagues out of \noffering.\n  I will say to my colleagues on this side, dust off your amendments. \nLet's get ready to debate and discuss and vote for a long time, if we \ncan't have a reasonable ending to this predicament.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make a request and see if my \ncolleagues will abide by this. We have an amendment offered by Senator \nKyl. We have an amendment offered by Senator Durbin. We have an \namendment pending in the wings by Senator Kennedy, and we have an \namendment pending in the wings by Senator Santorum. I would ask all \nfour of those amendments to disappear in the twilight of this morning, \nthat we have a voice vote on Senator Landrieu's amendment, and we vote \non final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me indicate that it is not just those \nfour amendments. Let me just advise my colleagues, when we started this \nprocess, we had 130 amendments. If we don't dispose of these other four \nin the way the chairman has indicated, I will call each and every one \nof those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2785 And 2851, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, tempers are starting to rise. This is not \ngood for the cause.\n  We are very close to the finish line. Senator Conrad and I have been \nworking together very closely. We have agreed to a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution by Senator Lugar and an amendment by Senator Specter. I send \nthose to the desk and ask for their immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The assistant journal clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Lugar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2785.\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Mr. Specter, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2851.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2785\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning summer food \n                            pilot projects)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING SUMMER FOOD PILOT \n                   PROJECTS.\n\n        It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     concurrent resolution assume that in making appropriations \n     and revenue decisions in Function 600 (Income Security), the \n     Senate supports the provision, to the Food and Nutrition \n     Service and other appropriate agencies within the Department \n     of Agriculture, of $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2005, and \n     $127,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2005 through \n     2009, to enable those agencies to expand the summer food \n     pilot projects established under section 18(f) of the Richard \n     B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1769(f)) to \n     all States of the United States and to all service \n     institutions (including service institutions described in \n     section 13(a)(7) of that Act).\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2851\n\n                     (Purpose: Strike Section 404)\n\n       Strike section 404(a).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to considering the \namendments en bloc? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendments? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to amendments Nos. 2785 and 2851, en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2785 and No. 2851) were agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2852\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe Senator Collins has an \namendment. I send it to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles], for Ms. Collins, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2852.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide a deficit neutral reserve fund for Postal Service \n                                reform)\n\n       On page 28, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 304. RESERVE FOR POSTAL SERVICE REFORM.\n\n       If the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate \n     reports a bill or joint resolution, or an amendment thereto \n     is offered or a conference report thereon is submitted, that \n     reforms the United States Postal Service to improve its \n     economic viability, the Chairman of the Committee on the \n     Budget may revise committee allocations for the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs and other appropriate budgetary \n     aggregates and allocations of new budget authority and \n     outlays by the amount provided by that measure for that \n     purpose, if that measure would not increase the deficit for \n     fiscal year 2005 and for the period of fiscal years 2005 \n     though 2009.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend, Senator \nCarper, to offer an amendment that will help the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee--GAC, which I chair, report out legislation reforming the \nUnited States Postal Service.\n  The Postal Service is the linchpin of a $900 billion industry that \nemploys nine million Americans in fields as diverse as direct mailing, \nprinting, catalog production, publishing, and paper manufacturing. The \nhealth of the Postal Service is essential to thousands of companies and \nthe millions that they employ. It is vital that we in Congress, the \nPostal Service, its employees, and the mailing industry work together \nto save and strengthen this institution on which so many Americans \nrely.\n  What many people do not realize is that the Postal Service cannot \nsurvive without fundamental reform. Last month, Comptroller General \nDavid Walker wrote to me to urge comprehensive--not incremental--reform \nto ensure the USPS' future viability. In a letter to me, he stressed \nthat ``comprehensive postal reform is urgently needed'' and noted that \nthe Postal Service's current business model ``is not well aligned with \n21st century realities.'' If anything, David Walker is understating the \npoint.\n  The Postal Service is faced with enormous debts. It owes $6.5 billion \nin debt to the U.S. Treasury and its long-term liabilities include \nnearly $7 billion for Workers' Compensation claims, $5 billion for \nretirement costs, and as much as $45 billion to cover retiree health \ncare costs. The fact is, if the Postal Service no longer provided \nuniversal service at affordable rates, no private company could step in \nand fill the void. The economies simply would not work.\n  That is why the Governmental Affairs Committee has embarked on a \ndeliberative effort to produce and report out legislation reforming the \nUnited States Postal Service. We have held six\n\n[[Page S2682]]\n\nhearings to date, and we are not yet finished. Once we have heard from \nall interested parties and gathered and analyzed as much information as \npossible, Senator Carper and I plan to introduce reform legislation. \nThis amendment will help us move our bill toward enactment.\n  Our amendment sets up a deficit-neutral reserve fund to accommodate \npostal reform. Under the terms of the amendment, if the Governmental \nAffairs Committee reports out a postal reform bill that is fully \noffset, then the Budget Committee chairman can allocate to GAC the \ndirect spending authority we would need to bring our bill to the floor \nwithout it being subject to a budget act point of order. It is my \nintent to seek only offsets for our bill that enjoy a broad, bipartisan \nconsensus of our committee. Our amendment would permit the bill to \noffset direct spending increases with parallel revenue increases--say, \nby closing abusive tax loopholes--which is an avenue I plan to explore \nfurther. Of course, if a suitable offset cannot be found, it would be \nmy intent to move forward nonetheless.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2852.\n  The amendment (No. 2852) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, \nhas an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. NICKLES. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is also cleared on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2775) was agreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Corzine has an amendment pending.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, has the chairman and the ranking member \nbeen able to resolve the question on the floor with regard to the other \nwithdrawals? If that is the case, I will be prepared to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we give extra points for colleagues who \nwithdraw amendments after 12 o'clock. Three colleagues will make about \n2 minutes worth of remarks and then we can be voting on final passage. \nI believe Senator Kennedy is first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All remaining general debate time is \ncontrolled by the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had an important amendment dealing with \na Medicare proposal to follow the recommendation of the Medicare \nactuaries, which indicate that we are paying the HMOs and the PPOs \n$1,100 a year more than is being paid to Medicare, which over a 10-year \nperiod is $42 billion.\n  My amendment would have used that $42 billion to offset the expenses \nunder the current prescription drug program. I understand now that \nthere has been a proposal offered by the leaders. I have the assurance \nfrom our leader he will make the best effort to give us the opportunity \nto address this in a timely way in the next legislation that comes \nthrough here. On that basis, I withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor his generosity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that as a result of \nthe suggestion of the chairman of the Budget Committee, the four \npending matters would not be voted on, which would include the proposal \nI offered, the proposal of the Senator from Illinois, and the proposal \nof the Senator from Pennsylvania, who will speak last, and as Senator \nKennedy mentioned, his as well. I want my colleagues to know this is \nbeing done by the four of us in an effort to try to get finished here \nvery soon.\n  It seems to me we ought to take one lesson from what has occurred \nhere tonight, which is that those of us who wish to bring amendments to \nthe floor, to have them debated and voted on, who I think have every \nright to have those amendments voted on, will have to in the future \noffer these amendments at a different time in the process. I hope my \ncolleagues will recognize that when we do that, it is for the purpose \nof getting that vote.\n  I think my colleagues would have to agree that the process followed \nhere tonight was not fair and the only reason I have withdrawn the \namendment I proposed was so we can complete action. Rest assured that \nthe proposal will be back and my colleagues will have an opportunity to \nvote on it in the future.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is controlled by the minority \nmanager.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in the interest of fostering this \nbipartisan feeling that has been so prevalent throughout these 4 days, \nI will yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania for 2 minutes.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2853\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2853.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I send this documentation in support of \nthe amendment to the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                           CANDIDATE KERRY'S BUDGET

Mr. President, what I sent to the desk was a budget as \nproposed by Senator Kerry. This is a combination of the documentation \nfrom the L.A. Times, Washington Post, and other sources, of the \nproposals he has made with respect to this year's budget.\n  For the information of Members, the proposal reflects 129 different \nline items in the budget, of which 124 are increases and 5 are \ndecreases. As a result of the proposals put forth by Senator Kerry, \ntaxes would be raised on the American people $351 billion over the next \n5 years.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not control the time.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. If I may continue, Mr. President. The Government would \nspend $1.89 trillion more over the next 5 years and borrow $738 billion \nmore. In other words, the deficit would be $738 billion more under the \nproposals put forth by Senator Kerry. When asked about that, his \ncampaign said they have more refinements to do.\n  The bottom line is what we have proposed is a responsible budget to \ncut the deficit in half over the next 3 years, and what the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is offering around the country is a budget that \nwould increase the deficit by $738 billion, increase taxes on the \nAmerican people by $350 billion, and increase spending in Washington, \nDC, by almost $1.1 trillion.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2853, Withdrawn\n\n  I would love to have had a vote on the amendment. But in the spirit \nof comity that we have here at quarter of 1 in the morning, I will \nwithdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have the Bush budget and I could send \nthat to the desk. I am the only one who has time remaining here \ntonight. I would say to my colleagues, I have 300 charts, and I would \nbe willing to go through all of them tonight, talking about the \ndeficiencies of the Bush budget.\n  Let's just start with the debt that is being added and put on the \nAmerican people by the Bush budget: $3 trillion of additional debt in \njust the next 5 years when we already have record budget deficits--the \nbiggest budget deficit in the history of the country. The President is \nasking us to take $2.4 trillion from Social Security--every penny of \nSocial Security surplus--over the next 10 years and use it to pay for \nincome tax cuts primarily directed to the wealthiest among us.\n\n[[Page S2684]]\n\n  We could go on and on and on about the deficiencies of this budget: a \n94-percent cut in the COPS Program; a 60- percent cut in port security \nat a time when our security is at risk; a 33-percent cut to \nfirefighters.\n  We could have an extended and lengthy discussion about the \ndeficiencies of the Bush budget. We could go through the entire history \nof this President, who told us 3 years ago that we could have massive \ntax cuts and we would still have no budget deficits. He told us at the \ntime he would completely protect Social Security, not taking it to use \nfor other purposes, and now he takes $2.4 trillion, violating that \npledge.\n  We could go to his statement in the next year in which he promised us \nthat the deficits would be small and short-term. Instead, now we see \nthe biggest deficits in the history of our country.\n  Then we could go to the third year, when the President told us the \ndeficits would be small by historical standards. Instead of being \nsmall, they are the biggest deficits in the history of the United \nStates.\n\n  Now he has told us the deficit will be cut in half if only we adopt \nhis budget. Let me say to my colleagues, the only way he gets that is \nhe leaves out big chunks of Federal expenditures.\n  First, he says there is no cost for the war past September 30. None. \nDoes anybody believe that? There is no cost for Iraq, there is no cost \nfor Afghanistan, there is no additional cost for the war on terror?\n  The Congressional Budget Office says there is $280 billion of \nresidual costs. Not one penny of it is in the President's budget.\n  I could go on and on about the deficiencies of this budget. I will \nnot send the Bush budget to the desk. I will not ask for a vote. In the \ninterest of the good tone that has been set, and out of friendship and \nrespect for the chairman who has conducted himself in a most honorable \nand decent way, I ask that we go to final passage.\n  I also yield, again in the spirit of bipartisanship, 3 minutes to the \nchairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues. I knew \nthat we were attempting a lot to try to finish this tonight. I knew we \nwould have a lot of votes and, I say to Senator Byrd, I knew it would \nnot be easy. I thank Senator Byrd for his help. I thank all colleagues \nfor their patience. With a little exception in the last hour, this has \nbeen managed quite well.\n  I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Conrad, for his work. We \nhave handled I don't know how many amendments. I think we voted on 15, \n16 amendments today. We had a lot of cooperation. We got a lot of good \nwork accomplished. We have a budget which we are ready to pass that \nwill cut the deficit in half in 3 years.\n  I thank our colleagues. I thank Senator Conrad's staff; Mary Naylor, \nSue Nelson, and his entire team, as well as Hazen Marshall, Stacey \nHughes, and my entire team. They worked endless hours.\n  I urge adoption of the resolution. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                          mental health parity\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to begin by complimenting my \nfriend from Oklahoma and the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee on \na job well done. He has skillfully navigated a difficult course to \nproduce the Budget Resolution before us today. Congratulations.\n  I also want to tell him that even though he has served as the \nChairman of the Senate Budget Committee for only two short years, he \nhas set a very high bar for future Chairmen to meet.\n  I would like to raise the issue of mental health parity as the Senate \ndebates the FY 2005 Senate Budget Resolution.\n  It is my understanding the Resolution before us assumes the revenue \nimpact of enacting a mental health parity law at a cost of $2.3 billion \nover five years. However, I want to make sure that this is indeed the \ncase because the assumption I just mentioned is not specifically \nreferenced in S. Con. Res. 95. Rather, the overall revenue number is \nsuch that it assumes Congress will pass mental health parity \nlegislation.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand the concern of the distinguished senior \nSenator from New Mexico regarding mental health parity legislation and \nI would concur with my colleague's assessment. S. Con. Res. 95 does \nassume the revenue impact of enacting mental health parity legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman for his \nconsideration and explanation of this important matter.\n\n\n                             AMTRAK FUNDING\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am aware that some of my colleagues are \nconcerned about budgeting sufficient funding for Amtrak. I would like \nto point out that this budget does not specifically provide sufficient \nfunding for the continuing operations of Amtrak, our Nation's intercity \npassenger rail carrier. The President's budget this year proposes $900 \nmillion for Amtrak, an amount generally and widely considered to be \ninsufficient to safely operate the railroad; it would likely have to be \nshut down. Amtrak officials have stated that $1.798 billion would \nsufficiently fund their operations and capital needs in fiscal year \n2005. This amount would help Amtrak return to a good state-of-repair, \nand let them provide safe, reliable service. Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee Ranking Member Hollings has shown great \nleadership as a supporter of passenger rail service in our country, and \nI want him and others to know that we are not endorsing the President's \nbudget request for Amtrak.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee. His hard work in highlighting shortcomings in the \nPresident's budget is truly commendable. As my friend from North Dakota \nstates, I feel it is important to recognize the need for adequate \nfunding for Amtrak. Earlier this year, the Senate passed S. 1072, the \nSafe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of \n2004, SAFE-TEA, which reauthorized many Federal surface transportation \nprograms. As part of that reauthorization package, we authorized $2 \nbillion per year for Amtrak for 6 years. The Senate recognized that \nfunding for Amtrak is a priority. Rail travel provides passengers an \nalternative to air travel and driving, and the benefits are numerous. \nRidership on Amtrak trains totaled over 24 million last year. I am \ncertain we will not allow funding for this important service to fall \nbelow adequate levels requested by Amtrak President and CEO David Gunn, \nwho has made such great progress recently. It is important that we \nmaintain the critical momentum he has established.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, my good friend from South Carolina, \nthe ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, has been a tireless and influential advocate for \npassenger rail, and his leadership is unparalleled on this issue. \nAlthough my friend Senator Conrad, the ranking member on the Senate \nBudget Committee, has pointed out that this budget does not explicitly \nprovide for adequate funding for Amtrak, I am hopeful that Senator \nHollings' efforts will lead to a long-term funding source for the \nrailroad so that it may finally take advantage of efficient, multi-year \nplanning and realize additional efficiencies on its system. The attacks \non 9/11 taught us a valuable lesson concerning transportation options, \nand we need to heed that lesson so we do not find ourselves in a \nsituation again where options for travelers are severely limited and \nour economy suffers because of it.\n  Last year, the Congress appropriated $1.2 billion for Amtrak--the \nhighest amount ever. Also last year, Amtrak carried over 24 million \npassengers--their highest amount ever. I am quite certain this is no \ncoincidence. It is also no coincidence that this record was achieved \nduring the first full year under the leadership of Mr. Gunn. He is \ndoing a remarkable job of improving the reliability of the railroad, \nand his success is a success shared by our Nation as a whole.\n  In the meantime, given the funding levels we are finally providing to \nAmtrak, I am pleased that my colleagues are seeing that we can no \nlonger nickel-and-dime our national passenger railroad. I hope that we \ncan do the right thing to continue to ensure that\n\n[[Page S2685]]\n\nAmtrak is given the resources it needs to continue on its path to a \nstate-of-good-repair.\n\n\n                             yucca mountain\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue \nthat has come up during this year's budget debate regarding the nuclear \nwaste disposal fund and Yucca Mountain. I am glad to see that my \nfriends, Majority Leader Frist and Chairman Nickles, are on the floor \nto discuss this issue with me.\n  Let me start by explaining that the President requests $880 million \nthis year in his budget for the nuclear waste repository at Yucca \nMountain. Of that amount, $131 million is provided in discretionary \nappropriations under the proposed discretionary cap in the same manner \nas last year. However, $749 million of this amount is funded by a new \nproposal that will require a change in law. This change in law would \ntake receipts that now go to the nuclear waste disposal fund and use \nthem to pay for activities at Yucca Mountain. Let me be clear, that \nwithout this law change, the President's budget only provides $131 \nmillion for Yucca Mountain under the proposed discretionary cap.\n  Now let me turn to the Senate budget resolution. This year's \nresolution assumes discretionary appropriations of $577 million for \nYucca Mountain in 2005, which is same level that was enacted in 2004. \nIt should also be noted that the resolution does not assume the change \nin law with respect to the nuclear waste disposal fund receipts. I ask \nChairman, Nickles, I am wondering if the Senator could confirm that I \nam correct in my description of the budget resolution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes, Senator Domenici is correct in his statement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Chairman Nickles. I want to explain why there \nis a problem. It appears that in the budget resolution and probably \nthroughout the rest of the year, we will live within the President's \nproposed discretionary cap. But within the President's proposed cap \nlevel, only $131 million is assumed for Yucca Mountain if the law \nchange is not enacted. However, the administration and many in Congress \nstill expect that we will provide funding for Yucca Mountain above $131 \nmillion in the Energy and water development appropriations bill. Under \nthis scenario, the Energy and water bill finds itself in the hole by at \nleast $303 million, which is the difference between what is assumed in \nthe Senate budget resolution and what the President has requested for \nYucca Mountain, and by as much as $749 million if the allocation to my \nsubcommittee were only to include the President's requested amount of \n$131 million.\n  In order to support this budget resolution, I need to have confidence \nthat I will have the resources available to the Energy and water \nappropriations bill to provide funding for Yucca Mountain without \nhaving to take funds out of other programs in the Energy and water bill \nsuch as the Corps, DOE civilian science, and DOE labs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank Senate Domenici for his statement. This is a \ntough issue, and I want him to know that I understand the dilemma he is \nfacing. I appreciate his willingness to work with me on this, and I \ngive him my commitment to support a level of discretionary funding in \nthe budget resolution conference report and throughout the rest of the \nyear that will provide the resources necessary for his committee to \nfund Yucca Mountain without having to take resources from the other \nprograms in the Energy and water bill if the President's law change is \nnot enacted.\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank Senator Domenici and Senator Nickles for working \nso hard to resolve this issue. I understand the difficult position that \nSenator Domenici finds himself in this year with regard to Yucca \nMountain. I want him to know that he has my support in getting the \nnecessary resources for Yucca Mountain in the Energy and water \nappropriations bill without having to take funding from other programs \nin the bill if the President's proposed law change is not enacted.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join Mr. Bingaman in offering an \namendment to the fiscal year 2005 budget resolution that helps small \nbusinesses by restoring, and in some cases reasonably increasing above \nfiscal year 2004 appropriated levels, funding cuts proposed by \nPresident Bush for the Small Business Administration.\n  The President's budget requests 15 percent less in funding for the \nSBA than requested last year, while promising more assistance in \nlending and counseling. For example, the budget request claims to save \ntaxpayers $100 million by cutting all funding for the SBA's largest \nsmall business lending program, while at the same time claiming to \nincreasing access to loans by 30 percent. Sound familiar? It should. \nThe President proposed eliminating all funding for these small business \nloans his first year in office, that time shifting the more than $100 \nmillion in funding to borrowers and lenders by increasing fees, fees \nthat the General Accounting Office exposed as excessive for 8 years. \nThe administration wanted to overcharge them even more. We in Congress \nrejected it. This time the President has proposed paying for it through \naccounting and program gimmicks that are unworkable and the small \nbusiness community and small business lenders have rejected.\n  We are all in favor of more efficient and cost-effective government, \nbut the SBA's 7(a) loan program does not need fixing. It already is \nstructured to provide long-term loans to small business at a cost of \nabout 1 percent. That is one Federal dollar generating $99, an \nexcellent bang for the buck! This valuable resource just needs \nreasonable funding. The problems over the past four years have all been \ncreated by unreasonable budgets, propped up by funding schemes that \nnever materialize and create unnecessary instability in the delivery of \ncapital for small businesses.\n  Today we are trying to address the needs of small businesses next \nyear, fiscal year 2005, to prevent the same funding crises that we have \nexperienced in the SBA small business loans year after year. If the \nPresident's fiscal year 2005 Budget for the SBA is adopted, there will \nbe zero funding for the SBA's largest loan program, which provides \nabout 40 percent of all long-term capital to small businesses in this \ncountry; termination of all micro-entrepreneur loans and complementary \nbusiness training; termination of ten of 20 small business counseling \nand development programs, including assistance to Native Americans and \nWomen's Business Centers.\n  For the SBA's counseling and business development programs, this is \nthe most damaging budget the President has proposed in four years. Cuts \nto or inadequate funding of these programs are routinely attributed to \nvague and unfounded claims of duplication. Such claims mistake a common \nmission of training and counseling for duplication, ignoring the \nreality that small businesses vary greatly and have different needs. \nJust as it would be ineffective to have only one type of loan or \nventure capital financing structure for 23 million small businesses in \nthis country, it would be ineffective to water down specialized \nmanagement and training programs to impose counseling and training \nassistance, most are grant programs that have cost-sharing components \nwith state and local entities, such as matching grants, so they \nleverage more for the small businesses than the face value of the \nFederal grant.\n  Without funding, budget gimmicks will force borrowers to face higher \nfees or lack of access to affordable capital; high interest credit card \nloans; higher bankruptcies because they go into business with \ninordinately high debt or can't get counseling to survive the rough \ntimes. At worst, because the most damaging budget gimmick attacks the \nsmall businesses' source of more than 40 percent of long-term loans, it \nis very possible that, together with the overall cuts, the Agency would \nbe little more than an insurance agency for cookie-cutter loans made by \na handful of large banks in only a fraction of the states and areas now \nserved, or closing its doors within a couple of years.\n  This amendment also takes a step in the right direction for restoring \nfunding to the New Markets Venture Capital initiative that was \nrescinded in the fiscal year 2003 Omnibus Appropriations bill: $10.5 \nmillion for guaranteed debentures, and $13.75 million in grants for \nNMVC technical assistance. That\n\n[[Page S2686]]\n\nmoney was reserved for a second round of funding, and our Committee had \nan agreement with the SBA that it would offer that round in the fall of \n2002. However, as companies spent significant money and time to begin \npreparing proposals, SBA broke the agreement and did not issue a \nsolicitation for the second round of funding. Because the $24.25 \nmillion reserved for a second round of funding was not obligated, it \nwas available to be rescinded and it was rescinded as part of the \nfiscal year 2003 appropriations process. New markets venture capital is \nimportant for developing public-private partnerships to invest in areas \nwith high unemployment where the private sector rarely invests. This \namendment helps restore some of the critically needed New Markets \nVenture Capital funds.\n  The amendment I am offering with Mr. Bingaman takes a reasonable \napproach. In general, the $171 million paid for in this amendment \nrestores funding to programs that are critical to small business \ndevelopment and job creation in our towns and cities.\n  The $171 million results from:\n  Adding $101m to the 7(a) Loan Program (zero-funded).\n  Adding $3m to the Microloan Program (terminated).\n  Adding $25m to the Microloan Technical Assistance Program \n(terminated).\n  Adding $8m to the Program for Investment in Microentrepreneurs \n(PRIME) (terminated).\n  Adding $2m to Native American Outreach Program (terminated).\n  Adding $3.5m to Export Assistance Centers Program (terminated).\n  Adding $3m to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) FAST \nProgram (terminated).\n  Adding $1m to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Rural \nOutreach Program (terminated).\n  Adding $2m to the New Markets Venture Capital Program (zero-funded)\n  Adding $3m to the New Markets Technical Assistance Grants Program \n(zero-funded).\n  Adding $1.5m to the Women's Business Centers Program (increases \nfunding to $13.5m).\n  Adding $17m to the Small Business Development Centers (increases \nfunding to $105m).\n  Adding $500k to the 7(j)/8(a) Programs (increases funding to $2m).\n  Adding $250k to the Veterans' Outreach Program (increases funding to \n$1m).\n  Adding $250k to Small Disadvantaged Business Program (increases \nfunding to $1.75m)\n  Americans need jobs. And many who have them are scared of losing \nthem. Adequately funding public-private partnerships of the SBA is one \nof the fastest ways to fuel the economy, creating businesses, creating \njobs, and improving the innovation of this country. I ask my colleagues \nto vote for this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2759\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I speak on Senate amendment 2759, which \nSenator Kohl and I introduced to restore juvenile justice funding to \nthe Department of Justice. The proposed amendment would increase the \nadministration of justice function by $122 million and offset the \nallowances function of the budget.\n  The prevalence of justice crime continues to be among the greatest \ncriminal justice challenges faced by our nation, and a major concern to \nevery parent. In 2002, juveniles accounted for 16.5 percent of all \ncriminal arrests in the United States. Persons under 18 committed 10 \npercent of all murders, over 17 percent of all rapes, nearly 24 percent \nof all robberies, and 50 percent of all arsons. Additionally, in 2002, \n101 juveniles under 15 were arrested for murder. Juveniles under 15 \nwere responsible for six percent of all rapes, 11 percent of all \nburglaries, and one-third of all arsons. And, unbelievably, juveniles \nunder 15--who are not old enough to legally drive in any state--in 2002 \nwere responsible for 8 percent of all auto thefts.\n  To put this in some context, consider this: in 2002, youngsters age \n15 to 18, who are only seven percent of the population, committed 16.5 \npercent of all crimes. Even with recent modest reductions in the \njuvenile crime rate, I believe that there is strong potential for \nsignificant increases in juvenile crime above already too-high rates as \nthe children of the baby boom generation are coming into the prime age \nfor criminal activity.\n  The national juvenile crime problem required a change in the Federal \napproach, which the Congress addressed in the 107th Congress. As one of \nthe primary authors of the reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974 which passed last Congress, I \nfocused this act works on reducing juvenile delinquency while \nadequately addressing the needs of juvenile offenders. Moreover, those \nreforms made federal policy on juvenile crime consistent with the \nrealities of the problem.\n  As part of the reauthorization, we restructured juvenile justice \nassistance programs, including the Juvenile Accountability Incentive \nBlock Grant, JABG, Program. The reauthorization reformed the federal \nrole in the nation's juvenile justice system by providing relief from \nburdensome federal mandates and authorizing block grant assistance to \nstates and local governments, which includes accountability-based \njuvenile justice programs. These grants have been successful in \nreducing the recidivism rate of juveniles by up to 70%.\n  Another major component of juvenile assistance, delinquency \nprevention, was also strengthened in the reauthorization. Delinquency \nprevention funding supports valuable mentoring programs, after school \nprograms, therapy and other services for troubled children. These \nprograms offer education and community activities to deter children \nfrom drugs, gangs, and other opportunities to engage in criminal \nbehavior.\n  The authorization strengthened the act, and authorized it at $350 \nmillion each year.\n  Despite Congressional authorization, the President has requested \ndrastically reduced levels for juvenile justice for the past 3 years. \nOverall funding has been cut by almost two-thirds. According to the \nPresident's budget request for Fiscal Year 2005, juvenile justice \nprograms are to receive $150 million less than the congressionally-\nauthorized amount. The Kohl-Hatch amendment would restore juvenile \njustice funding to the same level it was in Fiscal Year 2004--$320 \nmillion which is still under the authorized amount.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this much needed amendment to the \nBudget Resolution. We must put stock in our children and help them stay \naway from a life of crime.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2771\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I discuss Senate Amendment 2771, an \namendment I propose to the budget resolution. This amendment seeks to \nrestore $600 million to the Department of Justice's Office of Justice \nPrograms for law enforcement assistance.\n  The Office of Justice Assistance provides grants to the states and \nlocalities to aid law enforcement officers in the fight against crime. \nIn addition to the COPS Office grants, the Office of Justice Programs \noffers states the Byrne Grant program and the Local Law Enforcement \nBlock Grant, LLEBG Program, both of which have dramatically increased \nthe capabilities and effectiveness of state and local law enforcement \nagencies.\n  Despite this tremendous help to our states, the President has not \nrequested any money specifically for the Byrne Grant program or the \nLocal Law Enforcement Block Grant, LLEBG program in the Fiscal Year \n2005 budget request. As he has done for the past 2 years, the President \nproposes, and the budget resolution recommends, to consolidate these \ngrant programs into one Justice Assistance Grant Program. However, in \nthe process of consolidation, the new proposal seeks to eliminate a \nnumber of components of these grant programs. In addition, the budget \nproposes to reduce funding for COPS, thus reducing overall law \nenforcement assistance funding by 63 percent, or just over $1.035 \nbillion.\n  The Byrne Grant program funds a number of successful crime reduction \nprograms and is the Department of Justice's most flexible assistance \naccount. Without these funds, many states would not be able to focus \ntheir resources at or operate specific programs. For example, in my own \nstate of Utah, Byrne Grants provide the majority of funding for \nmultijurisdictional drug task forces and DARE training. I am concerned \nthat without these task forces, Utah's ability to wage the war against \ndrugs would be seriously diminished.\n\n[[Page S2687]]\n\n  Byrne Grants assist many states in controlling and preventing drug \nabuse, crime, and violence, and in improving the functioning of the \ncriminal justice system. Currently, Byrne Grants have 29 specific \npurpose areas to combat drugs, gangs, financial and white collar \ncrimes, and to improve the court system, the correctional facilities, \nand forensic capabilities. The proposed Justice Assistance Grant would \nonly have six purpose areas. Many functions covered under the Byrne \ngrants would no longer be eligible for much needed funds.\n  The Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program has also been \nsuccessful by offering state and local law enforcement agencies the \nability to hire officers and purchase needed equipment. These programs \nhave made it possible for local police and sheriffs departments to \nacquire efficiency-enhancing technology and equipment. Without these \nfunds, our law enforcement offices would loose valuable equipment which \nhas been able to enhance their crime fighting objectives.\n  My amendment seeks to restore local law enforcement assistance back \nto the Fiscal Year 2004 level. In order to do this, I am requesting \nthat the offset come from function 800 in the budget resolution, \ngeneral Government.\n  As many of you know, the Department of Treasury is funded under this \nfunction. The Department of Treasury has $11.658 billion in \ndiscretionary budget authority for Fiscal Year 2005. In Fiscal Year \n2001, the Department of Treasury had $10.332 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority.\n  I recognize the needs of the Internal Revenue Service to modernize \nits systems, to fight abusive tax shelters, to reduce the tax gap, and \nto provide service to taxpayers. However, despite the increased needs \nof the IRS, because of the reorganization the Department of Treasury \nhas lost two major components since 2001--the United States Secret \nService and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. These two \nagencies had a combined budget of $1.584 billion in Fiscal Year 2001.\n  With a significant reduction in resources, one would imagine that the \nDepartment of Treasury's budget would have significantly decreased as \nwell. However, instead of seeing a decrease in budget authority, of at \nleast $1.584 billion, the Department of Treasury's budget has continued \nto increase since Fiscal Year 2001.\n  In light of this, my amendment proposes to offset funds for the \nOffice of Justice Programs with funds from Treasury that previously \nwent towards major law enforcement agencies.\n  I hope that the appropriators will continue to fund the Byrne Grants \nand the Local Law Enforcement Block Grants at the same level they have \nin the past. However, there will not be room in the budget for them to \ndo so unless my amendment passes.\n  These highly successful and popular programs provide needed \nassistance to state and local law enforcement for a wide variety of \nprograms and services. Eliminating these programs represents a severe \nblow to federal efforts to assist our communities in the war against \ncrime.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2793\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to discuss Senator Dorgan's \namendment to S. Con. Res. 95, the budget resolution. Although I am \nhighly supportive of increased funding for law enforcement assistance, \nI cannot support this amendment. This amendment proposes to reduce \nunnecessarily the tax cut in order to achieve the important goal of \nenhancing law enforcement efforts.\n  As I have stated before, I am supportive of existing Federal \nassistance to law enforcement officers, such as the Byrne grants, the \nLocal Law Enforcement Block grants, and the COPS grants. These highly \nsuccessful, effective and popular programs provide needed assistance to \nstate and local law enforcement for a wide variety of programs and \nservices.\n  Eliminating funding for these programs represents a severe blow to \ncommunities and neighborhoods across the country desperately in need of \nFederal resources to win the war against crime. In fact, I have filed \nmy own amendment--with Senator Biden's support--to restore the Office \nof Justice Programs' law enforcement assistance to the same level as \nthat in Fiscal Year 2004. However, my amendment does not reduce the tax \ncut. It simply allocates funds from other areas of the budget.\n  That being said, I cannot vote for a reduction in the tax cut. A $2.2 \nbillion reduction in the tax cut affecting the top 1 percent of \ntaxpayers may seem like a good idea to some. However, as many Senators \non my side of the aisle have pointed out, a high percentage of small \nbusinesses pay taxes at the individual level, not as corporations. \nThese include sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, and \nlimited liability companies. Smaller businesses are the engine of job \ncreation in this country. Why in the world, during this time when jobs \nare very much needed, would we want to harm the potential for some of \nthese businesses to expand and create more jobs?\n  Under today's law, the top individual tax rate is 35 percent, the \nsame tax rate that corporations pay. Because so many privately-held \nbusinesses do pay tax at the individual and not the corporate rate, it \nis important that we keep this parity in the tax law. This amendment \nwould raise the individual rate above the corporate rate and once again \nintroduce a disparity in the tax rates on businesses in this country. \nThis would be poor public policy so I must oppose it.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment which \ndoes not affect the tax cut, and not to support Senator Dorgan's \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2783\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Boxer amendment purports to deal \nwith the loss of manufacturing jobs and the outsourcing problem. If \nsome on the other side want to do something about manufacturing jobs, \nthey should stop obstructing the FSC/ETI bill with poison pill \npolitical amendments. When we come back after next week, I'd ask those \non the other side to put results ahead of politics and let us finish \nthe bipartisan JOBS bill.\n  This amendment, on the other hand, just suggests that the Finance \nCommittee repeal the tax policy of deferral and raise taxes on small \nmanufacturers. The tax policy of deferral insures that American \ncompanies like Intel and Hewlett-Packard, compete on a level playing \nfield with foreign companies. Eliminating deferral means U.S. companies \nwill face a tax burden that is not shared by Japanese, German, British \nor other competing companies.\n  The Boxer amendment, though styled as a tax increase on the wealthy, \ncontains a tax increase on our small business manufacturers. It would \nreverse the bipartisan Finance Committee bill's lower rate for \nmanufacturers. Instead of 32 percent, small business manufacturers tax \nrates would be raised to a level higher than what the Fortune 500 pay.\n  If you care about manufacturing jobs, why would you punish our \nmanufacturers by raising their marginal tax rates? If you care about \nmanufacturing jobs, help us get the FSC/ETI bill passed and don't raise \ntaxes on manufacturers.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, like a lot of my colleagues this week, I \nhave been visited here in Washington by a number of my constituents.\n  We get to hear, first hand, about the lives of the people we \nrepresent, about how we can help them or hurt them.\n  As we debated the budget this week, a couple of those meetings really \nstood out in my mind. When I met with Delaware's League of Local \nGovernments, their top priority was increased funding for public safety \nand homeland security. These are the mayors and county executives from \nmy State, the public officials closest to the needs of our communities.\n  They came to tell us that they need more cops on the beat, they need \nmore resources and more attention from us here in Washington to deal \nwith the security of the chemical plants in their towns, to name just \none important example.\n  As they brought this message to us here in Washington, not just to me \nbut to all of us in the Congress, we were presented with this budget \nresolution, that cuts 30 percent from the support for first responders, \nthe very fire fighters and police officers that we so often pay lip \nservice to. Lip service is all they get from this budget.\n  I joined with my colleagues in offering an amendment to restore and \nincrease funding for homeland security,\n\n[[Page S2688]]\n\nin keeping with the message we heard this week from our State and local \nofficials. But that amendment was rejected, because it would have taken \na small amount from the tax cuts--just a small amount--from the tax \ncuts going to those with the top 1 percent of incomes in this country.\n  I offered an amendment during the budget debate to restore funds cut \nfrom the COPS Program, that has put more policemen and women on the \nstreets of towns and cities in Delaware and across the country. This \nbudget, in a false economy, had reduced funding for law enforcement \ngrants by over 60 percent.\n  My amendment would have restored a billion dollars to the COPS \nprogram, the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant, and the Byrne program. \nAnd it would have taken an additional 1 billion dollars off of the \ndeficit.\n  Those amendments were rejected to protect the tax cuts that go to the \ntop 1 percent of income earners in this country. Those are not the \npriorities of the local government officials who came here this week \nlooking for help to strengthen public safety in their communities.\n  But that is the top priority of this budget resolution: sacrificing \nevery other priority to avoid shaving barely 1 percent off of a tax cut \nthat will total $690 billion dollars for people in the top 1 percent \nincome level in this country over the next 10 years.\n  I also had the pleasure of meeting with the American Legion of \nDelaware this week. It is always moving, and a little humbling, to meet \nwith the men and women who have given so much to this country. But \nthese days, with so many of our troops still in the field, these \nmeetings have even more meaning.\n  I know that a lot of my colleagues met with their veterans this week, \ntoo, and that they heard the same thing I did: health care is their top \npriority. This budget makes it harder for veterans to get health care, \nand makes it more expensive.\n  We offered amendments this week to add $2.7 billion to this budget \nfor veterans' health care, and to pay for it by shaving less than 1 \nhalf of 1 percent off of the tax cuts for those in the top 1 percent of \nincome earners in this country. That amendment was rejected, too.\n  To prevent a tiny reduction in the tax breaks for those who have the \nmost we refused to add funds for veterans' health care.\n  In the debate this week on the budget resolution we made fundamental \nchoices, and those choices revealed the principles, the values, that \nwill guide us for the rest of this legislative session, and for years \nto come.\n  The values in this budget are not those of the local officials who \ncame to see me this week. They are not the values of the veterans who \ncame to town, either. And they are not my values.\n  When you write a budget, you have to put your money where your mouth \nis. At the end of the day, you have to be willing to make the choices--\nyou have to set the priorities. And at the end of the day, those \npriorities, those values, will be written in black and white--and in \nthe gallons of red ink in this budget resolution.\n  The statement made by this budget is one that I categorically reject, \nand that I urge my colleagues to reject.\n  I have to say that the budget resolution that is before us this week \nis perhaps the most irresponsible, disingenuous, and I have to add, the \nmost callous that I have seen in my time here in the Senate.\n  This budget resolution, puts us on a track toward historical levels \nof debt, to be left to our children and grandchildren. This budget \nresolution slights the most basic responsibilities of our Government, \nwith cuts in homeland security, in education, health care, \ntransportation, clean water, and scientific research, despite growing \nneeds in all of those areas.\n  This budget resolution will cripple our ability to meet the looming \ncrisis in the Social Security System because it borrows virtually all \nof the reserves that Social Security is now building up in anticipation \nof the retirement in just over 10 years of the baby boom generation.\n  Even borrowing all of those Social Security reserves does not balance \nthis budget. Even cutbacks in heath care, in medical research, in law \nenforcement, in education won't bring this budget back into balance. \nThese false economies that will cost us more in the future will not \nbring the budget into balance.\n  In fact, under this budget, deficits continue to grow and grow, into \nthe future. On paper, this budget claims to reduce the deficit over the \nnext 5 years. There are 2 problems with that claim.\n  First, the claim that this resolution will reduce the deficit ignores \nthe cost of the continuing war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, and the \ncontinuing war on terrorism. Whatever those costs may be, there is one \nnumber that we know for a fact is false, is dead wrong, and that number \nis zero.\n  By the estimate of the Congressional Budget Office, those costs could \nrun to $280 billion over the next 10 years.\n  There is supposedly an allowance in this budget for $30 billion, but \nthat is only a small fraction of what we can expect, and it is not even \ncounted as part of the deficit. If we spend it, it will add to the \ndeficit, but in this resolution, it is not counted, nor is the $250 \nbillion more the CBO expects us to spend.\n  Millions of Americans are finding out now, and tens of millions will \nsoon find out, that the Alternative Minimum Tax, designed to make sure \nmillionaires did not manage to escape paying tax altogether, is set to \nfall on middle-class families. It will cost tens of billions of dollars \nto prevent that from happening. The administration agrees that it needs \nfixing, too. But this resolution assumes only 1 year of AMT relief, \nleaving out of the deficit count tens of billions in certain costs over \nthe coming years.\n  The claim that this resolution reduces the deficit over the next 5 \nyears is based on taking all of the reserves of the Social Security \nsystem, reserves that will be needed in the next decade for the largest \nwave of retirements in our country's history. If you leave that out, \nthe deficit 5 years out will be closer to $550 billion, not the $237 \nbillion they claim.\n  The other problem with the claim that this resolution will reduce the \ndeficit in the next 5 years, is that the next 5 years, as bad as they \nare, are not real problem. The real problem our Nation will face lies \nin the years after that, when the deficits explode, on a collision \ncourse with the coming crisis in the Social Security system. It matters \nlittle what happens in the next 5 years if we careen into budget \ncollapse in the years that follow.\n  That is just what this resolution would do. It leaves us on a path to \nadd more than $2 trillion to our debt over the next 10 years.\n  It demands sacrifice from the middle class, who face rising health \ncare costs and high college tuition payments at a time when job \nsecurity is shaky, when the search for a new job takes longer and \nlonger, and when we are losing the bedrock manufacturing jobs that have \nbeen the foundation of our middle class.\n  This budget demands sacrifice from everyone, except those Americans \nwho have already been most blessed by the opportunities and advantages \noffered by this great country. For those Americans, who have received \nand will receive the lion's share of the recent tax cuts, not a dime of \nsacrifice will be asked.\n  Out of a total, 10-year tax cut of over $1.8 trillion, the top one \npercent will get $690 billion. The average taxpayer in the top 1 \npercent will get a 10-year tax cut of over half a million dollars. That \nis what this budget resolution, and the votes we have taken here on the \nSenate floor, will go to any length to protect. The reason that the \nrest of us must sacrifice, we are told, is that we face massive \ndeficits. We just don't have enough money.\n  Like the child who killed his parents, and then begged for mercy \nbecause he was an orphan, the majority, who has insisted in the face of \nexploding deficits on tax cut after tax cut after tax cut, now claims \nwe do not have the money to fund the most basic promises to American \ncitizens.\n  To make up for those deficits, to pay for those tax cuts, this budget \ngoes after those who are least able to help themselves. Unfortunately, \ntheir sacrifices will be in vain because this budget will still leave \nus with a massive burden of increasing debt. But this budget does not \nask for a dime of sacrifice from those who have enjoyed the greatest \neconomic success in this country, and who--on top of their growing\n\n[[Page S2689]]\n\nwealth and incomes--have been the major beneficiaries of the recent \nrounds of tax cuts.\n  Over and over in this debate we have debated amendments to restore \ncuts in public safety and homeland security, in veterans' health care, \nin education funding--to keep the many promises to Americans that we \nhave made. To support those priorities that help average Americans, \nthose amendments called for small reductions in the tax cuts going to \nthe top 1 percent of Americans.\n  We are not talking about cancelling tax cuts for average Americans. \nAnd we are not talking about cancelling tax cuts for the wealthiest \namong us. We are just talking about reducing the already huge tax cuts \nthat they are going to receive.\n  If this budget resolution is adopted, we will break promises to \ngovernors, mayors, school boards, teachers, parents, and children. The \nNo Child Left Behind program will be funded at a level $8.6 billion \nbelow what we promised when that law was passed.\n  If this resolution is adopted, we will leave veterans' health care \n$2.7 billion below what it is needed to keep our commitment to those \nwho have already given so much--who continue to give so much--to our \ncountry.\n  If this resolution is adopted, we will shortchange the working poor \nin this country who are doing just what we hoped they would do when we \nreformed welfare. But the earned income tax credit, that President \nReagan himself called the best anti-poverty program we have, will be \ncut by $3 billion. That program will be cut by $3 billion, because this \nSenate refused to take a tiny nick out of the tax cuts going to those \nwith an average income of a million dollars a year. This Senate would \nrather take $3 billion from the working poor than take a tiny fraction \nfrom the those who already have so much.\n  The list goes on. It includes Senator Lieberman's amendment, to \nprovide an additional $7 billion for homeland security. These funds \nwould have helped to secure our ports and our borders and our \ntransportation system, guard against bioterror, and support first \nresponders.\n  That amendment, that would take a little more than 1 percent of the \ntotal tax cut going to the wealthiest 1 percent--leaving them with more \nthan nine-tenths of their tax cut, more than $680 billion--that \namendment was rejected.\n  This budget resolution has one principle and one principle only: \nprotect those tax cuts at any cost, including trillions of dollars in \nadditional deficits and debt.\n  We know what those cuts will cost us in the future, and how much \nsacrifice they demand from those who can least afford it, but what have \nthey done for us so far?\n  I ask my colleagues to remember the first time that President Bush \ncalled for tax cuts. That was back in the last presidential campaign, \nwhen the economy was booming and the budget was in surplus. He promised \nus that we could afford huge tax cuts, that were designed to shrink \nfederal revenues, and to prevent the build-up of budget surpluses. Hard \nis as it to recall, the threat he was most concerned with was that we \nwould balance the budget and then keep on building up surpluses.\n  Then, as the economy slowed down, he claimed that those same tax cuts \nwould stimulate growth--the tax cuts he designed in the midst of the \nstrongest economic boom our country had ever seen.\n  When those tax cuts failed to stimulate growth, and as deficits began \nto expand, virtually wiping out the $5.6 trillion ten-year surplus \nprojected when he came into office, we were told that we needed even \nmore tax cuts. Not only have the deficits continued to grow, but those \ndeficits and the tax cuts that brought them on have done nothing to \ncreate jobs.\n  You have to go all the way back to the Hoover administration to find \na record of job losses to rival this one. We have come out of \nrecession, and have restored a respectable level of economic growth, \nand the stock market has come back to around the levels it reached in \n1998. We are 37 months past the last peak in the business cycle, and on \nthose measures things are looking up.\n  But this recovery is unique in our history. When it comes to jobs--\nthe one real measure of economic health--we are, compared to our \nexperience, 5.4 million jobs behind where we should be. While we have \nlost 2.4 million jobs over this period, we have also failed to produce \nnew jobs at normal rates.\n  As the population grows, that means that more and more people are out \nof work, more than just the 2.4 million who had a job when this \nadministration came into office, and who don't have one now.\n  In addition, there are millions who should be in the labor force, who \nhave either dropped out and stopped looking, or never entered the labor \nforce--over two and a half million. So while the unemployment rate is \nofficially 5.6 percent, counting those who have despaired of finding \nwork in this economy the rate is actually 7.4 percent.\n  The reason so many are discouraged from looking for work is clear--\nthe duration of unemployment is the longest in 20 years. The number of \npeople who have exhausted their long-term unemployment benefits is \ngrowing. Despite repeated efforts, this Congress has refused to extend \nlong-term unemployment benefits.\n  Last month, no new private sector jobs were created. None. The small \namount of hiring that happened was done by governments, not by the \nprivate sector, the only engine for real, sustained economic growth.\n  We have enacted tax cuts that will cost us $2.3 trillion dollars, \ncounting the extra interest needed because all of that money is \nborrowed. We have turned balanced budgets, and historically high \nsurpluses, into historically high deficits.\n  We are still 2.4 million jobs in the hole, by official numbers and \nmillions more jobs short of where we should be this far into an \neconomic recovery.\n  This resolution shrugs off these sorry facts. It does nothing to \nchange course in the face of these failures. As a matter of fact, this \nbudget resolution will result in higher deficits than no change in \ncurrent policy. No budget resolution at all would be better than the \none before us today. I will vote against it and hope my colleagues will \njoin me.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I support the budget resolution, S. Con. \nRes. 95. Let me begin by commending Chairman Nickles for his \noutstanding leadership as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. He \nhas fairly and respectfully brought both sides of the aisle to the \ntable on an issue that is inherently partisan. He has done so in a \nmanner that encouraged cooperation, if not agreement. Last week, we \ncompleted a difficult markup in less than 2 days. We could not have \ndone so without the leadership of both the chairman and the ranking \nmember and the hard work of all of the Republican and Democrat members \non the Budget Committee.\n  After more than 20 years on the Senate Budget Committee, this will be \nChairman Nickles' last floor debate on the Congressional Budget \nResolution. We will miss him as both our chairman and as one of the \nSenate's most responsible and trusted protectors of the taxpayer \ndollar. Chairman Nickles has built a reputation for being fiscally \nconservative not by saying he's a fiscal conservative, but by actually \nbeing one. I applaud him and his dedication to fair budgeting and wish \nhim the best of luck in his future endeavors.\n  I would also like to thank the ranking member for the technical \nknowledge he brings to the table during these debates. Last week, he \nexplained very succinctly how the budget caps and assumptions work. I \nwas pleased to hear my friend from North Dakota talk about the \nimportance of the caps versus the assumptions. Both the Republicans and \nDemocrats have stacks and stacks of assumptions that identify our \nfunding priorities, but these assumptions don't set in stone the \nspecific levels of funding. They just help us set targets. Sometimes \nthose targets are higher, sometimes those targets are more to the left \nor more to the right, but they never shift downward partly because we \npass dozens of amendments every year that wrongly focus on the \nindividual programs, not the overall limits.\n  Despite attempts by my colleagues to turn this into a debate on \nappropriations, I'd like to remind everybody that we are not taking \nshots at the targets yet. The appropriators are the first ones who \nactually get to do that. Today, we're talking about the targets\n\n[[Page S2690]]\n\nset by the President and the committee-reported budget resolution. Like \nlast year, when the President released his budget in February, I read \nthe entire thing. I read the summaries and studied the tables and \nanalyzed the assumptions; and, I truly believe the President laid the \nfoundation for a good budget. Some people disagree with the underlying \nassumptions of the President's proposal and the budget plan that it was \nbuilt upon and some want to turn it upside down. But, these arguments \nare more political than substantial, and they hinder our progress \ntoward appropriations.\n  I believe the Budget committee rightly built upon the strong \nfoundation laid by the President with respect to the Committee-reported \nresolution. We reported a resolution that will cut the deficit in half \nin three years and allow America to continue down the road to economic \nrecovery. Yet, we did not have much luck passing this resolution in the \ncommittee in a bipartisan fashion. The vote was 12 in favor and 10 \nopposed.\n  Why the split? Because we, as Republicans, voted to hold the line on \nspending and live up to our promise to provide tax relief for all \nAmericans. In contrast, we had more than 30 amendments from our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who wanted to increase \nspending and raise taxes to pay for it. Again, these amendments were \nmore political than substantial, and they delayed our progress \ntremendously. The proponents of these amendments were trying to tell \nthe Finance Committee how and when to raise taxes, but they cannot do \nthat. Raising taxes is firmly under the jurisdiction of the Finance \nCommittee, and they certainly do not need to take our advice on the \nsubject.\n  In most cases, these proposed amendments would have increased \ndiscretionary spending and increased the deficit. During a time when \ndeficit spending is higher in nominal terms than ever before, wouldn't \nit make more sense to decrease spending rather than increase it? We \nhave a huge deficit and yet we still cannot control the spending of our \ncolleagues. The debate on the floor this week is turning out to be \nsimilar.\n  Throughout the week, too many amendments have been introduced that \nwould certainly have increased the size of the Federal government and \nblown the Federal deficit out of the water. Many of these amendments \nhave also proposed to simply shift funds from one program to another \nbased on budget ``assumptions.'' Let me again remind my colleagues that \nthe budget resolution does not set spending levels for individual \nprograms. Unfortunately, I don't think this message is getting through \nto some people. As such, I have no doubt that many more amendments like \nthose we've seen so far will be offered before the final vote.\n  For example, an amendment that proposes to increase funding under \nfunction 450 for Firefighter Assistance Grants by eliminating tax \nrelief for working Americans does not guarantee that funding will \nactually find its way into those grant accounts. That decision will be \nmade by the appropriators and the Senate during the debate on \nappropriations. That means much of the rhetoric we've heard throughout \nthe debate is political, not practical. Right now, we can only decide \nthe amount of money, not where it will end up.\n  We are not making the decisions this week as to which individual \nprograms will be funded. We are setting the spending limits for our \nAppropriations Committees. We are setting the limits that will hold our \ncolleagues in check when it comes to spending. The whole process \nreminds me of the cartoon that shows two bears in the woods--one has a \ntarget on his chest and the friend is saying ``rotten birthmark.'' \nThankfully, we are not shooting at the bear today. The Appropriations \nCommittee will do the shooting.\n\n  Some of that shooting will be monitored down the road. My friend and \ncolleague from Pennsylvania established a spend-o-meter last year that \nshows exactly how much our colleagues across the aisle want to increase \nspending on appropriations bills and under authorizing legislation. \nMost recently, the spend-o-meter proved useful during debate on the \nomnibus bill when the other side of the aisle proposed amendments that \nwould have increased spending from $341 billion to almost half a \ntrillion dollars in less than 24 hours. My friend and colleague has \nbeen using the spend-o-meter to keep track of how the proposed \namendments on the budget resolution would impact the deficit, and let \nme tell you, the results are just as troubling. According to the charts \npresented by the Senator from North Dakota, he adds $5 billion and $6 \nbillion and only gets $1 billion more spent. When I add $6 and $5 \nbillion, I get $11 billion in budget requests.\n  If we were talking about a business, and we were the owners, we would \nbe looking for areas of waste and unnecessary costs so we could trim \ncosts and reinvest the money. The President did suggest the same kind \nof cuts based on GPRA in over 60 programs, resulting in $4.9 billion of \nsavings. Not much you say? Show me your cuts. The economy grew while we \nconstrained spending. We balanced it by growth of the economy, not by \ncutting a dime.\n  Constraining spending and shifting the targets we've been talking \nabout can happen at the same time. Although few in number, some of the \namendments offered today, including one I intend to offer, would \nactually shift the targets to a better position that will help us grow \nthe economy. But, I think it's safe to say that most of the amendments \noffered by the other side will be outrageous attempts to raise taxes \nunder the guise of increasing appropriations for very popular programs. \nAgain, let's be clear that we will not be passing an appropriations \nbill today.\n  We will continue working on the budget resolution, which I believe \nsets forth a good budget. This year we had to make tough choices about \nour priorities. This budget reflects those priorities. Of the 3.3 \npercent increase in discretionary funding, 92 percent of it goes to the \nsoldiers and citizens protecting our men and women overseas and at \nhome. This budget gives our men and women serving in the Armed Forces \nand our diplomatic corps the tools they need to fight for democracy and \nwin the war on terror.\n  This budget, however, isn't just about defense and homeland security. \nThis budget is also about creating a better and brighter future for our \nkids. The committee-reported resolution supports the President's \nefforts to provide more funding for education than ever before in the \nhistory of the United States.\n  We have heard many arguments and we will continue to hear many \narguments today and throughout the week, claiming that this budget \nresolution is an attempt to sell our education system short. That is \nsimply not true. Under this budget, we assume that the Appropriations \nCommittee will invest billions more in Title I grants under the No \nChild Left Behind Act, in Part B grants for individuals with \ndisabilities, and Pell grants to students who want to take their \neducation one step further.\n  Writing this budget resolution was not an easy process. It is never \neasy to cut or freeze spending. But we had to make tough choices this \nyear. We had to freeze spending in most categories and limit percentage \ngrowth in all others. We had to clamp down on the tax relief we could \nprovide to working Americans. We had to set spending caps at a \nresponsible level that would allow our Appropriations Committees to \npass 13 appropriations bills. To the credit of the Budget Committee, we \nmade these tough choices. We produced a resolution that will allow \nCongress and America to move forward without overstepping the authority \nof the Budget Committee. We do not make the decisions on where to spend \nthe money, just on how much is spent, although many amendments would \ngive you the opposite impression.\n  I said this during the committee markup and I'll say it again today--\nthis budget is about moving forward. We've faced some tough times in \nrecent years. The huge spike in spending during the last year of the \nClinton administration set the stage for troubled times in 2001. With \nthe technology bust of the late 1990s and the year 2000, many of our \nhealthiest industries were struck down to the point of barely \nbreathing. But, that was just the beginning.\n  The terrorist attacks of 2001 and the international war against \nterror have forced us to address the decisions by previous \nadministrations to gradually weaken our Armed Forces. Now, we are \npaying the price. We are playing a\n\n[[Page S2691]]\n\ncatch-up game--a catch-up game that costs billions, not millions, of \ndollars.\n  That's why we need to pass a budget this week that will rein in \nspending while allowing our defense sector and our economy as a whole \nto continue to recover. The budget resolution before us today makes \nsome general, but critical assumptions. One of the most important \nassumptions focuses on preventing attempts by our colleagues to raise \ntaxes on our working families.\n  The committee-reported resolution proposes to extend the personal tax \nrelief currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2004. Contrary to \nthe statements made by my colleagues, this tax relief helps middle- and \nlower-income taxpayers. The $1,000-per-child tax credit, the 10 percent \nincome tax bracket expansion, and the marriage penalty relief are three \nof the most important tax provisions passed in decades. These \nprovisions put more money back into the hands of our neighbors, \nfamilies and friends.\n  This week, we have an opportunity to pass a budget that plans for the \nfuture, while taking care of our present-day needs. This budget aims to \ncut the budget deficit in half in just a few short years. I believe we \ncan do it.\n  The tax relief put in place last year has already resulted in growth \nin almost every sector of our economy. Our gross domestic product \nincreased by more than 4 percent last quarter and robust spending on \ntechnology, infrastructure and equipment points to strong continued \ngrowth through the next year. This growth will lead to more companies \npaying into the Federal pot and more money flowing from the private \nsector to the public sector and back again.\n  That is what this debate should be about--passing a budget that will \nhelp, not hurt, America's recovering business sector and job markets. \nWe have heard the scare tactics on Social Security and unemployment and \noutsourcing, but what we haven't heard a lot about is how to help \naddress the problems. This debate should focus on progress, not \npolitics. I have been working with my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle on an amendment that would propose a step in the right direction. \nMy amendment would add $250 million to the Nation's job training \nprograms.\n  For generations, the skills and ingenuity of the American workforce \nhave fueled the greatest economy in the world. Today, America faces an \nemerging challenge that threatens the prosperity of generations to \ncome. Our challenge is to equip our workforce with the skills needed \nfor jobs in the new, global economy. Our prosperity rests with our \nability to create and fill the high-skilled jobs that the 21st century \neconomy demands.\n  We have talked about the loss of American jobs because of increasing \nglobalization. We have talked about the loss of American jobs because \nof increasing productivity. I am here to talk about how we can keep \nhigh-paying jobs in America's factories, in America's businesses, and \non America's shores. As we consider job creation in this country, we \nmust address the growing skills gap that threatens our ability to \ncompete--and succeed--in a more complex, knowledge-based economy.\n  As the country continues its economic recovery, people are asking: \n``where are the jobs?'' It may surprise you to learn that many high-\nskilled jobs in this country remain unfilled because employers can't \nfind qualified workers. According to a 2003 survey conducted by the \nCenter for Workforce Preparation, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, half of the employers reported difficulty in finding \nqualified workers. The problem is greatest for small employers. Nearly \n60 percent of employers with 11 to 50 workers report having a hard time \nfinding qualified workers. Small employers--our greatest source of \neconomic growth--can't create jobs if they don't have the skilled \nworkers to fill the jobs.\n  The gap between the demand for high-skilled workers and the supply \nwill only widen in the future. Looking ahead 2 years, only 30 percent \nof the employers surveyed believe that the skills of their workforce \nwill keep pace with demand. According to the 2003 study by the Center \nfor Workforce Preparation, the manufacturing industry--which has faced \nsome of the most severe job loss--faces the greatest skills gap. \nManufacturers predict that by 2005 only 21 percent of their workforce \nwill have the necessary skills. Almost 80 percent of American workers \nwon't be qualified for American manufacturing jobs.\n  Without any action, technology and other advances will outpace the \nability of American workers and business to update skills needed to \ncompete in the new economy. But there is good news. There is action we \ncan take to retrain workers to fill the jobs needed in this country, \nnow and in the future. First, we can increase budgetary resources for \njob training programs under the Workforce Investment Act. Second, and \nmore importantly, we can make sure the Nation's job training system \ncreated under the Workforce Investment Act effectively prepares our \nworkforce for good jobs that the evolving economy demands. This \namendment will do the first. To do the second, my Colleagues must agree \nto send legislation reauthorizing and improving the Workforce \nInvestment Act into Conference.\n  I am offering this amendment to increase job-training budget \nauthority because I agree with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \nthat: ``what will ultimately determine the standard of living of this \ncountry is the skill of the people.'' Job training under the Workforce \nInvestment Act will help our workers get back to work or find better \njobs. It will improve the lives of our workers and help them achieve \nthe American Dream for themselves and their families.\n  This investment in our Nation's job training and employment system is \nan important investment in our future. Like any investment of the \ntaxpayers' money, the investment in Federal job training programs must \nbe fiscally responsible and generate results. While I support an \nincrease in resources for job training, it cannot come at the expense \nof fiscal discipline. Therefore, my amendment is offset fully from \naccount 920. My amendment will increase resources for Fiscal Year 2005 \nin the job training function. It will responsibly shift the target in \nthis area. Beyond that, we must improve the workforce development \nsystem to better meet the needs of American workers and businesses \nbefore investing additional resources.\n  We cannot meet the challenges of the 21st century economy by simply \nthrowing more money into the existing workforce development system. We \nhave to improve the Workforce Investment Act to better prepare American \nworkers for the good jobs of today and tomorrow. Again, there is good \nnews. We have a bill that does this. It is a bipartisan bill that \npassed out of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee \nunanimously. We passed it on the Floor unanimously last November. \nThat's as bipartisan as you can possibly get.\n  Where is the bill now? Here is the bad news. We can't appoint a \nconference committee, which is the committee made up of Republicans and \nDemocrats who would meet with the House to work out differences between \nwhat they passed and what we passed. The Workforce Investment Act can \nhelp more than 900,000 dislocated workers a year find the well-paying \njobs in this country that are available. That is 900,000 opportunities \nthat can help fill the skills gap and make American workers and \nbusinesses more competitive. I have heard a lot of talk about losing \nAmerican jobs. If we really want to take care of jobs in this country \nand make sure jobs stay in this country, we would appoint a conference \ncommittee for the Workforce Investment Act bill and enact this vital \nlegislation.\n  Last week, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a \nhearing that addressed the skills of the American workforce. Dr. Diana \nOblinger, executive director of Higher Education for Microsoft--an \nAmerican company that symbolizes innovation and growth--presented some \nof the best testimony I have ever heard. She said that being able to \n``outthink the rest of the world'' may be the most important \ncompetitive advantage. In this knowledge-based, global economy, I agree \nwith Dr. Oblinger that the brainpower of our workforce is our greatest \nresource.\n  This amendment recognizes that the first priority for workers who \nhave lost their job is finding a new job. But this\n\n[[Page S2692]]\n\namendment is only a band-aid. It will not fix the Nation's job training \nprograms. If we are going to continue to ``outthink the rest of the \nworld'', we must improve the job-skills and training of our greatest \nresource now and into the future.\n  With that, I believe this budget is a fiscally responsible measure \nand I urge my colleagues to work together to pass both my amendment and \nthe resolution by the end of the week. Once again, I thank Chairman \nNickles, Ranking Member Conrad, and all of the committee members for \ntheir work so far and hope we can move to final adoption of the \nCongressional Budget Resolution before the April 15 deadline.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance \nof accurate data to the debate over the budget resolution, particularly \nas it relates to the distribution of the tax burden. Over the past \nseveral days, a number of my colleagues have made claims that the tax \nrelief we have enacted over the past three years only benefits the \nwealthiest of Americans.\n  In this debate, as well as all tax policy debates, it is important to \nuse accurate data, and to debate the issues in an intellectually honest \nmanner.\n  One of the key questions in any tax relief package is fairness. In \nevaluating fairness, we frequently look at whether a proposal retains \nor improves the progressivity of our tax system. Critics of tax relief \ncontinue to attempt to use distribution tables to show that tax relief \nproposals disproportionately benefit upper income taxpayers.\n  The tax relief that has been enacted to date, in the 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief packages, is promoting investment incentives so that \ncompanies will purchase additional capital and labor.\n  Criticizing these plans for benefiting wealthy taxpayers assumes that \nthe rich stay rich and the poor stay poor.\n  Recent studies, including one produced by the National Center for \nPolicy Analysis, indicate that this is untrue. The May 2003 study \nmeasures income mobility by breaking same age workers into five income \nlevels and by monitoring their movement between the income quintiles \nover 15 years.\n  The study shows there is considerable economic mobility in America \nand that large numbers of people move up and down the economic ladder \nin relatively short periods of time. Moreover, in recent years earning \nmobility has increased.\n  The study demonstrates that within a single 1-year time frame that \none-third of workers in the bottom quintile move up and one-fourth of \nworkers in the top quintile move down. One-half of the remaining labor \nforce changed quintiles within one year and 60 percent of workers are \nupwardly mobile within 10 years. The study also showed that after 10 \nyears, two-thirds of workers change quintiles.\n  A University of Michigan study also concludes that taxpayers tend to \nmove between income groups during their lifetimes. This makes sense. \nTaxpayers are likely to be lower-income earners early and late in life \nbut are likely to be higher-income earners during the mid-points of \ntheir lives.\n  My understanding is that the Congressional Budget Office--CBO--is \nconsidering the use of income mobility concepts in its analyses. I'm \npleased that the non-partisan official scorekeeping organization \nrecognizes the important issue of income mobility.\n  What allowed these people to escape the lowest income quintile and \nstart earning more money is college education and acquiring necessary \nskills on the job. Interestingly, anecdotal evidence shows 80 percent \nof individuals on the Forbes 400 list were self-made, as opposed to \nthose who inherited fortunes.\n  Again, this underlines the importance of taking advantage of \neducational opportunities. Education allowed these people to overcome \ndifferences in parental income, increased their chances to escape low \nwage jobs, and determined the success of their future earnings.\n  Too often distribution tables are used in an almost fetish-like \nmanner. It is important to understand that the tables are, at best, \nsnapshots. The reality is much more complex. Distribution tables are \nuseful policy tools, but they must be used in context.\n  The NCPA study confirms that there is substantial economic mobility \nbetween generations. Almost 60 percent of sons whose parents' incomes \nwere in the bottom 20 percent are in a higher income group; 31 percent \nhave incomes in the top 60 percent.\n  Therefore, whoever is saying that once rich, Americans stay rich, and \nonce poor, they stay poor, is purely mistaken. I welcome this data on \nthis important matter for one simple reason: it sheds light on what \nAmerica really is all about--vast opportunities and economic mobility.\n  Built by people from all over the world, our country truly provides \nunique opportunities for everyone. These opportunities include better \neducation, healthcare services, land financial security. But most \nimportantly, our country provides people with freedom to obtain \nnecessary skills to climb the economic ladder and live better lives.\n  We are a free nation. We are a mobile nation. We are a nation of \nhard-working, innovative, skilled and resilient people who like to take \nrisks when necessary in order to succeed. We have an obligation as \nlawmakers to incorporate these fundamental principles into our tax \nsystem.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support final passage of this \nbudget resolution. In my judgment, this budget, like the President's \nbudget that it reflects, is divorced from the reality that working \nfamilies in Michigan and across the country face every day. The \nchallenges facing our country today are enormous. We are allocating \nresources around the globe to combat terrorism. Our troops are putting \ntheir lives on the line every day to secure and rebuild Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Social Security and Medicare face unprecedented strains as \nthe baby boom generation nears retirement. At the same time, the \nFederal deficit is ballooning to historic proportions.\n  Crafting a budget to accommodate these and other priorities requires \na careful and balanced approach. But unfortunately, the \nadministration's budget and the resolution before us today focus too \nheavily on promoting massive tax cuts mainly for the wealthiest \nAmericans, adding a large amount to our national debt and forcing \npainful cuts in our Nation's priorities like education, health care and \nprotection of the environment--cuts that have real consequences for all \nof us.\n  This resolution, like the President's proposal, would make permanent \nthe tax cuts pushed through Congress by the President in 2001 and 2003, \nwhich the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates will cost $1.1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. Substantial revenue reductions like \nthese have already left in their wake the largest annual deficit in our \nNation's history, estimated by CBO to be a staggering $478 billion for \nthis year and they are projected to continue.\n  Moreover, this resolution hides its true future effects by failing to \naccount for large expenses that we all know are coming. By using 5-year \nprojections instead of the customary 10-year numbers, this budget \ndisguises the size of our deficits. The cost of extending the tax cuts \npast 2010 explodes just outside of the 5-year window. It is also \noutside of this 5-year window that the surplus we have in the Social \nSecurity trust fund disappears, thereby making the unified budget \nfigures even worse. When this budget plan is played out over 10 years, \nour deficits skyrocket and use up every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus, funds that Social Security will need as our baby boomers start \nto retire.\n  The President's budget blueprint also failed to include a number of \ninevitable costs, such as the cost of continued military operations in \nIraq and Afghanistan. I am glad to see that the Budget Committee \nrecognized this fact and placed into a special reserve fund $30 billion \nfor military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for 2005. However, it \nis clear that more will be needed; it is unrealistic to fail to reserve \namounts for Iraq or Afghanistan in 2006 or subsequent years.\n  This budget also doesn't take into account likely reforms to the \nAlternative Minimum Tax, reforms that are needed to keep tens of \nmillions of middle class taxpayers from paying a tax that was \noriginally meant to apply only to a small portion of high-income \ntaxpayers. Because of these and other omissions, achieving the \nPresident's goal of cutting the deficit in half by\n\n[[Page S2693]]\n\n2009 is hollow rhetoric, especially if he continues to stick to his \nagenda.\n  Following the path of continuing the President's tax breaks is \nfiscally irresponsible. The tax cuts are heavily slanted toward the \nwealthiest Americans. The average tax cut for the wealthiest 1 percent \nwould be nearly 90 times larger than the average tax cut for middle-\nincome households.\n  In its attempt to accommodate these reckless and inequitable tax \ncuts, this budget proposes a significant number of cuts to vital \nprograms. Despite the fact that millions of jobs have been lost since \nthe beginning of the Bush Administration--many in the manufacturing \nindustry--this budget offers little help to those looking for \nemployment. I am disappointed that we couldn't pass the amendment \noffered by Senator Boxer that would have placed top priority on \ncreating jobs in the U.S. now, discouraging the shipping of jobs \noverseas, and helping workers dislocated by global forces beyond their \ncontrol.\n  Instead this resolution contains significant cuts to one of the most \nsuccessful federal/state partnerships in government, the Manufacturing \nExtension Program (MEP). The MEP creates programs to help our country's \nmanufacturers be more productive and competitive, thus, keeping jobs \nhere at home. The resolution also completely slashes funding for The \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology's Advanced Technology \nProgram (ATP), which focuses on improving the competitiveness of \nAmerican companies in the global marketplace by encouraging R through \npublic-private collaboration in the development of promising \ntechnologies. In the face of a loss of 2.6 million manufacturing jobs \nover the past few years, we should be doing all we can to promote \nprograms that help create manufacturing and hi-tech jobs. Supporting \nthe MEP and ATP programs is one way to do this.\n  Additionally, I am extremely disappointed that this plan fails to \nextend unemployment insurance to workers who have exhausted their \nbenefits. The number of individuals exhausting their regular State \nunemployment benefits and not qualifying for further benefits is higher \nthan at any other time on record--about 90,000 workers a week; \nextending unemployment insurance is the right thing to do for displaced \nworkers and for the economy because it provides an economic stimulus by \nputting money in the pockets of people who need it most.\n  And the misguided priorities don't stop there. Despite our attempts \nto amend it, this budget inadequately addresses the needs of our \nchildren by failing to fund our education programs.\n  The No Child Left Behind Act, approved overwhelmingly by this body \njust over 2 years ago, is intended to help our school children make \nprogress toward reaching their full potential by providing things such \nas smaller classes, after-school programs, and technology and \ntechnology training for teachers. But the President's budget refuses to \nprovide our school systems the funding they were promised. And now, \ndespite attempts to change this, the budget resolution also \ninadequately addresses the need for increases in education funding to \nassist local schools. We cannot expect our schools to adequately meet \nthe high academic standards that have been set if we neglect to provide \nthem with the tools they need to succeed.\n  Not only does this budget fail our young school children, it also \nfails our older children who seek financial assistance to attend \ncollege. The Pell grant program is the single largest source of Federal \nGovernment grant aid devoted to financing postsecondary education. This \nprogram reaches over one-fifth of all undergraduates each year. Despite \nthe program's successes, this body opposed increasing the maximum Pell \ngrant by a $1,050 by reducing tax breaks for the wealthiest among us.\n  This budget also fails to meet the needs of our veterans by \nunderfunding the Department of Veterans Affairs, forcing real cuts in \nthe health services for America's veterans. Not only should we be \nredoubling our efforts to care for those who have already served in the \nmilitary, but as a new generation of soldiers returns home from \ncountries around the globe, we must ensure that they have access to a \nveterans' health system that is able to provide them with the care and \nservices they have earned. Despite these obligations to the men and \nwomen who have been sent into harm's way to protect us and our way of \nlife, I am disappointed that this body voted down more than an \namendment to increase veterans' medical care, even when the cost was \nfully offset. Our veterans deserve not only our recognition and our \ngratitude, but also the appropriate funding for well-earned services \nand benefits.\n  And the unwise cuts don't end there. This budget would make steep \ncuts in housing programs that provide assistance to low-income \nfamilies, our seniors, and the disabled. The proposal also cuts foreign \naid, environmental programs, health programs and the list goes on and \non, calling for significant reductions in nearly every part of \ngovernment in an attempt to pay for the President's tax cuts.\n  I am pleased that the Senate passed the amendment offered by the \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Baucus, to strike the reconciliation \ninstructions requiring mandatory program cuts targeted at critical \nprograms like Medicaid and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). I hope \nthis will end the attempts to cut these vital programs that serve low-\nincome families and individuals, populations that are, unfortunately, \ngrowing. This is not the time to cut these critical and effective \nprograms.\n  Medicaid, as my colleagues know, is the largest source of funding for \nmedical and health-related services for low-income individuals. In \n2003, the program assisted 24.8 million children, and 13.6 disabled, \nblind, and elderly individuals. The EITC program has been highly \nsuccessful in assisting persons in low-income families raising children \nto transition from welfare to work. EITC helps individuals and \nfamilies, particularly single working mothers, meet essential needs, \nfrom putting food on the table to paying monthly rent to assisting in \nrequired educations expenditures. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \nthe EITC helps lift over four million people out of poverty annually, \nincluding more than 2.7 million children. Cuts to either of these \nprograms are unacceptable.\n  This budget is divorced from the reality that American families face \nevery day. It burrows us deeper into the deficit ditch, continues our \nreckless reliance on the Social Security surplus and fails to provide \nvital programs with adequate funding. I cannot support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the budget \nresolution that the Senate is voting on today. We have been presented a \nfiscally irresponsible budget that calls for record budget deficits and \ndeep cuts in programs for education, first responders, veterans, and \nthe environment. I find it difficult to pin point exactly how this \nbudget benefits the hard working Americans who are being asked to pay \nfor this reckless fiscal plan.\n  This budget plan does nothing to address the growing Federal debt \nthat we are preparing to pass onto our children and grandchildren. In \nfact, this budget calls for a record $477 billion deficit this year, on \ntop of the record $450 billion deficit last year. We have a \nresponsibility to bring accountability back to the budget process. The \n$1.7 trillion in tax cuts that we have enacted over the past three \nyears have not fulfilled any of their promise--they have not done \nanything to curb our growing economic problems; they have not continued \nthe budget surpluses we reached under the previous administration; and \nthey have not restored confidence in the fiscal decisions of our \nGovernment.\n  Perhaps even more disturbing, this budget fails to reflect the \nspending realities that face our country in the coming years. The \nendemic long-term deficits forecast in this budget will significantly \nadd to the Federal debt that is expected to top $15 trillion by 2014. \nThis five-year budget plan also contains no funds for our continuing \ncommitments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The costs for these operations are \nso excessive--an estimated $280 billion over ten years--that including \nthem in the budget would produce an unfathomably large national budget. \nWhere will the money come from for future requests? The hope to cut the \ndeficit continues to move farther and farther from reality.\n  Once again, this Congress is poised to enact a fiscally irresponsible \nbudget\n\n[[Page S2694]]\n\nplan offered by this administration. Time after time the President and \nmany of my Republican colleagues have shown that they do not care about \nthe long-term effects his policies have on our financial future. After \nrecord budget surpluses during the final years of the Clinton \nadministration, the Bush administration has sent Congress three budgets \nin a row that have turned record surpluses into record deficits. The \nPresident's own budget predictions call for the Government to be a \nrecord $521 billion in the hole in 2004. This budget resolution is full \nof red ink for as far as the eye can see. With the retirement of the \nfirst of the baby boom generation just four years away, we can no \nlonger afford to continue on the President's path of fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, just this week the National Conference of \nState Legislatures released its latest Unfunded Mandates Report. Based \non President Bush's budget request, and the budget resolution before \nus, the NCSL Report labels the $40 million in fiscal year 2005 funding \nfor election reform under the Help America Vote Act an unfunded mandate \nof $560 million.\n  The budget resolution before us does not include sufficient funds to \nensure that necessary election reforms can be achieved by the States in \ntime for the 2006 elections. I regret that the resolution does not \nreflect the bipartisan recommendation of the Senate Rules Committee \nwith regard to payments to the States for election reform under the \nHelp America Vote Act, P.L. 107-252, HAVA.\n  In our letter of February 24 to the Budget Committee, Chairman Lott \nand I expressed our concerns that the $40 million funding level \nproposed by President Bush's budget for fiscal year 2005 was \ninsufficient to fully fund the required election reforms which States \nmust implement by the first Federal election in 2006. Based on \nestimates by the States, the bipartisan Carter-Ford, Commission, and \nnumerous experts, Congress authorized a total of $3 billion over 3 \nfiscal years for implementing these requirements. To date, Congress has \nfunded roughly $2.4 billion in section 257 requirements payments. It is \nimperative that the remaining $600 million be provided in fiscal year \n2005 to ensure that the States will be able to meet the requirements of \nHAVA, including the replacement of punch card systems and the \ndeployment of fully disabled-accessible voting systems, by 2006.\n  Folloiwng the November 2000 election debacle, Congress responded by \nplacing new requirements on the States for the conduct of Federal \nelections with the promise that we would fund 95 percent of the cost of \nthose mandates. For the first time in our Nation's history, the Federal \nGovernment will be a full partner with the States in the funding of \nFederal elections. To expect cash-strapped State and local governments \nto make up for the shortfall in promised Federal funds threatens to \nderail the very election reforms Congress mandated that the States \nimplement.\n  Voting is the voice of a free and democratic society. I believe that \nCongress can, and will, find the necessary funds to fulfill our promise \nto the States and our commitment to the American electorate to see that \nevery eligible voter has an equal opportunity to vote and have their \nvote counted. While I will not insist on offering an amendment to this \nbudget resolution, I am serving notice that I intend to work with my \ncolleagues to see that we fully fund HAVA in fiscal year 2005 to ensure \nthat the bipartisan reforms we enacted are implemented by the 2006 \nelections.\n  Mr. Daschle. Mr. President, I had hoped to offer an amendment to \nincrease funding for the Rural Education Achievement Program. I will \nwithhold that amendment, but I would like to take this opportunity to \nhighlight the challenges facing rural schools.\n  Rural schools play a very important role in educating our Nation's \nchildren. Nearly 40 percent of America's schoolchildren attend public \nschools in rural areas or small towns with populations of less than \n25,000. Almost 50 percent of the Nation's public schools are located in \nrural areas and small towns, and 41 percent of public school educators \nteach in rural community schools.\n  Rural schools face formidable challenges in their efforts to provide \na high-quality education to each of their students. These school \ndistricts tend to be less effective in obtaining State and Federal \ncompetitive grants, in large part because many cannot afford \nprofessional grant writers. The costs of providing a good education \nalso tend to be higher in rural districts. Teachers, for example, are \npaid the same whether they are teaching 30 or 5 students in a \nclassroom. Transportation costs are much higher in rural districts, \nsince school buses must travel longer distances. Unfortunately, these \ncosts can adversely affect the budgets of rural districts and make it \nharder for them to provide the services necessary for high achievement.\n  Nevertheless, and appropriately, the same level of academic results \nare expected of them as in urban and suburban school systems. These \nstudents certainly deserve an equal opportunity to achieve those \nresults. The geographic isolation of rural districts will make it more \ndifficult to achieve the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act. Schools \nfound in need of improvement may not have the ability or the resources \nto implement provisions such as public school choice and supplemental \nservices.\n  Increasing funding for the Rural Education Achievement program would \nprovide rural school districts with additional funding and flexibility \nto help these students achieve proficiency. Providing additional \nfunding to rural districts would give them more options for providing \nhigh-quality services to children, such as distance learning and more \nteacher training.\n  The President proposes to freeze funding for the Rural Education \nAchievement Program in his budget for fiscal year 2005, despite the \nmajor challenges facing schools in rural communities. I believe we \nshould provide the full $300 million as promised by title VI of the No \nChild Left Behind Act, and I hope to work with my colleagues to achieve \nthat goal as we work on the appropriations bills this year.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am in opposition to the budget before the \nSenate. Many pundits will argue that the Senate budget is meaningless \npolitical posturing and a waste of time. After all, no money is \nappropriated by the decisions we make in this resolution. No taxes are \nchanged. No laws are passed.\n  But those who write off the budget debate are making a real mistake \nand missing a real opportunity. The Senate's budget resolution is our \none chance to demonstrate that we have a coherent plan for our country. \nThe budget is our opportunity to show that we have the courage to face \nour challenges, the common sense to meet our obligations, and the \nvision to lead the nation into a brighter future.\n  Sadly, the budget before us fails on all three counts.\n  Our current fiscal situation is a disaster. The Federal balance sheet \nhas swung from a record surplus of $236 billion in fiscal year 2000 to \na record deficit of $477 billion projected for this fiscal year. Now--\nas the baby boom generation prepares to retire, as our nation faces \nunprecedented threats to our security, as well-paying manufacturing \njobs bleed off our shores--does our budget face our fiscal shortfall \nwith the gravity and seriousness of purpose the situation demands?\n  No, it does not. Instead, we have a document that masks Treasury-\ndraining tax policy with 5-year projections--closing the window to the \npublic before the price tag for the President's ill-considered tax \nbreaks reaches the trillions of dollars. Instead, we have a budget that \ndoesn't include in its bottom line the estimated $280 billion in \nadditional funds over the next 10 years it will take to continue to \nfight wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Certainly, the cost of the war in Iraq is a contentious issue. The \nexploding price of the President's tax breaks is unsettling. And the \n$2.8 trillion the budget before us plans to add to the federal debt in \nthe next 5 years is downright terrifying. A courageous budget would \nacknowledge those hard, cold numbers honestly. This budget does not.\n  Nor does it contain the sort of common sense that might make it a \nfiscal plan worth supporting.\n  As school districts everywhere cut back on teachers, academic \noptions, counseling, books, even heat to pay for the mandates of the \nLeave No Child Behind Act, does this budget meet the\n\n[[Page S2695]]\n\ngovernment's acknowledged obligation to pays its fair share?\n  As Republican and Democratic Governors alike struggle to meet the \nhealth needs of the uninsured, does this budget propose to meet the \nfederal government's obligations to the States under Medicaid? No.\n  As the costs to the government and society of young criminal \noffenders pile up, does this budget meet its obligation to fund the \ncost savings juvenile crime prevention programs that keep kids out of \njail? No.\n  As farmers and ranchers struggle with shrinking profit margins, \nviolent weather conditions, and market-wrecking diseases like mad cow \ndisease, does this budget meet its obligation to guarantee a safe and \navailable food supply? No.\n  The list of unmet obligations is longer than the budget document \nitself: TANF reauthorization, transportation reauthorization, higher \neducation reauthorization, Federal nutrition program reauthorization--\nhealth, education, safety, welfare--all needs unmet; all duties undone.\n  If the first rule of commonsense budgeting is pay what you owe, then \nthis budget is a violation of common sense.\n  But perhaps even more than common sense--or courage--what this budget \nlacks is vision.\n  We should face head on and plan for--the hemorrhage of manufacturing \njobs. But this budget merely dabs at the wound with unrelated upper \nincome tax cuts, ill-conceived trade agreements, and empty promises of \nbetter times to come.\n  We should face head on--and plan for--the looming crisis in Social \nSecurity shoved onto the baby boom generation by our precarious fiscal \nsituation. But this budget merely shortens its time frame to 5 years \nand ignores the train wreck just around the corner.\n  We should plan for a prosperous future for next generation. But this \nbudget skimps on feeding them when they're born, skimps on teaching \nthem as they grow, and is generous only in loading them down with debt \nwhen they enter the working world.\n  We are capable of producing a budget with courage, common sense, and \nvision. We have not. The people of this country deserve a budget with \ncourage, common sense and vision--everything this budget is not. For \nthose reasons, I oppose the resolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the budget \nresolution that the Senate is considering today. Quite simply, this \nresolution does not reflect the priorities of West Virginians. The \npolicies promoted here would not be in the best interests of the \noverwhelming majority of West Virginians.\n  This budget resolution calls for more of the same failed economic \npolicies that have been implemented over the last 3 years. It provides \nfor additional tax cuts for the wealthy. It short-changes investment in \nimportant domestic programs. It understates the cost of supporting our \ntroops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it forecasts more \noutrageous deficits for our children to pay off.\n  West Virginians are rightfully worried about our economy right now. \nMany of them are unemployed, and many others are nervous that their \njobs will be the next ones shipped overseas. They are having trouble \nmaking ends meet on wages that have stagnated. They are struggling to \nhave health care for themselves and their families. They have a right \nto expect that when laying out our economic policy for the coming year, \nCongress will address these pressing concerns. I am very disappointed \nthat the budget resolution we are considering today offers no \nleadership on these important issues.\n  Instead, as has been the pattern of the last 3 years, this budget \nresolution provides for more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Let \nme be clear. Some of the tax cuts called for in this budget resolution \nare ones that I look forward to supporting. The increase in the child \ntax credit, relief from the marriage penalty, expansion of the lowest \ntax bracket--these are tax cuts for hard-working Americans that \nDemocrats have been fighting for all along. Families in West Virginia \ndeserve to have these tax cuts extended, and I will work with my \ncolleagues to ensure that we do so.\n  However, this budget resolution calls for additional tax cuts for the \nvery wealthiest Americans as well. The legislation asks us to \naccelerate the elimination of estate tax--something that helps married \ncouples with estates worth more than $7 million. The resolution asks us \nto extend the tax cuts on dividends and capital gains income--something \nthat will benefit less than 20 percent of the people in my state. I \nsimply do not believe that Congress ought to consider additional tax \ncuts for the most fortunate in our society in a year when our troops \nare in the fields, millions of Americans are feeling the pain of \njoblessness, and the government is running record deficits. To those \nwho hid behind the spurious argument that tax cuts for the wealthy are \nreally for small businesses, I would remind them that less than 2 \npercent of our Nation's small businesses pay taxes in the highest \nbracket.\n  With tax revenues already at their lowest point in decades, as a \nshare of the economy, critical Government services are underfunded in \nthis budget resolution. The resolution provides just $369 billion for \nall domestic, discretionary spending outside of homeland security. \nWhile that may sound like a great deal of money, it is just $2 billion \nmore than last year, and certainly not enough to keep pace with \ninflation or program growth.\n  Let me give you just a few examples of the painful results of such a \nbudget. First, this budget turns its back on our schools and reneges on \na promise Congress made when it enacted the No Child Left Behind \nlegislation. In 2000, I voted for the No Child Left Behind Act because \nI strongly believe that education is the key to our future and we must \ninvest in higher academic standards. Based on that legislation, our \nschools have accepted annual testing, and its expense, higher academic \nstandards for students, and higher standards for teachers. But this \nbudget does not follow through with the resources we promised schools \nthat accepted these changes. This year alone, we are $8.6 billion short \nof promised funding. In West Virginia, funding is $60 million less than \npromised.\n  Students are not the only ones to lose out under this budget \nresolution. Anthony Principi, the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, told \nCongress that Veterans Administration health care is underfunded. He \ntestified that he needed $1.2 billion in additional funds. At a time \nwhen military personnel are serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, new \nveterans are coming home, and 60,000 veterans are on waiting lists for \nhealth care, we simply must fund VA health care. Yet, this budget does \nnot.\n  The Federal Government also has a responsibility to maintain its \ncommitment to Medicaid in order to protect access to health care for \nour poor children, needy families and seniors in nursing homes. This is \nespecially true during times of economic downturn when Medicaid \nbeneficiaries need it the most. Last year, I worked with several of my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate to successfully pass $20 billion in \nState fiscal relief. This legislation prevented several States from \nmaking cuts to their Medicaid programs. However, the projected budget \ndeficits for states in the coming year are between $39-$41 billion--in \nspite of the slight upturn in the economy. Eighteen States have already \nintroduced measures to reduce Medicaid coverage, eliminate benefits, \nincrease copays, limit access to prescription drugs, or decrease \npayments to providers. Additional states will be forced to enact \nsimilar measures if fiscal relief expires on June 30.\n  Instead of trying to undermine Medicaid funding, we should continue \nto provide state fiscal relief in order to hasten our nation's economic \nrecovery and improve coverage options for the uninsured. And I am very \ndisappointed that this budget resolution offers no assistance to states \nto prevent these devastating cuts.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Aviation Subcommittee of the Commerce \nCommittee, I cannot help but note that this resolution does not provide \nsufficient funds for the Essential Air Service program or the Small \nCommunity Air Service Development Program. I will certainly fight for \nadequate funding to maintain the Federal Government's commitment to \nmaking sure that small and rural communities continue to be connected \nto the national air transportation system. This\n\n[[Page S2696]]\n\nbudget resolution will make that fight an uphill battle.\n  I cannot support this budget. I refuse to believe that this is the \nbest that Congress can do, and I will not try to explain to West \nVirginians that there is room for additional tax cuts, but not enough \nmoney for education, child care, health care, infrastructure \nimprovements, homeland security, and other important domestic \ninitiatives.\n  I also refuse to ask West Virginia's children to assume enormous \namounts of additional debt to fund such misguided priorities. Make no \nmistake, while this budget imposes painful restrictions on services \nthat West Virginians care about, it still increases our national debt \nby unprecedented amounts in the coming years. These outrageous deficits \nwill have a tangible, negative impact for middle-class Americans. As \nGovernment borrowing goes up, we know that interest rates will also \narise for families with home mortgages, student loans, car loans, or \ncredit card debt.\n  If this resolution is to be the blueprint for our economic policy \nthis year, then we are in for another dismal year. I ask my colleagues \nto oppose this budget resolution and to work together to craft a budget \nthat is consistent with the values of hard working American families.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the priorities \nof this year's budget resolution, I want to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss a growing problem in America--one that has had an especially \ndevastating impact on South Dakota and other rural States. That problem \nis the spread of methamphetamine.\n  Over the course of the last decade, there has been a dramatic \nincrease in the trafficking and abuse of methamphetamine in rural \nStates. In fact, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Agency recently \nstated, ``Meth is now the number one drug in rural America--absolutely, \npositively, end of question.'' South Dakota, like many States across \nthe country, is struggling to find ways to combat this latest drug \nepidemic.\n  Methamphetamine is highly addictive, and can have devastating health \neffects, including psychotic behavior and brain damage, and produces \nwithdrawal symptoms of depression, anxiety, fatigue, paranoia, and \naggression. Chronic methamphetamine use can cause anxiety, confusion, \nand violent behavior. Every year, hundreds of people die from \nmethamphetamine-related causes, and the number of admissions to \ntreatment for methamphetamine throughout the United States increased \nfrom 14,554 in 1992 to 80,678 in 2001, an increase of over 500 percent.\n  The problem is getting worse. In 2001, 10 percent of all South \nDakotans who sought State-funded inpatient treatment services indicated \nthat meth was the primary substance of abuse. In 2002, the number grew \nto 17 percent. In June 2003, that percentage jumped to 33 percent. \nFifty-seven out of 66 counties in South Dakota in 2001 reported \nproblems with methamphetamine use, and because meth-related problems \nare showing increased movement from the outside edges of the State \ntoward the center, the sad truth is that soon there won't be a single \ncounty in my State that is not seriously affected by methamphetamine.\n  In addition to having serious adverse health affects, methamphetamine \npresents our Nation's law enforcement agencies with unique and \nsignificant challenges.\n  Unlike other illegal drugs that are produced in foreign countries and \nsmuggled into America, meth is being produced and distributed right \nhere in America. Methamphetamine can be manufactured in small, \nclandestine labs that operate out of homes, barns, hotel rooms, and \neven car trunks. The equipment, ingredients, and even the recipe are \nreadily available in pharmacies, hardware stores and on the Internet. \nProducers of methamphetamine tend to be small-scale operations seeking \nto make only enough for personal use and minor sales--much like the old \nalcohol stills--so that police can't simply choke off a major supply by \ntargeting a big dealer. And because these clandestine operations are \nusually making only small quantities, shutting down a single meth lab \ndoes little to limit supply.\n  So law enforcement faces one of its most urgent and complex \nchallenges. It is being asked to shut down something as deadly as \nheroin, but as easy to make as bathtub gin.\n  We must act to reverse this trend before it is too late. That is why \nI am supporting amendments to the budget resolution that will provide \nneeded assistance to rural communities in their efforts to combat \nmethamphetamine. Programs such as COPS, Byrne Grant, and Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grants play an essential role in providing the \nresources for our State and local law enforcement officers in their \nefforts.\n  Just last night, on NBC nightly news, one of the lead stories was \nentitled ``Meth labs, a toxic threat to rural America.'' We don't need \nmore stories in the news to know methamphetamine trafficking and abuse \nare already a major problem in rural areas. There is evidence that the \ndrug is beginning to take hold in our Nation's urban and suburban \nareas. We must act now to prevent further damage.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed the Baucus \namendment to strike what would amount to devastating cuts to the \nMedicaid program. I am pleased that this amendment was adopted, and I \nbelieve it was an important step in correcting what I believe was a \ngross misplacement of priorities in the Budget Resolution before the \nSenate.\n  At the same time that this budget resolution cuts taxes for wealthier \nAmericans by billions of dollars, it also included a provision that \nwill help clear the way for an $11 billion cut in Medicaid. This cut \nwould be devastating to millions of low-income families, children, \ndisabled and senior citizens who are served by this critical health \ncare program.\n  And to make matters worse, this cut would come at a particularly bad \ntime. States continue to face fiscal crises as a result of a weakened \neconomy. They are already struggling to keep up with the rising demands \nand costs of Medicaid as more families need help during trying economic \ntimes. This budget resolution would have made it even harder for States \nto meet the needs of families, and would certainly lead to more \nuninsured Americans as States are forced to make painful cuts in \nMedicaid.\n  Estimates show that an $11 billion cut in Medicaid would cost \nWisconsin approximately $200 million over 5 years. Wisconsin has been a \nleader in providing comprehensive health services that working families \nneed, but how would our State be expected to absorb a cut of this \nmagnitude and continue to provide the comprehensive services people \ncount on? This provision could force cuts in critical health benefits, \npreventive benefits, dental coverage, vision coverage, or speech and \noccupational therapy. It could force States to limit enrollment and \nlead to an increase in the number of uninsured families. It could lead \nto higher costs for seniors enrolled in State prescription drug \nassistance programs. It could limit options for long-term care for the \nelderly and disabled. And it could lead to cuts in reimbursement to \nhealth care providers.\n  We should be appalled by the prospect of cuts in basic safety net \nprograms like Medicaid during a time when many lower-income Americans \nneed more help. We should be especially shocked when the cut occurs at \nthe same time that we provide billions in tax cuts for the wealthy. But \nthis budget resolution would have put $11 billion in Medicaid cuts on a \nfast track and left low-income working families, children, seniors and \npeople with disabilities out in the cold.\n  I am pleased that the Senate voted to reject these harmful Medicaid \ncuts and to finally begin to put this budget's priorities in the proper \norder for our Nation's working families.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on S. Con. Res. \n95, the fiscal year 2005 budget resolution.\n  I support the budget before us because I believe it strikes a good \nbalance between fiscal discipline, continued tax relief, and strong \nsupport for our military and the security of our homeland.\n  Before I expand on S. Con. Res. 95, I would like to reflect on a few \nevents and developments that have shaped the current landscape in \nAmerica. Since President Bush's inauguration in 2001 America has faced \na myriad of debilitating events such as: a stock market\n\n[[Page S2697]]\n\nthat had been in decline since 2000 along with a recession according to \nleading economists; unprecedented corporate scandals; and, terrorism on \nAmerican soil. This triad of events was a perfect recipe for increased \nunemployment, a ballooning deficit and a struggling economy. In an \nattempt to rectify these problems, the President, in conjunction with \nthe House and the Senate passed necessary sweeping tax reform that has \nhelped right the stock market, reduce unemployment and pave the way to \nsustained economic growth in the future.\n  While these past legislative accomplishments were essential and have \nproduced phenomenal results such as; gross domestic product, GDP, in \nthe third quarter last year grew at the fastest quarterly rate in two \ndecades, unemployment has dropped drastically and the combined value of \nthe New York Stock Exchange, NYSE, and the NASDAQ has increase 40 \npercent. And we need to do more to assure this unprecedented growth \ncontinues. That is why this budget rejects tax increases on working \nfamilies, maintains tax relief for married couples and maintains the \n10-percent income tax rate for low-wage workers. In addition to \nmaintaining tax relief, this budget, in order to allow for continued \neconomic prosperity, holds the line on spending and cuts the deficit in \nhalf in merely three short years. This reduction in spending and \nexercise in fiscal discipline will help curb our towering deficit.\n  The United States has also made bounding leaps in the war on \nterrorism. In the past year alone, the United States has toppled two \nevil regimes, in Afghanistan and Iraq, rid the world of Iraq's weapons \nprograms, and captured Saddam Hussein. The Budget committee sent to the \nfloor an increase in defense funding of $20 billion. After agreeing to \nSenator Warner's amendment, of which I was a cosponsor, the Senate has \nincreased military funding by $27 billion for 2005 to make sure troops \nhave the resources necessary to continue to fight this war on terrorism \nand protect and defend our interests around the world. In addition to \nproviding funding for our military, this budget also takes into account \nthe importance of adequately providing funding to secure our home front \nby increasing homeland security funds by $4 billion over last year's \nlevel.\n  With our renewed economic growth and Congress' diligent efforts to \nfocus spending on only our essential priorities, we can continue this \neconomic prosperity and secure America at home and abroad.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we debate the fiscal year 2005 budget \nresolution before us, each of us is obligated to measure the budget \nagainst our State and national priorities. Monday I talked about the \nmany ways this budget shortchanges the Nation's priorities. Today I \nwant to focus on the ways the budget shortchanges South Dakota's \npriorities.\n  South Dakotans want to ensure that our fiscal health and Social \nSecurity remain sound and stable. They want men and women who have \nworked hard all their lives to retire with dignity. Since January 2001, \nthey have watched with alarm as the Bush administration and Congress \nhave spent both the budget surpluses it took us so long to accrue and \nthe Social Security trust funds that, only a few years ago, both \npolitical parties declared untouchable. This budget exacerbates that \ndismal situation, and I will be supporting an amendment to protect \nSocial Security for generations to come.\n  South Dakotans want America's veterans to be treated with dignity, \ntoo. They want us to honor our commitments to them and ``care for him \nwho shall have borne the battle and for his widow and orphan.'' Here \nagain, this budget fails. Nearly 60,000 veterans are on waiting lists \nfor care at VA hospitals. When our troops fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan return home, the lines could get even longer. But despite \nthe extraordinary sacrifices our soldiers have made for us, the \nRepublican budget offers veterans only longer waits and higher fees. I \nwill be offering an amendment to fully fund veterans' health care.\n  South Dakotans believe the men and women of the National Guard and \nReserves should have the right to come home to health care, too. That \nis why I will be offering an amendment to allow those without health \ninsurance to purchase TRICARE coverage when they return from active \nduty. The amendment would give Guard members and reservists permanent \naccess to TRICARE coverage for themselves and their families.\n  South Dakotans feel the pain of low wages, high unemployment, and \nAmerican jobs going overseas. That is why I will be supporting an \namendment to encourage job creation, discourage shipping American jobs \noverseas, and provide dislocated workers the assistance they need. \nSouth Dakotans want their children to have a world-class education. \nThey believe that, in that effort, we should leave no child behind. \nEven if that child lives in a small, rural school district. Even if \nthat child lives on an Indian reservation. The No Child Left Behind Act \nsaid, if you hold our students to higher standards, we will guarantee \nyou the funding to meet those standards. Schools are holding up their \nend of the bargain, but the President and this budget are not. I will \nsupport an amendment to make good on our national promise and fully \nfund the No Child Left Behind Act, including the Rural Education \nAssistance Program.\n  South Dakotans believe we should also make good on our promises to \nNative Americans. In that regard, and in so many areas, our Government \nhas fallen short. Perhaps the most flagrant violation of our commitment \nto Native Americans is our failure to provide essential health care \nservices to the people who depend on the Indian Health Service. This \nbudget provides less than 40 percent of the funding needed to provide \nbasic health care services to Indian Country. On a per capita basis, \nthat equals about half of what our nation spends on federal prisoners' \nhealth care. Again, I will be offering an amendment to right that \nindefensible wrong.\n  South Dakotans value clean water. The President's budget and this \nbudget resolution shortchange critical drinking water projects, as well \nas basic water and sewer services for rural communities. Throughout \nthis year's budget and appropriations processes, I will be working to \nrestore those funds.\n  South Dakotans value their forest land and want to protect it. Last \nDecember, Congress and the administration enacted the Healthy Forests \nRestoration Act to authorize funds for hazardous fuels reduction in our \nnational forests. The President's budget underfunds that program, \nleaving our forests vulnerable and many communities at high risk of \ndevastating fire. These funds must also be restored.\n  South Dakotans believe that the communities that put food on our \ntable deserve our gratitude and a fair chance to maintain their way of \nlife. The President's budget and this budget resolution cut essential \nconservation and rural development programs and threaten the economic \nfuture of rural communities. I will be working to restore those funds, \ntoo.\n  This budget, like all budgets, is about more than numbers. It is \nabout choices. It is about priorities. And from the looks of this \nbudget, our priorities are all wrong.\n  Our Nation is at war, our economy is flagging, our schools are \nstruggling, our people are going without health care, and our \ngovernment is facing record deficits as far as the eye can see. But \ndespite the tremendous challenges our nation faces, this budget \ninexplicably proposes a staggering $1.3 trillion in new tax breaks, \nprimarily for the wealthiest among us.\n  South Dakotans have a different set of priorities. In the course of \nthis debate, I plan to support a series of amendments that aim to \nreflect those priorities. The amendments will offer a strategy to \nrepair our fiscal problems, keep our promises, and prepare our country \nfor the challenges of the future.\n  Each amendment will fix a glaring weakness in this budget and each \nwill be fully paid for. In fact, most will actually reduce the deficits \nthat Republican budgets have created. And they will reflect the \npriorities of South Dakotans, who, like virtually all other Americans, \nexpect us to make responsible choices.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Federal budget deficit will reach a record $477 \nbillion this year, according to figures released in February by the \nCongressional Budget Office. And, if you believe the President's own \nnumbers, the\n\n[[Page S2698]]\n\nbudget deficit will come in at $521 billion this year. This is a \nstunning turnaround from 3 years ago, when the budget was in surplus. \nBut this is just the tip of the iceberg. Over the next 10 years, the \ndeficit is projected to grow to $5.5 trillion--another record.\n  Deficits do matter, and unless we face up to them, they could \nseriously harm our Nation's economy. Here is why:\n  First, deficits mean increased spending on interest instead of \npriorities. In the short term, deficits can help stimulate the economy \nor pay for emergency spending. But in the long term, they limit our \nNation's ability to fund much needed priorities. This means less money \nfor education, less money for environmental protection, and less money \nfor health care. The administration--largely because of the projected \ndeficits--has pledged to limit spending on domestic programs this year \nto 1 percent growth.\n  The budget before the Senate today reflects these constraints by: \nfailing to reimburse state and local governments for the federal \nresponsibilities in paying for the incarceration of illegal immigrants; \nreducing the effectiveness of our police officers by cutting almost \n$700 million from the COPS program; cutting almost $250 million from \nfirefighter grants; underfunding No Child Left Behind by $8.9 billion; \nand underfunding Port Security by more than $550 million. These are not \nfrivolous or unimportant programs: these are vital priorities that must \nbe funded.\n  Last year we spent $318 billion in interest on the national debt \nalone. Our total non-defense discretionary spending last year was only \nmodestly larger, coming in at $421 billion. Every dollar of that $318 \nbillion was money that could have been available for education, \nhealthcare, defense, infrastructure, job development, homeland \nsecurity--or to return to the American people as tax cuts, if we had \npaid down the debt.\n  Second, deficits lead to interest rate increases. We have been \nfortunate in recent years; interest rates and inflation have remained \nlow. But as the economy picks up, the downward pressure on interest \nrates will be relieved and the impact of deficits will be felt. This \nwill add huge expenses to variable home mortgages and auto loans. An \nincrease of just 1 percent would add $2,000 per year to the cost of a \n$200,000 home mortgage. This is more than the majority of American \ntaxpayers will receive from the President's latest tax cut.\n  Third, deficits prevent us from addressing the looming Social \nSecurity and Medicare crises. This is an issue that is not addressed in \nthis budget resolution. We can not continue to avoid it forever. The \nretirement of the baby boomers will place a tremendous strain on our \nsocial safety net. In fact, if we do not address the problem, the \nMedicare trust fund will go broke by the year 2030, and the Social \nSecurity trust fund by 2040.\n  Our Nation was poised to deal with these crises at the end of the \nClinton administration. In 1998, the 30-year trend of deficit spending \nhad been reversed, and we paid off $448 billion of the Nation's \npublicly held debt. This opportunity, however, has been lost. Not only \nhave we failed to shore up the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds, but we are also tapping the Social Security trust fund to pay \nour bills--to the tune of $164 billion this year alone.\n  So what do we do?\n  One possibility is to simply continue along our current path and pass \nour problems on to our children and grandchildren. In fact, the budget \nresolution we are dealing with today raises the federal debt ceiling by \n$644 billion--essentially borrowing from future generations because we \nare unable to muster the political will necessary to pay today's \nobligations today.\n  So I strongly believe that the time has come to chart a different \ncourse, and make the tough choices that the President and this budget \nresolution avoid making. We must adopt a balanced approach to both \ntaxes and spending and return to a program of fiscal sanity. This is \nwhat we did when I first came to the Senate over a decade ago. At that \ntime, a small, bipartisan group of Senators came together to get our \nfiscal house in order. Democrats worked to bring spending under \ncontrol. And Republicans pledged not to push for additional tax cuts. \nToday, we must come together again to address the deficit and restore \nour Nation's economic security.\n  On taxes, I believe that we must consider rolling back the tax cut on \nthe wealthiest in the Nation, to bring the income tax rate from its \ncurrent 35 percent back up to 38.6 percent--what it was just last year. \nThis will affect those who earn more than $312,000 per year. And, will \nimpact less than one percent of American taxpayers, but will save \nnearly $130 billion over the next decade. Making the President's tax \ncuts permanent, as he called for in his State of the Union Address, \nrepresents the height of fiscal irresponsibility. In fact, the Tax \nPolicy Institute estimates the cost of making these tax cuts permanent \nwould cost $1.8 trillion over ten years--$1.8 trillion at just the time \nthat baby boomers will start retiring and Social Security and Medicare \nneed to be stabilized.\n  The tragedy of our current circumstance is that, given the surpluses \nhe inherited, President Bush should have the resources available to \ndevote additional spending to healthcare, education, and the \nenvironment. But the wrong policies, at the wrong time, combined with \nthe war on terror, escalating the 2001 tax cuts, and now moving to make \nthem permanent, plus the recession, have contributed toward the largest \nbudget deficit in history.\n  And now, the fact of the matter is that we are going to need to \ntighten our belts and bring spending under control. I have no problem \nholding the line on spending, but believe that it must be done in the \ncontext of a more responsible approach to tax policy.\n  Finally, we need to take a good, hard look at Social Security and \nMedicare, and start addressing some of the deeper structural problems \nwith these programs now--before they fall into crisis. These are not \neasy answers. But holding off on additional tax cuts, bringing spending \nunder control, and dealing with Social Security and Medicare is the \nonly path to long term fiscal order, a balanced budget, and a healthy \nand vibrant economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n\n            Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that following the vote on the adoption of the budget \nresolution, the Senate proceed to executive session and to consecutive \nvotes on the following nominations on today's Executive Calendar: \nCalendar Nos. 562 and 565.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the votes, the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then return to \nlegislative session with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, I \nask the distinguished leader if he would amend his unanimous consent \nrequest for it to be in order to ask for the yeas and nays at this \npoint.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, what we are doing, so people will stay for \nanother 15 minutes or so, is we are going to act on 2 of the 12 judges \nwho were reported by the Judiciary Committee last Thursday. The judges \nhave been cleared on our side and are ready to have a voice vote on \neach nomination.\n  I understand there is going to be a request for a rollcall vote from \nthe other side of the aisle. If no one requests such a vote, I will be \nprepared to announce that the vote on adoption of the budget resolution \nbe the final vote prior to the recess, but if votes are needed on the \njudges, then Senators should be prepared to stay for these two rollcall \nvotes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, again reserving the right to object, there \nwill be a request for a rollcall vote, and I assume the leader would \njoin in that, that there would be a request for a rollcall vote on the \ntwo judges, 10-minute rollcall votes so we are only here for 11 \nminutes, and everybody will be out on the second one. I only ask to \nprotect my rights to ask for those rollcall votes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it looks as if we will have final passage, \nand then we will have two rollcall votes. For scheduling what will \ncome, I announce that we will be in session tomorrow\n\n[[Page S2699]]\n\nbriefly to finish clearing some legislation, but we will not have \nrollcall votes tomorrow.\n  We are also attempting to clear additional executive nominations, \nincluding Mark McClellan to be Administrator of the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services. Following Friday's session, we will \nreconvene on Monday, March 22. I previously announced there will be no \nrollcall votes on that day. However, we will resume consideration of \nthe FSC/ETI bill on that day. I will have more to say on that in \nclosing later tonight.\n  Having said that, following the last vote tonight, the next vote will \noccur on Tuesday, March 23. We will go to final passage now, and then \ntwo rollcall votes on the judges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before we conclude, I again thank the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I also thank his excellent staff: \nHazen Marshall, Stacey Hughes, and Beth Felder, who worked closely with \nus through these difficult days.\n  I say to our side, I urge you to vote no on this budget resolution. \nIt adds $2.86 trillion to the national debt. I do not see any cutting \nof the deficit in half in 3 years or 4 years or 5 years under this \nbudget resolution. Instead, I see it adding to the deficit each and \nevery year by an additional $177 billion. I urge my colleagues to vote \nno.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to S. Con. Res. 95, as amended. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nEdwards), the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), and the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Reid) is absent \nattending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the passing of a true American patriot and hero--Mike \nO'Callaghan. While I mourn Governor O'Callaghan's passing, I am \nheartened that we here in this Chamber will continue to feel the impact \nof this great man through the service of his protege and former \nstudent--Assistant Democratic Leader Harry Reid.\n  The essence of Governor O'Callaghan is perhaps best captured by an \neffort he undertook in Nicaragua in 1996. He was in that war-torn \ncountry to observe elections that would mark its first ever peaceful \ntransition of power between democratically elected presidents.\n  At 66, Governor O'Callaghan could have asked to observe elections in \nthe nation's capital or its second city, but he insisted on going north \nto the Honduran border to observe elections among some of the most \nmarginalized people in a country of marginalized people. He had to go \nthere in a battered truck over rained out roads because, he said, these \nwere his people whom he had gotten to know in the 1980s, and he wanted \nto be with them as they celebrated the democracy they had earned.\n  That determination and generosity of spirit marked Governor \nO'Callaghan's life. He was highly decorated--with the Purple Heart, the \nBronze Star with a V for valor, and the Silver Star--during the Korean \nWar, during which he lost a leg.\n  Aware of that bravery and personal strength, Sargent Shriver reached \nout to Mike O'Callaghan to make him a point man in President Kennedy's \nand President Johnson's fight against poverty.\n  Also aware of that bravery and strength of character, the people of \nNevada made him their Governor from 1971 to 1979.\n  It was Harry Reid's awareness of O'Callaghan's bravery and character \nthat led me, with great pride, to recommend him just last month to \nserve on the Veterans Benefit Commission.\n  Governor O'Callaghan died last Friday morning doing what he did each \nand every morning of his life attending daily mass before he went to \nwork at the Las Vegas Sun. He also fought for the poor and the \ndisenfranchised--from Korea to Nicaragua to Nevada--each and every day \nof his life.\n  While we are saddened by the loss of Mike O'Callaghan, we can take \ncomfort in the knowledge that his generosity of spirit, his strength of \ncharacter, and his devotion to his State and country will not soon be \nforgotten, and that his values and commitment to public service live on \nin our colleague, and his close friend, Harry Reid.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2700-5", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JEANNINE HOLT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am grateful for the opportunity today to \npay tribute to a wonderful woman, dedicated public servant, and loyal \nstaff member--Mrs. Jeannine Holt. Jeannine has been my Southern Utah \nArea Director for 27 years, and is now retiring to enjoy the many \nwonderful things that life has to offer. Jeannine has done a tremendous \njob in serving thousands of Utahns who needed assistance, direction, or \njust a listening ear.\n  Jeannine has worked on many important issues affecting our State \nincluding lands issues, private property rights, and health care. In \nrecent years she played a pivotal role in helping southern Utah \ncitizens receive compensation from the government for exposure to \nradiation. Her guidance has helped literally hundreds of radiation \nexposure victims and their families navigate the complicated process to \nreceive some financial relief for the awful illnesses many have \nexperienced.\n  Jeannine is a real southern Utah ``treasure.'' She has always been an \nintegral force in her community serving on various boards and \ncommittees including the Dixie State College Board of Trustees, the \nState Fair Board, the St. George Chamber of Commerce Board, and on the \nRotary Bowl Committee. In addition, she has actively and energetically \npromoted the tourism industry in Utah's Dixie and has shared her love \nfor the red rock canyons and sun-drenched lands of St. George and its \nsurrounding areas with people she meets each day.\n  Jeannine's love and loyalty for the republican philosophy has been \nevident in the many years she has served promoting the ideals and \nvalues of the Republican party. She has literally donated thousands of \nhours working for candidates, and campaigns who share her commitment to \nRepublican principles. For 20 years she has served as the vice \nchairwoman of the Washington County Republican Party, a position she \nhas undertaken with distinction and honor.\n  Jeannine was also one of the founding members of the Women's \nConference in Dixie, a conference which brings together hundreds of \nwomen each year from all over southern Utah to discuss important issues \naffecting the health and well-being of women and families. From its \ninception 18 years ago to today, this conference has established itself \nas an important forum for women from all over southern Utah to attend \nand enjoy.\n  In addition to the service she has rendered in the community and on \nmy staff, Jeannine is a loving wife to her husband Stan. They have \nworked side-by-side for many years on projects benefitting their \ncommunity and have buoyed each other up through life's twists and \nturns. Jeannine is also a loving mother of 3 and grandmother of 6.\n  I am grateful for the service that Jeannine Holt has given to me, to \nher community and to the State. She has been by my side for many years \nand has always been a vital component of my Senate organization. I will \nmiss her tremendously but know that life holds many wonderful things \nfor her to savor and enjoy. Jeannine Holt is a dedicated public \nservant, fervently patriotic American, and loyal and cherished friend. \nI want to wish her the very best in retirement and pray for her \ncontinued good health, success and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2700-6", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2700-S2701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this Nation has always been driven \nforward by a passion for discovery and a sense of adventure. From our \nearliest days as a nation, these deeply rooted American qualities have \nspurred our determination to explore new scientific frontiers and \nsparked our entrepreneurial spirit of technological innovation. We know \nin our very fiber that America's strength, prosperity, and global \npreeminence depend directly on scientific research and technological \ninnovation.\n  This is not conjecture. The scientific and economic record of the \npast half-century constitutes overwhelming proof. Yet, today, our \nscientific progress, and the high-tech, high-wage jobs it creates, are \nat risk because the Bush administration is failing to sustain America's \ncommitment to basic research.\n  The Federal Government has seen its research and development, R, \ninvestments steadily decline as a share of\n\n[[Page S2701]]\n\nthe U.S. economy, bringing the federal investment down to levels not \nseen since the midsixties. Federal R has declined in dollar terms \nover many years, and even in years when the investment has increased, \nit has declined sharply relative to our economic growth rate, barely \nkeeping pace with inflation. Physical sciences, math, and engineering \nhave been particularly affected.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's R budgets only worsen this \ntrend. Although Federal funding is set to increase 4.7 percent, nearly \nall of that increase would go to only two Departments--the Departments \nof Defense and Homeland Security--for the development of weapons \nsystems and counterterrorism technology. These are necessary \ninvestments that will make our Nation safer. But the remaining Federal \nR investments, which generate new knowledge, improve healthcare, and \nprotect the environment, will actually shrink.\n  This failure to adequately invest in America's research portfolio is \ntaking a toll on the work of America's scientists, and it will affect \nthe lives of all Americans. In my home State of South Dakota, the Earth \nResearch Observation System does work that helps us become more \nresponsible stewards of the environment, while increasing the yields of \nfarmers all over the world. But this research is being endangered \nbecause of the administration's severe budget cuts.\n  You don't need to be a rocket scientist to figure out why funding is \nbeing cut for nearly all nondefense basic-science and technology \nprograms. These vital investments in America's future are being cut to \nprovide enormous tax breaks for large corporations and the wealthy \nelite. This is short-sighted, and it is dangerous. The President's own \nscience advisors warn that Federal support for physical sciences and \nengineering is dropping, while U.S. student enrollment in those \ndisciplines also continues to fall. Reversing these trends is crucial \nto our Nation's future.\n  We are on the verge of a new industrial world order. Already, almost \nany service that can be delivered in bits and bytes and does not \nrequire face-to-face interaction with customers is up for grabs. The \nbig winners in the intense global struggle for economic predominance \nwill not be those who simply produce products cheaper and faster than \ntheir competition. The big winners will be those countries that nurture \nthe talent, discover the techniques, and invent the tools so advanced \nthere is no competition.\n  Unfortunately, measured in terms of the number of scientific \npublications, science is growing faster in the European Union than in \nthe U.S., according to 15 key indicators related to human resources, \ninvestment, and scientific productivity. This ought to raise red flags \nfor all of us. Economic growth follows scientific discovery, and if \nAmerica falls behind in science, the fallout will ripple throughout our \neconomy, dragging down productivity and slowing job creation.\n  The administration's disregard for science extends beyond budgetary \nchoices. Just last month, the Union of Concerned Scientists released a \nreport charging that the White House has systematically undermined the \nspirit of objective science. The report states that the Bush \nadministration ``has suppressed or distorted the scientific analyses of \nfederal agencies to bring these results in line with administration \npolicy.''\n  Time and again, the administration is choosing politics over rational \nscience.\n  South Dakotans know what this is like. The Missouri River is part of \nthe cultural and economic heart of our State. In recent years, a broad \nscientific consensus has developed that mismanagement by the Army Corps \nof Engineers is harming the Missouri River, and that the flow of the \nriver should be restored to a more natural state to protect the ecology \nand habitat of endangered species. Just last year, an analysis by the \ntop scientists at the administration's Fish and Wildlife Service \nconfirmed this consensus. And yet the administration set aside the \nscientists' report, replaced the scientists with another panel more to \nits liking, and today continues to fight court orders requiring more \nresponsible stewardship.\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch recently ran an editorial saying, ``As \npurges go, this one has Stalinesque subtlety.'' And that is from a \nleading newspaper in the area that supposedly would benefit \neconomically from the Corps' decision.\n  The White House's 2001 report on global warming is another troubling \ncase study in the politicization of science. When the science pointed \nto the fact that fossil fuel production and consumption contributes to \nglobal warming, the White House deleted that finding from the report. \nIn its place, they inserted a reference to an opposing study that was \nfinanced by the American Petroleum Institute. Whenever the \nadministration has had the opportunity, it has stacked the deck by \nstaffing research boards and advisory councils with researchers who \nhave shown allegiance to the White House's political goals.\n  Just last week, the President dismissed two advisers from his Council \non Bioethics because of their positions on stem cell research. And last \nmonth, HHS Secretary Tommy Thompson admitted that his agency had made a \nmistake in altering the conclusions of scientists who found significant \nand pervasive racial disparities in health care in the United States. I \nam pleased that this ``mistake'' has been rectified, but concerned that \nit only happened after an investigation uncovered that the Department \nhad altered scientific conclusions in order to downplay the problem of \nunequal health care for minorities.\n  This is not real science. This is ``vending machine science.'' The \nadministration thinks it can pull a lever and get the results it wants. \nFor the sake of short-term political gain, the administration is basing \nits decisions on weak science. As a result, it is putting at risk \nAmerica's economic strength, our future prosperity, and our health and \nsafety.\n  That is why increasing numbers of leaders in government, industry, \nand academia--all concerned about sustaining U.S. leadership across the \nfrontiers of scientific knowledge--are beginning to question whether \nthe United States is starting to lose its edge in basic scientific \nresearch. They worry that the Bush administration, by undercutting \nscientific research in key areas, has lost sight of the importance of \nlong-term investments that help create the necessary conditions for \nprosperity. They worry that this failure of intellectual leadership \nwill erode the high standing American science has achieved in the past \nhalf-century.\n  Their apprehension is well justified.\n  The pace of scientific discovery is quickening. Research is more \nimportant to the day-to-day lives of Americans than ever before. \nCutting back on research at the dawn of this new century would be like \ncutting our defense budget at the height of World War II. Leadership \nacross the frontiers of scientific knowledge is not merely a cultural \ntradition of our Nation; today, it is an economic and security \nimperative.\n  We must ensure that America remains at the epicenter of the ongoing \nrevolution in scientific research and technological innovation that \ngenerates new knowledge, creates new jobs, and builds new industries. \nBy sustaining our investments in fundamental research, we can ensure \nthat America remains at the forefront of scientific capability, thereby \nenhancing our ability to shape and improve our Nation's future and the \nworld's future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2701-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2701-S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DETENTION OF ENEMY COMBATANTS IN THE WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as elected representatives of the American \npeople, Senators seek to ensure that the U.S. Government protects the \nAmerican people from international terrorism. We seek also to ensure \nthat the cherished liberties of the American people are preserved, and \nto keep the people as fully informed as possible, as we fight the war \non terror.\n  On February 24, 2004, the Counsel to the President of the United \nStates, former Texas Supreme Court Judge Alberto R. Gonzales, addressed \nthe Standing Committee on Law and National Security of the American Bar \nAssociation. Judge Gonzales discussed the legal basis for detention of \nenemy combatants in the war on terror, including U.S. citizens Yaser \nHamdi and Jose Padilla. His address set forth details of the \ndecisionmaking steps that\n\n[[Page S2702]]\n\nresulted in the detention of Messrs. Hamdi and Padilla as enemy \ncombatants. The U.S. Supreme Court has accepted the cases of Messrs. \nHamdi and Padilla for review during its current term.\n  So that all my colleagues and the American public may be informed on \nthis important matter, I ask unanimous consent that the address by \nJudge Gonzales be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Remarks by Alberto R. Gonzales, Counsel to the President\n\n\n   AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION, STANDING COMMITTEE ON LAW AND NATIONAL \n                                SECURITY\n\n       In 1862, President Abraham Lincoln composed a letter to \n     Eliza P. Gurney in which the President considered how God \n     could allow the horrors of the Civil War to occur. In his \n     correspondence, our 16th President wrote:\n       ``We must believe He permits it [this war] for some purpose \n     of his own, mysterious and unknown to us; and though with our \n     limited understanding we may not be able to comprehend it, \n     yet we cannot but believe, that he who made the world still \n     governs it.''\n       Lincoln's faith would not permit him to doubt that the \n     specter of American sons killing American sons was \n     providential. Many Americans surely had similar thoughts \n     about God's plan as we watched American Airlines Flight 11, \n     and then United Airlines Flight 175, slam into the Twin \n     Towers of the World Trade Center on the morning of September \n     11th. On that day, America was subjected to a brutal and \n     treacherous attack by an enemy that had declared war on our \n     society.\n       Whether consciously or not, we all realized on September \n     11th that some things would never be the same. We all \n     realized that the country now faced an unprecedented threat \n     that, in ways yet to be known, would alter the way we live \n     our lives and would alter the way the government goes about \n     protecting American lives. Over time, some of the ways \n     September 11th has changed our lives have become routine--\n     such as the longer security screenings we all now build into \n     plans when we are going to the airport. In part because these \n     changes have become routine, and particularly because there \n     have been, thankfully, no subsequent attacks on American \n     soil, some may be tempted to become complacent, and may no \n     longer be concerned about future acts of terrorism.\n       But we should make no mistake about it: Despite our \n     successes in capturing many al Qaeda leaders, in destroying \n     their base of operations in Afghanistan, and in preventing \n     domestic attacks, the threat posed by al Qaeda is still very \n     real. Al Qaeda is a fluid, adaptable, and resourceful enemy \n     that continues actively to plan attacks both against American \n     interests and our allies abroad and against targets within \n     the United States. As you all know from the period of the \n     heightened threat level that we all experienced around the \n     holidays, we continue to get specific intelligence about \n     planned al Qaeda attacks. We know from their previous \n     practices that members of al Qaeda are very patient, willing \n     to spend years to plan, train for, and then execute an \n     attack. It would be foolish for anyone now to declare that, \n     given two-plus years free from attacks within the U.S., the \n     domestic phase of the conflict with al Qaeda is somehow \n     ``over.'' I can assure you that no one in the Government is \n     complacent about the threat posed by al Qaeda.\n       In response to this ongoing threat, President Bush, like \n     other Presidents during times of war, has taken strong, \n     sometimes difficult, action to protect American lives and \n     preserve the long-term survival of this country.\n       A few people--probably some in this audience--are \n     uncomfortable with the balance struck by this Administration \n     between protecting our country and preserving our freedoms. \n     They are uneasy with the idea of applying the law of war to \n     the enemy combatants waging war against this country, \n     including enemy combatants who are American citizens. Citing \n     the necessity of protecting our reputation in the \n     international community, our critics insist that these \n     combatants should receive the benefit of the rules and \n     procedures of our criminal justice system, those tried and \n     true methods that we use to deal with criminals such as car \n     thieves and drug dealers. They demand that our judges--even \n     though untrained in executing war plans--have a \n     substantive role in the war decisions of the Commander-in-\n     Chief.\n       In spite of the massive and horrific loss of life on \n     September 11th, the skeptics assert it is obvious that \n     America is not at war, much less engaged in warfare on \n     American soil. In their view, it is obvious that every \n     American citizen--even a citizen who, as a member of a \n     terrorist group, wages war against our sons and daughters--is \n     entitled to be] dealt with solely according to the rules and \n     presumptions of the criminal justice system, including the \n     right to counsel, the right to remain silent, and the general \n     right to judicial supervision of their detention. It is \n     obvious, they say, that foreign fighters, captured overseas \n     and detained by our military outside the United States, have \n     a right to challenge, in our civilian courts, the scope and \n     terms of their detention.\n       Respectively, these propositions are not at all obvious as \n     a matter of law; to the contrary, they lack any valid \n     foundation in domestic or international law. The \n     Administration's detractors fundamentally misunderstand the \n     nature of the threat this country is facing. America \n     confronts a lethal but unfamiliar enemy, sometimes hidden \n     here in our neighborhoods, waiting to hurt innocent people. \n     Our enemies are not constrained by civilian authority or by \n     any government. Nor are they inhibited by ordinary human \n     concerns for their own safety or lives. Some are fanatics who \n     believe their greatest power can lie precisely in their \n     disregard for human life and their willingness to resort to \n     indiscriminate violence, as we witness nearly every day in \n     bombings and shootings around the world. They do not love \n     liberty, they do not respect law, they do not cherish life.\n       Certain propositions are, in my view, clear. First, the \n     brutal attacks of September 11th--which killed nearly three \n     thousand people from more than ninety countries--were not \n     only crimes but acts of war. Since at least that day, the \n     United States has been at war with al Qaeda. While al Qaeda \n     may not be the traditional armed force of a single nation \n     state, al Qaeda is clearly a foreign enemy force. It has \n     central direction, training, and financing and has members in \n     dozens of countries around the world who are committed to \n     taking up arms against us. It has political goals in mind. Al \n     Qaeda has attacked not only one of our largest cities, \n     killing thousands of civilians, but also has attacked our \n     embassies, our warships, and our government buildings. While \n     different in some respects from traditional conflicts with \n     nation states, our conflict with al Qaeda is clearly a war.\n       As a practical matter, this state of war is not in \n     dispute--not by the United Nations Security Council, which \n     passed a resolution in response to the September 11th attacks \n     recognizing the right of states to act in self-defense; not \n     by members of NATO, or the Rio or ANZUS treaties, all of \n     which unanimously invoked their treaty clauses regarding \n     collective defense from armed attack; and not by the United \n     States Congress, which acted to support the President's use \n     of all necessary and appropriate military force against al \n     Qaeda.\n       Second, the President is determined to win this war and has \n     directed that all instruments of national power be directed \n     to this new type of enemy. Because the threat is not only \n     against our military abroad, but also against civilians here, \n     the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland \n     Security share responsibility with the Department of Defense \n     for the successful prosecution of this war. To suggest that \n     an al Qaeda member must be tried in a civilian court because \n     he happens to be an American citizen--or to suggest that \n     hundreds of individuals captured in battle in Afghanistan \n     should be extradited, given lawyers, and tried in civilian \n     courts--is to apply the wrong legal paradigm. The law \n     applicable in this context is the law of war--those \n     conventions and customs that govern armed conflicts.\n       Under these rules, captured enemy combatants, whether \n     soldiers or saboteurs, may be detained for the duration of \n     hostilities. They need not be ``guilty'' of anything; they \n     are detained simply by virtue of their status as enemy \n     combatants in war. This detention is not an act of punishment \n     but one of security and military necessity. It serves the \n     important purpose of preventing enemy combatants from \n     continuing their attacks. Thus, the terminology that many in \n     the press use to describe the situation of these combatants \n     is routinely filled with misplaced concepts. To state \n     repeatedly that detainees are being ``held without charge'' \n     mistakenly assumes that charges are somehow necessary or \n     appropriate. But nothing in the law of war has ever required \n     a country to charge enemy combatants with crimes, provide \n     them access to counsel, or allow them to challenge their \n     detention in court--and states in prior wars have generally \n     not done so.\n       It is understandable, perhaps, that some people, especially \n     lawyers, should want to afford the many due process \n     protections that we have grown accustomed to in our criminal \n     justice system to the individuals captured in our conflict \n     with al Qaeda. It has been many years, fortunately, since the \n     United States has been in a conflict that spans the globe, \n     where enemy combatants have been captured attempting to \n     attack our homeland. But the fact that we have not had \n     occasion to apply the well-established laws of war does not \n     mean that they should be discarded. The United States must \n     use every tool and weapon--including the advantages presented \n     by the laws of war--to win the war against al Qaeda.\n       Within this framework, today I would like to discuss what \n     some may consider the most controversial of the President's \n     actions, namely the detention of American citizens as enemy \n     combatants, wherever those persons may have been seized, and \n     more specifically the determination that a person--\n     particularly an American citizen--captured in the United \n     State is an enemy combatant. As you know, we have detained \n     two American citizens as enemy combatants.\n       The first, Yaser Hamdi, is a Saudi national who was a part \n     of Taliban military unit that surrended to Northern Alliance \n     forces in a battle near Konduz, Afghanistan in late 2001. He \n     was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle when he surrendered. He \n     has admitted that he went to Afghanistan to train with and \n     fight for the Taliban. Following his capture, a U.S. military \n     screening team confirmed\n\n[[Page S2703]]\n\n     that Hamdi indeed met the criteria for enemy combatants over \n     whom the U.S. forces were taking control. Afterwards, \n     military authorities learned of records indicating that \n     Hamdi, although a Saudi national, had been born in Louisiana. \n     He was transferred to a naval brig in the United States where \n     he remains detained.\n       The second, Jose Padilla, also an American citizen, was \n     among those who sought to bring terror to our soil. Padilla \n     has served time in the U.S. for murder and for a handgun \n     charge. In 1998, following his release from prison, he moved \n     to Egypt, where he took the name Abdullah Al Muhajir. In 2001 \n     and 2002, Al Muhajir, or Padilla, met with al Qaeda officials \n     and senior operatives, and proposed to conduct terrorist \n     operations within the United States--includinga plan to \n     detonate a dirty bomb--as well as the detonation of explosive \n     devices in hotel rooms and gas stations. Padilla received \n     training from al Qaeda operatives, and was directed by al \n     Qaeda members to return to the United States to explore and \n     advance plans for further attacks against the United States. \n     Multiple intelligence source separately confirmed Padilla's \n     involvement in planning terrorist attacks by al Qaeda against \n     United States citizens and interests. Like Hamdi, Padilla \n     has been detained in a naval brig in the United States.\n       The President's legal authority to detain American citizens \n     as enemy combatants is, in my view, clear. The practice of \n     capturing and detaining those engaged in hostilities is as \n     old as war itself, and is ingrained in this Nation's military \n     history. The detention of enemy combatants serves two vital \n     objectives in the global war on terror: preventing killers \n     from rejoining the enemy and continuing to fight, and \n     enabling the collection of intelligence about the enemy. The \n     Supreme Court's 1942 decision in Ex parte Quirin acknowledged \n     that the President's war powers include the authority to \n     capture and detain enemy combatants at least for the duration \n     of a conflict, and authority that was well-settled by the \n     time of that decision. More to the point with respect to \n     Hamdi and Padilla, the Supreme Court has made clear that this \n     power extends to enemy combatants who are United States \n     citizens. As the Court observed in Quirin, in which one of \n     the detained Nazi saboteurs was a United States citizen: \n     ``citizenship in the United States of an enemy belligerent \n     does not relieve him from the consequences of a belligerency \n     which is unlawful.''\n       The course of action that we have taken with respect to Mr. \n     Hamdi and Mr. Padilla--and the arguments that we have made in \n     defending those actions in the courts--draw upon these well-\n     established precedents. The Executive's determination that an \n     individual is an enemy combatant is a quintessentially \n     military judgment--indeed, deciding who is the enemy is in \n     many senses the fundamental, threshold decision that the \n     Commander-in-Chief makes, the decision from which all other \n     military decisions flow. Accordingly, the traditional \n     deference owed by courts to military judgments is at its \n     broadest with respect to the President's determination that \n     an individual is an enemy combatant. While courts may review \n     (by habeas corpus) the Executive's determination that an \n     American citizen (whether captured abroad or on U.S. soil) is \n     an enemy combatant, that review must be deferential. \n     Specifically, in view of the great deference owed to the \n     President's enemy combatant determinations and the serious \n     separation-of-powers concerns that would attend any searching \n     judicial inquiry into the factual underpinnings of the \n     President's judgment, a factual review of the President's \n     determination can extend no further than ensuring that it has \n     evidentiary support. That framework focuses exclusively on \n     the factual support presented by the Executive and entails \n     confirming the existence of some evidence supporting its \n     determination that the individual is an enemy combatant.\n       The Government's record in the courts on the scope of the \n     President's authority, as you probably know, has been mixed. \n     The Fourth Circuit in Hamdi agreed that the President may \n     detain enemy combatants, including American citizens, and \n     further agreed that judicial review should be highly \n     deferential. The Court reasoned that the designation of Hamdi \n     as an enemy combatant bears the closest imaginable connection \n     to the President's constitutional responsibility during the \n     actual conduct of hostilities, and that while judicial review \n     does not disappear during wartime, the review of battlefield \n     capture in overseas conflicts is a highly deferential one.\n       Applying this deference to the facts of the case, the \n     Fourth Circuit concluded that--despite his status as an \n     American citizen currently detained on American soil--Hamdi \n     is not entitled to challenge the facts presented by the \n     United States. The Court held that where as here, a \n     petitioner has been designated as an enemy combatant and it \n     is undisputed that he was captured in a zone of activity \n     combat operations abroad, further judicial inquiry is \n     unwarranted when the government has responded to the petition \n     by setting forth factual assertions which would establish \n     a legally valid basis for the petitioner's detention.\n       The Second Circuit reached a different conclusion with \n     respect to Jose Padilla. There, a divided panel held that the \n     President does not have inherent authority under the \n     Constitution to detain as an enemy combatant an American \n     citizen seized within this country away from a zone of \n     combat. The Court also held that the President could detain \n     an American citizen only with the express authorization of \n     Congress, and that the Congressional resolution to use force \n     against members of al Qaeda did not give such authorization.\n       You will not be surprised to learn that we found the Fourth \n     Circuit decision to be brilliant, and the panel's reasoning \n     incisive and unimpeachable. We found the decision by the \n     Second Circuit panel on the other hand, to be less brilliant, \n     less supportable by the facts, and contrary to legal \n     precedent.\n       I am constrained by my time this morning from elaborating \n     further on our legal arguments in both cases. In any event, \n     they are a matter of public record and have been fully set \n     out in our briefs. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in \n     both the Padilla and Hamdi cases this spring. We are hopeful \n     that the Court will agree with the government's position in \n     each case.\n       What I would like to turn to is something that has not been \n     made a matter of public record. Until today, the Government \n     has been reticent about discussing in any detail the \n     decision-making steps that may result in an American citizen \n     being designated as an enemy combatant or how an American \n     detainee held in the United States may be provided access to \n     counsel.\n       As a result, while we have set forth our legal authorities \n     clearly in legal briefs, in the debate over the fairness and \n     prudence of the Government's actions in the war on terror, \n     the voice of the Government has remained essentially unheard. \n     Our silence has been largely for reasons of national \n     security. The deliberations that underpin any decision that a \n     person already within the United States is, in reality, an \n     enemy combatant, invariably include extraordinarily sensitive \n     intelligence information that we are loathe to reveal for \n     fear that it may jeopardize the future capture of enemy \n     combatants and future prevention of terrorist attacks. We \n     realize that our relative silence on this issue has come at a \n     cost. Many people have characterized--mischaracterized, in \n     our view--our actions in the war on terrorism as inconsistent \n     with the rule of law. Indeed, because of our silence, many \n     critics have assumed the worst. They have assumed that there \n     is little or no analysis--legal or otherwise--behind the \n     decision to detain a particular person as an enemy combatant. \n     To them, the decision making process is a black box that \n     raises the specter of arbitrary action.\n       While some of these criticisms are understandable, they are \n     wrong. With two years of experience, we now believe that our \n     concerns for national security can be accommodated with a \n     greater public disclosure of the steps we have taken behind \n     the public actions you already know about. And so today, we \n     will begin to take a more active role in the debate about the \n     fairness of our acts of detention of U.S. citizen enemy \n     combatants. This discussion builds on Secretary Rumsfeld's \n     speech eleven days ago in Miami, where he revealed the review \n     mechanisms that had long been in place with respect to \n     detentions of non-U.S. citizen enemy combatants being held at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Today I am going to explain the \n     decision-making that led to our enemy combatant \n     determinations with respect to U.S. citizens.\n       Yaser Hamdi, in my view, presents a relatively easy case. \n     Hamdi was seized in a combat zone in Afghanistan. He was \n     armed with an AK-47 when his Taliban unit surrendered to \n     Northern Alliance forces. The Northern Alliance subsequently \n     made him available for an interview by U.S. military \n     personnel. A U.S. military screening team confirmed that \n     Hamdi met the criteria for enemy combatants over whom the \n     United States was taking control, and Hamdi was transferred \n     to U.S. control. In such a situation in a foreign zone of \n     combat, that determination was quite properly made by \n     military personnel on the ground. These facts and other \n     details relating to the circumstances of Hamdi's case were \n     memorialized in a declaration, the so-called Mobbs \n     declaration, which was made available for review by the \n     courts in connection with Hamdi's habeas petition.\n       As for enemy combatants who are American citizens and are \n     captured here in the U.S., as a matter of prudence and policy \n     the decision-making steps we have employed have been far more \n     elaborate. They have included a thoughtful, deliberate and \n     thorough analysis of the relevant facts and law at many \n     levels of the Executive branch. In the one case in which the \n     President has exercised his authority as Commander-in-Chief \n     to detain a U.S. citizen in the United States as an enemy \n     combatant, we have employed a thorough--indeed, painstaking--\n     mechanism to ensure multiple layers of scrutiny before even \n     proposing any action to the President.\n       What follows is a general description of the mechanism that \n     was employed before the President exercised this presidential \n     power. I should caution, however, that there is no rigid \n     process for making such determinations--and certainly no \n     particular mechanism required by law. Rather, these are the \n     steps that we have taken in our discretion to ensure a \n     thoroughly vetted and reasoned exercise of presidential \n     power.\n       In any case where it appears that a U.S. citizen captured \n     within the United States may be an al Qaeda operative and \n     thus may qualify as an enemy combatant, information on the \n     individual is developed and numerous options are considered \n     by the various relevant agencies (the Department of Defense, \n     CIA and DOJ), including the potential for a\n\n[[Page S2704]]\n\n     criminal prosecution, detention as a material witness, and \n     detention as an enemy combatant. Options often are narrowed \n     by the type of information available, and the best course of \n     action in a given case may be influenced by numerous factors \n     including the assessment of the individual's threat potential \n     and value as a possible intelligence source. This explains \n     why persons captured in the U.S. may be processed differently \n     depending on the totality of the circumstances the particular \n     case presents.\n       For example, we could have abundant information indicating \n     that the individual has committed a crime--such as material \n     support for terrorism--but the information may come solely \n     from an extremely sensitive and valuable intelligence source. \n     To use that information in a criminal prosecution would mean \n     compromising that intelligence source and potentially putting \n     more American lives at risk. Those are the sort of \n     considerations that have to be weighed in deciding how we \n     proceed against a particular individual in any given case.\n       When it appears that criminal prosecution and detention as \n     a material witness are, on balance, less-than-ideal options \n     as long-term solutions to the situation, we may initiate some \n     type of informal process to present to the appropriate \n     decision makers the question whether an individual might \n     qualify for designation as an enemy combatant. But even this \n     work is not actually commenced unless the Office of Legal \n     Counsel at the Department of Justice has tentatively advised, \n     based on oral briefings, that the individual meets the legal \n     standard for enemy combatant status. That standard was \n     articulated by the Supreme Court in Quirin, where the Court \n     made clear that, at a minimum, ``citizens who associate \n     themselves with the military arm of the enemy government, \n     and with its aid, guidance, and direction enter this \n     country bent on hostile acts are enemy belligerents within \n     the meaning of . . . the law of war,'' and thus may be \n     detained. The important factor, therefore, is that the \n     person has become a member or associated himself with \n     hostile enemy forces, thereby attaining the status of \n     enemy combatant.\n       It is worth noting, I think, that on more than one occasion \n     OLC has advised that the facts relating to a certain \n     individual did not support an enemy combatant determination, \n     or were so close to the line as to present a very doubtful \n     case. In those cases the United States did not proceed \n     further in the process of determining whether to designate \n     the persons as enemy combatants, but rather pursued \n     different, legally available options for addressing the \n     threat. In a very real sense, the Executive branch in these \n     cases declined to take a particular action against suspected \n     terrorists because it concluded that the action was not \n     clearly legally supportable.\n       Once initial assessments indicate that an enemy combatant \n     designation may be the best legally available way to deal \n     with a particular U.S. citizen, we have proceeded to take the \n     following steps to assist the President in making a final \n     decision.\n       First, the Director of Central Intelligence makes a written \n     assessment of all available CIA intelligence information \n     concerning the individual and transmits a recommendation and \n     request to DoD recommending that the person be taken into \n     custody as an enemy combatant.\n       The Secretary of Defense then makes his own independent \n     evaluation, based upon the information provided by the CIA \n     and other intelligence information developed within DoD. That \n     evaluation is embodied in a written assessment concerning \n     enemy combatant status.\n       The Secretary's assessment is provided to the Attorney \n     General with a request for the Attorney General's opinion \n     concerning: (1) whether the assessment comports with \n     applicable law; (2) whether the individual may lawfully be \n     taken into custody by the Department of Defense; and (3) \n     whether the Attorney General recommends as a matter of policy \n     that that course be pursued. This ensures that DOJ can \n     formally provide input on the law-enforcement equities \n     related to the individual. DoD's request to the Attorney \n     General includes the intelligence information from both the \n     CIA and DoD.\n       In addition to the materials forwarded by the DoD, the \n     Attorney General relies on two documents in responding to \n     DoD's request: the first is a memorandum from the Criminal \n     Division setting out all the information available to it from \n     the FBI and other sources concerning the individual; and the \n     second is a formal legal opinion from OLC analyzing whether \n     the individual meets the legal standard to be held as an \n     enemy combatant--the Quirin standard I just discussed.\n       Following his review, the Attorney General forwards a \n     letter with his legal advice and recommendations back to DoD, \n     along with the Criminal Division fact memo and the OLC \n     opinion.\n       The Secretary of Defense then transmits a package of \n     information to the President, recommending that the President \n     designate the individual as an enemy combatant. The package \n     of information recommending the enemy combatant designation \n     includes six items: (i) the written assessment and \n     recommendations of the CIA; (ii) the recommendation and \n     preliminary assessment by the Secretary of Defense; (iii) the \n     DoD intelligence information; (iv) the Attorney General's \n     letter to DoD, including his legal opinion and \n     recommendation; (v) the Criminal Division's fact memo; and \n     (vi) the OLC opinion.\n       Lawyers at the White House review the DoD package and \n     recommendations, and the Counsel to the President forwards it \n     to the President along with his written recommendations to \n     the President.\n       Finally, the President reviews the DoD package and is \n     briefed by his Counsel. If the President concludes that the \n     person is an enemy combatant, the President signs an order to \n     that effect directing the Secretary of Defense to take him \n     into his control. In the case of Padilla, the President \n     concluded that Padilla ``is, and at the time he entered the \n     United States in May 2002 was, an enemy combatant.'' The \n     President also determined that he ``possesses intelligence, \n     including intelligence about personnel and activities of al \n     Qaeda that, if communicated to the U.S., would aid U.S. \n     efforts to prevent attacks by al Qaeda.''\n       As you can see executive branch decision making is not \n     haphazard, but elaborate and careful. And although these \n     specific steps are not required by law, we have followed them \n     in our discretion, in order to make sure that--in this \n     context as in all others--the President's Commander-in-Chief \n     authority is exercised in a reasoned and deliberate manner.\n       In part because of the reluctance that I spoke about \n     earlier to articulate our position and procedures, there \n     appears to be some confusion about whether the Government is \n     willing to permit American enemy combatants access to our \n     courts to challenge their detention. The reality, of course, \n     is that they do have such access: the detentions of Hamdi and \n     Padilla have been challenged in the courts and indeed are \n     slated for review by the Supreme Court this Spring. And, of \n     course, from the outset, those challenges on Hamdi's and \n     Padilla's behalf have been pursued by qualified counsel.\n       But can there be meaningful access to our courts and a \n     meaningful right to file a habeas challenge without direct \n     access to counsel? To the average American, this may appear \n     to be a legitimate question. But those who question the \n     government's position on access to counsel operate under a \n     fundamental misunderstanding of the legal nature of the \n     detention of virtually all of these terrorists.\n       It is the position of this Administration that, in the case \n     of citizens who take up arms against America, any interest \n     those individuals might have in obtaining the assistance of \n     counsel for the purpose of preparing a habeas petition must \n     give way to the national security needs of this country to \n     gather intelligence from captured enemy combatants. Although \n     the right to counsel is a fundamental part of our criminal \n     justice system, it is undeniably foreign to the law of war. \n     Imagine the burden on our ability to wage war if those trying \n     to kill our soldiers and civilians were given the opportunity \n     to ``lawyer up'' when they are captured. Respectfully, those \n     who urge the extension of the right to counsel to these \n     combatants, for the purpose of filing a habeas petition, \n     confuse the context of war with that of the criminal justice \n     system.\n       When we are at war, debriefing of enemy combatants is a \n     vital source of intelligence. But the stream of intelligence \n     would quickly dry up if the enemy combatant were allowed \n     contact with outsiders during the course of an ongoing \n     debriefing. The result would be the failure to uncover \n     information that could prevent attacks on our military and on \n     American citizens. This is an intolerable cost, and we do not \n     believe it is one required by the Constitution. For these \n     reasons, we have urged that interrogations of captured enemy \n     combatants should be allowed to proceed, as they historically \n     have, uninterrupted by access to counsel.\n       We have also recognized, however, that in every case we \n     need not maintain the most restrictive conditions on \n     detention that the law of war permits. Constraints imposed on \n     a particular U.S. citizen held as an enemy combatant should \n     be and are constantly re-evaluated as a matter of policy, to \n     make sure that the terms and conditions of confinement are \n     necessary to meet the needs of national security.\n       The Department of Defense employs a deliberate and thorough \n     procedure, as a matter of policy, when making this decision \n     about access to counsel. The stated policy of the \n     Department--which it detailed publicly last December--is to \n     permit any enemy combatant who is a United States citizen and \n     who is being detained by DoD in the United States access to \n     counsel: (1) after DoD has determined that such access will \n     not compromise the national security of the United States; \n     and (2) after DoD has completed intelligence collection from \n     that enemy combatant or after DoD has determined that such \n     access will not interfere with intelligence collection from \n     that enemy combatant.\n       The policy is initiated when DoD officials in charge of \n     interrogations make an initial determination that \n     intelligence collection is completed or that access to \n     counsel would not interfere with intelligence collection. \n     This determination is made after coordination with the \n     Department of Justice, including the FBI, and the CIA. DoD \n     officials prepare a memo for the Deputy Secretary of Defense \n     seeking authorization for access to counsel. That draft is \n     coordinated within DoD and with officials at the White House, \n     DOJ, and CIA.\n       Once this coordination is complete, and a consensus \n     reached, the memo is forwarded to the Deputy Secretary of \n     Defense for his consideration. The Deputy Secretary then \n     makes a final decision whether the two prongs of the DoD \n     access to counsel policy are satisfied.\n\n[[Page S2705]]\n\n       As you can see, the decision to provide counsel is made \n     after careful consideration of national security \n     implications. These decisions are guided by thorough legal \n     analysis at various levels of our government.\n       That is precisely the course we have followed both with \n     Yaser Hamdi and Jose Padilla. When officials at DoD \n     determined that intelligence collection from Hamdi was \n     complete, they announced last December that he would be \n     allowed access to a lawyer, subject to appropriate security \n     restrictions. Hamdi has now met with his lawyer. Earlier this \n     month DoD officials concluded that national security would \n     not be harmed by permitting Padilla to have access to \n     counsel, and he too will be given access to a lawyer. As \n     these decisions show, we have an interest in restricting \n     access to counsel to the extent necessary to advance an \n     important intelligence-gathering interest. When that interest \n     no longer exists, we have no further need to restrict access \n     to counsel and will allow U.S. citizens that access to assist \n     in their challenge to their detention in the courts by means \n     of habeas corpus. We believe strongly that access to counsel \n     needs to occur at an appropriate time. What we will not do is \n     put American lives at risk and jeopardize intelligence-\n     gathering by recognizing a non-existent right for enemy \n     combatants to consult with lawyers.\n       I am pleased to have had the opportunity this morning to \n     provide you with some more details about the decisionmaking \n     process that we have followed in dealing with enemy \n     combatants who are U.S. citizens. The way in which this \n     Administration has made its decisions, in my judgment, \n     vividly illustrates the President's commitment to wage war \n     on terror aggressively and relentlessly while fully \n     respecting the bounds of the law.\n       Recent press accounts and editorials have suggested that \n     the Bush Administration--fearing losses in the courts--has \n     revised its approach to dealing with terrorists. As I hope my \n     remarks this morning have made clear, that is not the case. \n     The extensive procedures and safeguards that I have described \n     today are ones that we have followed from the outset in \n     determining whether certain individuals qualify as enemy \n     combatants. All along, the Administration's actions have been \n     uniformly grounded in historical practice and legal precedent \n     and have been based on careful and continuous consideration \n     of the facts and circumstances of each case. What is new is \n     our willingness to share more information about our \n     procedures, as Secretary Rumsfeld did two weeks ago in Miami \n     and as I am doing today. Our flexibility in this regard has \n     been constrained by the demands of national security. At this \n     point in time, however, we have decided that there are ways \n     that we can share some of this information, and that doing \n     so--as I have today--is both consistent with the demands of \n     national security and in furtherance of our interest in \n     showing the American people that their government is one that \n     respects the law even as it fights aggressively an enemy \n     dedicated to our destruction.\n       Because ours is a free society, the actions taken by the \n     Administration have been (and will continue to be) challenged \n     in the courts. These are important issues, and courts exist \n     to resolve such disputes. Our independent judiciary will help \n     determine how longstanding practice applies to the first \n     conflict of the 21st Century. It is possible that the courts \n     may disagree with a particular decision or policy; indeed, \n     the Second Circuit has already done so in Padilla (although \n     the Supreme Court will now be reviewing that case and \n     providing the final word on the issues presented). I am \n     confident in the legality of the measures the Administration \n     has employed in seeking to defend Americans from our enemies \n     in the war on terror--but in our system the courts will have \n     their say. What cannot be denied, however, is that in \n     protecting the American people from our terrorist enemies, \n     the Administration has carefully examined the Constitution \n     and laws of the United States, as applied in historically \n     analogous situations.\n       In closing, when I walk into the Oval Office to brief the \n     President, I am always reminded of the awesome responsibility \n     that the President has--and the corresponding duty on all of \n     us who serve him. But the burden of protecting this country \n     and of securing the rights embodied in our Constitution is \n     not ours alone.\n       Yes, those of us in government have a direct hand in \n     executing power under our Constitution. But American \n     citizens--including members of the bar--also play an \n     important role in protecting and defending the Constitution's \n     precious precepts. The vigilance and work of American \n     citizens in this endeavor arguably is no less patriotic than \n     the actions of our soldiers on the battlefield--both are in \n     defense of our freedoms . . . and both should be respected.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2705-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN MEMORY OF GOVERNOR BOB ORR\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a tremendous \nHoosier and dear friend Bob Orr, who has recently passed away.\n  Bob Orr was our Governor during 8 years of record growth in Indiana \njobs, Indiana exports, and increased interest in public education. As a \nscholar, businessman, political leader, State legislator, and \nLieutenant Governor, he was superbly qualified to be the 45th Governor \nof Indiana. His extraordinary success brought new idealism, energy, and \npride to the Hoosier State.\n  I was privileged to share a myriad of wonderful experiences with Bob \nOrr during the past 40 years of our work together in public service, \nbut two will be indelible in my memories. In June of l989, Bob was \nnominated by President George H. W. Bush to be United States Ambassador \nto Singapore. He proceeded to his post after a hearing by the U.S. \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee and confirmation by the U.S. Senate. \nShortly thereafter, Char and I visited Ambassador Orr in Singapore. We \nwere thrilled by his vision of the great opportunities our country \ncould enjoy if we utilized our collective imagination and inventive \ngenius to expand exports and to provide constructive economic and \npolitical leadership in Asia. Bob Orr was tireless in leading Indiana \nand the United States to have an international perspective and a clear \nvision of how our business and educational opportunities could flourish \nif we sought to compete more effectively.\n  My second indelible memory is my last visit with Bob and Mary Kay Orr \nlast September at a dinner in Indianapolis featuring an address by \nPresident George W. Bush. It was exciting to compare political notes \nwith both of them and to catch up on family news. I had the privilege \nof once again introducing a great Governor, world statesman, and very \ndear friend. I had introduced, nominated, and spoken about Bob Orr \ninnumerable times, but the last time I had the honor to do so was very \nspecial. The assembled crowd rose in cheers and sustained applause. \nStrongly assisted by Mary Kay, Governor Orr arose, a living legend for \na legion of Hoosiers inspired by his life of achievement and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2705-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       EXPRESSING SYMPATHY FOR THE VICTIMS OF THE MADRID BOMBINGS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, \nI want to express my deep concern about recent developments in Iran.\n  Today, the International Atomic Energy Agency is meeting to discuss a \nproper response to findings that Iran has failed to disclose many \nnuclear related activities in violation of the Non-Proliferation \nTreaty. This is a serious issue. There is no doubt that Iran is in \nviolation of its commitments under the NPT. The IAEA Board of Governors\n\n[[Page S2706]]\n\nmust insist that Iran come into complete compliance with its \nobligations, disclose all information about its nuclear program, and \nallow unrestricted access to IAEA inspectors. Given the high degree of \nenriched uranium found in Iran--weapons grade uranium--and yesterday's \nstatement from Iran indicating that it planned to resume enrichment, \nthis matter should immediately be referred to the United Nations \nSecurity Council for further action.\n  I am also deeply troubled by Iran's terribly flawed elections of \nFebruary 20. The people of Iran deserve our support and they deserve \ntrue democratic reform. We cannot turn our backs on the people of Iran \nbecause its political leadership has failed them. There are an \nestimated 700,000 Iranian Americans living in California who are so \nhopeful for democratic change in their homeland. The election of \nFebruary 20 was clearly a step in the wrong direction.\n  On February 12, the Senate passed an important resolution, S. Res. \n304, that was submitted that same day by Senator Brownback. Denouncing \nthe elections as harmful for true democratic forces in Iran, the \nresolution stated that the policy of the United States should be to \nadvocate a democratic government in Iran that will restore freedom to \nthe people of Iran, abandon terrorism, protect human rights, and live \nin peace and security with the international community. I fully agree.\n  I hope that the Iranian people know that they have the support of the \nSenate as they aspire for the freedom denied them by the current \nIranian regime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2706-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

I \n     represent a small portion of my country--the state of \n     Delaware, which is located between Washington and New York.\n       As you know, in America there are no Kings or Princes, no \n     Lords or Dukes, no Emirs or Sultans, Like you, we fought a \n     war against colonialism for our freedom. The central belief \n     in our system is that each individual should have an equal \n     opportunity to succeed.\n       At home, I am surrounded by very strong women. A mother who \n     instilled in her children the values of faith and community. \n     A sister who was better at her studies than I was, and upon \n     whose guidance our large family depends. A wife who is a \n     respected professor in our community, not just smart, but \n     also wise. And a daughter who knows she can be anything she \n     wants to be.\n       Like most of the nearly 300 million Americans whose \n     families arrived on our shores from every corner of the \n     globe, I was not born to wealth or stature. I was not \n     promised anything other than the opportunity granted to every \n     American--the opportunity to go as far as I could dream.\n       I am sure that Libyan parents share the same hope for their \n     children. I am sure it is a universal hope--but not one that \n     can be realized in many countries. That's one of the things \n     that makes my country special.\n       I have served in the United States Senate for 31 years, \n     elected democratically six times by the men and women of \n     Delaware. Men and women. Young and old. Black and white, \n     Hispanic and Asian. Christians, Jews, Hindus and yes, Arab-\n     Americans and Muslims. You may not know that there are almost \n     as many Muslims in the United States as there are citizens of \n     Libya. And there are more Arab-Americans than all the people \n     who live in Tripoli. Their votes count the same as everyone \n     else.\n       I belong to the Democratic party. President Bush leads the \n     other major political party--the Republican party. But I am \n     here not as a representative of my party . . . not as a \n     representative of Christian-Americans . . . not as a \n     representative of white Americans. I am here as a \n     representative of my country who believes, along with many \n     other Americans, that this is a moment of great possibility \n     for Libya and for the relationship between our countries. But \n     many of us remain skeptical.\n       For too long, our relationship has been marked by \n     hostility. In fact, I have a personal connection to the \n     terrible act that set back our relations for years.\n       I am a graduate of Syracuse University Law School. There is \n     a wall at my school, erected to the memory of 270 people--\n     including 35 young students who never returned home from \n     their studies abroad. They lost their lives when Pan Am 103 \n     was bombed out of the sky. Thirty-five is a number, a \n     statistic. But each of those young people had a name. Each \n     had a mother and a father, a sister and brother, and friends \n     who loved them--and who still suffer their loss every single \n     day. The victims were young men and women like Ken Bissett. \n     He was an artist and a writer. Like Eric and Jason Coker, \n     twin brothers. Eric was studying economics. Jason wanted to \n     be a journalist. He might have been here today, reporting on \n     their significant event. And like a kind hearted young women \n     named Keesha Weedon who wanted to help troubled children. \n     Each of these young people had a past--and each had a future \n     cut short by violence. Imagine if one of them had been your \n     son or your daughter. Think about that for just a moment. \n     Your government's admission of responsibility for the bombing \n     of Pan Am 103 was not only necessary--it was the right thing \n     to do. And it was consistent with your traditions. In the \n     words of the Koran: ``As for him who shall repent and believe \n     and do right, he happily may be one of the successful.'' It \n     appears now that your government wants to change in order to \n     become ``one of the successful.''\n       Americans will never forget the past. But we cannot allow \n     it to stop us from building a more peaceful world that can \n     prevent such tragedies in the future. That must be the legacy \n     of those who lost their lives, and for those who carry their \n     memory. And so while American remain wary, we also stand \n     ready to walk with you if you are willing to take the \n     difficult steps necessary to rejoin the community of nations. \n     By accepting responsibility for the past . . . agreeing to \n     abandon its weapons of mass destruction program . . . and \n     joining the war on terrorism . . . your government is \n     beginning to end Libya's political and economic isolation. \n     But what I want to say to you today is this: do not stop \n     there. Aim higher. Go further.\n       For centuries, the people of Libya were denied the \n     opportunity to fulfill their God-given potential. First, you \n     were held back by outside colonizers. Then, you were led \n     astray by misguided ideologies. The result is a great gulf \n     between your rightful expectations and the reality of your \n     lives.\n       You are right to expect good schools for your children and \n     first rate doctors for your parents. You are right to expect \n     to own your home and to build your own business. You are \n     right to expect newspapers with competing ideas and an \n     internet connection in every home. You are right to expect \n     the freedom to speak your mind without fear of being thrown \n     in jail. So the question is: How do you make sure that \n     history does not repeat itself and that you are not denied \n     the opportunity to which you are entitled?\n       Your economic potential is extraordinary because of the \n     natural resources buried in the ground. But your national \n     potential is limitless, because of the human resources that \n     are spread all across this land.\n       You have tremendous oil power. But it will only be \n     meaningful if you use it to unleash the brain power of the \n     Libyan people--especially the awesome potential of your \n     youth. In fact, oil can be more of a burden than a benefit if \n     it used as an excuse not to develop all aspects of your \n     society . . . and if its proceeds are not widely shared and \n     wisely invested in education, training and a strong \n     foundation for the future.\n       Let me offer you a concrete example. It concerns patents--\n     the legal protection the world gives to new ideas and \n     inventions. They're a good measure of the quality of a \n     country's educational system, its entrepreneurship, its \n     innovation and its rule of law. Between 1980 and 1999, the \n     nine leading Arab economies--each built on oil wealth--\n     registered a mere 370 patents in my country. During that same \n     period, South Korea alone registered 16,328 patents. Why? In \n     the 21st century, human resources are the true\n\n[[Page S2707]]\n\n     wealth of any nation. You have a historic opportunity to free \n     those human resources to their full potential. I urge you to \n     seize it.\n       It may strike you as presumptuous that an American \n     politician is offering advice that you did not seek. After \n     all, my country has its own problems. Let me be clear: I have \n     not come here to impose American views on you or to suggest \n     we have all the answers. But I know that more than ever \n     before, your fate and our future are joined. There was a time \n     when the United States would have been satisfied with the \n     status quo in the Middle East, North Africa and here in \n     Libya. But the events of September 11, 2001 marked a turning \n     point in how my country views the world, and specifically how \n     it sees this region.\n       Americans now understand that the promise of our time is \n     matched by peril. Ideas and innovations can travel the planet \n     at the stroke of a computer key, spreading progress far and \n     wide. But the same technology and openness that power these \n     forces of construction also enable forces of destruction. As \n     a result, problems in any one part of our planet can plague \n     the entire world, including the United States. There is no \n     mountain high enough or ocean wide enough to protect us. The \n     question for America is what, if anything, can we do about \n     this new reality? Make no mistake: the United States will \n     meet and defeat any threat to the safety of our people and \n     the security of our country. We have the will and we have the \n     way to prevail.\n       But our physical prowess alone cannot solve the problem. We \n     are engaged in much more than a contest of force. We are \n     engaged in a war of ideas. I am convinced that war will be \n     won by those who offer hope, not hatred . . . progress, not \n     paralysis . . . a vision for the future, not an obsession \n     with the past.\n       Those who attacked us on September 11 were beyond the reach \n     of reason. Their blind hatred was not the bitter fruit of \n     poverty--they were relatively prosperous people. It was not \n     the product of Islam--they perverted a great faith. It was \n     not the result of American's support for Israel, as much as \n     you may disagree with it. Osama Bin Laden almost never \n     mentioned the Palestinian cause before attacks. His focus was \n     his own country, Saudi Arabia.\n       No, America's aggressors were foot soldiers in a new war \n     pitting believers in freedom, openness, and tolerance against \n     the forces of radical fundamentalism and regression. It is \n     not a clash between civilizations, but within civilizations--\n     especially within the Arab and Muslim worlds.\n       Today, violent radicals have turned their terror on us. But \n     make no mistake: they regard the large majority of moderate \n     Muslims as their enemies as well. Hundreds of Muslims were \n     among the more than 3000 dead in the World Trade Center and \n     the victims of attacks in Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Morocco. \n     And if the radicals succeed, you will be their victims in \n     another way as well, condemned to a future of hopelessness \n     and despair.\n       I believe that the cause of hope and the tide of history is \n     on the side of the moderates and modernizers--in this region, \n     in my region and around the world. Our challenge is to reject \n     their cynicism and hatred and to build an alliance of \n     tolerance and progress.\n       We each have a job to do. Our job--America's job--is first \n     and foremost to listen to you--to listen to your ideas, as \n     well as your fears and concerns. And to do a much better job \n     explaining our ideas and intentions.\n       But even if we do that well, human nature is the same world \n     wide. It is rare to feel good about your neighbor's new car \n     when you've just lost your job. America's military might, \n     economic power and cultural reach make us present in people's \n     lives on every continent, in every country. Sometimes we do \n     not recognize the conflicting emotions this can produce: \n     respect and admiration, but also envy, resentment and fear.\n       There will always be those who do not like specific \n     policies we advocate or the way we pursue them. That is your \n     right. The burden is on us to make our case . . . and to have \n     faith in our power to persuade, not just coerce. It may \n     surprise you that most Americans don't like the fact we're \n     the world's sole superpower. They understand it thrusts upon \n     them a responsibility they did not seek and would rather not \n     bear. For example, the people I represent in Delaware \n     understood but did not like the fact I voted to send their \n     sons and daughters to Kosovo. They went to Kosovo to prevent \n     the genocidal slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Muslim \n     men, women and children by Milosevic.\n       For better or worse, one result of our standing is that \n     people around the world think the U.S. is both the cause of, \n     and answer to, their concerns.\n       I am proud that America is, more often than not, the \n     solution rather than the problem. I am also proud of our \n     generosity. Like your tradition of Zakat, we feel a moral \n     obligation to share our good fortune. Every year, we send \n     tens of billions of dollars far from our shores to help the \n     impoverished . . . support economic development . . . combat \n     AIDS. We should do more. We already do a lot. But it is also \n     true that in the Middle East and North Africa, repressive \n     political systems and closed economies generate deep anger, \n     resentment, and extremism. I know that the United States has \n     seemed, at best, indifferent to the plight of the oppressed \n     and, at worst, complicit with corrupt and autocratic \n     regimes--despite our generosity.\n       In the past, we've justified that support in different \n     ways: the Cold War struggle against communism . . . the \n     preference for stability over chaos . . . the need to ensure \n     a steady supply of oil. the tragedy of 9-11 has taught \n     America the hard way that we cannot afford such policies. As \n     President Bush said recently: ``stability cannot be purchased \n     at the expense of liberty.''\n       Americans of all political persuasions agree that our \n     security requires us to more actively support your \n     aspirations to choose your own leaders . . . to express \n     your own opinions . . . to associate freely with others . \n     . . to worship in peace . . . to be treated with dignity. \n     In a word, our security requires us to more actively \n     support your desire for liberal democracy. That is the \n     right thing to do. And it is the surest path to realizing \n     your potential and your dreams. Democracy is first and \n     foremost about preventing the concentration of power into \n     the hands of the few . . . or the one. Elections are \n     necessary--but not enough. Democracy is about creating \n     individual rights and building independent institutions: \n     courts of law, political parties, a free press, \n     transparent government, property ownership, a private \n     sector, non-governmental organizations. It is about \n     schools that teach tolerance to your children, and teach \n     them to think for themselves. It is about making women \n     genuine partners in building a modern society.\n       Nothing about democracy is incompatible with Islam. For \n     example, since the days of the Prophet, the shura--a council \n     where community leaders gather to make decisions through \n     discussion--has been a Muslim concept.\n       I know many resist change because of the uncertainty it \n     brings. I understand the tension people feel between holding \n     on to traditions that are comfortable and embracing \n     modernity. In my own country, people contend with that \n     tension every day. For example, free trade means that \n     Americans have more choice and pay less for the many things \n     in our stores. But it also means American jobs are lost to \n     countries where people are willing to work for lower pay. \n     That has made millions of Americans--despite our prosperity--\n     angry and afraid.\n       So each of us, in different ways, has to contend with \n     powerful forces of change and the uncertainty they bring. \n     Every nation must find its own way. Let me share with you, in \n     all humility, the path my country has chosen and some lessons \n     we have learned.\n       Many see the economic, cultural and military power of the \n     United States. What they may not understand is that those \n     strengths flow from our democratic system, not the other way \n     around. They flow from the freedom we afford every American \n     to think, to question and to create. There are other paths to \n     prosperity. South Korea once enjoyed extraordinary growth \n     without democracy. Now, so does China. But I am convinced \n     that in the long run, the freedoms we enjoy are a tremendous \n     advantage in competing with other countries in the \n     information age.\n       Our strength also flows from the great diversity of our \n     people. More than two centuries ago, our founders recognized \n     that America's enduring mission would be ``to form a more \n     perfect union''. In other words, they understood the \n     challenge of forging a single nation from many different \n     parts. But they were confident that in working to overcome \n     our differences, Americans would constantly move forward.\n       They were right. My country was born in the midst of \n     slavery; we still struggle to overcome the legacy of racism. \n     But we can also say that African Americans have made great \n     strides and are making great contributions to our society.\n       The rights we enjoy and the institutions we built give \n     every American the power to shine a light on the mistakes we \n     make, and to demand that they be corrected. And the rules we \n     live by protect us from the excess of absolute power . . . \n     and have helped us build a country where each individual has \n     the opportunity, but not the guarantee, to achieve his or her \n     potential.\n       Please do not misunderstand me. I mean no disrespect. But \n     the nations of the Arab world could be doing so much more to \n     harness the enormous potential of their people.\n       Consider this: the combined gross domestic product of all \n     Arab countries in 1999 was less than that of a single \n     European country--Spain. Think about that for a moment. And \n     then think back a thousand years. Spain was part of a great \n     Arab empire which encompassed most of the Mediterranean and \n     the Middle East. Why did you thrive then? It was not your \n     armies alone. It was your ideas, your civilization, your \n     culture, your openness. Why has this one small territory--\n     then called Al Andalus, now called Spain--outpaced the rest \n     of the Arab world combined today?\n       Don't take the answer from me. Listen to the leading Arab \n     scholars who recently completed a remarkable study of Arab \n     Human Development, published by the United Nations. It speaks \n     to the need across the Arab world to make progress in three \n     critical areas: Empowering women, spreading knowledge, and \n     expanding freedom. This is an incredibly difficult \n     challenge--but also an extraordinary opportunity. 70% of your \n     population is below the age of 30. Unlocking their minds and \n     unleashing their talents can be a deep source of strength. \n     Bringing women into the work place will boost your economies \n     . . . just as women leaders past and present in Pakistan . . \n     . in Bangladesh . . . in Turkey . . . and in Indonesia \n     energized the Muslim world's politics. Giving your people\n\n[[Page S2708]]\n\n     access to the internet will connect them to a vast supply of \n     knowledge and power your progress.\n       The United States wants to help you seize these \n     opportunities in a spirit of cooperation. We are ready to \n     share our experiences . . . to make investments in your \n     economies . . . to welcome you into the international \n     community. We are prepared to build these partnerships \n     because it is in our interest.\n       It is up to you to take the necessary, important, \n     unavoidable risks. The choice is yours. You can merely \n     survive, with an economy that generates just enough wealth to \n     get by and a society that provides few freedoms and \n     opportunities.\n       Or you can thrive. I am convinced you can thrive. My \n     conviction follows from your history. At a time when \n     Europeans were barely emerging from the Dark Ages, the light \n     of civilization was shinning brightly in the Arab world. \n     Scholars outpaced their European counterparts in math, \n     science and other disciplines of modernity. Philosophers and \n     poets, architects and artists enlightened the world from \n     Cairo to Baghdad to Damascus to Granada.\n       I believe with all my heart that you can build a future as \n     glorious as your past. And I am convinced that my country has \n     a profound stake in your success.\n       Let me leave you with the words of a great Arab-American \n     poet, Gibran Khalil Gibran, that speak powerfully to this \n     time and this challenge: ``O land veiled to our sight from \n     ages past\n       Which way to you? Which path? How long? How wide? What \n     wasteland hems you in? What mountain range Enfolds your \n     realm? Which one of us the guide? Are you our hope? Or are \n     you a mirage? In hearts where none but fruitless quests \n     reside . . .\n       ``O source of knowledge where our forbears dwelt, Where \n     truth they worshiped, beauty was their creed; Uncharted \n     source, unknown, unreachable Whether by crested wave or \n     racing steed, Neither in East nor West can you be found, In \n     southern reaches nor in northern field, Not in the skies we \n     find you, nor the seas, Nor pathless deserts which beguile \n     our art; Deep in the soul you burst, like light, like fire, \n     You are within my chest, my pounding heart.''\n       Thank you for listening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2708-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CELEBRATING NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I look forward to the U.S. Senate passing this resolution \nand designating the week of March 14-20, 2004, as National Safe Place \nWeek. I would like to thank my colleague Senator Feinstein for her work \non this issue. I would also like to thank the other cosponsors of this \nresolution: Senator Campbell, Senator Boxer, Senator Fitzgerald, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Inhofe, Senator Feingold, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Johnson, Senator Lieberman, Senator Mikulski, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Kohl, Senator Lincoln, Senator Shelby, and Senator Murkowski. \nThis action will recognize the importance of Project Safe Place and \nsend a message that we will keep working to protect our children. In \ncountless hours of selfless work, volunteers truly do make a difference \nevery day, and in passing this resolution, the Senate will be \napplauding the tireless efforts of the thousands of dedicated \nvolunteers across the Nation for their many contributions to the youth \nof our Nation through Project Safe Place.\n  Mr. President, events of the day may turn our attention overseas, but \nit is essential to remember those who are fighting an ongoing battle \nright here at home. This battle has been raging for generations and \nconsists of fighting to protect this Nation's most valuable resource: \nour children. Young people are the future of this Nation; they need to \nbe both valued and protected. Sadly, however, as my colleagues know, \nthis precious resource is threatened daily.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to talk about a tremendous \ninitiative between the public and private sector that has been reaching \nout to youth for over twenty years. Project Safe Place is a program \nthat was developed to assist our Nation's youth and families in crisis. \nThis partnership creates a network of private businesses trained to \nrefer youth in need to the local service providers who can help them. \nThose businesses display a Safe Place sign so that people can easily \nrecognize a ``safe place'' for them to go to receive help.\n  The goal of National Safe Place Week is to recognize the thousands of \nindividuals who work to make Project Safe Place a reality. From trained \nvolunteers to seasoned professionals, these dedicated individuals are \nworking together with the resources in their local communities and \nthrough their ties across the Nation to serve young people. Because of \nProject Safe Place, this all happens under a well-known symbol of \nsafety for in-crisis youth.\n  Project Safe Place is a simple program to implement in any local \ncommunity, and it works. Young people are more likely to seek help in \nlocations that are familiar and non-threatening to them. By creating a \nnetwork of Safe Places across the Nation, all youth will have access to \nneeded help, counseling, or a safe place to stay. However, though the \nprogram has already been established in 42 States, there are still too \nmany communities that don't know about this valuable youth resource.\n  If your State does not already have a Safe Place organization, please \nconsider facilitating this worthwhile resource so that young people who \nare abused, neglected, or whose futures are jeopardized by physical or \nemotional trauma will have access to immediate help and safety in your \ncommunity.

Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to honor the service of Mr. Jerry Brewer of Flatwoods, KY. \nIt is wonderful to see him finally receiving the recognition for his \nservice that he has deserved for so long.\n  On March 6, 2004, Mr. Brewer finally received decorations for his \noutstanding service in combat that he performed while in the army in \nVietnam. A special thanks goes out to his daughter, Ms. Melissa \nAshworth, for her hard work in correcting this oversight.\n  Mr. Brewer served in Vietnam in 1969 and 1970 as a member of the \n478th Engineer Battalion of the 11th Infantry Brigade. He did receive a \nPurple Heart,\n\n[[Page S2709]]\n\nbut his other medals were unfortunately delayed for over three decades. \nHowever, last Saturday Mr. Brewer finally received the medals that he \nhad earned. He was awarded with the Bronze Star, another Purple Heart, \nthe Vietnam Service medal, the National Defense Service medal, the Good \nConduct medal, the Republic of Vietnam Campaign medal, the Vietnam \nCross of Gallantry, and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.\n  As one of the U.S. Senators from Kentucky, I know that Mr. Jerry \nBrewer served as a fine example of what it means to be true patriot and \nan American of the highest caliber. We must remember that the American \nway of life has been made possible by the bravery of men and women like \nMr. Brewer. When freedom has been challenged, many like him have \nanswered the call to arms. We must never forget that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2709-1", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        NATIONAL EYE DONOR MONTH\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the \nattention of my colleagues and all of our constituents across the \nNation that March is National Eye Donor Month. The first eye bank \nopened in 1944 and since then, over half a million Americans have \nreceived the gift of sight. Now, Americans throughout the country have \nthe power to help restore sight to thousands of people in need. Mrs. \nJeanne Bross, 65, can return to college in South Carolina with restored \nsight after receiving a corneal transplant in a Birmingham, AL \nhospital. This amazing turn in her life would not have been easy \nwithout someone giving the precious gift of sight.\n  The purpose of Eye Donor Month is to educate each and every American \nfamily to the opportunity to give the gift of sight and to make a \nterrific difference in someone's life. This month marks an opportunity \nto celebrate the gift of sight, to raise public awareness and to honor \npast donors and their families. The process to become a donor takes \njust minutes. All a donor needs to do is sign a donor card and most \nimportantly, discuss their donation wishes with their family.\n  Last year over 46,000 Americans had their sight restored through the \nmiracle of corneal transplantation. This year, thousands of Americans \nwill require a sight restoring cornea transplant due to the continual \nneed for cornea and tissue. Our eye banks across the Nation, along with \nthe Eye Bank Association of America, work to ensure that all of these \nAmericans will receive the tissue they need. It is also important to \nnote that there are ever changing strict standards, screening \nprocedures and accreditation programs in place to ensure that each of \nthe recipients receives safe tissue, achieving a success rate of over \n90 percent.\n  As National Eye Donor Month proceeds, I encourage my colleagues to \nwork with their local eye banks to increase public awareness of corneal \ntransplantation and the continuous need for donors. I appreciate the \nopportunity to highlight Eye Donor Month and again, encourage all \nAmericans to sign a donor card and speak with their families about \ntheir wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2709-2", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF MARC MIRINGOFF\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, every so often, someone comes \nalong and changes the way we look at things. Marc Miringoff was such a \nperson. We note his passing last week in New York at the age of 58.\n  Marc was a gifted social scientist who had the crucial insight that \nprogress ought not be measured in economic terms alone. Gross national \nproduct, gross domestic product, net foreign investment, balance of \npayments, net savings rates--all of these thrown together, properly \nweighted and critically analyzed could certainly tell us much about the \nstate of our economy. But Marc asked whether they would give us the \ntrue measure of our society. He concluded they did not.\n  In the 1980s, Marc sought to change that. He founded the Fordham \nInstitute for Innovation in Social Policy in 1985, where he worked to \ndevelop an index to measure the Nation's social health. The index \nconsisted of a number of measures that reflected the worlds of public \nhealth, education, the justice system, and violence. Marc burrowed \nbeneath the numbers to find the underlying, often invisible, structures \nof poverty that undermined economic progress.\n  I was privileged to know Marc. I benefited from his counsel and was \nchallenged by his insights. I know that Marc was no dry-as-dust \nacademic. He relished the political arena as much as he enriched the \nacademic forum. He was an evangelist for the concept of social health. \nHis eyes sparkled when an elected official got hooked on his ideas. He \nworked hard, bringing others along, encouraging them to look more \ndeeply at the fabric of American society and to work harder to make it \na richer, stronger fabric.\n  I will miss Marc. We all will miss him. Right now, the country needs \nmore people like him. I offer my condolences to his wife, Marque, and \nto his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2709-3", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    VOLUNTEERS OF AMERICA OF FLORIDA\n\n   Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, as ranking member on \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I rise to acknowledge an \nextraordinary charitable organization, which serves some of this \ncountry's most troubled and disadvantaged veterans. This organization \nis the Volunteers of America of Florida.\n  The Volunteers of America of Florida provides essential services to \nveterans such as supported employment, mental health care, job \nplacement, basic living skills training, housing programs, and social \nsupport groups. One of the unique outreach tools owned and operated by \nVolunteers of America of Florida is their Florida Veterans Mobile \nService Center. This is a specially designed 40-foot-long vehicle from \nwhich medical, dental, mental health, substance use and benefits \ncounseling services are provided. It is also used to distribute food \nand clothing to the homeless wherever they are located. The Mobile \nService Center is on the road 200 days per year and has traveled more \nthan 30,000 miles, serving over 40 counties in Florida to reach over \n3,000 homeless veterans per year. This includes outreach to rural \nencampments in areas such as the Florida Everglades, Ocala National \nForest, and the Barrier Islands off of the Keys.\n  The Mobile Service Center is funded through a unique partnership of \nGovernment, corporate and not-for-profit organizations which includes \nthe U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs, Eli Lilly and Company, USAA, \nmany veterans service organizations--including: DAV, VVA, AMVETS, VFW, \nPVA, American Legion, NCOA, Korean War Veterans, Jewish War Veterans, \nVietNow, Marine Corps League--and Volunteers of America of Florida.\n  In Florida alone, there are between 17,000 and 23,000 homeless \nveterans who are living on the streets on any given night. Nationally, \nthere are about 300,000 homeless veterans on any given night. In a \nyear, that number jumps to over half a million veterans who will \nexperience homelessness.\n  As a new generation of veterans begin to return home, it has become \nincreasingly important to cultivate safety net programs for our \nNation's veterans. Volunteers of America of Florida is battling to \nbreak the cycle of homelessness and reintegrate these brave veterans \nback into society. It gives me great pleasure to honor the paid and \nvolunteer staff that makes these programs possible throughout the great \nState of Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2709-4", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2709-S2710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n           SBA EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2004\n\n Mr. KERRY.

Lack of a \n     response by the United States to a particular declaration or \n     statement made under the Convention shall not be interpreted \n     as tacit acceptance by the United States of that declaration \n     or statement.\n       (7) The United States understands that nothing in the \n     Convention limits the ability\n\n[[Page S2713]]\n\n     of a State to prohibit or restrict imports of goods into its \n     territory in order to, inter alia, promote or require \n     compliance with environmental and conservation laws, norms, \n     and objectives.\n       (8) The United States understands that articles 220, 228, \n     and 230 apply only to pollution from vessels (as referred to \n     in article 211) and not, for example, to pollution from \n     dumping.\n       (9) The United States understands, with respect to articles \n     220 and 226, that the ``clear grounds'' requirement set forth \n     in those articles is equivalent to the ``reasonable \n     suspicion'' standard under United States law.\n       (10) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     228(2), that--\n       (A) the ``proceedings'' referred to in that paragraph are \n     the same as those referred to in article 228(1), namely those \n     proceedings in respect of any violation of applicable laws \n     and regulations or international rules and standards relating \n     to the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from \n     vessels committed by a foreign vessel beyond the territorial \n     sea of the State instituting proceedings; and\n       (B) fraudulent concealment from an officer of the United \n     States of information concerning such pollution would extend \n     the three-year period in which such proceedings may be \n     instituted.\n       (11) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     230, that--\n       (A) it applies only to natural persons aboard the foreign \n     vessels at the time of the act of pollution;\n       (B) the references to ``monetary penalties only'' exclude \n     only imprisonment and corporal punishment;\n       (C) the requirement that an act of pollution be ``wilful'' \n     in order to impose non-monetary penalties would not constrain \n     the imposition of such penalties for pollution caused by \n     gross negligence;\n       (D) in determining what constitutes a ``serious'' act of \n     pollution, a State may consider, as appropriate, the \n     cumulative or aggregate impact on the marine environment of \n     repeated acts of pollution over time; and\n       (E) among the factors relevant to the determination whether \n     an act of pollution is ``serious,'' a significant factor is \n     non-compliance with a generally accepted international \n     rule or standard.\n       (12) The United States understands that sections 6 and 7 of \n     Part XII do not limit the authority of a State to impose \n     penalties, monetary or nonmonetary, for, inter alia--\n       (A) non-pollution offenses, such as false statements, \n     obstruction of justice, and obstruction of government or \n     judicial proceedings, wherever they occur; or\n       (B) any violation of national laws and regulations or \n     applicable international rules and standards for the \n     prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine \n     environment that occurs while a foreign vessel is in any of \n     its ports, rivers, harbors, or offshore terminals.\n       (13) The United States understands that the Convention \n     recognizes and does not constrain the long-standing sovereign \n     right of a State to impose and enforce conditions for the \n     entry of foreign vessels into its ports, rivers, harbors, or \n     offshore terminals, such as a requirement that ships exchange \n     ballast water beyond 200 nautical miles from shore or a \n     requirement that tank vessels carrying oil be constructed \n     with double hulls.\n       (14) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     21(2), that measures applying to the ``design, construction, \n     equipment or manning'' do not include, inter alia, measures \n     such as traffic separation schemes, ship routing measures, \n     speed limits, quantitative restrictions on discharge of \n     substances, restrictions on the discharge and/or uptake of \n     ballast water, reporting requirements, and record-keeping \n     requirements.\n       (15) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate discharges into the marine environment resulting \n     from industrial operations on board a foreign vessel.\n       (16) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate the introduction into the marine environment of \n     alien or new species.\n       (17) The United States understands that, with respect to \n     articles 61 and 62, a coastal State has the exclusive right \n     to determine the allowable catch of the living resources in \n     its exclusive economic zone, whether it has the capacity to \n     harvest the entire allowable catch, whether any surplus \n     exists for allocation to other States, and to establish the \n     terms and conditions under which access may be granted. The \n     United States further understands that such determinations \n     are, by virtue of article 297(3)(a), not subject to binding \n     dispute resolution under the Convention.\n       (18) The United States understands that article 65 of the \n     Convention lent direct support to the establishment of the \n     moratorium on commercial whaling, supports the creation of \n     sanctuaries and other conservation measures, and requires \n     States to cooperate not only with respect to large whales, \n     but with respect to all cetaceans.\n       (19) The United States understands that, with respect to \n     article 33, the term ``sanitary laws and regulations'' \n     includes laws and regulations to protect human health from, \n     inter alia, pathogens being introduced into the territorial \n     sea.\n       (20) The United States understands that decisions of the \n     Council pursuant to procedures other than those set forth in \n     article 161(8)(d) will involve administrative, institutional, \n     or procedural matters and will not result in substantive \n     obligations on the United States.\n       (21) The United States understands that decisions of the \n     Assembly under article 160(2)(e) to assess the contributions \n     of members are to be taken pursuant to section 3(7) of the \n     Annex to the Agreement and that the United States will, \n     pursuant to section 9(3) of the Annex to the Agreement, be \n     guaranteed a seat on the Finance Committee established by \n     section 9(1) of the Annex to the Agreement, so long as the \n     Authority supports itself through assessed contributions.\n       (22) The United States declares, pursuant to article 39 of \n     Annex VI, that decisions of the Seabed Disputes Chamber shall \n     be enforceable in the territory of the United States only in \n     accordance with procedures established by implementing \n     legislation and that such decisions shall be subject to such \n     legal and factual review as is constitutionally required and \n     without precedential effect in any court of the United \n     States.\n       (23) The United States--\n       (A) understands that article 161(8)(f) applies to the \n     Council's approval of amendments to section 4 of Annex VI;\n       (B) declares that, under that article, it intends to accept \n     only a procedure that requires consensus for the adoption of \n     amendments to section 4 of Annex VI; and\n       (C) in the case of an amendment to section 4 of Annex VI \n     that is adopted contrary to this understanding, that is, by a \n     procedure other than consensus, will consider itself bound by \n     such an amendment only if it subsequently ratifies such \n     amendment pursuant to the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (24) The United States declares that, with the exception of \n     articles 177-183, article 13 of Annex IV, and article 10 of \n     Annex VI, the provisions of the Convention and the Agreement, \n     including amendments thereto and rules, regulations, and \n     procedures thereunder, are not self-executing.\n       Sec. 4.

and\n       (E) among the factors relevant to the determination whether \n     an act of pollution is ``serious,'' a significant factor is \n     non-compliance with a generally accepted international rule \n     or standard.\n       (12) The United States understands that sections 6 and 7 of \n     Part XII do not limit the authority of a State to impose \n     penalties, monetary or nonmonetary, for, inter alia--\n       (A) non-pollution offenses, such as false statements, \n     obstruction of justice, and obstruction of government or \n     judicial proceedings, wherever they occur; or\n       (B) any violation of national laws and regulations or \n     applicable international rules and standards for the \n     prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine \n     environment that occurs while a foreign vessel is in any of \n     its ports, rivers, harbors, or offshore terminals.\n       (13) The United States understands that the Convention \n     recognizes and does not constrain the long-standing sovereign \n     right of a State to impose and enforce conditions for the \n     entry of foreign vessels into its ports, rivers, harbors, or \n     offshore terminals, such as a requirement that ships exchange \n     ballast water beyond 200 nautical miles from shore or a \n     requirement that tank vessels carrying oil be constructed \n     with double hulls.\n       (14) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     21(2), that measures applying to the ``design, construction, \n     equipment or manning'' do not include, inter alia, measures \n     such as traffic separation schemes, ship routing measures, \n     speed limits, quantitative restrictions on discharge of \n     substances, restrictions on the discharge and/or uptake of \n     ballast water, reporting requirements, and record-keeping \n     requirements.\n       (15) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate discharges into the marine environment resulting \n     from industrial operations on board a foreign vessel.\n       (16) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate the introduction into the marine environment of \n     alien or new species.\n       (17) The United States understands that, with respect to \n     articles 61 and 62, a coastal State has the exclusive right \n     to determine the allowable catch of the living resources in \n     its exclusive economic zone, whether it has the capacity to \n     harvest the entire allowable catch, whether any surplus \n     exists for allocation to other States, and to establish the \n     terms and conditions under which access may be granted. The \n     United States further understands that such determinations \n     are, by virtue of article 297(3)(a), not subject to binding \n     dispute resolution under the Convention.\n       (18) The United States understands that article 65 of the \n     Convention lent direct support to the establishment of the \n     moratorium on commercial whaling, supports the creation of \n     sanctuaries and other conservation measures, and requires \n     States to cooperate not only with respect to large whales, \n     but with respect to all cetaceans.\n       (19) The United States understands that, with respect to \n     article 33, the term ``sanitary laws and regulations'' \n     includes laws and regulations to protect human health from, \n     inter alia, pathogens being introduced into the territorial \n     sea.\n       (20) The United States understands that decisions of the \n     Council pursuant to procedures other than those set forth in \n     article\n\n[[Page S2715]]\n\n     161(8)(d) will involve administrative, institutional, or \n     procedural matters and will not result in substantive \n     obligations on the United States.\n       (21) The United States understands that decisions of the \n     Assembly under article 160(2)(e) to assess the contributions \n     of members are to be taken pursuant to section 3(7) of the \n     Annex to the Agreement and that the United States will, \n     pursuant to section 9(3) of the Annex to the Agreement, be \n     guaranteed a seat on the Finance Committee established by \n     section 9(1) of the Annex to the Agreement, so long as the \n     Authority supports itself through assessed contributions.\n       (22) The United States declares, pursuant to article 39 of \n     Annex VI, that decisions of the Seabed Disputes Chamber shall \n     be enforceable in the territory of the United States only in \n     accordance with procedures established by implementing \n     legislation and that such decisions shall be subject to such \n     legal and factual review as is constitutionally required and \n     without precedential effect in any court of the United \n     States.\n       (23) The United States--\n       (A) understands that article 161(8)(f) applies to the \n     Council's approval of amendments to section 4 of Annex VI;\n       (B) declares that, under that article, it intends to accept \n     only a procedure that requires consensus for the adoption of \n     amendments to section 4 of Annex VI; and\n       (C) in the case of an amendment to section 4 of Annex VI \n     that is adopted contrary to this understanding, that is, by a \n     procedure other than consensus, will consider itself bound by \n     such an amendment only if it subsequently ratifies such \n     amendment pursuant to the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       (24) The United States declares that, with the exception of \n     articles 177-183, article 13 of Annex IV, and article 10 of \n     Annex VI, the provisions of the Convention and the Agreement, \n     including amendments thereto and rules, regulations, and \n     procedures thereunder, are not self-executing.\n       Sec. 4. Conditions.\n       (a) In General.--The advice and consent of the Senate under \n     section 1 is subject to the following conditions:\n       (1) Not later than 15 days after the receipt by the \n     Secretary of State of a written communication from the \n     Secretary-General of the United Nations or the Secretary-\n     General of the Authority transmitting a proposal to amend the \n     Convention pursuant to article 312, 313, or 314, the \n     President shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations \n     of the Senate a copy of the proposed amendment.\n       (2) Prior to the convening of a Conference to consider \n     amendments to the Convention proposed to be adopted pursuant \n     to article 312 of the Convention, the President shall consult \n     with the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate on the \n     amendments to be considered at the Conference. The President \n     shall also consult with the Committee on Foreign Relations of \n     the Senate on any amendment proposed to be adopted pursuant \n     to article 313 of the Convention.\n       (3) Not later than 15 days prior to any meeting--\n       (A) of the Council of the International Seabed Authority to \n     consider an amendment to the Convention proposed to be \n     adopted pursuant to article 314 of the Convention, or\n       (B) of any other body under the Convention to consider an \n     amendment that would enter into force pursuant to article \n     316(5) of the Convention, the President shall consult with \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate on the \n     amendment and on whether the United States should object to \n     its adoption.\n       (4) All amendments to the Convention, other than amendments \n     under article 316(5) of a technical or administrative nature, \n     shall be submitted by the President to the Senate for its \n     advice and consent.\n       (5) The United States declares that it shall take all \n     necessary steps under the Convention to ensure that \n     amendments under article 316(5) are adopted in conformity \n     with the treaty clause in article 2, section 2 of the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (b) Inclusion of Certain Conditions in Instrument of \n     Ratification.--Conditions 4 and 5 shall be included in the \n     United States instrument of ratification to the Convention.\n       Section 1. Senate advice and consent subject to \n     declarations and understandings.\n       The Senate advises and consents to the accession to the \n     United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, with \n     annexes, adopted on December 10, 1982 (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Convention''), and to the \n     ratification of the Agreement Relating to the Implementation \n     of Part XI of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \n     Sea, with annex, adopted on July 28, 1994 (hereafter in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``Agreement'') (Treaty Doc. \n     103-39), subject to the declarations of section 2, to be made \n     under articles 287 and 298 of the Convention, the \n     declarations and understandings of section 3, to be made \n     under article 310 of the Convention, and the conditions of \n     section 4.\n       Sec. 2. Declarations under articles 287 and 298.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations:\n       (1) The Government of the United States of America \n     declares, in accordance with article 287(1), that it chooses \n     the following means for the settlement of disputes concerning \n     the interpretation or application of the Convention:\n       (A) a special arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance \n     with Annex VIII for the settlement of disputes concerning the \n     interpretation or application of the articles of the \n     Convention relating to (1) fisheries, (2) protection and \n     preservation of the marine environment, (3) marine scientific \n     research, and (4) navigation, including pollution from \n     vessels and by dumping; and\n       (B) an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with \n     Annex VII for the settlement of disputes not covered by the \n     declaration in subparagraph (A).\n       (2) The Government of the United States of America \n     declares, in accordance with article 298(1), that it does not \n     accept any of the procedures provided for in section 2 of \n     Part XV (including, inter alia, the Sea-Bed Disputes \n     Chamber procedure referred to in article 287(2)) with \n     respect to the categories of disputes set forth in \n     subparagraphs (a), (b), and (c) of article 298(1). The \n     United States further declares that its consent to \n     accession to the Convention is conditioned upon the \n     understanding that, under article 298(1)(b), each State \n     Party has the exclusive right to determine whether its \n     activities are or were ``military activities'' and that \n     such determinations are not subject to review.\n       Sec. 3. Other declarations and understandings under article \n     310.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate under section 1 is \n     subject to the following declarations and understandings:\n       (1) The United States understands that nothing in the \n     Convention, including any provisions referring to ``peaceful \n     uses'' or ``peaceful purposes,'' impairs the inherent right \n     of individual or collective self-defense or rights during \n     armed conflict.\n       (2) The United States understands, with respect to the \n     right of innocent passage under the Convention, that--\n       (A) all ships, including warships, regardless of, for \n     example, cargo, armament, means of propulsion, flag, origin, \n     destination, or purpose, enjoy the right of innocent passage;\n       (B) article 19(2) contains an exhaustive list of activities \n     that render passage non-innocent;\n       (C) any determination of non-innocence of passage by a ship \n     must be made on the basis of acts it commits while in the \n     territorial sea, and not on the basis of, for example, cargo, \n     armament, means of propulsion, flag, origin, destination, or \n     purpose; and\n       (D) the Convention does not authorize a coastal State to \n     condition the exercise of the right of innocent passage by \n     any ships, including warships, on the giving of prior \n     notification to or the receipt of prior permission from the \n     coastal State.\n       (3) The United States understands, concerning Parts III and \n     IV of the Convention, that--\n       (A) all ships and aircraft, including warships and military \n     aircraft, regardless of, for example, cargo, armament, means \n     of propulsion, flag, origin, destination, or purpose, are \n     entitled to transit passage and archipelagic sea lanes \n     passage in their ``normal mode'';\n       (B) ``normal mode'' includes, inter alia\n       (i) submerged transit of submarines;\n       (ii) overflight by military aircraft, including in military \n     formation;\n       (iii) activities necessary for the security of surface \n     warships, such as formation steaming and other force \n     protection measures;\n       (iv) underway replenishment; and\n       (v) the launching and recovery of aircraft;\n       (C) the words ``strait'' and ``straits'' are not limited by \n     geographic names or categories and include all waters not \n     subject to Part IV that separate one part of the high seas or \n     exclusive economic zone from another part of the high seas or \n     exclusive economic zone or other areas referred to in article \n     45;\n       (D) the term ``used for international navigation'' includes \n     all straits capable of being used for international \n     navigation; and\n       (E) the right of archipelagic sea lanes passage is not \n     dependent upon the designation by archipelagic States of \n     specific sea lanes and/or air routes and, in the absence of \n     such designation or if there has been only a partial \n     designation, may be exercised through all routes normally \n     used for international navigation.\n       (4) The United States understands, with respect to the \n     exclusive economic zone, that--\n       (A) all States enjoy high seas freedoms of navigation and \n     overflight and all other internationally lawful uses of the \n     sea related to these freedoms, including, inter alia, \n     military activities, such as anchoring, launching and landing \n     of aircraft and other military devices, launching and \n     recovering water-borne craft, operating military devices, \n     intelligence collection, surveillance and reconnaissance \n     activities, exercises, operations, and conducting military \n     surveys; and\n       (B) coastal State actions pertaining to these freedoms and \n     uses must be in accordance with the Convention.\n       (5) The United States understands that ``marine scientific \n     research'' does not include, inter alia--\n       (A) prospecting and exploration of natural resources;\n       (B) hydrographic surveys;\n       (C) military activities, including military surveys;\n       (D) environmental monitoring and assessment pursuant to \n     section 4 of Part XII; or\n       (E) activities related to submerged wrecks or objects of an \n     archaeological and historical nature.\n       (6) The United States understands that any declaration or \n     statement purporting to limit navigation, overflight, or \n     other rights and freedoms of all States in ways not permitted \n     by the Convention contravenes the Convention. Lack of a \n     response by the United States to a particular declaration or \n     statement\n\n[[Page S2716]]\n\n     made under the Convention shall not be interpreted as tacit \n     acceptance by the United States of that declaration or \n     statement.\n       (7) The United States understands that nothing in the \n     Convention limits the ability of a State to prohibit or \n     restrict imports of goods into its territory in order to, \n     inter alia, promote or require compliance with environmental \n     and conservation laws, norms, and objectives.\n       (8) The United States understands that articles 220, 228, \n     and 230 apply only to pollution from vessels (as referred to \n     in article 211) and not, for example, to pollution from \n     dumping.\n       (9) The United States understands, with respect to articles \n     220 and 226, that the ``clear grounds'' requirement set forth \n     in those articles is equivalent to the ``reasonable \n     suspicion'' standard under United States law.\n       (10) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     228(2), that--\n       (A) the ``proceedings'' referred to in that paragraph are \n     the same as those referred to in article 228(1), namely those \n     proceedings in respect of any violation of applicable laws \n     and regulations or international rules and standards relating \n     to the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from \n     vessels committed by a foreign vessel beyond the territorial \n     sea of the State instituting proceedings; and\n       (B) fraudulent concealment from an officer of the United \n     States of information concerning such pollution would extend \n     the three-year period in which such proceedings may be \n     instituted.\n       (11) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     230, that--\n       (A) it applies only to natural persons aboard the foreign \n     vessels at the time of the act of pollution;\n       (B) the references to ``monetary penalties only'' exclude \n     only imprisonment and corporal punishment;\n       (C) the requirement that an act of pollution be ``willful'' \n     in order to impose non-monetary penalties would not constrain \n     the imposition of such penalties for pollution caused by \n     gross negligence;\n       (D) in determining what constitutes a ``serious'' act of \n     pollution, a State may consider, as appropriate, the \n     cumulative or aggregate impact on the marine environment of \n     repeated acts of pollution over time; and\n       (E) among the factors relevant to the determination whether \n     an act of pollution is ``serious,'' a significant factor is \n     non-compliance with a generally accepted international rule \n     or standard.\n       (12) The United States understands that sections 6 and 7 of \n     Part XII do not limit the authority of a State to impose \n     penalties, monetary or nonmonetary, for, inter alia--\n       (A) non-pollution offenses, such as false statements, \n     obstruction of justice, and obstruction of government or \n     judicial proceedings, wherever they occur; or\n       (B) any violation of national laws and regulations or \n     applicable international rules and standards for the \n     prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine \n     environment that occurs while a foreign vessel is in any of \n     its ports, rivers, harbors, or offshore terminals.\n       (13) The United States understands that the Convention \n     recognizes and does not constrain the long-standing sovereign \n     right of a State to impose and enforce conditions for the \n     entry of foreign vessels into its ports, rivers, harbors, or \n     offshore terminals, such as a requirement that ships exchange \n     ballast water beyond 200 nautical miles from shore or a \n     requirement that tank vessels carrying oil be constructed \n     with double hulls.\n       (14) The United States understands, with respect to article \n     21(2), that measures applying to the ``design, construction, \n     equipment or manning'' do not include, inter alia, measures \n     such as traffic separation schemes, ship routing measures, \n     speed limits, quantitative restrictions on discharge of \n     substances, restrictions on the discharge and/or uptake of \n     ballast water, reporting requirements, and record-keeping \n     requirements.\n       (15) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate discharges into the marine environment resulting \n     from industrial operations on board a foreign vessel.\n       (16) The United States understands that the Convention \n     supports a coastal State's exercise of its domestic authority \n     to regulate the introduction into the marine environment of \n     alien or new species.\n       (17) The United States understands that, with respect to \n     articles 61 and 62, a coastal State has the exclusive right \n     to determine the allowable catch of the living resources in \n     its exclusive economic zone, whether it has the capacity to \n     harvest the entire allowable catch, whether any surplus \n     exists for allocation to other States, and to establish the \n     terms and conditions under which access may be granted.

A bill to amend part D of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to improve the collection of child support, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is \nvery close to my heart--the Child Support Improvement Act of 2004. I \nwant to express my appreciation for the leadership of the Senator from \nConnecticut on these issues, and his willingness to co-sponsor this \nbill.\n  In my career, I have had the opportunity to see the significant \nproblems facing our child support system from several different \nperspectives.\n  As a district judge in Texas, I ruled in divorce and custody cases. I \nsaw the powerful emotions involved in these cases, where the best \ninterests of children are fought over even as the relationships that \nbrought them into this world fall apart.\n  And I had to make judgments in a large number of child support cases \nbefore Texas implemented the system for expediting these cases by \nestablishing the masters program.\n  As a Supreme Court justice, I had the opportunity to write opinions \nthat had a real and positive affect on child support.\n  As Attorney General, I saw the positive effects of enforced \nguidelines for child support, visitation, and income withholding. I \nworked to implement Federal mandates. And I saw that we had a deep hole \nto climb out of, a child support system that was in terrible shape.\n  My first priority was to improve customer service. I saw that more \nthan $16 million in child support payments were collected but \nundistributed due to computer errors, leaving those most in need of \nassistance without their child support payments merely because of \ncomputer or administrative problems.\n  And the vast majority of the people calling the child support offices \nfor assistance were automatically disconnected or received a busy \nsignal. Only one in every seven phone calls was actually answered--one \nin seven.\n  We got to work fast. We focused on both the dead beat and the dead \nbroke parents. We fixed the customer service system, establishing eight \nregional call centers and an interactive web site to provide case-\nspecific information on a secure site for parents to access. We worked \nwith community organizations to establish a dozen fatherhood programs. \nWe got payments out the door more quickly, and we reduced undistributed \ncollections. And I announced a top ten list of ``Texas' Most Wanted \nChild Support Evaders,'' those dead beat parents who willfully evaded \narrest.\n  In the end, we collected more than $3 billion in child support. Some \nfolks called it a miracle. I call it a good start.\n  I believe that this body has the responsibility to do more to help \nour child support system be more efficient, more responsive, and do \nmore to improve the lives of children and families.\n  The proposal that I am introducing today, along with the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut--who has a deep understanding of \nthe issue and, like me, served his State as attorney general--features \nseveral long-needed reforms of our child support provisions.\n  It includes new distribution options for states to get more child \nsupport to families on TANF, and to pay more child support to families \nwho were previously on TANF.\n  This bill also has several provisions based on my experience as \nAttorney General: 1. It encourages States to do more medical support \nenforcement, by giving states a funding incentive that will ultimately \nreduce our Federal Medicaid and S-CHIP costs. 2. It promotes early \nmonitoring of child support orders, cutting red tape so that states \nhave greater freedom to innovate and large arrearages never occur. 3. \nIt focuses on reducing undistributed collections by directing more \nFederal resources toward finding solutions to this widespread problem. \n4. It gets payments to custodial parents quickly, by urging States to \nuse electronic payment methods. 5. And it allows States the option to \nsend all non-IV-D child support payments to the State Disbursement \nUnit, reducing expenses, paperwork and confusion for employers and \naccelerating payments to families.\n  I believe that all of these reforms are necessary and important \nsteps. They will lower costs, increase efficiency, and get children \nmore of the help they need.\n  Even as we strive to improve our child support system, we cannot \nunderestimate the social importance of the family as a component of our \nmission. As author Maggie Gallagher once wrote: ``When men and women \nfail to form stable marriages, the first result is a vast expansion of \ngovernment attempts to cope with the terrible social needs that result. \nThere is scarcely a dollar that state and federal government spends on \nsocial programs that is not driven in large part by family \nfragmentation: crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, school \nfailure, and mental and physical health problems.''\n  I strongly believe that the family is the fundamental institution of \nour civilization. If fosters successful communities, happier homes, and \nhealthier lives.\n  The family provides the foundation for raising each new generation of \nAmericans. And when families are weakened, children suffer the most. \nEven the best child support system in the world cannot give the caring \nlove and nurturing of family--which is why I believe we need to have a \nchild support system that genuinely encourages parents to be an active \npart of their child's life.\n  We need a child support system that focuses on the dead beat and dead \nbroke parents, that brings the worst evaders in, and that puts the \nfamily first. Let us in this body strive to do everything we can, as we \nhope for a brighter future for this nation and future generations of \nAmerican children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL ( for himself, Ms. Collins, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2196. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to clarify \nthat per diem payments by the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \ncare of Veterans in State homes shall not be used to offset payments \nthat are made under the medicaid program for the purpose of assisting \nveterans; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators Collins and Snowe to introduce legislation which \nwill rectify a very serious problem affecting veterans in my State and \naround the Nation. The bill I am introducing will clarify the treatment \nof the per diem payments made by the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nVA, to\n\n[[Page S2721]]\n\nsupport State Veterans Homes across the country.\n  For several decades, Federal law has required that the VA pay a per \ndiem amount to States to support quality care provided to eligible \nveterans at qualified State Veterans Homes. This VA per diem, currently \nabout $56 per day for nursing home care and $27 per day for domiciliary \ncare, is intended to assist States in providing the best possible care \nto those who served in our armed forces.\n  In Colorado and a number of other States, the availability of the VA \nper diem is threatened by interpretations of Medicaid rules by the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. CMS would treat the VA \nper diem payments as third-party payments, requiring that the entire \namount be offset against Medicaid payments. This interpretation would \ndeny residents of State Veterans Homes who receive Medicaid in these \nstates any benefit whatsoever of the VA per diem payments.\n  I believe this runs contrary to the intent of Congress in \nestablishing the VA per diem payment system. State Veterans Homes are \nrequired to meet stringent and costly VA standards for care as a \ncondition for receiving these per diem payments. These standards of \ncare exceed those required by Medicaid, and the VA per diem makes it \npossible for State Veterans Homes to meet the higher VA standards. Most \nimportantly, this per diem allows our veterans to receive high quality \nnursing care.\n  An insistence by CMS on its interpretation would jeopardize the \nfunding balance for many Medicaid-certified State Veterans Homes across \nthe country. The result of the CMS interpretation would be to force \nState Veterans Homes that do not currently offset the VA per diem \npayments against Medicaid funding to reduce their standard of care, \ndefer construction of needed new facilities, and possibly close certain \nState Veterans Homes.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would simply clarify that \nthe VA per diem payments cannot not be considered to be a third-party \nliability under Medicaid. It would build on other precedents where \nCongress wanted to make sure that benefits were received by their \nintentional recipients, not transferred to the Medicaid program. For \nexample, federal law already includes exceptions for similar payments, \nsuch as those made under the Indian Health program.\n  Our legislation recognizes that the States fund their State Veterans \nHomes in a variety of different manners. It preserves their flexibility \nto do so in a way that best serves their veterans, and ensures that no \nstate is forced to lose the benefit of the VA per diem.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and move forward \nwith a plan that will enable our State Veterans Nursing Homes to \nprovide the high quality care that our veterans deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT UNDER MEDICAID PROGRAM OF DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS PER DIEM PAYMENTS TO STATE \n                   HOMES FOR VETERANS.\n\n       Section 1741 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(e) Payments to States pursuant to this section shall not \n     be considered a liability of a third party for any purpose \n     under section 1902(a)(25) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1396a(25)).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2197. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to clarify the status of certain communities in the \nwestern Alaska community development quota program; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as residents of sparsely populated \nState with great natural resources but severe poverty in many of its \nrural areas, Alaskans have engaged in a variety of social and economic \nexercises intended to improve the living standard and expand economic \nopportunities for our most challenged communities.\n  I rise today to introduce a bill to ensure that one of the most \nsuccessful of those exercises is allowed to continue. I am pleased to \nsay the measure is also cosponsored by Alaska's senior senator.\n  The CDQ Community Preservation Act is intended to maintain the \nparticipation of all currently eligible communities along the shore of \nthe Bering Sea in Alaska's Community Development Quota program. It is \nnecessary because inconsistencies in statutory and regulatory \nprovisions may require a reassessment of eligibility and the exclusion \nof some communities from the program. This was not the intent of the \noriginal program, nor of any subsequent changes to it. In order to \nclarify that fact, a legislative remedy is needed.\n  The Community Development Quota Program began in 1992, at the \nrecommendation of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council, one of \nthe regional councils formed under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act. Congress gave the program permanent \nstatus in the 1996 reauthorization of the Act.\n  The program presently includes 65 communities within a 50 nautical-\nmile radius of the Bering Sea, which have formed six regional non-\nprofit associations to participate in the program. The regional \nassociations range in size from one to 20 communities. Under the \nprogram, a portion of the regulated annual harvests of pollock, \nhalibut, sablefish, Atka mackerel, Pacific cod, and crab is assigned to \neach association, which operate under combined Federal and State agency \noversight. Almost all of an association's earnings must be invested in \nfishing-related projects in order to encourage a sustainable economic \nbase for the region.\n  Typically, each association sells its share of the annual harvest \nquotas to established fishing companies in return for cash and \nagreements to provide job training and employment opportunities for \nresidents of the region. The program has been remarkably successful.\n  Since 1992, approximately 9,000 jobs have been created for western \nAlaska residents with wages totaling more than $60 million. The CDQ \nprogram has also contributed to fisheries infrastructure development in \nwestern Alaska, as well as providing vessel loan programs; education, \ntraining and other CDQ-related benefits.\n  The CDQ program has its roots in the amazing success story of how our \noffshore fishery resources were Americanized after the passage of the \noriginal Magnuson Act in 1976. At the time, vast foreign fishing fleets \nwere almost the only ones operating in the U.S. 200-mile Exclusive \nEconomic Zone. American fishermen simply did not have either the \nvessels or the expertise to participate.\n  The Magnuson Act changed all that. It led to the adoption of what we \ncalled a ``fish and chips'' policy that provided for an exchange of \nfish allocations for technological and practical expertise. Within the \nnext few years, harvesting fell almost exclusively to American vessels. \nWithin a few years after that, processing almost became Americanized. \nToday, there are no foreign fishing or processing vessels operating in \nthe 200-mile zone off Alaska, and the industry is worth billions of \ndollars each year.\n  The CDQ program helps bring some of the benefits of that great \nindustry to local residents in one of the most impoverished areas of \nthe entire country. It is a vital element in the effort to create and \nmaintain a lasting economic base for the region's many poor \ncommunities, and truly deserves the support of this body.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for refinancing of consolidated student \nloans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the \nConsolidated Student Loan Reduction Act of 2004.\n  A college education is becoming more and more crucial as American \nworkers seek to compete in the global marketplace. Yet, the cost of a \ncollege education is rising each year, making it less accessible to low \nand moderate income individuals. While grants and scholarships are \navailable, students have come to increasingly rely on student loans. \nBetween 1992 and 2002, Federal student loans increased by 165 percent, \nand in 2003, $65 billion--or 70 percent of total Federal student aid--\nwas in the form of loans. The average debt for a college graduate is \n$17,000, and it can exceed $100,000 for a graduate student.\n  Under Federal law, and in order to receive longer repayment terms, \nindividuals may consolidate their student loans into one loan. The \ninterest rate on the consolidated loan is fixed. So while current law \ngives individuals a longer time to repay their student debt, it does \nnot allow them to take advantage of the low interest rates that prevail \nin the marketplace today. Graduates may refinance their houses at lower \nrates but cannot do the same with student loans.\n  My bill would change that and would permit individuals to refinance \ntheir consolidated Federal loans at the same interest rate as Federal \nStafford loans, which fluctuate with the market and are generally below \nthe prevailing market rate. Individuals could refinance anytime their \nconsolidated loan rate exceeded 1 percent of the Stafford loan rate. \nAnd under my bill the borrower is not required to pay any fee or costs \nwhen they refinance.\n  There are many in Congress who have introduced legislation to make a \ncollege education more accessible and affordable to American students. \nI support many of those efforts. My modest bill is a step in this \ndirection, and I encourage my colleagues to support this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2199. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to \nimprove the ability of State and local governments to prevent the \nabduction of children by family members, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n   Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator \nHutchison, Senator Snowe, Senator Feingold and Senator Lincoln to \nintroduce the ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2004,'' a bill to \nhelp the thousands of children who are abducted by a family member each \nyear.\n  Family abductions are the most common form of abduction yet they \nreceive little attention and law enforcement often doesn't treat them \nas the serious crimes that they are.\n  The Family Abduction prevention Act of 2004 would provide grants to \nstates for costs associated with family abduction prevention. \nSpecifically, it would assist States with: costs associated with the \nextradition of individuals suspected of committing the crime of family \nabduction; costs borne by State and local law enforcement agencies to \ninvestigate cases of missing children; training for local and State law \nenforcement agencies in responding to family abductions; outreach and \nmedia campaigns to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions; \nand assistance to public schools to help with costs associated with \nflagging school records.\n  Each year, over 200,000 children--78 percent of all abductions in the \nUnited States--are kidnapped by a family member, usually a non-\ncustodial parent.\n  More than half of abducting parents have a history of domestic \nviolence, substance abuse, or a criminal record.\n  Most State and local law enforcement agencies do not treat these \nabductions as serious crimes. Approximately 70 percent of law \nenforcement agencies do not have written guidelines on responding to \nfamily abduction and many are not informed about the Federal laws \navailable to help in the search and recovery.\n\n  Many people believe that a child is not in grave danger if the \nabductor is a family member. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the \nassumptions can endanger a child's life. Research shows that the most \ncommon motive in family abduction cases is revenge against the other \nparent--not out of love for the child.\n  The effects of family abduction on children are very traumatic. \nAbducted children suffer from severe separation anxiety. To break \nemotional ties with the left-behind parent, some family abductors will \ncoach a child into falsely ``disclosing'' abuse by the other parent to \nperpetuate their control during or after abduction. The child is often \ntold that the other parent is dead or did not really love them.\n  As the child adapts to a fugitive's lifestyle, deception becomes a \npart of life. The child is taught to fear those that one would normally \ntrust, such as police, doctors, teachers and counselors. Even after \nrecovery, the child often has a difficult time into adulthood.\n  On Takeroot.org, a website devoted to victims of family abductions, \nRebekah told the story of when her mother kidnapped her.\n  Her mother was diagnosed as manic and was verbally abusive to her \nchildren and husband. Rebekah's father was awarded full custody of her \nand her brothers. However, one weekend, when Rebekah was 4-years-old, \nher mother took her to Texas.\n  Her mother had all her moles and distinguishing marks removed from \nher body and she had fake birth certificates made for Rebekah and \nherself. As Rebekah grew up, she was told that her father didn't love \nher and that her siblings didn't want to see her. When the FBI finally \nfound Rebekah, she didn't remember her father and felt very alone.\n  In addition, in many family abduction cases, children are given new \nidentities at an age when they are still developing a sense of who they \nare. In extreme cases, the child's sexual identity is covered up to \navoid detection.\n  Abducting parents often deprive their children of education and much-\nneeded medical attention to avoid the risk of being tracked via school \nor medical records.\n\n  In extreme cases, the abducting parent leaves the child with \nstrangers at an underground ``safe house'' where health, safety, and \nother basic needs are extremely compromised.\n  For example, in Lafayette, CA, two girls were abducted by their \nmother and moved from house to house under the control of a convicted \nchild molester. Kelli Nunez absconded with her daughters, 6-year-old \nAnna and 4-year-old Emily in violation of court custody orders. Nunez \ndrove her daughters cross-country, and then returned by plane to San \nFrancisco, where she handed the children to someone holding a coded \nsign at the airport.\n  The person holding the sign belonged to an underground vigilante \ngroup called the California Family Law Center led by Florencio Maning, \na convicted child molester. For six months, Maning orchestrated the \nconcealment of the Nunez girls with help from other people. Luckily, \npolice were able to track down the girls and they were successfully \nreunited with their father.\n  California has been the Nation's leader in fighting family abduction. \nIn my State, we have a system that places the responsibility for the \ninvestigation and resolution of family abduction cases with the County \nDistrict Attorney's Office. Each California County District Attorney's \nOffice has an investigative unit that is focused on family abduction \ncases. Therefore, investigators only handle family abduction cases and \nbecome experts in the process.\n  However, most States lack the training and resources to effectively \nrecover children who are kidnapped by a family\n\n[[Page S2723]]\n\nmember. According to a study conducted by Plass, Finkelhor and \nHotaling, 62 percent of parents surveyed said they were ``somewhat'' or \n``very'' dissatisfied with police handling of their family abduction \ncases.\n  The ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2004'' would be an important \nfirst step in addressing this serious issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to quickly act on this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Family Abduction Prevention \n     Act of 2004''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress findings that--\n       (1) each year more than 203,000 children in the United \n     States (approximately 78 percent of all abducted children) \n     are abducted by a family member, usually a parent;\n       (2) more than half of the parents who abduct their children \n     have a history of alcohol or substance abuse, a criminal \n     record, or a history of violence;\n       (3) the most common motive for family abduction is revenge \n     against the other parent, not protecting the child's safety;\n       (4) children who are abducted by family members suffer \n     emotional, psychological, and often physical abuse at the \n     hands of their abductors;\n       (5) children who are victims of family abductions are \n     forced to leave behind family, friends, their homes, their \n     neighborhoods, their schools, and all that is familiar to \n     them;\n       (6) children who are victims of family abductions are often \n     told that the parent who did not abduct the child has died, \n     does not love them, or will harm them;\n       (7) children who are abducted by their parents or other \n     family members are sometimes forced to live in fear of \n     discovery and may be compelled to conceal their true \n     identity, including their real names, family histories, and \n     even their gender;\n       (8) children who are victims of family abductions are often \n     denied the opportunity to attend school or to receive health \n     and dental care;\n       (9) child psychologists and law enforcement authorities now \n     classify family abduction as a form of child abuse;\n       (10) approximately 70 percent of local law enforcement \n     agencies do not have written guidelines for what to do in the \n     event of a family abduction or how to facilitate the recovery \n     of an abducted child;\n       (11) the first few hours of a family abduction are crucial \n     to recovering an abducted child, and valuable hours are lost \n     when law enforcement is not prepared to employ the most \n     effective techniques to locate and recover abducted children;\n       (12) when parents who may be inclined to abduct their own \n     children receive counseling and education on the harm \n     suffered by children under these circumstances, the incidence \n     of family abductions is greatly reduced; and\n       (13) where practiced, the flagging of school records has \n     proven to be an effective tool in assisting law enforcement \n     authorities find abducted children.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to provide for \nsecondary containment to prevent methyl tertiary butyl ether and \npetroleum contamination; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprevent chemicals that leak from underground storage tanks from causing \nenvironmental and public health damage. My colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Mr. Dingell, is introducing companion legislation.\n  Underground storage tanks can hold extremely toxic chemicals that can \nmove rapidly through soil, contaminating the ground, aquifers, streams \nand other bodies of water. Underground storage tanks are located in \nurban and rural areas. When they leak, they present substantial risks \nto groundwater quality, human health, environmental quality, and \neconomic growth.\n  There are approximately 700,000 underground storage tanks in the \nUnited States, and more than 430,000 confirmed releases from these \ntanks as of\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\nmid-2003. By and large, MTBE contamination has come from leaking \nunderground storage tanks. MTBE has contaminated water supplies in 43 \nStates. Twenty-nine States have drinking water contamination. Estimates \nindicate that it will cost at least $29 billion to clean up MTBE \ncontamination nationwide. Currently, the leaking underground storage \ntanks program and other laws ensure that responsible parties pay to \nclean up the damage caused by these leaking spills.\n  However, the best solution to leaking underground storage tanks is to \nprevent them from leaking in the first place with the use of secondary \ncontainment, such as double walls. There is already widespread support \nfor this throughout the country. Twenty-one States already require \nsecondary containment, either for all new or replaced tanks--such as in \nCalifornia, or for all new or replaced tanks in sensitive areas. In \naddition, two States are awaiting final passage or approval of such \nrequirements, and one State requires tertiary, such as triple walls, \ncontainment. According to figures from the Petroleum Equipment \nInstitute, 57 percent of all tanks installed from 2000 through 2003 \nwere double walled.\n  But this is not fast enough in the face of the threats to our \ndrinking and groundwater. Approximately 50 percent of the population \nrelies on groundwater for their drinking water. In 2000, 42 States had \nMTBE detected in soil or groundwater at gasoline-contaminated leaking \nunderground storage tank sites. The time to prevent contamination is \nnow.\n  We must ensure the environmental health and safety of our water. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2202. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to give \ndistrict courts of the United States jurisdiction over competing State \ncustody determinations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Feingold and \nSenator Lincoln to introduce the ``Bring Our Children Home Act,'' a \nbill to help the thousands of children who are abducted by family \nmembers and taken to a foreign country each year.\n  Despite an increasingly high level of Congressional and public \nconcern regarding international parental abduction and the wrongful \nretention of American children abroad, the situation facing American \nchildren and their left-behind parents in these cases has not improved \nand continues to be a serious problem.\n  The Bring Our Children Home Act would help prevent both domestic and \ninternational family abductions. Specifically, the bill would:\n  Establish a right of action in Federal court for resolution of child \ncustody disputes;\n  Give law enforcement the authority to detain any child who has been \nentered into the FBI's National Crime Information Center's database \nunder any category of the Missing Person File for 24 hours or until a \ndisposition can be made;\n  Amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to require information on \neach country's efforts to prohibit international child abduction;\n  Require federally-funded supervised visitation centers to provide \nservices in child custody cases wherein a State court finds that there \nis a risk of abduction and orders supervised visitation as a preventive \nmeasure; and\n  Most importantly, it would provide a national registry of custody \norders which would allow law enforcement the confidence to intervene in \nsituations and aid a custodial parent to be reunited with their child, \nor to stop an abduction in progress. The National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children is aware of cases in which law enforcement felt \nunable to intervene because parents represented conflicting orders. \nSuch conflict has lead to international abductions that could have been \nprevented.\n  As of May 31, 2003, the U.S. Department of State's Office of \nChildren's Issues was aware of 1060 international abduction cases, 904 \nopen abduction cases and 156 access cases, initiated by U.S.-based \nparents seeking a child's return or access to a child currently in a \nforeign country. The actual number of children being kept abroad is \nhigher than this, as these are open cases, not numbers of children. And \nnew cases are reported every week.\n  As international marriages have increased in recent decades, so have \naccusations of international child abduction according to Karolina \nWalkin, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman.\n  In a 2001 Contra Costa Times article, parents complained that the \nJustice Department has little interest in their international abduction \ncases and the State Department was unwilling to disrupt diplomatic \nrelations over abducted children. Written policy directs consular \nofficers to remain neutral, no matter the circumstances.\n  A 2000 General Accounting Office report noted that the FBI has made \nlimited use of the 1993 International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act. \nDespite at least 1,000 international parental abductions from the \nUnited States annually, the Bureau has prosecuted only 62 cases in 7 \nyears.\n  The Bring Our Children Home Act requires the Department of Justice \nand Department of State to report to Congress on International Parental \nKidnapping Crime Act warrants and extradition. We must make sure that \nwe are utilizing the tools that we have available to recover abducted \nchildren.\n  The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child \nAbduction is an international agreement among 54 nations, including the \nUnited States, that established civil procedures to follow when \nlocating, accessing, or returning abducted children.\n  This legislation would provide additional support for left-behind \nparents and it would ease their ability to bring resolution to their \ncase and their children home.\n  For countries that are not party to the Hague Convention, it is a \ncase- and country-specific matter. For example, in Saudi Arabia, a wife \nor child of a Saudi man may not leave the country without his prior \nwritten permission. There have been many cases in which adult female \nAmerican citizens have been unable to leave Saudi Arabia because they \nhave not been able to obtain the written permission of their male \nguardian, regardless of their constitutionally guaranteed rights as a \nU.S. citizen.\n  This legislation would require that the Department of State report to \nCongress on their progress in negotiating with countries who are not \npart of the Hague Convention, such as Saudi Arabia.\n  The ``Bring Our Children Home Act'' would be an important step in \nhelping these families reunite. It gives law enforcement the tools they \nneed to identify children illegally abducted by family members and \nreturn them home.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide assistance to combat HIV/AIDS in India, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmake India eligible for assistance under the Emergency Plan for AIDS \nRelief.\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\n  India is facing a critical moment. An estimated 4.58 million people \nare infected with the HIV virus in India and HIV/AIDS has been reported \nin almost all the states and union territories of the country. The \nepidemic is spreading rapidly from urban to rural areas and from high-\nrisk groups to the general population. Given India's size and the \nmobility of its population, there is a serious threat of catastrophe.\n  India's political leaders, public health officials, non-governmental \norganizations, and medical and scientific communities have taken \nimportant steps to combat HIV/AIDS. India, the world's largest \ndemocracy, has skilled governmental and civil society actors who are \ncommitted to a new awareness of the AIDS crisis and strategic \napproaches to combating the disease. But significant gaps remain in the \nIndian health care system's ability to address the full scope of the \ncrisis. These gaps require immediate and sustained U.S. engagement and \ncontribution of resources.\n  We must continue to expand the list of eligible countries in \nrecognition of the global nature of this pandemic. We must also \naccelerate assistance to African and Caribbean countries already \nincluded as focus countries. Finally, we must increase overall funding \nto combat HIV/AIDS. India is but one example of the enormity of the \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. But it is also an example of the opportunities for \nAmerica to reach out and find partners in combating this scourge. It is \nnot true that programs to fight AIDS cannot absorb more resources. \nThere is critical and urgent work to be done and committed \nprofessionals ready to do it. They just need our help.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of India has estimated that 4,580,000 \n     people in India are infected with the human immunodeficiency \n     virus (``HIV'') and cases of individuals with the acquired \n     immune deficiency syndrome (``AIDS'') have been reported in \n     almost all the states and union territories of India.\n       (2) The effort to combat the HIV and AIDS epidemic in India \n     has reached a critical point, as the epidemic is spreading \n     rapidly from urban to rural areas and from high-risk groups \n     to the general population.\n       (3) Political leaders, public health officials, non-\n     governmental organizations, and medical and scientific \n     communities in India have taken important steps to combat HIV \n     and AIDS in that country, but assistance from the United \n     States is urgently needed to enhance such efforts.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the addition of India as a country for which the \n     Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat \n     HIV/AIDS Globally has responsibilities under section \n     1(f)(2)(B)(ii)(VII) of the State Department Basic Authorities \n     Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a(f)(2)(B)(ii)(VII)) should not \n     decrease the amount of funding the Coordinator makes \n     available for assistance to any other such country;\n       (2) the United States should continue to increase the \n     number of countries eligible to receive assistance from the \n     United States to combat HIV and AIDS; and\n       (3) the United States should increase the total amount of \n     assistance available to combat HIV and AIDS.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE TO COMBAT HIV/AIDS IN INDIA.\n\n       Section 1(f)(2)(B)(ii)(VII) of the State Department Basic \n     Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 2651a(f)(2)(B)(ii)(VII)) \n     is further amended by inserting ``India,'' after ``Haiti,''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Cornyn, and Mrs. \n        Feinstein):\n  S. 2204. A bill to provide criminal penalties for false information \nand hoaxes relating to terrorism; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, since the September 11th attacks against \nour Nation, each of us is more conscious of our individual safety and \nsecurity. No example hit closer to home than when anthrax-infected \nletters made their way into Senators' offices. Senators, \nRepresentatives and staffers were forced to vacate offices, advised to \ntake strong antibiotics, and faced with the uncertainty of whether they \ncontracted a life-threatening disease.\n  In response to this vulnerability that is now inherent in our \neveryday lives, Congress has beefed up law enforcement and intelligence \ntools to combat terrorism better. The key to fighting terrorism is to \ntarget those planning terrorist acts and capture them before they can \nrealize their horrific goals. Our law enforcement communities have \nutilized the new tools we have provided them to respond in a dedicated \nand professional way to these new challenges.\n  Unfortunately, we are beginning to see a number of instances where \ncruel and depraved individuals have engaged in terrorist hoaxes. For \nexample, people have sent letters containing powder or sugar and a note \nstating that the recipient has now been infected by anthrax. These \nhoaxes are more than a bad joke. They require a substantial and costly \nresponse--evacuation of buildings, emergency medical tests or \ntreatment, and laboratory action. Hoaxes like these, which mimic \nterrorist acts, undermine public confidence by spreading panic and \nfear, and drain valuable resources from Federal, State, and local \ngovernment agencies which must respond to the hoax.\n  Under current Federal law, it is a felony to perpetrate certain \nhoaxes, such as saying there is a bomb on an airplane. It is also \nillegal to communicate a threat using the facilities of interstate \ncommerce that could cause personal injury to someone. However, because \nhoaxes related to anthrax or other Federal crimes do not always contain \nspecific threats, they may not be covered by current federal law. The \nCongressional Research Service has noted that this is a gap within the \ncurrent Federal code.\n  Clearly, there is a need for tough legislation to reflect the \nseriousness of this type of crime. This is why Senators Schumer, \nCornyn, Feinstein and I are introducing the Stop Terrorist and Military \nHoaxes Act of 2004. The legislation criminalizes conduct that conveys \nfalse or misleading information under circumstances where such \ninformation may reasonably be believed. The bill covers hoaxes related \nto biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons and other federal crimes \nthat do not contain specific or express threats.\n  In addition, this bill criminalizes intentionally false statements \nconcerning the death, injury, capture or disappearance of a member of \nthe United States Armed Forces. During the recent liberation of Iraq, \nthere were several cruel hoaxes played on family members of those who \nwere risking their very lives in the service of our country. Family \nmembers sacrifice alongside service men and women who place their lives \nin danger in the service of our country. Those family members deserve \nto be treated with respect and should be free from these cruel \ndeceptions. This bill makes sure that these malicious pranks can be \npunished appropriately.\n  America is engaged in a war on terrorisms. In addition to protecting \nour citizens from terrorist acts, we also need to take measures to \nensure that our law enforcement resources are not needlessly wasted by \nresponding to these offensive and expensive terrorist hoaxes. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 2205. A bill to authorize the extension of unconditional and \npermanent nondiscriminatory treatment (permanent normal trade relations \ntreatment) to the products of Ukraine, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to grant normal \ntrade treatment to the products of Ukraine. My brother, Congressman \nSander Levin, has introduced an identical bill in the House. We \nintroduced similar bills in the 107th Congress. It is our hope that \nenactment of this legislation, which builds upon and improves our \nprevious legislative efforts, will help build stronger ties between the \nUnited States and Ukraine.\n  Roughly three decades ago, the Jackson-Vanik amendment was included \nin the Trade Act of 1974. While relatively small in number of words, \nthis provision helped open up an entire society by exposing the \nrepressive tactics of the Soviet Union. By focusing attention on the \nemigration restrictions that the Soviet Union placed on its\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nJewish citizens, the Jackson-Vanik amendment reiterated American \nconcern about the wide-scale human rights abuses occurring in the \nSoviet Union. In the process, the Jackson-Vanik amendment played a \nvital role in changing Soviet society.\n  The values that for nearly thirty years governed our relations with \nthe Soviet Union, democracy, freedom and the rule of law, remain \nfundamental values to our nation. This bill seeks to address those \nconcerns while recognizing the anachronistic nature of applying \nJackson-Vanik to Ukraine. In addition, this bill provides Congress with \na meaningful and effective tool to ensure that U.S. interests are fully \naddressed in World Trade Organization negotiations for Ukraine.\n  Ukraine does allow its citizens the right and opportunity to \nemigrate. Ukraine has been certified as meeting the Jackson-Vanik \nrequirements on an annual basis since 1992 when a bilateral trade \nagreement went into effect. It is now time for the United States \nrecognize this reality by eliminating the Jackson-Vanik restrictions \nand granting Ukraine normal trading status on a permanent basis. Our \nbill does this while addressing traditional Jackson-Vanik issues such \nas emigration, religious freedom, restoration of property, and human \nrights. These are the issues that led to the creation of the Jackson-\nVanik amendment, and we should not ignore them at this time.\n  Ukraine has taken some steps toward the creation of democratic \ninstitutions and a free-market economy, but much more remains to be \ndone. The way in which Ukraine's October 2004 presidential elections \nare conducted will go a long way toward determining the future path \nthis important strategic partner and ally will take.\n  The world is closely watching the process and conduct of this year's \npresidential elections in Ukraine. Free and fair elections, regardless \nof their final outcome, will be an important step toward Ukraine's \nrapproachment with the community of nations. This election will be \nvital for the process by which it is conducted. Thus far, there remains \nreason for concern.\n  In Ukraine, there are many working to promote free and fair \nelections; however, the staff of many civic and non-governmental \norganizations are being harassed, intimidated and even physically \nharmed. In addition, members of the media are facing similarly hostile \nand life threatening situations. Just this month, Ukrainian affiliates \nof Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty have been taken off the air, \narrested and had their stations raided. Such actions are inexcusable \nand not in keeping with the fundamental values of freedom, openness and \nthe rule of law. It is my hope that the October 2004 elections will aid \nUkraine's transformation from a nation where fear undermines public \ndiscourse into a nation where all facets of society can freely engage \nin the market-place of ideas without fear of recrimination. The \nUkrainian people deserve no less.\n  Jackson-Vanik no longer applies to Ukraine and should be waived. But \nwe need to utilize other ways to address the many problems facing \nUkraine. I also hope that this legislation will remind Ukraine of the \nbenefits it can and will accrue when it rightfully assumes its place \namong those nations that are guided by democracy, transparency and the \nrule of law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S.J. Res. 29. A joint resolution proposing an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States which requires (except during time of \nwar and subject to suspension by the Congress) that the total amount of \nmoney expended by the United States during any fiscal year not exceed \nthe amount of certain revenue received by the United States during such \nfiscal year and not exceed 20 per centum of the gross national product \nof the United States during the previous calendar year; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the Federal \nGovernment's fiscal year 2005 budget, I can think of no better time to \ndiscuss the need for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nIt is for that reason that I stand before you today--to introduce a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  This is the same amendment that I have introduced in every Congress \nsince the 97th Congress. Throughout my entire tenure in Congress, \nduring the good economic times and the bad, I have devoted much time \nand attention to this idea because I believe that one of the most \nimportant things the Federal Government can do to enhance the lives of \nall Americans and future generations is to balance the Federal budget.\n  Our Founding Fathers, wise men indeed, had great concerns regarding \nthe capability of those in government to operate within budgetary \nconstraints. Alexander Hamilton once wrote that ``. . . . . there is a \ngeneral propensity in those who govern, founded in the constitution of \nman, to shift the burden from the present to a future day.'' Thomas \nJefferson commented on the moral significance of this ``shifting of the \nburden from the present to the future.'' He said: ``the question \nwhether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it \nimposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the \nfundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves \nunauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts and morally bound to \npay them ourselves.''\n  I completely agree with these sentiments. History has shown that \nHamilton was correct. Those who govern have, in fact, saddled future \ngenerations with the responsibility of paying for their debts. Over the \npast 30 years, annual deficits have become routine and the Federal \nGovernment has built up massive debt. Furthermore, Jefferson's \nassessment of the significance of this is also correct: \nintergenerational debt shifting is morally wrong.\n  Over the years, we have witnessed countless ``budget summits'' and \n``bipartisan budget deals,'' and we have heard, time and again, the \npromises of ``deficit reduction.'' But despite all of these charades, \nthe Federal budget remains severely out of balance today. The truth is, \nit will never be balanced as long as the President and the Congress are \nallowed to shortchange the welfare of future generations to pay for \ncurrent consumption. This is evidenced by the fact that I stood in this \nsame place, introducing this same legislation during both the 106th and \nthe 107th Congresses while the Federal budget was actually in balance. \nBut alas, I stand here today with an enormous Federal deficit and a \nballooning Federal debt.\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is the only certain \nmechanism to break the cycle of deficit spending and ensure that the \nGovernment does not continue to saddle our children and grandchildren \nwith the current generation's debts.\n  A permanently balanced budget would have a considerable impact in the \neveryday lives of the American people. A balanced budget would \ndramatically lower interest rates thereby saving money for anyone with \na home mortgage, a student loan, a car loan, credit card debt, or any \nother interest rate sensitive payment responsibility. Simply by \nbalancing its books, the Federal Government would put real money into \nthe hands of hard working people. Moreover, if the government demand \nfor capital is reduced, more money would be available for private \nsector use, which in turn, would generate substantial economic growth \nand create thousands of new jobs.\n  More money in the pockets of Americans and more job creation by the \neconomy can become a reality with a simple step--a balanced budget \namendment.\n  On the other hand, without a balanced budget amendment, the \nGovernment will continue to waste the taxpayers' money on unnecessary \ninterest payments. In fiscal year 2003, the Federal Government spent \nmore than $318 billion just to pay the interest on the national debt. \nThat is more than the amount spent on all education, job training, and \ncrime programs combined.\n  We might as well be taking these hard-earned tax dollars and pouring \nthem down the drain. I believe that this money could be better spent on \nimproving education, developing new medical technologies, finding a \ncure for cancer, or even returning it to the people who earned it in \nthe first place. But instead, about 15 percent of the Federal budget is \nbeing wasted on interest payments because advocates of big government \ncontinue to block all efforts to balance the budget.\n\n[[Page S2728]]\n\n  A balanced budget amendment to the Constitution can be the solution \nto this perpetual problem. A balanced budget amendment will put us on a \npath to paying off our national debt, which is currently more than $7 \ntrillion. This amendment will help ensure that taxpayers' money will no \nlonger be wasted on interest payments.\n  Opponents of a balanced budget amendment treat it as if it is \nsomething extraordinary. They are right, a balanced Federal budget \nwould be extraordinary. And I believe that adopting an amendment that \nwould require the Federal Government to do what every American already \nhas to do--balance their checkbook--is exactly what this country needs \nto prove that Washington is serious about accomplishing this \nextraordinary feat. A balanced budget amendment is simply a promise to \nthe American people that the Government will spend their hard-earned \ntax dollars responsibly. I think that we owe our constituents and \nfuture generations of Americans that much.\n  We do not need any more budget deals or false promises from \nWashington to reduce the deficit. What we need is a hammer to force \nCongress and the President to agree on a balanced budget, not just this \nyear, but forever. A constitutional amendment to balance the Federal \nbudget is the only hammer forceful enough to make that happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              S.J.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing the Sense of the Senate that the Citizens' Stamp Advisory \nCommission should issue a postage stamp honoring Diwali.\n  Diwali, known colloquially as the ``festival of light,'' is \ncelebrated annually in Indian communities worldwide. Diwali marks the \nbeginning of the Hindu New Year and signifies the renewal of life for \nall. Traditionally lasting five days, it is common practice for \ncelebrants to light small oil lamps, called diyas, and place them \naround the home and pray for health, knowledge, and peace. Light \nrepresents the triumph of good over evil, and signifies optimism for \nthe future.\n  Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, and Eid have already been recognized on \nUnited States postage stamps. It would be appropriate to add Diwali to \nthis distinguished list. It is a holiday about community, family, and \nhope for the future--qualities the Senate should highlight and embrace.\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States is in the grip of pervasively higher \n     home energy prices;\n       (2) high natural gas, heating oil, and propane prices are, \n     in general, having an effect that is rippling through the \n     United States economy and are, in particular, impacting home \n     energy bills;\n       (3) while persons in many sectors can adapt to natural gas, \n     heating oil, and propane price increases, persons in some \n     sectors simply cannot;\n       (4) elderly and disabled citizens who are living on fixed \n     incomes, the working poor, and other low-income individuals \n     face hardships wrought by high home energy prices;\n       (5) the energy burden for persons among the working poor \n     often exceeds 20 percent of those persons' incomes under \n     normal conditions;\n       (6) under current circumstances, home energy prices are \n     unnaturally high, and these are not normal circumstances;\n       (7) while critically important and encouraged, State energy \n     assistance and charitable assistance funds have been \n     overwhelmed by the crisis caused by the high home energy \n     prices;\n       (8) the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (referred to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') and the companion \n     weatherization assistance program (referred to in this \n     section as ``WAP''), are the Federal Government's primary \n     means to assist eligible low-income individuals in the United \n     States to shoulder the burdens caused by their home cooling \n     and heating needs;\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\n       (9) in 2003, LIHEAP reached only 15 percent of the persons \n     in the United States who were eligible for assistance under \n     the program;\n       (10) since LIHEAP's inception, its inflation-adjusted \n     buying power has eroded by 58 percent; and\n       (11) current Federal funding for LIHEAP is not sufficient \n     to meet the cooling and heating needs of low-income families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) an authorization of $3,400,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2005 and 2006 to carry out the LIHEAP program;\n       (2) an authorization of $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 \n     and $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 to carry out the WAP \n     program;\n       (3) appropriations, for these programs, of sufficient \n     additional funds to realistically address the cooling and \n     heating needs of low-income families, as well as the systemic \n     shortfalls that have plagued the programs and the eligible \n     individuals that the programs are designed to assist; and\n       (4) advance appropriations of the necessary funds to ensure \n     the smooth operation of the programs during times of peak \n     demand.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2788.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PRIORITIES FOR \n                   EDUCATION FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Education, 5,000 schools \n     have been identified for school improvement, making 2,500,000 \n     children eligible to transfer to a higher performing public \n     school.\n       (2) Section 1116(b)(1)(E) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6316(b)(1)(E)) requires a \n     school that has failed to make adequate yearly progress for 2 \n     consecutive years to provide an option for students to \n     transfer to a higher performing public school.\n       (3) The overwhelming majority of parents who have tried to \n     exercise their right to transfer their children to a higher \n     performing public school have been denied the transfer due to \n     a lack of capacity at these higher performing schools.\n       (4) Full funding for the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) (as amended by the No \n     Child Left Behind Act of 2001) will enable public schools to \n     address these capacity issues and will provide parents with \n     meaningful school choice.\n       (5) Full funding for the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (as amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of \n     2001) will enable low performing schools to improve by giving \n     the schools the resources to serve an additional 2,000,000 \n     disadvantaged students, hire an additional 100,000 highly \n     qualified teachers, and provide after school tutoring for an \n     additional 1,400,000 students.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary totals in this resolution assume that no \n     funds will be made available for new programs aimed at \n     transferring students into private schools until school \n     improvement programs under part A of title I, part A of title \n     II, part A of title IV, and parts A and B of title V, of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311 et seq., 6601 et seq., 7101 et seq., 7201 et seq., 7221 \n     et seq.)

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMPENSATION FOR \n                   EXPOSURE TO TOXIC SUBSTANCES AT THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation \n     Program Act of 2000 (42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.) (referred to in \n     this section as the ``EEOICPA'') is intended to ensure the \n     timely payment of uniform and adequate compensation to \n     covered employees suffering from occupational illnesses \n     incurred during their work for the Department of Energy.\n       (2) The Department of Labor is responsible for implementing \n     the provisions under subtitle B of the EEOICPA, relating to \n     claims for radiation related cancers, beryllium disease, and \n     silicosis. The Department of Labor has, within its area of \n     responsibility, processed over 95 percent of the 52,000 \n     claims it has received, and is processing these claims in an \n     average of 73 days.\n       (3) As of the date of enactment of this resolution, the \n     Department of Health and Human Services has not promulgated \n     the regulations required under section 3626 of the EEOICPA \n     for allowing claimants to petition to be members of the \n     Special Exposure Cohort. Special Exposure Cohorts provide a \n     presumption in favor of the claimant for radiation related \n     cancers if--\n       (A) it is not feasible to estimate radiation dose with \n     sufficient accuracy; and\n       (B) there is a reasonable likelihood that the health of the \n     class of workers may have been endangered.\n       (4) The Department of Energy, which is responsible for \n     implementing subtitle D of the EEOICPA, relating to \n     occupational illness caused by exposure to toxic substances \n     at Department of Energy facilities, finalized its regulations \n     on August 14, 2002. The Department of Energy has processed 1 \n     percent of the 22,000 claims received through the Department \n     of Energy physicians panels since its regulations were made \n     final.\n       (5) The Department of Energy has no willing payor for up to \n     50 percent of the claims that its physicians panels determine \n     to be related to exposure to a toxic substance at the \n     Department of Energy. As a consequence, many claimants with a \n     positive determination from the physicians panel will be \n     denied benefits.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States is in the grip of pervasively higher \n     home energy prices;\n       (2) high natural gas, heating oil, and propane prices are, \n     in general, having an effect that is rippling through the \n     United States economy and are, in particular, impacting home \n     energy bills;\n       (3) while persons in many sectors can adapt to natural gas, \n     heating oil, and propane price increases, persons in some \n     sectors simply cannot;\n       (4) elderly and disabled citizens who are living on fixed \n     incomes, the working poor, and other low-income individuals \n     face hardships wrought by high home energy prices;\n       (5) the energy burden for persons among the working poor \n     often exceeds 20 percent of those persons' incomes under \n     normal conditions;\n       (6) under current circumstances, home energy prices are \n     unnaturally high, and these are not normal circumstances;\n       (7) while critically important and encouraged, State energy \n     assistance and charitable assistance funds have been \n     overwhelmed by the crisis caused by the high home energy \n     prices;\n       (8) the Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n     (referred to in this section as ``LIHEAP'') and the companion \n     weatherization assistance program (referred to in this \n     section as ``WAP''), are the Federal Government's primary \n     means to assist eligible low-income individuals in the United \n     States to shoulder the burdens caused by their home cooling \n     and heating needs;\n       (9) in 2003, LIHEAP reached only 15 percent of the persons \n     in the United States who were eligible for assistance under \n     the program;\n       (10) since LIHEAP's inception, its inflation-adjusted \n     buying power has eroded by 58 percent; and\n       (11) current Federal funding for LIHEAP is not sufficient \n     to meet the cooling and heating needs of low-income families.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume--\n       (1) an authorization of $3,400,000,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2005 and 2006 to carry out the LIHEAP program;\n       (2) an authorization of $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2005 \n     and $500,000,000 for fiscal year 2006 to carry out the WAP \n     program;\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\n       (3) appropriations, for these programs, of sufficient \n     additional funds to realistically address the cooling and \n     heating needs of low-income families; and\n       (4) advance appropriations of the necessary funds to ensure \n     the smooth operation of the programs during times of peak \n     demand.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2811.

FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The export of agricultural products is of vital \n     importance to the economy of the United States.\n       (2) In 2002, agriculture was a large positive contributor \n     to the United States merchandise trade balance with a trade \n     surplus of $12,300,000,000.\n       (3) The growth of United States agricultural exports should \n     continue to be an important factor in improving the United \n     States merchandise trade balance.\n       (4) Increasing the volume of agricultural exports will \n     increase farm income in the United States, thereby protecting \n     family farms and contributing to the economic well-being of \n     rural communities in the United States.\n       (5) Although the United States efficiently produces high-\n     quality agricultural products, United States producers cannot \n     realize their full export potential because many foreign \n     countries deny fair and equitable market access to United \n     States agricultural products.\n       (6) The Foreign Agricultural Service estimates that United \n     States agricultural exports are reduced by $4,700,000,000 \n     annually due to unjustifiable imposition of sanitary and \n     phytosanitary measures that deny or limit market access to \n     United States products.\n       (7) The denial of fair and equitable market access for \n     United States agricultural products impedes the ability of \n     United States farmers to export their products, thereby \n     harming the economic interests of the United States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reduce or eliminate foreign unfair trade practices \n     and to remove constraints on fair and open trade in \n     agricultural products;\n       (2) to ensure fair and equitable market access for exports \n     of United States agricultural products; and\n       (3) to promote free and fair trade in agricultural \n     products.\n\n     SEC. 503. IDENTIFICATION OF COUNTRIES THAT DENY MARKET \n                   ACCESS.\n\n       (a) Identification Required.--Chapter 8 of title I of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2241 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 183.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Mexican Agricultural Trade \n     Compliance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides that, if \n     the United States Trade Representative determines that the \n     rights of the United States under any trade agreement are \n     being denied, the Trade Representative shall take action to \n     enforce such rights.\n       (2) The Statement of Administrative Action accompanying the \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act provided that the United States \n     Trade Representative would base any section 301 determination \n     as to whether there has been a violation or denial of United \n     States rights under the Uruguay Round Agreements on panel or \n     Appellate Body findings adopted by the Dispute Settlement \n     Body of the World Trade Organization.\n       (3) In a panel report adopted by the Dispute Settlement \n     Body on January 27, 2000, the Dispute Settlement Body \n     determined that section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 is not \n     inconsistent with United States obligations under the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements, particularly in light of the decision of \n     the United States to use section 301 only after exhausting \n     its rights under the Dispute Settlement Understanding.\n       (4) On January 28, 2000, a panel of the World Trade \n     Organization determined that Mexico's antidumping order on \n     high fructose corn syrup imported from the United States \n     violated Mexico's commitments under the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements.\n       (5) On February 24, 2000, the Dispute Settlement Body \n     adopted the report of the panel.\n       (6) On April 10, 2000, the United States and Mexico agreed \n     to a September 22, 2000, deadline for Mexico to come into \n     compliance with the panel report as adopted by the Dispute \n     Settlement Body.\n       (7) On September 20, 2000, just 2 days prior to the date \n     Mexico had agreed to come into compliance with the panel \n     report, Mexico issued a revised antidumping threat \n     determination in an obvious attempt to evade its commitment \n     to come into compliance with the panel report adopted by the \n     Dispute Settlement Body.\n       (8) On June 22, 2001, a panel, convened pursuant to Article \n     21.5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, found that \n     Mexico's revised antidumping threat determination failed to \n     bring Mexico into compliance with its commitments under the \n     World Trade Organization.\n       (9) On October 22, 2001, the Appellate Body affirmed the \n     ruling of the Article 21.5 panel and recommended that Mexico \n     come into compliance with its obligations under the World \n     Trade Organization.\n       (10) On November 21, 2001, the Dispute Settlement Body \n     adopted the Appellate Body ruling that affirmed the findings \n     of the Article 21.5 panel.\n       (11) On January 1, 2002, in a transparent attempt to evade \n     the determinations of the Dispute Settlement Body regarding \n     Mexico's antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup, and \n     in an affront to the rules-based system of the World Trade \n     Organization, Mexico imposed a de facto discriminatory 20 \n     percent tax on soft drinks containing high fructose corn \n     syrup, the intent and effect of which is to continue Mexico's \n     antidumping order on United States high fructose corn syrup \n     by other means by restricting access to the Mexican market.\n       (12) On April 20, 2002, with its discriminatory tax on soft \n     drinks containing high fructose corn syrup now in place, and \n     in a continuous event with the imposition of this tax, Mexico \n     lifted its antidumping order on high fructose corn syrup. \n     Importantly, Mexico lifted its antidumping order only after \n     ensuring that imports of United States high fructose corn \n     syrup would not enter the Mexican market due to the \n     imposition of the tax on soft drinks. Mexico's lifting of its \n     antidumping order enabled it to make the disingenuous claim \n     that it had come into compliance with the findings adopted by \n     the Dispute Settlement Body regarding Mexico's antidumping \n     order.\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\n       (13) The imposition of the tax on soft drinks and the \n     lifting of the antidumping order by Mexico are related \n     aspects of a unified effort by Mexico to deny the rights of \n     the United States with respect to the trade of high fructose \n     corn syrup.\n       (14) The effects of the import restrictions of Mexico's \n     antidumping order continue with even more egregious results \n     through the imposition of a 20 percent tax on high fructose \n     corn syrup. Imports of high fructose corn syrup from the \n     United States dropped from 110,893 metric tons in 2001 (the \n     year prior to the lifting of the antidumping order) to 4,868 \n     metric tons in 2002 (the first year of the tax).\n       (15) The United States has exhausted proceedings under the \n     Dispute Settlement Understanding, and the Dispute Settlement \n     Body has on more than 1 occasion adopted findings adverse to \n     Mexico.\n\n     SEC. 503.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRIBAL COLLEGES AND \n                   UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) American Indians from 250 federally recognized tribes \n     nationwide attend tribal colleges and universities, a \n     majority of whom are first-generation college students.\n       (2) Tribal colleges and universities are located in some of \n     the most isolated and impoverished areas in the Nation, yet \n     they are the Nation's most poorly funded institutions of \n     higher education. While the Tribally Controlled College or \n     University Assistance Act, or ``Tribal College Act'' provides \n     funding based solely on Indian students, the colleges have \n     open enrollment policies providing access to postsecondary \n     education opportunities to all interested students, about 20 \n     percent of whom are non-Indian. With rare exception, tribal \n     colleges and universities do not receive operating funds from \n     the States for these non-Indian State resident students. Yet, \n     if these same students attended any other public institutions \n     in their States, the State would provide basic operating \n     funds to the institution.\n       (3) While Congress has been increasing annual \n     appropriations for tribal colleges in recent years, the \n     President's fiscal year 2005 budget recommends a $5,500,000 \n     decrease in institutional operating funds. This represents \n     the third consecutive year that the President's budget \n     proposed decreases that Congress must restore.\n       (4) Because of congressional budget restorations, the \n     tribal colleges funded through titles I and II of the \n     Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act are \n     within $19,000,000 of full funding at their authorized level.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) this resolution recognizes the funding challenges faced \n     by tribal colleges and universities and assumes that priority \n     consideration will be provided to them through funding of the \n     Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, the \n     Equity in Educational Land Grant Status Act, title III of the \n     Higher Education Act, and the National Science Foundation \n     Tribal College Program; and\n       (2) such priority consideration reflects the intent of \n     Congress to continue to work toward statutory Federal funding \n     authorization goals for tribal colleges and universities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2832.

The Department of Energy has processed 1 \n     percent of the 22,000 claims received through the Department \n     of Energy physicians panels since its regulations were made \n     final.\n       (5) The Department of Energy has no willing payor for up to \n     50 percent of the claims that its physicians panels determine \n     to be related to exposure to a toxic substance at the \n     Department of Energy. As a consequence, many claimants with a \n     positive determination from the physicians panel will be \n     denied benefits. Many States, including Alaska, Colorado, \n     Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, New Mexico, Idaho, and \n     Nevada, may not have a willing payor.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) claims for occupational illness, which are determined \n     to be caused by exposure to toxic substances at Department of \n     Energy facilities under subtitle D of the EEOICPA, should be \n     promptly, equitably, and efficiently compensated;\n       (2) administrative and technical changes should be made to \n     the EEOICPA to--\n       (A) improve claims processing and review by physicians \n     panels to ensure cost-effective and efficient consideration \n     and determination of workers' claims;\n       (B) provide for membership in additional special exposure \n     cohorts; and\n       (C) address eligibility issues at facilities with residual \n     radiation; and\n       (3) the President and Congress should work together at the \n     earliest opportunity to develop a plan that effectively \n     resolves the issue of a lack of a willing payor for many \n     claims that are determined under subtitle D of the EEOICPA to \n     be related to exposure to a toxic substance at Department of \n     Energy facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2848.

Mr. President, I would like to announce for the \ninformation of the Senate and the public that the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental affairs \nwill hold a hearing entitled ``Profiteering In a Non-Profit Industry: \nAbusive Practices in Credit Counseling.'' The subcommittee intends to \nhold this hearing to address the problems facing the credit counseling \nindustry. Once community-based and consumer-friendly, the credit \ncounseling industry has undergone significant transformation during the \npast several years. New and aggressive profit-driven participants have \nentered the market, causing a rash of consumer complaints about high \nfees, misleading advertising, and poor service. The proliferation of \nfor-profit, ``back-office'' servicing companies is threatening to \nchange the industry into a debt collection mill instead of an industry \nwhose focus should be on consumer counseling and education. The \nsubcommittee's March 24 hearing will review the most egregious cases \nfor misconduct among credit counseling agencies and their for-profit \nservice providers and examine what solutions may be available to repair \nthe industry.\n  The hearings will take place on Wednesday, March 24, 2004, at 9 a.m., \nin room 342 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. For further \ninformation, please contact Raymond V. Shepherd III, Staff Director and \nChief Counsel to the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, at 224-\n3721.\n\n\n                subcommittee on public lands and forests\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Our \ndear friend Senator Reid has attended a funeral of one of his very \nclose friends today.\n  I want the Record to show the only reason he missed the votes and was \nnot here to help orchestrate our successful conclusion of the budget is \nbecause of his need to be in Nevada. I thought it was important we make \nnote of that in the Record.\n  I appreciate the majority leader yielding for that purpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/03/11/senate-section/article/S2752-6", "month": "03", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
