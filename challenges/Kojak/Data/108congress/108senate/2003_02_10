Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the nomination of Miguel Estrada to be a circuit judge \nfor the DC Circuit.\n  On Thursday we attempted to reach a consent agreement which would \nhave allowed for a vote on that nomination during today's session. \nUnfortunately, that consent was not granted last Thursday. However, it \nis still my hope to work with my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to set a time certain for a vote on the confirmation of this \nimportant nomination. I know there are additional Members who want to \nspeak on the nomination, and I hope they do so today, that they take \nadvantage of the opportunity, beginning in a few minutes, over the \ncourse of today.\n  I do want to express our willingness to go as long as necessary \ntonight to allow for that open discussion, that open debate, so \ncolleagues do have the opportunity to express their wishes.\n  I do want to make sure my colleagues understand it is our intent to \nfinish this nomination and vote on this nomination as early as possible \nthis week. I would love to have that opportunity to do so either later \ntonight or tomorrow--again recognizing that it is important people have \nthe opportunity to speak. Again, we are perfectly happy to stay here as \nlong as necessary tonight.\n  In addition, three district court judges were reported by the \nJudiciary Committee on Thursday. We are working towards an agreement \nfor a vote on one of those nominations this evening,\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\nor possibly all three nominations this evening. We will report shortly \nafter discussion with the leadership on both sides of the aisle, but we \nexpect the first vote to be at 5:15 this afternoon.\n  Also, as a reminder, the current continuing resolution is set to \nexpire on Friday of this week. We are still hoping the appropriators \nwill complete their work on the conference report and therefore the \nSenate would consider the conference report later this week, as soon as \nit becomes available.\n  We are also attempting to clear several important items that are on \nthe Legislative Calendar. Each may require a short period of debate \nthis week and a rollcall vote. Thus, we have a very full week over the \nnext 5 days. Senators should expect a busy session this week and, \nindeed, as I mentioned earlier, late nights are possible. It is likely \nthat there will be several late nights this week, including tonight if \npeople will take advantage of that, in terms of discussing and bringing \ntheir views to the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, while the majority leader is in the Chamber, \nfirst, on the vote on the judges, the ranking member of the committee, \nSenator Leahy, has said he is aware of the three judges and he would \nlike a rollcall vote on each of the three and that you and Senator \nDaschle can work on the time of when at least the first will occur this \nevening.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me remind the Senator, I would like to do all three \nthis evening. We can plan on having the first vote at 5:15 and then we \ncan discuss about the other two. I think it would be our intent to have \nall three tonight.\n  Mr. REID. Fine.\n  I also say to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, the majority \nleader, last week there were a number of problems, as the leader is \naware. There were memorial services--it was difficult to have people \nspeak. Also, it was difficult to get some Democrats to speak because \nthe distinguished chairman took a lot of time speaking. It was hard to \nwork in other people.\n\n  With that in mind, and with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee in the Chamber, what I would like to do is arrange some times \nfor people to speak today so we do not have people waiting around and \nso the chairman of the committee and ranking member know who is \nplanning on coming. If it is appropriate, I will give those times to \nboth the leader and to the chairman. The ranking member, Senator Leahy, \nis here and he is available all of the day, of course, if necessary.\n  But from 1 to 2, Senator Feinstein would like to be able to speak; \nfrom 2 to 2:45, Senator Kennedy would like to speak; from 3 to 4 \no'clock, Senator Schumer would like to speak; and Senator Levin would \nlike to speak after that until the vote. And then Senator Feingold \nwould like to speak at 5:30. They may not use all this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me say, first, I appreciate the assistant Democratic \nleader outlining that. It is very important that we hear from people \nwho have very important things to say. It is really a matter of time \nmanagement at this juncture, so I very much appreciate it. If we could \njust have a gentleman's agreement for those times without locking it \nin, and then allowing the chairman and ranking member to determine the \nspecifics of those times, but it sounds agreeable to me.\n  Mr. REID. That sounds like a good idea.\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, it is not our side of the aisle I think at this \npoint that will do the majority of talking. We have a number of Members \nwho want to speak as well. But our goal is to have an up-or-down vote \non this important nomination after sufficient time as judged by the \nother side of the aisle and our side of the aisle.\n  I encourage, once again, the Senator to continue scheduling just as \nhe has done, which I appreciate, but to go as long today as he is \ncomfortable doing because we want to make sure he has that opportunity. \nBut it is my intention to bring this matter to a vote as soon as \npractical as we go forward.\n  Mr. REID. I also say to the distinguished majority leader and the \ndistinguished Chair of the committee that one of the things we are \nconcerned about--and we know there has been very little time used on \nthe debate so far, as the Senator knows, and as Senator Daschle stated \npublicly, the Democrats have not decided whether there is going to be a \nfilibuster. That is something the majority leader and Senator Daschle \ncan speak about later today. But I ask for the cooperation of the \nmajority; that, in effect--and I don't mean this to be a derogatory \nterm--no games be played. If somebody steps off the floor in the next \nfew hours, I hope the question would not be called on this nomination \nuntil we get into a more--I want to use the right word. Until we get \ninto a more competitive phase of this debate, I hope there would not be \nanything like that done.\n  Could I have the assurance of the chairman of the committee that in \nfact would be the case?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think for today, of course, we will agree \nto that. But again, I want to come back to the fact of whether it is \ncompetitive and the accusations of a filibuster going back and forth. \nThat is going to sort of occur.\n  Let me just say on the part of the chairman and myself that as long \nas we are having good participation, it is important--not just \nlistening to people because they want to get out and talk for an hour, \nwhich looks like a filibuster--to the American people that we work in \ngood faith to come to what I hope will be a fair up-or-down vote in a \nreasonable period of time, and games are not in order and are not to be \nplayed. At the end of the day, we expect no filibuster--again, that is \na decision which will be made on your side--because the American people \ndeserve better. If there is insistence on a filibuster, we will use \neverything within our power being in the majority under the Senate \nrules to bring this to an up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. REID. One last thing I would like to say is we are having, as the \nmajority leader knows, a conference committee meeting of the \nAppropriations Committee at 6:30 this evening. There are still a number \nof open issues. We will hear from Senator Stevens and others. But this \nthing has moved along significantly over the weekend.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will close.\n  We have the opportunity of a very productive and very useful week. \nWhen you look at the continuing resolution and completing the \nappropriations bills with the omnibus package and the three judges \ntonight, if we can finish the Estrada nomination early enough in the \nweek, there are two other bills we are working on, including the Moscow \ntreaty. There is other legislation that is to follow. We have the \nopportunity of a very productive week before going out on recess. We \nhave to keep the train moving.\n  The reason why I mention that is, if members want to talk on the \nother for 30 minutes or 45 minutes each tonight, we want to make that \nopportunity available, and we hope the other side will seize that \nopportunity since we express that willingness.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from Tennessee yield for \njust a moment, the distinguished majority leader?\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. A couple of things should be mentioned.\n  As the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada has noted, we have a \ncommittee of conference on the appropriations this evening, which is a \nvery significant one because of the level of appropriations bills being \nrolled into one. A number of us who might speak on the floor are also \non that committee. Senior members of the Appropriations Committee have \nto be at the meeting. Some have said and others have commented about \ngames-playing here. I don't think the distinguished majority leader or \nthe distinguished acting Democratic leader would want to do that. I \nwould suggest just for my friend--looking around the floor--having been \nhere longer than anybody else on the floor right now, in the majority \nfour or five times, and four or five times in the minority with very \ndistinguished majority leaders, Senator Mansfield, Senator Byrd, \nSenator Baker, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Mitchell--\n  Mr. REID. Senator Dole.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And Senator Dole, and also having served as minority \nleader\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\nback and forth--all of them realized that anyone can come down at any \nmoment of inattention and, using the rules, gain a one-time advantage. \nWith all the distinguished leaders, I never saw a single one of them do \nthat, even when over and over again they had an opportunity to do it. \nMany times when I was chairman of the Agriculture Committee, when I was \nchairman of Judiciary Committee, when I was chairman of the Foreign \nOperations Committee, and when I was chairman of a number of others, we \nwould have hotly contested issues and cases where the ranking Member, \nthe only other person on the floor, had to leave the floor for a phone \ncall or something like that. And, of course, I always protected their \nrights. That is something that has been done. It is the role of the \nmajority leader, of course, to try to move legislation forward. It has \nalways been my feeling, whether being in the majority or in the \nminority, that the majority leader should do that. I think we can. But \nI also think everybody should realize that last week was a rather \nextraordinary week with, first, the services in Houston, and then the \nservices at the National Cathedral, and then the Republicans had a \nconference where they had to go on Friday. A lot was chopped into that \nweek.\n  I have already said the three judges which are on the Executive \nCalendar--those which were actually going to be put over by the \nRepublicans initially in the executive markup--I said to the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, let us go ahead and vote them out so \nwe can get them on the floor. But also the majority leader may not be \naware of the fact--at least from some of his statements--that during 17 \nmonths we did get through 100 of President Bush's judges and got all of \nthem confirmed on the floor. I know the distinguished Senator from Utah \nwould like to come close to that record, a record that was not achieved \nwhen the Republicans were chairing that committee and when President \nClinton was here. I know he would want to try for that now. Of course, \nI would be happy to go forward on those and vote those three out. There \nwill be rollcall votes. I realize that last year sometimes we had 10 or \n12 at a time by voice vote. I think that escaped the attention of the \npress, the White House, the Republican Senate campaign committee, and \nothers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2067-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n               CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will now resume \nexecutive session and the consideration of Executive Calendar No. 21, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia Circuit.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, of course, there are not going to be any \ngames played. Nobody on this side wants to play games. This is \nimportant stuff. We understand there are those on the minority side who \ndo not agree with this nomination. They have a right to not agree. But \nthey have a right to vote against Miguel Estrada if that is what they \nreally think is right.\n  On the other hand, should there be a filibuster it will be the first \nfilibuster in history against an inferior court, the circuit court of \nappeals or the district court.\n  With regard to the 100 nominees that made it through in the last few \nyears, that was a very good record, primarily just for judges. I am \nmore interested in how many are left over. I am more interested in how \nwe reduce the number of holdovers. Let us hope we can do that. I am \ngoing to do everything in my power to do it, and I hope I will have the \ncooperation of those on the minority side in trying to do what is \nreally our job; that is, to put the President's--whoever the President \nis--nominees through. We always have someone on both sides who wants to \nslow the process down. We understand that. But hopefully we can get \npeople of goodwill to not slow the process down and to not filibuster \nthis wonderful Hispanic judge named Miguel Estrada.\n  Mr. President, in that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a \nWashington Post editorial entitled ``Filibustering Judges'' be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2003]\n\n                          Filibustering Judges\n\n       ``Tell Senators: Filibuster the Estrada Nomination!'' cries \n     the Web site of People for the American Way. The subject is \n     President Bush's nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to a seat on \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Democratic \n     senators may not need much encouragement. With the Estrada \n     nomination due to come to the Senate floor today, they are \n     contemplating a dramatic escalation of the judicial \n     nomination wars. They should stand down. Mr. Estrada, who is \n     well qualified for the bench, should not be a tough case for \n     confirmation. Democrats who disagree may vote against him. \n     They should not deny him a vote.\n       Senators have on occasion staged filibusters on judicial \n     nominees, but none has ever prevented a lower-court nominee's \n     confirmation, the White House says. And that's good, It's \n     hard enough to get swift Judiciary Committee action and floor \n     votes for judicial nominees. The possibility of a filibuster \n     probably checks rash or overly partisan nominations; one can \n     imagine candidates so wrong or offensive that the tactic \n     would be justified. but a world in which filibusters serve as \n     an active instrument of nomination politics is not the either \n     party should want.\n       Mr. Estrada's nomination in no way justifies a filibuster. \n     The case against him is that he is a conservative who was \n     publicly criticized by a former supervisor in the Office of \n     the Solicitor General, where he once worked. He was not \n     forthcoming with the committee in its efforts to discern his \n     personal views on controversial issues--as many nominees are \n     not--and the administration has (rightly) declined to provide \n     copies of his confidential memos from his service in \n     government. Having failed to assemble a plausible case \n     against him, Democrats are now arguing that this failure is \n     itself grounds for his rejection--because it stems from his \n     own and the administration's discourteous refusal to arm \n     Democrats with examples of the extremism that would justify \n     their opposition. Such circular logic should not stall Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination any longer. It certainly doesn't warrant \n     further escalating a war that long ago got out of hand.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to take a few moments this morning to respond \nto some of the allegations that Miguel Estrada lacks support in the \nHispanic community. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Young men and women from Mexico, Central and South America, who come \nto the United States--sometimes with their parents, sometimes without--\nhave helped to build this country. There is no question about it. They \nhave mined our mines. They have built our railroads. They have worked \non the roads. They have advanced themselves in education. They are now \ndoctors, lawyers, and filling positions in virtually every walk of life \nin this country, and rightly so.\n  They struggled in a foreign country to make a better life, and the \ngifts they have brought to this Nation are what has made this Nation a \ngreat nation. And they still do today. The Hispanic community leaders I \nhave worked with over the years consider Miguel's success as their \nsuccess. And they know that all young Latinos across the country--\nwhether they live in border town colonia, a barrio in Chicago, or \nMiami's Calle Ocho--need role models such as Miguel to emulate.\n  Miguel arrived in this country with his mother at age 14. He lived in \na modest home, and his parents worked hard to send him to private \nschools. There is no crime in that. In fact, many Latino families work \ntwo and three jobs just to be able to send their children to private \nschools, which are usually Catholic schools. That is no crime. In fact, \nthe Catholic schools are among the best schools in this country. I do \nnot blame any parent for wanting to send their children to Catholic \nschools. They learn a lot of important things in Catholic schools. It \nis a sign of a Hispanic parent's love and dedication, and it is a \nmanifestation of Latino values at their best.\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\n  Latino groups that oppose Miguel's confirmation--notably, the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Puerto Rican Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, and the Democratic Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus--argue that the courts lack Hispanic representation. That is \nalways interesting to me. They are constantly arguing that there are \nnot enough Hispanics on our Federal courts, but they are not looking \nfor diversity--these three groups. They only want Hispanic judges who \nlook, think, and act like them. That is pretty apparent in this case.\n  A good judge is one who understands that there are competing \ninterests which must be balanced within the rule of law. Miguel Estrada \nis exceedingly capable of making that assessment. And every Latino in \nthis country--and every person in this country--ought to appreciate \nthat fact and ought to be very proud of what this young man has done \nwith his life. Of course, he wants to administer the law fairly. And I \nknow he will.\n  A review of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus's statement in \nopposition is most disappointing to me. It was issued in advance of \nMiguel Estrada's hearing. My colleagues in the House, who have argued \npersuasively for a fair process, decided that Miguel Estrada was not so \nentitled. They pronounced judgment beforehand. But that should not \nsurprise us. That caucus is a Democratic machine, or a Democratic Party \nmachine, to be a little more accurate.\n  The Republican members of the caucus were forced out because they did \nnot think and act like their Democratic counterparts. So you have a \npurely partisan Democrat Party machine over in the House that did not \neven listen to Estrada before they made this pronouncement and this \njudgment.\n\n  There are no Republican members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. \nYou would think they would want to get together with Republicans and, \nin a joint way, in a bipartisan way, work not only for and on behalf of \nthe Hispanic community, but for and on behalf of everybody in this \ncountry.\n  The Democrat Congressional Hispanic Caucus may oppose Miguel Estrada, \nbut the Republican Congressional Hispanic members--Lincoln Diaz-Balart, \nIleana Ros-Lehtinen, Henry Bonilla, Mario Balart--they all support his \nconfirmation, and they support him very strongly, as they should--and \nso should our Democratic friends in the House.\n  Ordinarily, I would think they would come out of their chairs in \nleading the charge to try to help Miguel Estrada, but, for some reason, \nthey are not doing it. And I suspect that the reason is Miguel does not \nlook, think, and act like they do.\n  There is a lesson in this, and it is a hard one to take. Hispanic \nAmericans have fought hard to counter injustices, to demand respect and \nequality of opportunity. They have fought hard all these years they \nhave been in this country. Indeed, the second oldest Hispanic \norganization in the country, the American GI Forum, came into existence \nin 1948, when a fallen war hero was refused a proper burial in Texas \nbecause he was a Mexican. Similarly, LULAC, established in 1927, and \nthe National Council of La Raza, established in 1968, came into \nexistence to ensure equality of opportunity for all Hispanic Americans, \nleaving a legacy for generations to come.\n  But today that legacy is threatened as this community, once united by \na common vision and a shared experience--sadly, one of discrimination--\nfinds itself divided along party lines in what appears to be purely \npolitical purposes--at least on the side of those who oppose Miguel \nEstrada. In the process, it is subjecting one of their own, Miguel \nEstrada, to a ``Latino'' litmus test, and subjecting him to the very \ntype of discrimination they have fought so hard to eradicate. There is \nno place in the judicial nomination process for single litmus tests.\n  I have taken that position the whole time I have been on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, or at least have tried to. Others may disagree \nwith me, but I do not believe any single litmus test should stop a \nperson who is otherwise qualified. And Miguel Estrada is not only \nqualified, Miguel Estrada is one of the most qualified people we have \never seen to come before the Judiciary Committee.\n  I think the judicial process is one that must remain free of single-\nissue litmus tests and politicization, in particular. I urge groups \nsuch as MALDEF and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to think back a \ncouple of years to the pending nomination of Richard Paez. I was not \nhappy with the way that was handled, and I was the one who was trying \nto get him through.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I worked hard to ensure the \nprocess was fair. In the early stages it was not fair, in my opinion. \nHe deserved a vote, and I made sure he got one. It took years to get \nit. And there were some reasons--some legitimate reasons--why some \nopposed Paez. I do not see one legitimate reason why anybody would \noppose Miguel Estrada. Miguel deserves a vote.\n  Reasonable people can disagree on how one might vote in this \ninstance, but I call upon these organizations to step forward with the \nsame fervor and intensity that drove their campaigns to call for a vote \nfor Richard Paez. I urge them and my colleagues to recommit to a \nprocess that is fair, that is free from double standards and partisan \npolitics.\n\n  Look at this I have in the Chamber. Yes, there are three \norganizations--and there may be a few more; they are certainly all the \nleft-wing anti-Bush judge organizations that crop up on every circuit \ncourt of appeals nominee--that are opposed to Miguel Estrada. But the \nLatino people are for him, and they do not like these games being \nplayed.\n  Some have suggested he is not Hispanic enough. That is a joke: He is \nnot Hispanic enough; he has not been in this country long enough--even \nthough he has been here since he was 14 years of age, and earned his \nway, and graduated with honors from Columbia University, and in the \nhighest part of his class in law school at Harvard University. Not many \npeople can claim that.\n  He worked for two judges, and yet one of the arguments is that he \ndoes not have any judicial experience. We, more or less, blew that away \nlast week when we brought out how many judges, great judges in our \ncountry's history, never were judges before they were nominated and \nconfirmed.\n  But what they ignore is that Miguel Estrada has been a clerk for two \njudges. His judicial experience is a lot more than that of most people \nwho come through the Judiciary Committee, I will tell you that right \nnow. But it is not critical that a person have judicial experience. It \nmay be helpful in certain cases, but it is not critical. Some of the \ngreatest judges in history--and I will just cite Brandeis as an \nillustration--never had prior judicial experience other than \nperipherally. And in Miguel's case, he was actually a law clerk for two \nmajor Federal judges.\n  He clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court. Talk about judicial \nexperience. How many have clerked for the U.S. Supreme Court? Not very \nmany. You can go down through the ridiculous arguments they are using \nagainst him, and it is pitiful. This man has the highest rating--I \nmight add it is unanimously the highest rating--of the American Bar \nAssociation, which, according to my colleagues on the other side when \nthey were upset about some of the others, was their gold standard.\n  I have to admit I did not think the American Bar Association did a \nvery good job in bygone days. I have to admit today I think they are \ndoing a better job, and I support them for it. I applaud them for it. \nBut it is not easy to get a unanimously well-qualified, highest rating \nfrom the ABA, and that is a lot more than some of the critics would \never get.\n  Let's go to the Clinton circuit judges with no prior judicial \nexperience:\n  Judge David Tatel, Judge Merrick Garland, both on the DC Circuit, \nwhere Miguel Estrada will go; Sandra Lynch, First Circuit; Guido \nCalabresi, Second Circuit Court of Appeals; Robert Sack, Second \nCircuit; Sonia Sotomayor, Second Circuit; Robert Katzman, Second \nCircuit--these are all pretty darn good judges--Thomas Ambro, Third \nCircuit; Blane Michel, Fourth Circuit; Robert King, Fourth Circuit; \nKaren Nelson Moore, Sixth Circuit; Eric L. Clay; Dianne Wood; Kermit \nBuye; Eighth Circuit; Sidney Thomas; M. Margaret McKowen, Ninth \nCircuit; William Fletcher, Ninth Circuit; Raymond Fisher, Ninth \nCircuit; Ronald Gould;\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nMarcia Berzon; Richard Talman, Ninth Circuit; John E. Rawlinson, Ninth \nCircuit; B. Robert Henry; Carlos Lucero; William Bryce on Federal \nCircuit; Arthur Gajarsa; Richard Lynn; Anthony B. Dyk.\n  Many of these judges were appointed by Democratic Presidents--all \nwithout judicial experience and serving well in the circuit courts of \nthis country. That is not even talking about the Judge Brandeis, and \nothers who have served with such distinction throughout the years.\n  I would like to go to the other chart. I will make one or two points \nthere. I want to talk about those who support Miguel Estrada. These are \ngreat organizations:\n  League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic \norganization in the country; Hispanic National Bar Association, which \nworks very hard to try to get good Hispanics nominated in both parties; \nU.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, one of the oldest and most \nprestigious Hispanic associations in the country; Association for the \nAdvancement of Mexican Americans--they are all important to \nassociations--the Latino Coalition; Mexican American Grocers \nAssociation; Hispanic Contractors Association; IntraAmerican College of \nPhysicians and Surgeons; Congregacion Cristiana y Misionera ``Fey \nAlabanza''; American GI Forum; Casa De Sinaloense; Cuban American \nNational Foundation; Hispanics Business Roundtable; Nueva Esperanza, \nInc.; MANA, a national Latino organization; Cuban American Voters \nNational Community; Cuban Liberty Council; Federation of Mayors of \nPuerto Rico; Puerto Rican American Foundation.\n  I wonder why there is one Puerto Rican organization that is not for \nhim when the rest are. It is not hard to see why the Democrat-\ncontrolled Hispanic Caucus in the House is not for him--because they \nare partisan, and they are controlled, in large measure, in these \nmatters by left-wing groups in Washington and are continually unfairly \ninterfering with President Bush's nominees. They are against everybody \nPresident Bush nominates for the circuit court of appeals--or at least \nalmost everybody. So far, my impression is that they are against \nevery one of his circuit court nominees, unless they have been \nDemocrats.\n\n  This President has nominated more Democrats, as I understand it, than \nany Republican President in recent years, in order to reach out to \nDemocrats and try to bring them along. They have been good people, and \nI have certainly supported them, as have I think all of my colleagues.\n  Now, it is outrageous for some of these partisan Hispanic leaders to \nsay that Miguel Estrada is ``not Hispanic enough'' or that he has no \njudicial experience and therefore he should not serve. Let's just think \nabout that. He has no judicial experience; therefore, he should not \nserve. What does that say to all of the Hispanic lawyers in this \ncountry who don't have any judicial experience and might want to serve \nin the Federal circuit courts someday? It basically says you don't have \na chance, in the eyes of the people who take that attitude, because you \ndon't have any judicial experience--in spite of the fact that many \nFederal judges didn't have any experience and some of the greatest \njudges in history have not had judicial experience.\n  Miguel Estrada had judicial experience in serving two Federal judges, \none a Supreme Court Justice. I get a little tired of some of this \n``anti-Miguel-Estrada syndrome'' that seems to be going on. I know \nMiguel Estrada. He is a terrific human being, and he is qualified. He \nhas been given the highest rating the ABA gives. He has the support of \nvirtually all the Hispanic groups in the country, except for the few I \nhave mentioned. Miguel Estrada would make a wonderful Federal Circuit \nCourt of Appeals judge. He would add a great deal to the Circuit Court \nof Appeals for the District of Columbia, which only has 8 judges of the \n12 seats there right now, and they cannot keep up with the workload.\n  We ought to all be working hard to put Miguel Estrada on the bench. I \nam afraid there are those who don't want him there because they are \nafraid he would be on the fast track to the Supreme Court. That may be, \nbut the fact is we are talking right now of the Circuit Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened with interest as my friend \nfrom Utah has made arguments against the Democrats using the old thing \nof the straw man debate. I have heard a lot of arguments the Senator \nfrom Utah says we make against Mr. Estrada, but I have not heard them \nfrom us. I did hear some interesting things. He has expressed his \nsupport for Judge Richard Paez. After blocking it for several years, \nthe Senator from Utah did vote for him. I commend him for that. It is \ninteresting, however, that he does not speak of the strong opposition \nto Judge Paez by the Republicans. A very large number of their votes \nwere against him, and the fact that he was blocked by the Republicans \nyear after year after year, while the nominee was here, that, the \nSenator from Utah suggests, is legitimate; whereas there seems to be a \nstrong suggestion that if Democrats were to talk only a few days about \nMr. Estrada, and some may even vote against him, that is not \nlegitimate.\n  I also note that it is easy to accept the arguments if you don't put \nall the facts forth. For example, the charge of the distinguished \nSenator from Utah--take one judge, Sonia Sotomayor of the Second \nCircuit. He puts her down as a Clinton circuit judge with no prior \njudicial experience. In fact, she did have prior judicial experience. \nShe had been appointed originally by the first President Bush as a \nFederal court judge.\n  In an example, when time and time and time again President Clinton \nnominated people for the court of appeals and other judicial nominees \nwho had been appointed by Republican Presidents--something we have \nnever seen in this administration and probably won't--but I know of at \nleast three members of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals who were \nappointed by Republican Presidents versus district court judges, two by \nPresident Bush, one by President Reagan. All were then elevated to the \ncourt of appeals by President Clinton.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor, of course, was held up by Republicans for a \nconsiderable period of time, even though she had originally been \nappointed to be a Federal judge by President Bush, contrary to what the \nchart of my friends, the Republicans, says. It is in absolute \ncontradiction to what they said. She was blocked for a very long time \nby Republicans, and when she finally was able to get a vote, 29 voted \nagainst her.\n  Let's be honest about what happened. Judge Sotomayor, a superb judge, \nwas appointed first by a Republican to the district court bench, not, \nas my friends say, someone with no experience, and President Clinton \nnominated her to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. She was blocked \ninitially by the Republicans, and they finally allowed it through, but \n29 voted against her.\n  With Judge Paez, 39 voted against him. In fact--this is an \ninteresting fact on Judge Paez. I wonder if everybody is aware of the \nfact that initially Republicans filibustered a motion to proceed to his \nappointment to the Circuit Court of Appeals. I heard mention somewhere \nthat this never happened, that there were not any kind of delaying \ntactics on district court or Circuit Court of Appeals nominees, but on \na motion to proceed, something Democrats did not block in any way with \nJudge Estrada, Republicans did. Fifty-three of them voted against that \nmotion. I am surprised the Senator from Utah does not remember that \nfact because he is one of the 53 who voted against proceeding to bring \nup Judge Paez. I say this just to make sure we have accuracy in our \ndebate.\n  Debate on this nomination began last week on Wednesday, within \nseconds of the Senate adopting S. Res. 45, to honor the Space Shuttle \nColumbia astronauts, and after we observed a moment of silence. Many of \nus were not on the floor Thursday because we were attending a memorial \nfor the space shuttle astronauts at the National Cathedral.\n  I thank those who did participate in the debate last week. I commend \nto the Senate and to the American people the remarks of Senator Reid, \nSenator Kennedy, and Senator Schumer, each of whom added important \ndimensions and perspectives to this debate.\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\n  I also wish to take a personal moment to commend the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada, Harry Reid. While he is not a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, he spoke so eloquently on this subject and was able to carry \non the debate while others of us, as I said, had to be at the very \nsorrowful memorial service for our astronauts.\n  I had hoped that at some point in the last 2 years or so we would \nhave seen an effort on the part of the President and others to seek to \nunite rather than divide. Instead, we see a continuation of dividing \nthe American people, as deeply as we have seen the 19 members of the \nJudiciary Committee divided. Many of us would like to know the record, \nwould like to have a strong confidence in the type of judge Mr. Estrada \nwill be, and be able to vote in favor of this nomination.\n  Since I have been in the Senate, I have voted on hundreds of \nnominees--Republican nominees--to the Federal judiciary. I suspect I \nhave voted for more Republican nominees to the Federal judiciary than \nmost of my friends on the other side of the aisle have voted for \nDemocratic nominees. I do not need any lectures on how we should be \nbipartisan. In fact, when I was chairman, we were able to get 100 \nnominations through the committee and to the floor, any one of which of \nPresident Bush's nominees could have been stopped simply by not \nbringing the person up for a vote. We got through 100. Whether I agreed \nwith or was against the person, I felt that at least we had a record so \nwe knew what this person thought. We are being asked, after all, to \nuphold our oath of office and vote to confirm somebody to a lifetime \nposition. The reason we are asked to do that is the judiciary is \nsupposed to be outside the political realm. The judiciary is supposed \nto be independent and is supposed to be for all Americans and is \nsupposed to be lifetime positions, positions for which most of us who \nvote on them will not be in the Senate for the full terms of these \njudges. So we have to at least look at the nominees if we are going to \nanswer to the American people. There are 275 million Americans. They \nexpect an independent Federal judiciary. They know this country has a \nreputation of having the most independent Federal judiciary, and there \nare only 100 of us, however, who can represent those 275 million \nAmericans and use our imprimatur and our vote to confirm. We put forth \nan imprimatur for the whole country that this is somebody who will \nmaintain the independence of the judiciary and will not be somebody who \ncomes to the Federal bench with an ideological agenda, and we say that \nbecause we have looked at the people.\n\n  That is not the record before the Judiciary Committee, and it is not \nthe record before the Senate on Miguel Estrada. I remain concerned he \nis going to be an activist on the court, especially when one looks at \nthe very determined efforts, not only of the nominee but of the \nadministration, to keep information from the Senate. It is typical of \nso many of these nominees. The White House has made absolutely no \neffort--absolutely no effort--to try to work out any kind of a \nbipartisan understanding on these judges. In fact, it has done just the \nopposite. They have stonewalled any request for information.\n  Frankly, I am sorry my friends on the other side of the aisle are \nwilling to accept this with absolutely no information, even to having a \nvote in the committee with several members of the committee never even \nhaving sat in on what hearing there was on Miguel Estrada. It is a case \nof ``don't ask because we know you won't tell, so we will just go along \nwith it.'' ``Don't ask, you're not going to tell, we'll just go along \nwith it.''\n  There was an interesting editorial cartoon in Roll Call this morning \nshowing, like a meatpacking business, Federal judges coming down this \nassembly line and the Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nstamping OK, OK, OK, similar to the way beef is stamped for the USDA.\n  Unfortunately, that does not help the American public. People can \nvote for or against Mr. Estrada as they want, but they should at least \nhave some idea of on what they are voting, not this ``don't ask because \nwe won't tell.''\n  We are being asked to consider a nominee with no judicial experience, \nwith little relevant practical experience, who is opposed by many \nHispanic leaders and organizations and many other Americans.\n  While he counts Justice Scalia, former Judge Kenneth Starr, and Ted \nOlson among his friends and mentors, information about his \ndecisionmaking or what his values are, what he brings to this court, \nare locked away from any Senate consideration.\n  Last week I met with leaders of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, \nthe Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Puerto Rican \nLegal Defense and Education Fund, Hispanic labor leaders, and they all \ntold me they oppose this nomination. I was impressed by that because \nthese are leaders who have come to me and other Senators over the years \nand have strongly backed Hispanic judicial nominees.\n  We have 10 Hispanic judges on the courts of appeals now. Eight of \nthem were appointed by President Clinton. I know they were all backed \nby these Hispanic leaders. In fact, there were a number of other \nHispanic judges who were also nominated by President Clinton who were \nalso backed by the organizations, and unfortunately, the Republicans \nwould not allow them to even come to a vote in the committee, say \nnothing about coming to a vote on the floor of the Senate.\n  Notwithstanding the number who were blocked by Republicans from ever \neven coming to a vote, President Clinton did appoint more Hispanics to \nthe Federal bench than any President before him.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters in opposition \nto Mr. Estrada from MALDEF and other Hispanic organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and \n           Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project,\n                                                 January 29, 2003.\n     Re opposition to the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. \n         Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member: On behalf of the \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) \n     and Southwest Vote Registration and Education Project \n     (SVREP), we write you on a matter of great importance to not \n     only the Latino community but all Americans--the nomination \n     of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. As \n     you may know, our organizations weigh in on judicial \n     nominations with varying frequency; although we are \n     consistently and firmly committed to the view that the \n     selection of federal judges for life-long appointments who \n     will serve as the balance to the legislative and executive \n     branches is critically important to our community. As a \n     community, we recognize the importance of the judiciary, as \n     it is the branch to which we have turned to seek protection \n     when, because of our limited political power, we are not able \n     to secure and protect our rights through the legislative \n     process or with the executive branch. This has become perhaps \n     even more true in light of some of the actions Congress and \n     the executive branch have taken after 9/11, particularly as \n     these actions affect immigrants.\n       After an extensive review of the public record that was \n     available to us, the testimony that Mr. Estrada provided \n     before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the written \n     responses he provided to the Committee, we have concluded at \n     this time that Mr. Estrada would not fairly review issues \n     that would come before him if he were to be confirmed to the \n     D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. As such, we oppose his \n     nomination and urge you to do the same.\n       While the appointment to any Federal bench is important to \n     our community, appointments to circuit courts become even \n     more important when the Supreme Court accepts fewer than 100 \n     cases a year to hear. Thus, circuit courts are often the last \n     arbiters on determining the rights of individuals and \n     communities. The D.C. Circuit is perhaps even more important \n     than the other circuit courts because of the role it plays in \n     reviewing an extensive amount of Federal agency actions, from \n     regulatory actions to the orders and decisions of various \n     Commissions and Boards. It has been reported that nearly half \n     of the D.C. Circuit's caseload consists of appeals from \n     federal regulations or decisions.\n       In the memorandum attached, we outline a number of the \n     areas which lead us to oppose Mr. Estrada's nomination. Our \n     research and analysis cover a wide array of constitutional \n     legal issues that affect not only the Latino community, but \n     all Americans, including the First Amendment, the \n     Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment (Miranda), and due\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\n     process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. Our review also \n     covers such additional issues as racial profiling, \n     affirmative action programs, immigration, and abusive or \n     improper police practices, particularly when those \n     practices are adopted under the ``broken windows'' theory \n     of law enforcement. Finally, our critique of Estrada \n     includes an analysis of his views on such issues as \n     standing for organizations representing minority \n     interests, claims by low-income consumers, labor rights or \n     immigrant workers, and the right of minority voters under \n     the Voting Rights Act.\n       MALDEF sent the full Senate Judiciary Committee and the \n     White House a memorandum outlining these concerns prior to \n     Mr. Estrada's hearing. We believe the burden to address the \n     concerns we raised rested with the nominee, Mr. Estrada, and \n     the Judiciary Committee gave Mr. Estrada ample opportunity to \n     address them. Ultimately, Mr. Estrada had the affirmative \n     obligation to show that he would be fair and impartial to all \n     who would appear before him. After reviewing the public \n     record, the transcript of the hearing, and all written \n     responses submitted by Mr. Estrada, we conclude that he \n     failed to meet this obligation. He chose one of two paths \n     consistently at his hearing and in his written responses: \n     either his responses confirmed our concerns, or he chose not \n     to reveal his current views or positions.\n       We must in good conscience oppose the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Based on the \n     record available, we conclude that he would not fairly review \n     matters before him as a judge in a number of areas that will \n     have a great impact on our community. We urge you to oppose \n     this nomination to a life-long appointment to the second most \n     important court in the country. The power is too great to \n     place in the hands of someone who has not shown that he would \n     be fair in all cases that come before him.\n           Sincerely,\n     Antonio Gonzalez,\n       President, Southwest Voter Registration and Education \n     Project.\n     Antonia Hernandez,\n       President and General Counsel, Mexican American Legal \n     Defense and Education Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Mexican American Legal Defense\n\n\n                                         and Educational Fund,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 2003.\n\n        Press Statement by Marisa J. Demeo, Regional Counsel, DC\n\n\n   maldef expresses serious concerns about state of federal judicial \n nominations--announces opposition to nomination of miguel estrada to \n                    the dc circuit court of appeals\n\n       (Washington, DC).--The U.S. government system is set up as \n     a checks and balances system, among the executive, \n     legislative and judicial branches of our government. Since \n     the founding of this country, the interests and rights of \n     minorities, whether they be religious minorities, racial \n     minorities, or other groups of people who do not have the \n     power of the majority on their side, have been difficult to \n     protect. During the civil rights struggle in this country, it \n     was the courts which ensured that the values contained in our \n     Constitution were preserved even for those who did not have \n     equal representation or an equal voice in the legislative or \n     executive process.\n       Today, Latinos number 37 million residents in the U.S. \n     Despite this growing demographic presence, we have never had \n     someone serve as the President of this country, and we remain \n     the only minority group that is underrepresented in our \n     federal work force. We have no Latinos serving in the Senate, \n     and only twenty-two Latinos in the House of Representatives. \n     At the state level, we have a little more representation but \n     still are significantly underrepresented. For example, out of \n     all the Governors in this country, only one is Latino.\n       MALDEF serves as the lawyer for the Latino community across \n     this country in our courts. As such, we have established two \n     major goals for our community to shape the federal \n     judiciary--often, the only place where we have a chance to be \n     heard and have our rights protected. The first goal is to \n     increase the presence of Latino lawyers on the federal bench. \n     Only about 5% of those serving as judges in our federal \n     courts are of Hispanic background. When we number 12.5% of \n     the population, there is a lot of room for improvement. On \n     this score, President Bush has to do a better job.\n       Our second goal, which is as important as the first, is \n     that we want judges appointed to the federal courts who will \n     be fair to our community and the issues we must bring before \n     the courts. The issues we must bring to the court are often \n     complex and controversial--including such issues as \n     discrimination, affirmative action, racial profiling, and use \n     of excessive force by law enforcement. We need judges who \n     will approach these issues by objectively and fairly \n     evaluating the law and the facts, and not judges who come to \n     the courtroom already convinced that our arguments are \n     without merit. President Bush has failed our community on \n     this score as well, as too many of his nominees come to the \n     process with set ideological beliefs that they cannot set \n     aside.\n       The most difficult situation for an organization like mine \n     is when a President nominates a Latino who does not reflect, \n     resonate or associate with the Latino community, and who \n     comes with a predisposition to view claims of racial \n     discrimination and unfair treatment with suspicion and doubt \n     instead of with an open mind. Unfortunately, the only Latino \n     who President Bush has nominated in two years to any federal \n     circuit court in the country is such a person. President Bush \n     nominated Miguel Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. After a thorough examination of his record, his \n     confirmation hearing testimony, and his written answers to \n     the U.S. Senate, we announce today our formal opposition to \n     his nomination. We cannot in good conscience stand on the \n     sideline and be neutral on his nomination or others like his. \n     We oppose his nomination and that of others that will prevent \n     the courts from serving as the check and balance so \n     desperately needed by our community to the actions being \n     taken by the executive and legislative branches.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As national Latino civil rights \n     organizations, we write on a matter of great importance to \n     U.S. Latinos, and all Americans--the nomination of Miguel \n     Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Although \n     historically we have expressed our views on judicial nominees \n     with different levels of frequency, we are united in our view \n     that all federal judicial appointments are important because \n     they are life-long appointments, because they are positions \n     of great symbolism, and because federal judges interpret the \n     U.S. Constitution and federal laws serving as the balance to \n     the legislative and executive branches of the federal \n     government. While the Supreme Court is the highest court, the \n     appellate courts wield considerable power. During its most \n     recent term, the Supreme Court heard only 83 cases, while the \n     circuit courts decided 57,000 cases. As a practical matter, \n     circuit courts set the precedent in most areas of federal \n     law.\n       We are united at this time around our belief that Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination deserves full, thoughtful, and \n     deliberate consideration. The President proposes to place Mr. \n     Estrada, who has no judicial experience, on arguably the \n     single most important federal appeals court to decide a \n     myriad of statutory and regulatory issues that directly \n     affect the Latino community. Every appointment to a powerful \n     court is important as we recently witnessed in the Supreme \n     Court's 5-4 decision in Hoffman Plastics that stripped \n     undocumented workers of certain labor law protections. This \n     decision, which inevitably will result in increased \n     exploitation of the undocumented, as well as weaker labor \n     standards for all low-wage workers, underscores the \n     importance of nominations such as this one, not just to \n     Hispanics, but all Americans.\n       This decision comes on the heels of a series of Supreme \n     Court decisions which, in our view, have unnecessarily and \n     incorrectly narrowed civil rights and other protections for \n     Latinos. While we look to see if judicial nominees meet \n     certain basic requirements such as honesty, integrity, \n     character, temperament, and intellect, we also look for \n     qualities that go beyond the minimum requirements. We look to \n     see if a nominee, regardless of race or ethnicity, has a \n     demonstrated commitment to protecting the rights of ordinary \n     U.S. residents and to preserving and expanding the progress \n     that has been made on civil rights, including rights \n     protected through core provisions in the Constitution, such \n     as the Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause, as \n     well as through the statutory provisions that protect our \n     legal rights.\n       We are aware that some are demanding a commitment from you \n     and the Judiciary Committee to announce a date certain for \n     action on Mr. Estrada's nomination. We agree with the \n     proposition that every nominee deserves timely consideration. \n     For this reason, we urged the Senate to act on the nomination \n     of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     who was forced to wait for four years before being confirmed. \n     We also believe, however, that if a nominee's record is \n     sparse the Judiciary Committee should allow sufficient time \n     for those interested in evaluating his record, including the \n     U.S. Senate, to complete a thorough and comprehensive review \n     of the nominee's record. We therefore respectfully request \n     that you consider scheduling a hearing no earlier than \n     August, prior to the scheduled recess. This leaves sufficient \n     time for action prior to adjournment if his record is strong \n     enough to receive substantial bipartisan support.\n       In the interim, we pledge to conduct a fair and thoughtful \n     assessment of Mr. Estrada's record, and to communicate our \n     views on his nomination to you, Ranking Member Hatch, and \n     other Committee members in a timely manner.\n           Sincerely,\n     Antonia Hernandez,\n       President and General Counsel, Mexican American Legal \n     Defense and Educational Fund.\n     Manuel Mirabal,\n       President, National Puerto Rican Coalition.\n     Raul Yzaguirre,\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\n       President, National Council of LaRaza.\n     Juan Figueroa,\n       President and General Counsel, Puerto Rican Legal Defense \n     and Education Fund.\n     Arturo Vargas,\n       Executive Director, National Association of Latino Elected \n     and Appointed Officials.\n                                  ____\n\n         California LaRaza Lawyers & Mexican American Legal \n           Defense and Educational Fund,\n                                               September 24, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of Latino legal and civil \n     rights organizations, we write you on a matter of great \n     importance to not only the Latino community but all \n     Americans--the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. As you may know, our organizations \n     weigh in on judicial nominations with a variety of frequency; \n     however, we are all firmly committed to the view that the \n     selection of federal judges for life-long appointments who \n     will serve as the balance to the legislative and executive \n     branches is critically important to our community. As a \n     community, we recognize the importance of the judiciary, as \n     it is the branch to which we have turned to seek protection \n     when, because of our limited political power, we are not able \n     to secure and protect our rights through the legislative \n     process or with the executive branch. This has become even \n     more true in light of some of the actions of the legislative \n     and executive branches after 9/11 as these actions affect \n     immigrants in particular.\n       After an extensive review of the public record that was \n     available to us, we have concluded at this time that we have \n     serious concerns about whether Mr. Estrada would fairly \n     review issues that would come before him if he were to be \n     confirmed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. While the \n     appointment to any federal bench is important to our \n     community, appointments to circuit courts become even more \n     important when the Supreme Court accepts fewer than 100 cases \n     a year to hear. Thus, circuit courts are often the last \n     arbiters on determining the rights of individuals and \n     communities. The D.C. Circuit is perhaps even more important \n     than the other circuit courts because of the role it plays in \n     reviewing an extensive amount of federal agency actions, from \n     regulatory actions to the orders and decisions of various \n     Commissions and Boards. It has been reported that nearly half \n     of the D.C. Circuit's caseload consists of appeals from \n     federal regulations or decisions.\n       Some of us have stated during the previous Administration \n     that we believe in a nominee's right to have a hearing. Many \n     of us pushed in the past for hearings, with mixed success, \n     for such Latino nominees as Richard Paez, Sonia Sotomayor, \n     Enrique Moreno and Jorge Rangel. We still believe it is right \n     to give a nominee a hearing once his or her public record has \n     been explored to the fullest extent possible. That is why we \n     support the Judiciary Committee's decision to have a hearing \n     on Mr. Estrada. This public hearing will give Mr. Estrada, \n     the Senate and the public a chance to hear from Mr. Estrada \n     himself about the concerns that we and others have about his \n     nomination.\n       In the memorandum attached, we outline a number of the \n     areas which lead us to have our grave concerns about Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination. Based on our research, but is unclear \n     whether he would be fair to Latino plaintiffs as well as \n     others who would appear before him with claims under the \n     First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment \n     (Miranda), and the process clauses of the U.S. Constitution. \n     Further, we found evidence that suggests that he may not \n     serve as a fair and impartial jurist on allegations brought \n     before him in the areas of racial profiling, immigration, and \n     abusive or improper police practices where those practices \n     are adopted under the ``broken window theory'' of law \n     enforcement. We also have concerns about whether he would \n     fairly review standing issues for organizations representing \n     minority interests, affirmative action programs, or claims by \n     low-income consumers. We are also unsure, after a careful \n     review of his record, whether he would fairly protect the \n     labor rights of immigrant workers or the rights of minority \n     voters under the Voting Rights Act.\n       We believe the burden to address these concerns lies with \n     the nominee, Mr. Estrada. The Judiciary Committee should ask \n     questions about these issues and give Mr. Estrada an \n     opportunity to address the concerns. Ultimately, Mr. Estrada \n     has the affirmative obligation to show that he would be fair \n     and impartial to all who would appear before him. We hope you \n     will be able to gather information at the hearing as to \n     whether he meets this affirmative burden.\n       We look forward to the hearing and anticipate we could have \n     further recommendations to you once we have had a chance to \n     fully evaluate the answers that Mr. Estrada provides to the \n     Committee at the hearing and afterward.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chistopher Arriola,\n       California LaRaza Lawyers.\n     Antonia Hernandez,\n       Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Latino labor leaders made this point: They say Mr. Estrada \nis a stealth candidate whose views and qualifications have been hidden \nfrom the American people and from the Senate. He has refused to answer \nimportant questions about his views and his judicial philosophy. They \nsay it would be simply irresponsible to put him on the bench, and that \nis true.\n  To go back to some of the judges my good friend from Utah, the senior \nSenator from Utah, has talked about, Judge Richard Paez was a man \nstrongly supported by his home State Senators. He was supported by \nevery single Hispanic organization, and he was made to wait 1,500 days \nfor a vote. I think a lesser person would have said: I am not going to \nstand, I am not going to do it. But with the very strong support he had \nfrom the Hispanic community, he did not want to let them down. He did \nnot want to let down his family.\n  I talked with him many times during that time and encouraged him to \nstay with it. Elections came and went and he held on. Finally, he was \ngiven a vote. President Clinton had to get reelected as President to \nhave this happen. When we hear how great it was that they put him \nthrough finally, after 5 years of total humiliation, and that is 5 \nyears during which he was endorsed by every single Hispanic \norganization that spoke, he was allowed to come to a vote, but almost \n40 Republicans voted against him.\n  I talked about Judge Sonia Sotomayor. This is somebody who had a \nunanimous well-qualified rating from the ABA, the highest rating \npossible. One would think this would have been a slam dunk. She was \nsupported by every Hispanic organization. She had first been appointed \nto the Federal bench by the first President Bush. This should have been \nvery easy, but every time we wanted to bring her up for a vote on the \nfloor, there was an anonymous hold on the Republican side. Nobody \nwanted to step forward.\n  I will step up and state my opposition to Miguel Estrada. I feel that \nis only fair. I do not believe in anonymous holds. But every time we \ntried to bring up Sonia Sotomayor, a person who is listed by my friend \nfrom Utah as being one of the marks of excellence, a Republican would \nput on an anonymous hold, not even come forward and say, look, I want a \ndebate against this person.\n  She finally came to a vote. Twenty-nine Republicans voted against \nthis outstanding person. To his credit, my friend from Utah voted for \nher. I do appreciate that, and I complimented him at that time.\n  Even though President Clinton appointed 80 percent of the Hispanic \ncircuit judges that are now on the court, there would have been more. \nHe appointed two from Texas to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno of Texas. What happened? No \nRepublican voted against them, to their credit. But why? They never \nreceived a hearing or a vote. They were never allowed to come to a \nvote. So nobody had to vote against them. They were backed by every \nsingle Hispanic group that I know of.\n  Before we say, oh, my gosh, what are we doing to this poor Hispanic \nAmerican, here are two who were backed by every single Hispanic group, \nhad high ratings, nominated to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit, and they were never allowed to have a vote.\n  Christine Arguello of Colorado was nominated to the Tenth Circuit. As \nI recall, she was backed by every single Hispanic group there was. She \nwas never allowed to have a vote.\n\n  What I tried to do during the slightly over a year I was able to be \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I wanted to bring back some \nfairness to the confirmation process. I tried to address the vacancies \nwe inherited as a result of a refusal to have votes on President \nClinton's nominees. I brought a number of them forward. I also said I \nwould not agree to this idea of anonymous holds, something that had \nblocked so many of these Hispanic judges.\n  Late last week President Bush nominated one more Hispanic American to \nthe Fifth Circuit. That is good; he has now nominated two, which is, of \ncourse, a fraction, two-thirds, of those\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nwho were blocked from votes during the last administration.\n  It is not Senate Democrats who have created a confrontation over the \nEstrada nomination. It begins on the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. \nI told this to the distinguished majority leader again this morning, \nthat I have tried to work with the White House to see if there is some \nway we might move this process back to the kind of bipartisan process \nit was when I first came to the Senate, and that it was under both \nRepublican and Democratic leadership for a long time but which it is \nnot now.\n  I have urged the White House to make an effort to unite rather than \ndivide and then we might go somewhere, but there is a deafening silence \nfrom the other side of the Pennsylvania Avenue. I do not think they \nreally care. I think they see court packing as being an answer to \nright-wing ideologues. I think they see that there should be a \npolitical move on the major Federal courts that, even though that would \ndestroy their independence, even though that would diminish \nsubstantially the integrity of the Federal courts, they think it should \nbe an ideological court packing.\n  We see this coordinated effort to impose a narrow ideology on our \nFederal courts. The President campaigned saying that Justices Scalia \nand Thomas are his model nominees, and that is what he would use as a \nmodel for whomever he appoints. The Estrada nomination is evidence of \nthat. Justice Scalia particularly was a nominee who is not only \nstrident in his views but refused to share them with the Senate before \nhis confirmation. Senators on both sides of the aisle stood up and said \nthey were concerned with this stonewalling and they would not stand for \nit in the future. At least one side of the aisle has stuck with that.\n\n  Now, last year there was a panel discussion at the Federalist Society \nluncheon in which Lawrence Silberman and others discussed the strategy \nof saying nothing in confirmation hearings. The report was that Judge \nSilberman offered the same advice he had given Antonin Scalia when \nScalia was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1986: Keep your mouth \nshut. Mr. Estrada has followed that to the letter.\n  I ask, why is the record for the Senate's consideration being kept so \nthin? The answer is, so the White House can have it both ways. They \nchoose nominees based on narrow judicial ideology but insist the Senate \nproceed without considering it and, if possible, without knowing it. \nSecrecy and intimidation are the preferred methods of operation.\n  Anyone who had any remaining doubt about the criteria used by the \nWhite House to select judicial nominees need only consider the \nadmissions, including news reports over the last couple of weeks \nfollowing the reports in late January of Robert Novak and White House \nCounsel Alberto Gonzales's role in crafting the administration's brief \nopposing the University of Michigan affirmative action case. There have \nbeen a series of reports of a ``loud whispering campaign'' in which \nright-wing conservatives touted Miguel Estrada as a safer, more \nreliable, conservative Hispanic for the President to nominate to the \nSupreme Court in lieu of Alberto Gonzales.\n  Why? Pure and simple: Ideology; and a belief that you can nominate \nsomebody who will vote not as an independent member of the Judiciary \nbut as a Republican and--more than that--be part of the small, very \nconservative coterie of the Republican Party, and do it consistently \nand predictably.\n  I went to law school. As a lawyer, I argued a lot of cases before \nFederal courts. You assume the judge will be independent and will not \ntreat anyone one way or the other depending upon their political party, \nbut that he or she will decide the case based on the facts. This \napparently is no longer enough for this administration. They want a \nRepublican judge who will vote as a Republican who will be consistent \nand predictable. In other words, if you are a Democrat coming before \nthe Federal court or if you do not eschew a particular Republican \nideology when you come before that court, you are not going to get \nindependent treatment. That is wrong.\n  USA Today noted that when the Bush administration did not go as far \nas GOP hardliners wanted in opposing the University of Michigan's \naffirmative action program, some blamed Gonzales. That has led to an \nunusually aggressive whispering campaign. Conservative activists have \nbeen successful in persuading President Bush to nominate hardline \ncandidates, but lower courts made it clear to reporters that George W. \nBush and others do not believe Gonzales is Supreme Court material. They \ngo on to report conservatives also touting Miguel Estrada, native of \nHonduras and former Justice Department lawyer, who has been nominated \nby President Bush to serve on the U.S. appeals court in Washington, DC.\n  The administration seeks to have it both ways. They want to take \ncredit with the Federalist Society when they nominate ideological \nnominees, but they also want to pretend to the American public that \nideology does not matter.\n  I ask this: If ideology does not matter to the Republicans, why did \nthey obstruct scores of President Clinton's nominees to the courts, \nincluding several to the DC Circuit? If ideology does not matter, why \ndid Republicans vote in lockstep against Justice Ronnie White of \nMissouri to be confirmed to the district court? If ideology does not \nmatter, why did Republicans filibuster the nominations of Justice \nRosemary Barkett to the Fifth Circuit, Judge H. Lee Sarokin to the \nThird Circuit in 1994, Judge Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon to the \nNinth Circuit in 2000? To say we would never do this obscures the \nrecord and blurs the rationale.\n\n  Let me share with the Senate an account of Republican use of ideology \nin connection with judicial nominations. There was a column in the Wall \nStreet Journal in the summer of 1998 explaining the anonymous \nRepublican holds on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals. I worked hard for 2 years on that \nnomination. It is my circuit. It is the circuit court I argued in front \nof when I was in private practice. I was astounded when Republicans \nheld her up for months without a vote. I could not understand why such \nan outstanding nominee was being stalled by Republicans. After all, she \ninitially was appointed to the Federal bench by a Republican President. \nNot only that, she had an outstanding record as a judge and, before \nthat, an outstanding record in private practice and an outstanding \nrecord as a prosecutor.\n  What was not to like about this Hispanic woman appointed initially by \na Republican and now nominated by a Democrat? She had been confirmed by \nthe Senate to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New \nYork in 1992 after being nominated by the first President Bush. She \nstarted in a housing project in the Bronx. She then attended Princeton \nUniversity and Yale Law School. She worked for more than 4 years at the \nNew York District Attorney's Office as assistant district attorney. She \nwas in private practice in New York.\n  So then Mr. Gigot explained to all what was the problem behind the \nclosed doors of the Republican Cloakroom. Republicans were fearful, if \nshe were confirmed quickly, she could be in line to be nominated to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Gigot wrote:\n\n       If liberals do prevail, the president could turn to 43-\n     year-old district court judge Sonia Sotomayor. She's every \n     Republican's confirmation nightmare--a liberal Hispanic woman \n     put on the district bench by George Bush.\n\n  That was what the Republicans and the Wall Street Journal editorial \nwriters said.\n  Then the Wall Street Journal followed up, based on what they had been \ntold by the Republican Cloakroom. They editorialized a few days later \nand issued these instructions. I recall, when we were issued \ninstructions and the majority leader, George Mitchell, put together a \nplan that brought about a balanced budget, they said it would bring \nabout economic ruin. We then had 8 years of the most spectacular rise \nin our economy and the highest employment we ever had.\n  They issued instructions on June 8, 1998. We would like to think the \nRepublicans may be having second thoughts and are deliberately delaying \nher confirmation to see whether Justice Stevens announces his \nretirement when the current Court term ends this month.\n  The reason for the delay was confirmed by a subsequent report in the \nNew York Times. That is just one of\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\nscores of nominations the Republicans have delayed or stalled or \ndefeated because of ideology in recent years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the May 29, \n1998, column and the June 8, 1998, editorial in the Wall Street \nJournal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 18, 2002]\n\n              Visible Absence of Latinos on Federal Courts\n\n(By Antonia Hernandez, President and General Counsel, Mexican American \nLegal Defense and Education Fund, Los Angeles\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Your editorials claim that Senate Judiciary Chairman \n     Patrick Leahy is taking too long to confirm Miguel Estrada to \n     the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals position that is often \n     viewed as a stepping stone to the Supreme Court (``No \n     Judicial Fishing,'' June 11 and ``The Estrada Gambit,'' May \n     24).\n       Yet no mention was made of the delays for Latino-nominated \n     judicial candidates to the circuit courts during the Clinton \n     administration under a Republican-controlled Senate. It took \n     four years to confirm the nomination of Judge Richard Paez to \n     the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and he had to be \n     nominated three times. In two instances, the Senate did not \n     even schedule a hearing for two eminently qualified Latinos \n     to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals: Enrique Moreno and \n     Jorge Rangel, whose nominations languished and died in the \n     Judiciary Committee.\n        The Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund \n     (MALDEF) believes it is unfortunate the federal judiciary \n     remains predominantly white and male. Latinos are visibly \n     absent from the Supreme Court and many of the federal \n     appellate courts. but just being Latino is not enough. At the \n     end of the day, the decisions made by these individuals apply \n     to all regardless of race, ethnicity, gender or immigrant \n     status.\n       The fact that a nominee is Latino should not be a shield \n     from full inquiry, particularly when a nominee's record is \n     sparse, as in Mr. Estrada's case. It is vital to know more \n     about a nominee's philosophies for interpreting and applying \n     the Constitution and laws.\n       It is also important for Latinos to raise questions about \n     how a nominee's views might affect our community. MALDEF is \n     not seeking to stall Republican nominees. During President \n     Bush's first year, two Latinos whom MALDEF supported were \n     nominated and have been confirmed. We have met with White \n     House officials and asked them to nominate more Latinos. To \n     date, President Bush has nominated only one Latino to the \n     circuit court.\n       We firmly believe that all judicial nominees should have \n     hearings once their records have been adequately examined in \n     a fair and impartial manner.\n       Individuals appointed to the federal bench, a lifetime \n     appointment, must meet basic requirements such as honesty, \n     integrity, character and temperament.\n       But the inquire must not stop there. We must also look to \n     the nominee's record as it reflects his/her demonstrated \n     understanding and commitment to protecting the rights of \n     ordinary residents and to preserving and expanding the \n     progress that has been made on civil rights, including rights \n     protected through core provisions in the Constitution, such \n     as the equal protection clause and the due process clause, as \n     well as through the statutory provisions that protect our \n     legal rights.\n       Since 9/11, America has been embroiled in a serious public \n     debate about who we are as Americans and what are the limits \n     of our freedoms, who should enjoy the protections of our \n     laws, and what rights are to be extended or denied to \n     Latinos.\n       When the Supreme Court recently stripped immigrant workers \n     of important employee protections (Hoffman Plastics), Latinos \n     inquired why their voices mattered so little when so much was \n     at stake. Many asked why Latinos have had so little \n     representation in a judiciary that has the power to shape \n     their lives. Legitimate debate is integral to the judicial \n     selection process, and therefore it is legitimate to have \n     this debate within the context of confirming individuals who \n     are supposed to serve as impartial referees in this public \n     debate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 29, 1998]\n\n            Supreme Politics: Who'd Replace Justice Stevens?\n\n                           (By Paul A. Gigot)\n\n       President Clinton could soon make his third Supreme Court \n     appointment, and his political play will be to trump Senate \n     Republicans by naming the first Hispanic justice.\n       Such speculation is in high gear among Republicans because \n     the White House is already floating the names of potential \n     replacements should Justice John Paul Stevens pack it in when \n     the high court's term ends in the next month.\n       Retirement for the flinty, independent 78-year-old justice \n     is no sure thing. Merely hearing such speculation could cause \n     him to stay on, and by all accounts he's in good mental and \n     physical health. It's also clear from his Clinton v. Jones \n     opinion that he's no great admirer of this president.\n       But friends who've spoken with Justice Stevens say that for \n     the first time he seems like a man seriously contemplating \n     retirement. He already spends much of his time in Florida, \n     where his wife wouldn't mind seeing him more. He's also \n     talked about the subject with more than one of his bench \n     colleagues.\n       The timing would certainly make ideological sense for the \n     court's ranking liberal. By retiring this year, he'd shelter \n     his successor's confirmation from the presidential politics \n     that will be going strong next summer. A Clinton nominee next \n     year would also probably face a Senate with even more \n     Republicans than the current 55.\n       If Mr. Stevens waits until the summer of 2000, he'd run the \n     risk that his successor would be named by a conservative \n     president. While the justice appointed by Gerald Ford likes \n     to claim GOP credentials, you can bet he doesn't want to be \n     replaced by another Antonin Scalia. If he wants to preserve \n     the current court's precarious liberal-conservative balance, \n     this is the year to depart.\n       The biggest beneficiary would be Mr. Clinton, who is eager \n     to pad his lackluster legacy. That argues for naming the \n     first Hispanic justice, an act of symbolic politics that \n     would enhance Democratic ties to the nation's fastest growing \n     ethnic group.\n       The move would also mousetrap Senate Republicans, who will \n     be loathe to oppose anyone with a Hispanic surname. Still \n     smarting from the backlash against their anti-immigration \n     idiocy of 1994-96, some Republicans would vote to confirm \n     Geraldo Rivera.\n       And the problem is, they might have to vote on the judicial \n     equivalent. The lineup of qualified Hispanic Democratic \n     judges is shorter than admirers of Monica Lewinsky's lawyer \n     William Ginsburg. A list submitted to the White House (and \n     delivered in person to Vice President Al Gore) by the \n     Hispanic National Bar Association contains only six mostly \n     minor-league names.\n       Voters recalled Cruz Reynosos from the California bench \n     along with Rose Bird in 1986. Vilma Martinez has been a \n     liberal civil-rights litigator. Gilbert Casellas ran the \n     Equal Employment Opportunity Commission but has been passed \n     over by Mr. Clinton for the appellate bench.\n       The list's one genuine legal heavyweight is Jose Cabranes, \n     a Puerto Rican immigrant named to the federal Second Circuit \n     by Mr. Clinton in 1994. A former Yale general counsel, Judge \n     Cabranes was advertised as a finalist when the president made \n     his last Supreme Court pick. He's a judicial moderate and his \n     confirmation would be a bipartisan breeze.\n       But his very moderation is making him less acceptable to \n     many Clintonites this time. White House aides are already \n     telling Senate sources and others that Mr. Cabranes isn't \n     reliably liberal enough to replace Justice Stevens. He's \n     especially suspect on the liberal orthodoxy of classifying \n     everyone by racial and ethnic identity. He's no conservative, \n     but he's spoken out publicly for the ``Western civilization \n     curriculum'' attacked by the left.\n       Liberals also fret about the influence of Mr. Cabranes's \n     daughter, whose sin is to have belonged to the Federalist \n     Society and to have clerked for Judge Ralph Winter, a Reagan \n     appointee. It may seem odd to blame a father for the beliefs \n     of his daughter, but Clinton liberals believe in guilt by \n     conservative association.\n       If liberals do prevail, the president could turn to 43-\n     year-old New York district court judge Sonia Sotomayor. She's \n     every Republican's confirmation nightmare--a liberal Hispanic \n     woman put on the district bench by George Bush (at the \n     request of Democratic Sen. Pat Moynihan).\n       Her willingness to legislate from the bench was apparent in \n     her recent decision that a private group giving work \n     experience to the homeless must pay the minimum wage. Never \n     mind if this makes them that much harder to employ. Mr. \n     Clinton has nominated Judge Sotomayor to join Mr. Cabranes on \n     the Second Circuit, and she's said to be a favorite of \n     Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n       All of which means that a Stevens retirement would put a \n     large political burden on the protean shoulders of Judiciary \n     Chairman Orrin Hatch. His own choice would probably be Judge \n     Cabranes. And the Utah Republican has privately explained his \n     brisk approval of Clinton lower-court nominees as a way to \n     gain leverage and credibility for the more significant \n     Supreme Court pick. But Mr. Clinton has fooled Republicans \n     before. Maybe Republicans are better off begging Justice \n     Stevens to stay.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. When the Republicans now protest that the Senate can only \nlook at where a person went to school, and the rating the newly \ncompliant ABA provides, they are disregarding their own past practices. \nA young conservative activist spilled the beans quite explicitly \nrecently on the ``Crossfire'' television program in which he said:\n\n       . . . the second [he] gets in there he'll overrule \n     everything you love--\n\n  Everything moderates have worked to enact over the years.\n  That seems to be the badly kept secret, as to why the White House \nchose Mr. Estrada for this nomination--precisely because of his \nideology. Keeping that secret is apparently what motivated the strategy \nthat resulted in his extraordinary lack of responsiveness to \nsubstantive questions regarding his views and judicial philosophy.\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n  Nobody can look at opinions of the Supreme Court and believe that \nJustice Scalia and Justice Thomas do not have an agenda, the two stated \nby the President to be his model for nominees. But I am left with a \nfear that Mr. Estrada, likewise, comes to this nomination with a hidden \nagenda.\n  Maybe it is the nature of the beast, but I have never seen so many \ncrocodile tears in my life from the other side of the aisle as they \nask: Why are we asking these questions? How can you possibly question \nthis man? How can you possibly question this man?\n  I am going to tell the Senate a secret as to why it is we asked for \nthis. I know my friends on the other side may not want to let this out, \nso I will tell it just to those in this room where we learned to look \ninto this. We heard it from a speech given to the Federalist Society in \nwhich the Senator speaking said:\n\n       [T]he Senate can and should do what it can to ascertain the \n     jurisprudential views a nominee will bring to the bench in \n     order to prevent the confirmation of those who are likely to \n     be judicial activists. Determining who will become activists \n     is not easy since many of President Clinton's nominees tend \n     to have limited paper trails . . . Determining which of the \n     President's nominees will become activists is complicated and \n     it will require the Senate to be more diligent and extensive \n     in its questioning of a nominee's jurisprudential views.\n\n  I read that speech. In a sense of bipartisanship, I want you to know \nthat I agree exactly with what Senator Hatch said in Utah when he gave \nthat speech to the Utah branch of the Federalist Society. When Senator \nHatch said that we have to prevent the confirmation of those who are \nlikely to be judicial activists; the Senate must be more diligent and \nextensive in its questioning of nominees' jurisprudential views, I \nthink my friend from Utah had it absolutely right and, guess what, that \nis exactly what we are doing here.\n  In fact, when a Democratic President was sending judicial nominees to \nthe Senate, the man who would later become the principal Deputy White \nHouse Counsel for the President, the man who played a significant role \nin the selection of President Bush's judicial nominees, Tim Flanigan, \nsaid, the Judiciary Committee and the Senate must be extraordinarily \ndiligent in examining the judicial philosophy of judicial nominees.\n  This man, who went on to help the current President Bush pick \njudicial nominees, said:\n\n       In evaluating judicial nominees, the Senate has often been \n     stymied by its inability to obtain evidence of a nominee's \n     judicial philosophy. In the absence of such evidence, the \n     Senate has often confirmed a nominee on the theory they could \n     find no fault with the nominee. I would reverse the \n     presumption and place the burden squarely on the judicial \n     nominee to prove that he or she has a well-thought-out \n     judicial philosophy, one that recognizes the limited role of \n     Federal judges. Such a burden is appropriately borne by one \n     seeking life tenure to wield the awesome judicial power of \n     the United States.\n\n  I agree with that. What I do not agree with is that we say we must \nhave a standard of impartiality on judges, that they cannot be \nactivists, that they must answer their questions--we can say that is \nthe standard if it is a Democrat referring them to the Judiciary \nCommittee, but that all goes out the window when it is a Republican.\n  I agree that we must ask what their judicial philosophy is and they \nmust answer the questions. That is the standard that the Republicans \nset over and over again, both those who went on to serve in the White \nHouse and my friend from Utah when he was chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. It is a standard on which we should all agree.\n  But what I do not agree on is when it is a Republican making the \nnomination, no standards are required--no standards are required. We \ncan't ask about philosophy. We can't ask about temperament. We can't \nask what they are going to do with this lifetime appointment.\n  In this case specifically, Mr. Estrada refused to provide us the \nanswers about the types of jurisprudential views that Chairman Hatch \nand Mr. Flanigan said they must--they must--answer. At least they said \nthey must answer when it was a Democrat nominating them. But I guess if \nit is a Republican nominating them we get kind of a pass; that there is \ngoing to be jurisprudential purity.\n  Extensive questioning of this nominee's jurisprudential views have \nbeen forestalled and short circuited. He does have a paper trail but it \nhas been kept secret by the White House. There is a paper trail that \nsays what his jurisprudential views are, but the White House has kept \nit secret.\n  We want judges to be fair and impartial. That is what I believe most \nAmericans want. An independent judiciary is a bulwark against us losing \nour rights and our freedoms. I say it again. The vast majority of \npeople, if they go into Federal court, want to be treated fairly. They \nwant to look at that judge and say, it doesn't make a difference \nwhether I am Democratic or Republican, conservative, liberal, rich, \npoor, what my color is, or what my creed is, or anything else; I am now \nbefore the Federal courts, the most respected judicial system in the \nworld, and I am going to be treated fairly.\n\n  But, whether they know it or not, whether they think of it or not, \nthey have that sense that it is going to be a fair treatment because \nhistorically the Senate has maintained that integrity and independence \nof the Federal judiciary.\n  From the first part of our Nation's history when the Senate even \nturned down judges nominated by President George Washington, the most \npopular President in our history, the Senate has maintained the \nintegrity and independence of the Federal judiciary.\n  As I said before, I have voted on hundreds of judges. I voted for \nhundreds of judges of Republican Presidents--President Ford, President \nReagan, former President Bush, and the current President Bush, just as \nI have for Democratic Presidents. I have also voted against judges, \nthose nominated by Democratic Presidents as well as by Republican \nPresidents. I do this because I know it is a lifetime appointment and \nwe want to make sure of what we do. Most I voted for confirmation.\n  As I said before, we set an all-time record--certainly the record for \nthe last 10 or 15 years--during the year and a half or so that I was \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sending out 100 Federal \njudges, both circuit and district, including, I say to the Senator from \nAlabama and the Senator from Utah who is in the Chamber, judges from \ntheir States--not Democrats. They were Republicans. I think a lot of \ntheir philosophy is different than mine. I trusted their integrity, and \nthey answered the questions.\n\n  But here, the little record we have calls into question whether this \nperson can be a neutral referee or an advocate and activist from the \nbench. That is really where we are.\n  We have a duty to the American public to say when we give our \nimprimatur by voting to confirm somebody to a lifetime position on the \nFederal courts that we have made every effort possible to make sure we \nare going to maintain the integrity and the independence of the Federal \njudiciary; that we are not going to turn the Federal judiciary into a \npolitical arm.\n  We elect Presidents. In electing them, we say they can be political. \nI said I wish Presidents would be uniters and not dividers. In this \ncase, they have been a divider and not a uniter--but the nature of it \nis they are expected to be political.\n  We elect men and women to the House of Representatives and to the \nSenate to carry a political agenda, but we put people on the Federal \njudiciary to be independent and nonpolitical. Here we are being told \nthat we are going to fill out a political agenda.\n  My friend from Alabama wishes to speak. I will speak further but give \nhim a chance to speak.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several editorials and \nletters opposing Mr. Estrada's nomination be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 29, 2003]\n\n                        An Unacceptable Nominee\n\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote \n     tomorrow on Miguel Estrada, a nominee to the D.C. Circuit \n     Court of Appeals. Mr. Estrada comes with a scant paper trail \n     but a reputation for taking extreme positions on important \n     legal questions. He stonewalled when he was asked at his \n     confirmation hearings last fall to address concerns about his \n     views. Given these concerns, and given the thinness of the \n     record he and his sponsors in the administration have chosen \n     to make available, the Senate should vote to reject his \n     nomination.\n\n[[Page S2076]]\n\n       Mr. Estrada, a native of Honduras and graduate of Harvard \n     Law School, has a strong legal resume. But people who have \n     worked with him over the years, at the solicitor general's \n     office and elsewhere, report that his interpretation of the \n     law is driven by an unusually conservative agenda. Paul \n     Bender, a law professor and former deputy solicitor general, \n     has called Mr. Estrada an ideologue, and said he ``could not \n     rely on his written work as a neutral statement of the law.'' \n     In private practice, Mr. Estrada defended anti-loitering laws \n     that civil rights and groups have attacked as racist.\n       Unlike many nominees who are named to an appeals court \n     after years as a trial judge or professor, Mr. Estrada has \n     put few of his views in the public record. One way to begin \n     to fill this gap, and give the Senate something to work with, \n     would be to make available the numerous memorandums of law \n     that Mr. Estrada wrote when he worked for the solicitor \n     general's office, as other nominees have done. But the White \n     House has refused senators' reasonable requests to review \n     these documents.\n       Mr. Estrada, now a lawyer in Washington, also had an \n     opportunity to elaborate on his views, and assuage senator's \n     concerns, at his confirmation hearing, but he failed to do \n     so. When asked his opinion about important legal questions, \n     he dodged. Asked his views of Roe v. Wade, the landmark \n     abortion case, Mr. Estrada responded implausibly that he had \n     not given enough thought to the question.\n       Senators have a constitutional duty to weight the \n     qualifications of nominees for the federal judiciary. But \n     they cannot perform this duty when the White House sends them \n     candidates whose record is a black hole. Mr. Estrada's case \n     is particularly troubling because the administration has more \n     information about his views, in the form of his solicitor \n     general memos, but is refusing to share it with the Senate.\n       If Mr. Estrada is confirmed, he is likely to be high on the \n     administration's list for the next Supreme Court vacancy. The \n     D.C. circuit is a traditional feeder to the Supreme Court, \n     and it is widely thought that for political reasons the \n     administration would like to name a Hispanic.\n       The very absence of a paper trail on matters like abortion \n     and civil liberties may be one reason the administration \n     chose him. It is also a compelling--indeed necessary--reason \n     to reject him.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Jan. 13, 2003]\n\n                        Bush's Full-Court Press\n\n       There are at least two explanations--one even more cynical \n     than the other--for President Bush's renomination last week \n     of Judge Charles W. Pickering, a man the Senate rightly \n     rejected last year for a seat on the federal appeals court.\n       Perhaps Bush really didn't mean it last month when he \n     denounced as ``offensive .  .  . and wrong'' Mississippi Sen. \n     Trent Lott's nostalgic musings about the segregated South. \n     The Republican Party has long tried to have it both ways on \n     race: ardently courting minority voters while winking at \n     party stalwarts who consistently fight policies to establish \n     fairness and opportunity for minorities. Even Bush has not \n     always been above such doublespeak, encouraging African \n     Americans to vote GOP and touting his Spanish-language \n     facility on the campaign trail as a come-on to Latino votes \n     even as he dropped in at Bob Jones University, which, until \n     three years ago, barred interracial couples from sharing a \n     pizza.\n       Bush's renomination of Pickering, a man whose law career is \n     unremarkable but for his longtime friendship with Lott and \n     his dogged defense of Mississippi's anti-miscegenation laws, \n     throws another steak to the far right and sand in the eyes of \n     most Americans.\n       There could be another explanation for Bush's decision, \n     just weeks after denouncing Lott, to again shove Pickering on \n     the American people. Perhaps the president doesn't really \n     care whether Pickering, Whom he's indignantly defended as ``a \n     fine jurist .  .  . a man of quality and integrity,'' is \n     confirmed.\n       Maybe Bush calculates that Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-\n     Mass.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and others, justly \n     incensed that the judge is back before them, will embarrass a \n     Republican or two into joining them and defeat his nomination \n     a second time. The president may be figuring that if they can \n     call in enough chits on Pickering, the Democrats won't have \n     the votes to stop the many other men and women he hopes to \n     place in these powerful, lifetime seats on the federal bench.\n       None of those nominees can be tarred with Pickering's in-\n     your-face defense of segregation. But many, including Texas \n     Supreme Court Justice Priscilla Owen, lawyers Miguel Estrada \n     and Jay S. Bybee, North Carolina Judge Terrence Boyle and Los \n     Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl, share a disdain \n     for workers' rights, civil liberties guarantees and abortion \n     rights. Their confirmations would be no less a disservice to \n     the American people than that of Pickering, who now has been \n     nominated two times too many.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 5, 2003]\n\n                     Latino Would Set Back Latinos\n\n                         (By Antonia Hernandez)\n\n       It is ironic the President Bush, whose lawyers excoriated \n     affirmative action at the University of Michigan, would \n     nominate Miguel Estrada, an unqualified Latino, to the U.S. \n     Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in order to \n     achieve diversity. The full Senate takes up the nomination \n     this week.\n       The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or \n     MALDEF, and other Latino and civil rights organizations \n     believe that in a nation of more than 37 million Latinos, the \n     federal judiciary should not remain overwhelmingly white and \n     male. The nation needs judges who understand us, the Latinos \n     are visibly absent from the Supreme Court and many of the \n     federal appellate courts. The judiciary is the branch of \n     government to which we have turned to seek protection when, \n     because of our limited political power, we are not able to \n     secure and protect our rights through the legislative process \n     or the executive branch.\n       However, Estrada has neither demonstrated that he \n     understands the needs of Latino Americans nor expressed \n     interest in the Latino community. A thorough review of his \n     sparse record indicates he would probably make rulings that \n     roll back the civil rights of Latinos. Simply being a Latino \n     does not make one qualified to be a judge.\n       The decisions made by judges apply to all, regardless of \n     race, ethnicity, gender or immigrant status. Individuals \n     appointed to the federal branch, a lifetime appointment, must \n     meet basic requirements such as honesty, open-mindedness, \n     integrity, character and temperament. They must also go a \n     step beyond that and affirmatively demonstrate that they will \n     be fair to all who appear before them in court.\n       Estrada's lack of qualifications has prompted many \n     prominent Latino organizations and others to oppose him, \n     including MALDEF, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \n     Education Fund, the Southwest Voter Registration and \n     Education Project, Latino union leaders, the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights and Congress' Hispanic and Black \n     causes.\n       The available record of Estrada's legal positions raises \n     grave concerns about how he might rule on constitutional \n     matters affecting Latinos. For example, his work in the area \n     of criminal justice raises serious doubts as to whether he \n     would recognize the 1st Amendment rights of Latino urban \n     youths and day laborers, and it casts serious doubt on \n     whether he would fairly review Latino allegations of racial \n     profiling.\n       In 1977 he worked pro bono to defend the city of Chicago's \n     ban on loitering, which was designed to curb gangs and drug \n     activity. Instead, the ban resulted in police harrassment of \n     Latino and African American youths. After the Supreme Court \n     struck down the ordinance as unconstitutional, Estrada \n     volunteered to defend a similar one in Annapolis, Md., which \n     was also found to be unconstitutional.\n       As a government attorney, he argued that police discretion \n     was wide, that officers could execute a search warrant in a \n     felony drug investigation without knocking and announcing who \n     they were. This indicates his disdain for the protections of \n     the 4th Amendment.\n       In other areas, Estrada has stated that he has never raised \n     the issue of diversity in any of his workplaces and that he \n     would not seek to help Latinos by hiring them as clerks, and \n     he dismissed concerns about the lack of diversity among \n     Supreme Court law clerks. In 2001, in the Annapolis anti-\n     loitering case, Estrada argued that the NAACP had no standing \n     to represent the interests of African Americans. This \n     indicates he probably would question the right of access to \n     the courts of groups that have historically represented the \n     interests of Latinos.\n       Our opposition is not partisan. MALDEF has supported \n     President Bush's nomination of well-qualified Latinos who are \n     conservative and will continue to do so. However, when a \n     nominee, like Estrada, is an ideologue who hides his views \n     and who is so lacking in experience, we have little choice \n     but to oppose the nomination. The courts and the job of \n     justice are too important.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe Senator Kyl was in the line to \nspeak next. I think probably he will be here shortly.\n  I would like to say one thing about this issue of ideology. We had \nhearings on it. I know Senator Schumer advocated that we ought to \nconsider ideology--I guess he meant politics--of the nominee. Some of \nmy friends across the aisle asked: Why do Republicans nominate \nRepublicans and Democrats Democrats, if ideology doesn't matter?\n  We voted for those nominees. President Clinton had confirmed during \nhis tenure as President of the United States 377 Federal judges. This \nSenate voted down one judge. That is all we voted down on the floor of \nthe Senate. None were blocked in committee. All were voted out of \ncommittee, unless they had objections from home State Senators and came \nup until the last of the administration. And 41 judges had been \nnominated and were pending either in committee or on the floor when \nPresident Clinton left office. Comparing that to when President Bush\n\n[[Page S2077]]\n\nleft office and the Democrats controlled the Senate, there were 54 \nnominees pending and unconfirmed.\n  I think all of us need to take a deep breath and to remember that the \njudiciary is made up of human beings. They are appointed by the \nPresident. Our President believes in judicial restraint. He believes \nthat judges should not enact political agendas from the bench. That is \nthe criteria he has used--that and excellence and integrity. Miguel \nEstrada, probably as much as any nominee we have ever had, represents \nexcellence, integrity, and experience that would qualify him for the \njob. Indeed, he unanimously won the highest rating from the American \nBar Association, ``well qualified.''\n  But I will just say that we did, in fact, vote overwhelmingly for \nPresident Clinton's judges--377, and one we voted down. Only 41 were \nleft pending when he left office, which is well within the tradition of \nthis Senate.\n  Frankly, if people get nominated late, they don't have time for \nhearings. Sometimes the Senate will think, let's see how the election \ncomes out and leave some hanging. That has always happened here. That \ncan be criticized. But we do that. What we are seeing now is a slowdown \nof nominees at the beginning of the process.\n  I also note that as we considered these nominees we had hearings on \nthe burden of proof. A group of liberal professors met with the \nDemocratic leadership soon after President Bush was elected President. \nThey made a proposal that the ground rules of judicial nominations \nshould be changed. They didn't propose it while President Clinton was \nnominating his nominees, many of which were ACLU members, and many of \nwhich were strongly pro-abortion, and those kinds of things. They \ndidn't raise that then. But as soon as the election was over, they \nproposed changing the ground rules, according to the New York Times \nreport of that event. One of the things was that they would consider \nideology. Another one was that they would change the burden of proof--\nthat for the first time in history the burden would be on the nominee \nto somehow prove that they were worthy of the appointment instead of \nhaving the Senate review the presumptive power of the President to make \nthe nominee and then if disagreeing object to them. That was a big \ndeal. We had hearings on that in the court subcommittee of the \nJudiciary, of which I am a member.\n  Senator Schumer was an advocate of both of these positions. But the \nhearings he held were fair, and we had an interesting debate about it.\n\n  I will just say, being the ranking Republican during that time, that \nthe witnesses and the evidence we took to me clearly did not support \nchanging the ground rules. People such as Lloyd Cutler, who was counsel \nto the White House under Presidents Carter and Clinton, opposed that. \nHe believed that nominees should be given also the presumption of \nconfirmation. I thought it was pretty successful in how we handled it, \nand that the evaluations we considered on the issue should not be \nchanged. The rules ought not to be changed to going to a different way \nof considering nominations.\n  Senator Hatch--I have to agree, and I think my colleague, Senator \nLeahy, would agree with this--set forth a principal position for \nevaluating judges. He said we should consider judicial philosophy. He \ndid not say we should consider their politics. He talked about judicial \nphilosophy and the danger. The issue that concerned him and concerned \nmost Americans was the question of judicial activism. This was a \nphilosophy taught in law school for many years. I think maybe hopefully \nthat it is a little less prominent today than it was 15 or 20 years \nago--that good judges shove the envelope, good judges should be \nactivists, they should promote good causes and use the power of their \noffice to further causes which they believe are just and to strike \nblows for the poor, and that kind of thing. It was a strong philosophy.\n  But the truth is that is a dangerous philosophy. When you are talking \nabout a lifetime appointment of a person to the Federal bench, they \nshould understand that they are not empowered to render rulings that go \nbeyond the plain meaning of the law. They should not render rulings \nthat twist the meaning of words--giving words new and different \nmeanings than were intended when the Congress passed legislation, or \nwhen the Constitution was written. That is a very important issue to \nme.\n  On this question of activism, when you give an unelected judge and an \nunelected court lifetime appointments with no accountability to the \npeople, the power to redefine the meaning of words and to change \nhistoric understandings of our clauses and phrases in our statutes and \nin our Constitution, we have diminished democracy because they are \ndemocratically accountable. If we changed the law, they can vote us out \nof office. The next group of Senators or Congressmen can change the law \nif we vote badly. But if they declare that the Constitution says you \ncan't do this or you must do that, then it is much, much more difficult \nto deal with.\n  Certainly, in this Congress we do not want to impeach judges because \nwe disagree with their opinion. What we need are judges on the bench \nwho are honorable, intelligent, capable, and who understand their role, \nwhich is to enforce the law as written. And that is the kind of judge \nwe ought not have fear of, as one witness said.\n\n  Why should we fear a judge who shows restraint? Our liberties are not \nat risk by a judge who shows restraint. Our liberties are at risk when \nwe have a judge who believes they have the ability to go beyond what \nstatutes say and to do what they think is right. You have heard them \nsay: Well, the legislature would not act, so the judges had to act. \nThat is not legitimate. If the legislature did not act, that is a \ndecision of the legislature, a decision not to act. It is no less valid \nthan a decision by a legislature to act on a matter.\n  Judges ought to follow the law as written. They ought to understand \nthe great power of that branch of Government. They ought to be \nindependent. They should strike down laws that are unconstitutional. \nThat is not being activist. If a law is in violation of the \nConstitution, a conservative or liberal judge, I hope, will strike it \ndown. We have accepted that since Marbury v. Madison, since virtually \nthe beginning of this country. But that is not activist.\n  What is activist is to misrepresent what the Congress intended, to \ntwist the meaning of the words of the Congress, or to alter the meaning \nof the words of the Constitution to promote a short-term political \nagenda. I really think that is our problem. Activism can be defined in \na number of ways, but it is quite different from a person's political \nphilosophy.\n  To me, the high water mark of judicial activism was when we had two \nmembers of the U.S. Supreme Court dissent on every single death penalty \ncase. Their dissent was, they believed the death penalty was cruel and \nunusual punishment and the Constitution prohibits the imposition of \ncruel and unusual punishment. They said, according to the changing \nstandards they live in today, this was no longer compatible with humane \nor legal systems or modern thought, and therefore they just found it \ncruel and unusual to execute anyone by any means, and therefore the \nwhole death penalty statute should be struck down.\n  The reason that was particularly ill advised, in my view, is that at \nthe time the Constitution was adopted, it had the cruel and unusual \npunishment language in it but it also had six or eight references in an \napproving way to a death penalty. They talked about capital crimes and \nwhat the rules should be in a capital crime. And capital crimes are \ndeath penalty cases. They said life, liberty, and property cannot be \ntaken without due process of law--you can't take life. That means a \ndeath penalty.\n  Every State in the Union at the time the Constitution was written had \na death penalty, and so did the Federal Government have death \npenalties. So for those two judges to actually dissent in case after \ncase after case, to me, was merely imposing their personal views at one \nmoment in time over the established will of the legal system that had \nbeen from the beginning. It is also contrary to the views of the \nmajority of the States in the United States. And the polls have shown--\nif they want to go to evolving standards of decency that the American \npeople oppose the death penalty--that, in fact, overwhelmingly they \nfavor the death penalty. So I think we do need to watch that.\n\n[[Page S2078]]\n\n  (Mr. CHAMBLISS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. One of the big issues we have before us, as we consider \nPresident Bush's nominees, is: Are we looking to have people on the \nbench to further our political agenda, or are we just looking for a \nneutral arbiter, someone who can evaluate the cases between litigants \nand make a fair and just rendering of an opinion on it? That is what it \nis all about.\n\n  One of the things that was raised in complaint about Miguel Estrada \nwas he would not answer all their questions about his views on cases \nand lawsuits, and so forth. They said he would not produce his internal \nmemoranda when he was a part of the Solicitor General's Office of the \nDepartment of Justice. Every living former Solicitor General of the \nUnited States, Republican and Democrat, to my knowledge, has written \nthat he ought not to do that. Lawyers ought to be encouraged to write \nto their clients, the Department of Justice superiors, and give their \nopinions.\n  Let me add one thing about that issue. The memoranda that he wrote \nwere not to John Mitchell. The memoranda that he wrote were for Janet \nReno and the Clinton Department of Justice. He was in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office during that time. And he was evaluated and given the \nhighest possible evaluation by the Clinton Department of Justice \nattorneys. One of them specifically noted in that evaluation that he \nfollowed the procedures and policies of the Clinton Department of \nJustice. So I do not see how it can be suspected that he was writing \nright-wing extremist memoranda within that Department of Justice while \nhaving the kind of respect and high evaluations that he had. So I \nbelieve that is important.\n  There is a real reason that judicial nominees--and I know the \nPresiding Officer is a lawyer and understands these issues--why someone \nthrown into a hearing ought to be reluctant to answer questions about \ncomplex cases when we have a hearing on the confirmation of a nominee \nto the Federal courts of the United States. If they are confirmed, they \nwill be given important cases on which to rule. I hope and I pray they \nwill spend many hours reading the briefs of the parties, reading \npersonally the major cases in the country that deal with that issue, \nand they give it sincere thought and prayerful consideration before \nthey render a verdict. That is what we want.\n  To throw somebody in a hearing and to start asking them how they are \ngoing to rule on this matter or that matter is improper. And asking \nthem that would bind them, if they got in. In other words, let's say \nthat they said: Well, I favor this, Mr. Senator; I hope that makes you \nhappy; and I agree with you. And then they become a judge, and they get \na stack of briefs, and they start reading the opinions, and they come \nback out with the belief that that is wrong. What have they done then? \nNo. The history of our confirmation process and the strong opinion of \nthe American Bar Association, an independent arbiter in these matters, \nis that they should not be lured into expressing opinions on cases that \nare likely to come before them on the bench. That is so fundamental and \nso sound a principle that I cannot imagine anyone would suggest it be \nchanged.\n  Lloyd Cutler, White House Counsel to Presidents Clinton and Carter, \nwrote this:\n\n       Candidates should decline to reply when efforts are made to \n     find out how they would decide a particular case.\n\n  That was his testimony in our hearing as we discussed these issues in \nthe Judiciary Committee. That certainly is correct to me. I believe \nthat is sound policy, whether we have a Republican President or a \nDemocratic President. I do not recall that Senator Hatch ever insisted \na judge tell him how he was going to rule.\n  My good friend Senator Leahy, he likes to talk about the Federalist \nSociety and Senator Hatch making a speech at the Federalist Society. \nThey take no position over any of these legal issues. They are a forum \nfor debate. Most of the members, perhaps, believe in a restrained \njudiciary, but they have a lot of different ideas and vigorous debate, \nand they publish articles that disagree with one another.\n  But we confirmed a host of Federal judges under President Clinton who \nwere members of the American Civil Liberties Union. You may say: Well, \nyou know the American Civil Liberties Union. They do some good work. I \ndon't think we should just vote against them for that reason. And we \ndidn't. We confirmed almost all of them. As a matter of fact, I am not \nsure any of them who were members did not get confirmed.\n\n  Look at the Web site of the ACLU. It takes positions on issues. The \nACLU believes there should be total separation of church and State. I \nam sure they agree with the proposal that we ought to take ``under \nGod'' out of the Pledge of Allegiance. They believe in the legalization \nof drugs. They believe pornography laws should not be on the books and \nare unconstitutional. They believe even that child pornography laws are \nunconstitutional. That is a stated position.\n  Out of deference to President Clinton's nominees and his power and \nprerogative of appointment, we confirmed a bunch of them who were \nmembers of the ACLU, one of whom was a litigation committee chairman \nfor the ACLU. Others had been State directors of the ACLU.\n  What did we do? We asked them in the hearing: Do you personally \nsupport all those views? They would usually say they didn't.\n  We would say: Well, whether you agree or not on drug legalization, \nlet me ask you this: If we pass a law that says drugs are illegal, will \nyou enforce it? Will you take your office as judge and use it to \nundermine the established law of the land? And they would all say: We \nwill enforce the law.\n  That is how they came to be confirmed. I hope and trust to this day \nthey are complying with that. Our system would not work were it \notherwise.\n  I reiterate my growing admiration for Miguel Estrada's capabilities. \nHe came here as a teenager, was an honors graduate, the highest \npossible honors at Columbia College. He went to Harvard Law School \nwhere he finished at the top of his class and was chosen editor of the \nHarvard Law Review. For a graduating law senior from a law school to be \neditor of the Law Review is one of the highest, probably the highest, \nhonor that can be received. He was chosen that by his fellow members.\n  He didn't clerk for a Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge. They say \nhe doesn't have judicial experience. He sat at the right hand of a \nFederal circuit judge, doing the kind of work he will be doing as a \njudge today, for 2 years. Not only that, he was such an astoundingly \nqualified and capable young lawyer, he was chosen to be a law clerk for \nJustice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court of the United States. \nAnybody who knows anything about the legal profession knows being \nchosen as a law clerk by a Supreme Court judge is a great honor, \nsomething very few people ever get the opportunity to do. It is \nconsidered a matter of great significance.\n  Of course, Justice Kennedy is considered one of the swing justices on \nthe Supreme Court, not one my colleagues like to talk about as an \nextreme conservative. That is who he clerked for, and remains close to \nJustice Kennedy to this day. He is admired by him.\n  Then he went to the Department of Justice to the Solicitor General's \noffice. The Solicitor General's office is the law firm for the United \nStates before the Supreme Court. It is within the Department of \nJustice. They prepare the arguments before the Supreme Court, the \nappellate courts. Of course, that is what Miguel Estrada will be \nconsidered for, an appellate court judge, not a trial judge, but an \nappellate court judge. He did a remarkable job there, receiving the \nhighest possible evaluations by the Department of Justice.\n  After that, he went into practice with one of the premier law firms \nin the world in Washington, DC, and was evaluated by the American Bar \nAssociation. The American Bar Association takes its evaluation \nseriously. They do an independent background check. They make the \nnominee submit a list of their most significant cases. They have to \ngive the names and addresses of the judge who tried the case, names and \naddresses of the opposing counsel, and maybe even cocounsel, and to \nsummarize the case.\n\n  When that is done, the ABA interviews them. They don't interview just \ntheir friends. They interview the lawyers on the other side of the \ncases.\n\n[[Page S2079]]\n\nThey want to know, was this person a fair litigator; did he understand \nthe law; were his arguments coherent; did he have integrity; did you \nrespect him in the course of this litigation. Out of that evaluation, \nthe American Bar Association unanimously voted he was well qualified \nfor the court of appeals, and ``well qualified'' is the highest \nevaluation given.\n  We are proud of his achievements. President Bush has nominated an \nextraordinary judge. As I study more about Miguel Estrada and see more \nof his record, the more confident I am he will be not just a good \njustice but a great one. I believe that strongly.\n  I see Senator Kyl is here. We have been going back and forth, so if \nyou were able to allow him to speak at this time, that would be good.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona has something \nelse, of course, I will be here a lot longer, I believe. If it would \naccommodate him, I would be more than happy to do that. And then if we \ncould go back to this side, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Leahy. I yield to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank Senator Leahy. I was hoping I would be able to speak \na little bit earlier because there are specifically some things the \nSenator from Vermont said, so I am pleased he is here and I can respond \nto couple of comments he made. He is someone who, as chairman of the \ncommittee and now as ranking member, has important remarks about this \nprocess. I want to specifically relate to some of the things he did \nhave to say.\n  There are two aspects of this nomination of Miguel Estrada that \nshould catch our attention. The first has to do with the qualifications \nof this extraordinary American. The second has to do with the process \nby which he is being considered. If we are not careful, this body could \nset a very bad precedent. If Senators actually decide to filibuster the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada, something I understand is being \nconsidered by the leadership on the other side, if the decision were \nmade to filibuster him and his nomination failed as a result, it would \nbe the first time in the history of the Senate. It would drastically \nchange the way nominations for high judicial office are considered by \nthe Senate, essentially substituting a 60-vote majority required for \nconfirmation for the 50-vote majority that has heretofore been the \nstandard.\n  We can talk later about situations in which motions for cloture have \nbeen filed for one reason or another, but there has only been one real \nfilibuster in the Senate in the past, and that was the filibuster of \nJustice Abe Fortas. His nomination was withdrawn after a cloture \npetition failed. In other words, debate was not cut off. The filibuster \ndid continue. But that was a bipartisan filibuster, almost evenly \ndivided between Republicans and Democrats. It was not a concerted \neffort by one side or the other to galvanize their members into \nspeaking as long as it took to cause the withdrawal of the nomination \nby the leader.\n  If the minority leadership decides to engage in that tactic with \nrespect to Miguel Estrada, it would be not just unfortunate but \npermanently damaging to the relationship between the Senate and the \nexecutive and to the process by which we confirm nominations.\n  It is both a matter of tradition and comity. I know there are some \nwho make the argument that there is a requirement the Senate's \nconfirmation process be by majority vote. I don't think that case has \nbeen definitively established, but it certainly has been a matter of \ntradition.\n  There is a reason for it. That goes to the second. It has been a \nmatter of comity. The way our separation of powers works is each branch \nrespects the power of the other.\n  Now, when the Founding Fathers set it up, they were clear to provide \njurisdiction, but they left a lot of gray area between the jurisdiction \nof the three branches; and over the course of 200-plus years, the three \nbranches of Government have accommodated to each other's jurisdiction \nin a way with which the Supreme Court has infrequently, but \nimportantly, dealt.\n  The Supreme Court, as a matter of fact, exercising that degree of \njudgment and comity, generally has stayed out of what it calls \npolitical issues, for example. Part of that comity is that the Senate \nhas always believed it important to consider the most important \nnominees of a President and that the votes on those nominees be \ndetermined by a majority vote rather than extraordinary majorities or \nspecial procedures of the Senate.\n  That is because, in the modern idiom, ``what goes around comes \naround,'' which is a crude way of saying we know that, over the long \nhaul, all of us are going to be in the majority and in the minority and \neach will serve under Presidents of different parties. If we are to \ncooperate over the long haul in the Government to ensure that the \njudiciary is made up of people who are the very best qualified \ncandidates and that we respect the judgment of the American people in \nelecting a President, the Senate is required to give those nominees its \nvery best judgment, thorough consideration, but at the end of the day a \nvote to confirm by 51 rather than a supermajority.\n  In fact, no less an expert in the area than the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont, the former chairman and now ranking member of the \ncommittee has been among what I would call the very responsible members \nof his party who have spoken out on this issue in the past and have \nurged against the use of filibuster as a technique for holding up the \nnomination of judicial nominees; in fact, have even voted for cloture \nbut against the nominee on the merits. I have done the same thing with \nrespect to two nominees President Clinton nominated. It is quite \npossible to oppose someone on the floor but to understand that we \nshould never get the Senate in a position where filibustering a judge \nis the order of the day and, therefore, a 60-vote majority is required \nfor confirmation.\n  Since Senator Leahy is here, because I think he said it very well, in \ntwo different contexts, I will quote his own words on the subject. On \nJune 18, 1998, Senator Leahy said:\n\n       I have stated over and over again on this floor that I \n     would object and fight against any filibuster on a judge, \n     whether it is somebody I have opposed or supported.\n\n  I think that is the essence of the tradition of this body: That while \nwe may have disagreements sometimes and we are each free to cast a vote \nagainst a nominee, we understand that a filibuster to prevent a nominee \nfrom being voted on would be very wrong; it would set a very bad \nprecedent.\n  I think Senator Leahy was exactly correct when he uttered those \nwords. In fact, he also said a year later, on September 16, 1999:\n\n       I do not want to get into having to invoke cloture on \n     judicial nominations. I think it is a bad precedent.\n\n  He said it more succinctly than I have tried to say it here, but I \nagree with the distinguished ranking member of the committee that a \nfilibuster on a judge, whether you oppose or support a nominee, is \nwrong and it should be fought. I hope Senator Leahy will fight it. Many \nin his party would like to see a filibuster. Nobody disagrees that \neverybody should have a complete say on the matter. I agree with that. \nWe are willing to talk about Miguel Estrada for as long as it takes. \nBecause he is so well qualified, it is fun to talk about him, and it \nis going to be good to get him confirmed. When the talking is over, we \nneed to have a vote up or down.\n\n  May I also turn to a couple of other things the Senator from Vermont \nsaid. He talked about uniting and not dividing. I don't think there is \nanything divisive about Miguel Estrada. He is one of the kindest \nappearing people you can ask for. The ABA has given him a unanimous \nwell-qualified rating. They take into account judicial temperament as \nwell as qualifications. He has a great life story. He is certainly not \na controversial person. So I personally don't think words such as \n``narrow, ideological court-packing'' and the like are the way to \ndescribe the President's approach to this.\n  The President is certainly not trying to divide the country in \nnominating a very well qualified Hispanic judge such as Miguel Estrada. \nActually, I think the concern is more to another point the Senator from \nVermont made, which is that, in some people's view, there is not enough \nof a record on Miguel Estrada, that maybe he is a\n\n[[Page S2080]]\n\ncloset ideologue. I have heard that phrase bandied about. Again, the \nABA's rating--considered to be the gold standard by many colleagues--\nwould demonstrate that he is not an ideologue. There is no evidence of \nthat. I think some are searching for that evidence, and they don't have \nanything against him, so they are saying the record is incomplete. So \nit is a catch-22.\n  I also note that the Judiciary Committee itself, then including under \nthe leadership of the Senator from Vermont, has always submitted a \nquestionnaire to our judicial nominees. One of the questions goes right \nto the point of trying to determine whether or not anybody is applying \na litmus test to the nominee. I can remember back in Ronald Reagan's \ndays there were opponents of President Reagan who said: You are \napplying a litmus test on the abortion issue. Reagan said: I never \nasked anybody their view on the question.\n  The Judiciary Committee wanted to make sure nobody was trying to find \nout what a nominee's positions were on issues they would be confronting \non the court. That would be wrong. Therefore, one of our questions to \nevery judicial nominee is: Has anybody ever asked you about your \nspecific views on issues or about cases and how you might rule on cases \nthat might come before you? And, if so, please state the circumstances \nand the names.\n  The committee, in other words, wanted to make sure nobody was trying \nto find out from candidates how they would rule on particular issues, \nor what their particular ideology was, because we didn't believe that \nto be appropriate in judging nominees. Now it appears that there are \nsome who believe exactly the opposite, that indeed we must find out \neverything we can about the ideology of a candidate, and if it is not \nconsidered ``mainstream enough'' by some, that would be grounds for \ndenying the confirmation of the candidate. That has never been the test \nand should not be now.\n  I hope we can continue to apply the questionnaire from the Judiciary \nCommittee and ensure that candidates are not punished for not answering \nquestions that we ourselves don't think it appropriate to ask.\n  The Senator from Vermont made one rather astonishing claim, and that \nwas that--I believe I have the quotation--Miguel Estrada has had \n``little relevant experience.'' My goodness, if it hasn't been put in \nthe Record, I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed in the New York Post \ntoday by Rudolph Giuliani be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Post, Feb. 10, 2003]\n\n                             An Ugly Stall\n\n                         (By Rudolph Giuliani)\n\n       A 17-year-old named Miguel Estrada immigrates to this \n     country from Honduras, speaking only a few words of English. \n     He attends Columbia College, making Phi Beta Kappa and \n     graduating magna cum laude, then Harvard Law School, becoming \n     editor of the Law Review.\n       Next, he serves as a clerk first to U.S. Court of Appeals \n     Judge Amalya L. Kearse (a President Carter appointee), and \n     then to Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. From there, \n     he joins the Solicitor General's Office, serving as assistant \n     to the solicitor general of the United States for a year \n     under President George H.W. Bush and for four years under \n     President Clinton.\n       Then Estrada becomes a partner in a prestigious private law \n     practice--yet finds the time to perform significant pro bono \n     service, including some four hundred hours representing a \n     death row inmate before the Supreme Court.\n       In recognition of his special abilities and achievements, \n     President Bush nominates Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. He is supported by no fewer \n     than 16 Hispanic groups, who express enormous pride at the \n     prospect of the first Hispanic joining one of America's most \n     prestigious courts. Also supporting him are numerous \n     prominent Democrats, including President Clinton's solicitor \n     general and Vice President Gore's counselor and chief of \n     Staff.\n       Sounds pretty good? Well, here's where this story run the \n     risk of a most unhappy--and unfair--ending.\n       For nearly two years, Senate Democrats have delayed action \n     on the nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n       Citing no specific issues, Democratic senators vaguely \n     alluded to Estrada being ``way out of the mainstream.'' \n     Others raised equally hollow charges--all of which have not \n     only kept Estrada from getting the vote he deserves, but \n     denied the American people of a talented and effective \n     jurist.\n       Obviously, the fact that the Judiciary Committee was \n     controlled by the Democrats until this year helped delay \n     action. Last week, the committee finally voted to approve \n     Estrada's nomination, hewing strictly to party lines. But now \n     a few Democratic senators want to prevent a vote before the \n     full Senate by way of a filibuster.\n       Despite all the racket, the knocks against Estrada are so \n     easily dismissed that it is difficult to see them as anything \n     other than a thin veil disguising his detractors' true \n     motives. Let's take a look at them:\n       Some note that Estrada lacks judicial experience. Yet five \n     of the eight judges now on the D.C. circuit had no previous \n     judicial experience--including Chief Judge Harry Edwards, \n     who when President Carter appointed him in 1979 was even \n     younger than Estrada is now. Indeed, several Supreme Court \n     justices--including Byron White and Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist--had never been judges when they were named to \n     the land's highest court.\n       Estrada is no rookie. He has argued 15 cases before the \n     Supreme Court and was a highly respected Assistant U.S. \n     Attorney in my old office, the Southern District of New York. \n     And the American Bar Association unanimously gave him its \n     highest rating--``well qualified,'' a designation that some \n     of the very senators who now oppose him have called the \n     ``gold standard.''\n       Some object that the Bush administration won't produce \n     memoranda from Estrada in the Solicitor General's Office. \n     Bear in mind the Solicitor General's function: His office \n     represents the United States in court--in other words, the \n     government is his client. Why would a client or his attorney \n     choose to reveal their private and privileged communications?\n       The zeal to read a nominee's private memoranda seems to \n     apply only to this nominee. Seven past nominees to the Courts \n     of Appeals had worked in the Solicitor General's office--yet \n     not one was asked to disclose attorney-client memoranda. And \n     every living former Solicitor General--including Democrats \n     Archibald Cox, Seth Waxman and Walter Dellinger--signed a \n     letter to the Judiciary Committee stating that sharing these \n     confidential memos would damage the Justice Department's \n     ability to represent the United States before the Supreme \n     Court.\n       Some civil-rights groups complain that in private practice, \n     Estrada defended anti-loitering laws. In truth, he was \n     retained by the Democratic City Solicitor of Chicago to \n     defend the constitutionality of the anti-gang ordinances of \n     Democratic Mayor Richard M. Daley.\n       Miguel Estrada brings a proven ability to work with others \n     in a fair and constructive way, and his appeal is not limited \n     to any set of ideological backers. President Clinton's \n     Solicitor General, Seth Waxman, called his former colleague a \n     ``model of professionalism and competence'' and described his \n     ``great respect both for Mr. Estrada's intellect and for his \n     integrity.'' Ronald Klain, former Counselor to Vice President \n     Gore, wrote: ``Miguel is a person of outstanding character, \n     tremendous intellect, and with a deep commitment to the \n     faithful application of precedent.''\n       The Senate must fulfill its duty to consider the \n     appropriateness of judicial nominees. But that ``advice and \n     consent'' was never meant to empower special-interest groups \n     to hijack the appointments of abundantly qualified, eminently \n     decent nominees.\n       If senators who feel it's their right to let special-\n     interest agendas derail Estrada, the judiciary will lose a \n     wonderful opportunity. Far worse, the entire system will have \n     fallen victim to narrow and misguided attempts to thwart the \n     Constitution.\n       The stalling of Miguel Estrada's confirmation has been not \n     only unseemly and demeaning, but a perversion of the system \n     of judicial selection. It is also the escalation of a \n     dangerous trend. In their first two years in office, \n     Presidents Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan \n     saw more than 90 percent of their nominees to federal appeals \n     courts confirmed. In the first two years of this \n     administration, the figure is barely 50 percent.\n       Some say that's because President Bush isn't nominating \n     qualified individuals. But Miguel Estrada clearly puts the \n     lie to that suggestion.\n       I urge the Senate to allow this worthy man a vote. I urge \n     the Senate not to underestimate what a fair vote will mean to \n     Hispanic all across America.\n       I feel certain the result will be a confirmation--another \n     wonderful chapter in a true American success story.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in this wonderfully written piece, Rudy \nGiuliani talks about the astonishing record of this immigrant from \nHonduras, speaking only a few words of English, who attended Columbia, \nmade Phi Beta Kappa, graduated magna cum laude, then went to Harvard \nLaw School, and became editor of the Law Review. He clerked on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals and then for Justice Kennedy on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. He joined the Solicitor General's Office, serving as an \nassistant under two Presidents, a Republican and a Democrat, and he was \na partner in a prestigious law firm. He has argued 15 cases before the \nSupreme Court. And he has ``little relevant experience''?\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\n  The courts are full of judges who were not judges before they were \nappointed to the court. At some point, a person has to go from being a \nlawyer to a judge before he can be a judge. Certainly, there are a lot \nof non-lower-court judges, district court judges, who have been \nappointed not only to the circuit court of appeals to which this \nnominee is nominated, but also even to the U.S. Supreme Court. In fact, \nI believe that in this piece Giuliani points out that on this very \ncircuit, Chief Judge Harry Edwards who, when President Carter appointed \nhim--and he was even younger than Miguel Estrada--did not have previous \njudicial experience, nor did five of the eight justices now on the \ncourt. So that is not a predicate for serving on this court.\n  This is hardly a rookie candidate. I think you carry this argument \ntoo far. I urge my colleagues to consider this. With respect to many \nminorities, they are almost saying, you are not going to get a chance \nbecause we don't have that many minorities who serve on courts today. \nIf the requirement for service on a higher court is that you already \nare a judge, we are going to cut off a lot of minorities from \nconsideration. That is a glass ceiling, Mr. President, which we should \nnot impose.\n  Finally, the Senator from Vermont talked about a lot of candidates he \nsupported who had not been confirmed. But that is not relevant to \nMiguel Estrada. The question before us today is: should Miguel Estrada \nbe confirmed? I know the Senator from Vermont is not saying he opposes \nMr. Estrada for spite or for retribution because of candidates he \nsupported. That would not be appropriate. I know the Senator does not \nmean that.\n\n  Let's get back to Miguel Estrada and talk about his qualifications. \nIt boils down to two things, it seems to me: Is this person qualified \nto serve on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals? To that, there can be no \nanswer but as the American Bar Association unanimously said, he is very \nwell qualified. To the second point, after we are done talking about \nMiguel Estrada, after everything has been said, should we call for an \nup-or-down vote, or is this going to be the first time in the history \nof the Senate where we kill a nominee for circuit court by a partisan \nfilibuster? That would be, as the Senator from Vermont pointed out, a \nvery bad precedent, and I hope all the rest of my colleagues join the \nSenator from Vermont in objecting and fighting against any filibuster \non a judge, whether it is somebody they oppose or support.\n  If we approach this nominee in this way, I think we will confirm \nMiguel Estrada, and it will do the Senate proud and it will do the \nNation proud.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold for a moment, \nI ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a number of items.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator want to say what they are?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why don't I read them into the Record? I will read them \nand there will be no question. Will Senator Grassley yield time? It \nwill take 15 minutes to read them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will be glad to insert them without \nobjection. The Chair thought the Senator would want to identify them.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry, Mr. President, I was following the procedure \nfollowed by the other side this morning of putting items in the Record \nwithout identifying them.\n  Why don't I read them all so there will be no question, if the \nSenator from Iowa does not mind waiting 20, 30, 40 minutes for me to do \nthat, or if there is no objection, I will renew my request that the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund position statements \nregarding Mr. Estrada be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                For Immediate Release, January 27, 2003\n\n Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund--Reissues Its Position \n Statement Opposing the Nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the United \n      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\n       We previously expressed our strong opposition to the \n     candidacy of Miguel Estrada for a Judgeship on the D.C. \n     Circuit Court of Appeals. The hearing which Mr. Estrada was \n     given by the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2002 did \n     nothing to address our grave concerns about his fitness to \n     serve as an Appellate Judge. In fact, the hearing raised more \n     questions then it answered. Accordingly, we are reissuing our \n     position statement in strong opposition to Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination. In our review, it is clearly not in the best \n     interests of Hispanic Americans or for that matter all \n     Americans, to appoint an individual about whom there are \n     serious and for that matter unanswered doubts concerning his \n     ability to render justice in a fair and impartial manner.\n                                                Pierre M. LaRamee,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Reissued: January 27, 2003.\n\nPosition Statement on the Nomination of Miguel A. Estrada to the United \n      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\n\n\n                             I. background\n\n       On May 9, 2001, Miguel A. Estrada was nominated by \n     President George W. Bush to the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. That court is \n     widely considered to be the second most powerful court in the \n     nation and traditionally has served as a launching pad for \n     judges to be appointed to the United States Supreme Court. \n     Mr. Estrada has been touted as the first Hispanic-American \n     nominated to the DC Circuit, and many believe that he is \n     being groomed to be the first Hispanic-American Supreme Court \n     Justice. Because of the tremendous importance of this \n     nomination to our nation's nearly 40 million Latinos, and to \n     all Americans in general, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense & \n     Education Fund (PRLDEF), has decided to take a position on \n     his nomination.\n       Since Mr. Estrada was nominated, PRLDEF has sought to learn \n     as much as it could about his background and qualifications \n     for the important, life-tenured position of Circuit Judge. \n     Because our offices are located seven blocks away from \n     ``Ground Zero'' in New York City, our diligent efforts were \n     interrupted by a six-month delay to mourn, reflect, and \n     recover after the tragic events of September 11. Thereafter, \n     we resumed our extensive examination of Mr. Estrada's history \n     and record. We reviewed his available writings, although such \n     writings are extremely limited. We conducted dozens of \n     interviews with individuals familiar with Mr. Estrada, \n     including those who have studied and worked with him as well \n     as those who have lived in the same communities with him. We \n     also surveyed all available news media reports and other \n     public materials concerning Mr. Estrada. Finally, we \n     interviewed Mr. Estrada himself.\n       As a national civil rights organization primarily concerned \n     with advancing and protecting the civil and human rights of \n     the Latino community and all Americans through litigation, \n     policy analysis, and education, we sought to answer several \n     questions in evaluating Mr. Estrada's nomination. First and \n     foremost, is Mr. Estrada sufficiently qualified? Second, are \n     or should Mr. Estrada's reportedly extreme views by \n     disqualifying? third, would Mr. Estrada's life experiences \n     bring to the D.C. Circuit the unique sensitivities and \n     perspectives of Hispanic-Americans? Finally, does Mr. Estrada \n     possess the proper judicial temperament required for appeals \n     court nominees?\n       For the reasons stated below, we believe that Mr. Estrada \n     is not sufficiently qualified; that his reportedly extreme \n     views should be disqualifying; that he has not had a \n     demonstrated interest in or any involvement with the \n     organized Hispanic community or Hispanic activities of any \n     kind; and that he lacks the maturity and judicial temperament \n     necessary to be a circuit court judge. Accordingly, we oppose \n     his nomination and urge the United States Senate Judiciary \n     Committee to reject his nomination.\n\n\n                 ii. concerns about his qualifications\n\n       While the positions Mr. Estrada has held and his \n     intellectual abilities may initially appear impressive, they \n     are neither as complete nor as impressive in depth and scope \n     as those of many others who have been or could be appointed \n     to the elevated position of Circuit Judge. Mr. Estrada seems \n     to us to have had insufficient experience for the position of \n     United States Circuit Judge, especially in the powerful D.C. \n     Circuit. His experience is not as extensive as that of others \n     who have been appointed to the federal appellate courts and \n     have had greater depth and breadth of experience.\n       Historically, both judicial experience and academic \n     experience have been given great weight in considering \n     nominations for circuit court judgeships. Perhaps most due to \n     his relatively young age of 39 when he was nominated, \n     however, Mr. Estrada had not had any judicial experience \n     whatsoever. Nor has he had any academic or teaching \n     experience. Much of his legal experience has been devoted to \n     handling criminal law matters. In addition, he simply has not \n     developed a sufficient record upon which one could fairly \n     evaluate his positions, fairness and reasoning skills.\n       Traditionally, the written record from either scholarly \n     works or judicial opinions has historically served as the \n     best basis upon which candidates for appellate courts have \n     been evaluated. Where a written record does not exist, life \n     experiences and activities have been relied upon to help \n     measure fairness and reasoning skills. Mr. Estrada's record \n     provides a wholly inadequate basis upon which to conclude \n     that he can be a fair and impartial court judge. This is \n     especially relevant and important given the fact that a\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\n     number of his colleagues have said unequivocally that Mr. \n     Estrada has expressed extreme views that they believe to \n     be outside the mainstream of legal and political thought. \n     Unfortunately, we could not fully test these strong \n     impressions against Mr. Estrada's very limited record. If \n     Mr. Estrada first served as a district court judge or in \n     another judicial capacity, we would have a much more \n     complete record upon which to assess his later nomination \n     to the court of appeals.\n\n\n                     iii. concerns about his views\n\n       Despite the absence of a written record of Mr. Estrada's \n     views, concerns over whether Mr. Estrada could impartially \n     serve on an appellate court have been heightened because \n     individuals who have worked with and even supervised him have \n     both privately and publicly stated that he is an ideologue \n     with extremely strong ideological views, and would have \n     difficulty keeping those views from affecting his judgment \n     when deciding cases as an appellate judge. He has reportedly \n     made strong statements that have been interpreted as hostile \n     to criminal defendants' rights, affirmative action and \n     women's rights. Additionally, he has clearly chosen to be \n     actively engaged principally with ideological causes and \n     organizations, such as the Federalist Society and the Center \n     for the Community Interest. Members of these groups have been \n     outspoken on the issues we believe are of concern to \n     minorities, the very groups Mr. Estrada should be sensitive \n     to. It is also particularly noteworthy that some of the most \n     ideologically extreme organizations in our nation have \n     endorsed his nomination.\n       Because of Mr. Estrada's very limited written record, \n     coupled with his refusal to answer detailed questions about \n     his ideological views, the public and private reports of his \n     extreme ideological views were not effectively rebutted, and \n     should therefore be disqualifying.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee asked Mr. Estrada to provide \n     information on the ten most significant litigated matters \n     that he personally handled and whether he had played any role \n     in a political campaign. Curiously, Mr. Estrada failed to \n     include two important activities in his response. He \n     neglected to mention that he participated in the preparation \n     of a brief in the Bush v. Gore election recount litigation, \n     and that he served on the Bush Department of Justice \n     Transition Team.\n       When questioned on whether the Supreme Court has hired \n     enough minority law clerks, Mr. Estrada's response was ``if \n     there was some reason for underrepresentation, it would be \n     something to look into . . . but I don't have any reason to \n     think it's anything other than a reflection of trends in \n     society.'' He said that he does not know whether he has been \n     a beneficiary of affirmative action or not. He explained \n     that he may be for or against affirmative action depending \n     upon the particular issues at hand.\n       Bush Administration supporters of Mr. Estrada tout his \n     nomination by stressing that he is the first Hispanic to be \n     nominated to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and could \n     become the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice. This \n     ``Hispanic'' touting is at odds with Mr. Estrada's clearly \n     expressed desire to be judged only ``on the merits.'' Mr. \n     Estrada's views on the ethnic dimension of his candidacy \n     notwithstanding, it is clear that the Bush Administration \n     fully intends this to be a ``Hispanic'' nomination to the \n     Court. This intent is what compels our interest in and \n     underscores both the importance of this nomination and the \n     relevance of this issue to the Hispanic community.\n\n\n            iv. concerns of the hispanic-american community\n\n       Of greatest concern to the Latino community is Mr. \n     Estrada's clear lack of any connection whatsoever to the \n     issues, needs, and concerns of the organized Hispanic \n     community. It is indeed ironic that someone promoted as a \n     Hispanic has neither shown any demonstrated interest in, nor \n     has had any involvement with many Hispanic organizations or \n     activities throughout his entire life in the United States. \n     Nor has he been involved with, supportive of, or responsive \n     to issues of concern to Latinos.\n       Some have attempted to portray his story as a compelling \n     one of a Hispanic who came to this country speaking little to \n     no English. In stark contrast with this story, however, the \n     reality is that Mr. Estrada appears to have come from a \n     privileged background and received English training and \n     education prior to his arrival in the United States. This \n     training enabled Mr. Estrada to participate fully in the \n     educational opportunities afforded to him in the United \n     States. As the son of a lawyer and a bank vice president who \n     had the resources to finance superior educational \n     opportunities for him, Mr. Estrada has not lived the \n     educationally or economically disadvantaged life his \n     proponents would have others believe. Nor have Mr. Estrada's \n     life experience resembled or been shared with those of \n     Latinos who have experienced discrimination or struggled with \n     poverty, indifference or unfairness.\n       Knowledge of people and of their aspirations for fairness \n     and justice should be possessed by all candidates for \n     judicial office. Mr. Estrada has lived a very different life \n     from that of most Latinos--a life isolated from their \n     experience and concerns. Once he made it, he both disappeared \n     from and never became connected or committed to the Hispanic \n     community. As a result, we believe that he lacks the \n     sensitivity and perspectives shared by the majority of \n     Hispanic-Americans in our country. During our interview with \n     him, he took offense at the view that he is disconnected from \n     the Hispanic community, but he countered those concerns \n     merely by asserting that he listens to Hispanic music and \n     reads Spanish language books. We believe that he is \n     disconnected from the real-world activities that would \n     enable him to contribute uniquely to the development of \n     the law and the enhancement of the administration of \n     justice, as have other Hispanics who have served as judges \n     before him.\n\n\n               V. CONCERNS ABOUT HIS JUDICIAL TEMPERAMENT\n\n       We have serious concerns about Mr. Estrada's judicial \n     temperament. Simply put, he has been described as one who is \n     arrogant and elitist. It has been reported that he \n     ``harangues his colleagues'' and ``doesn't listen to other \n     people.'' We witnessed these qualities first-hand during our \n     interview.\n       Based largely on our personal observations, we now firmly \n     believe that Mr. Estrada lacks the maturity and temperament \n     that a candidate for high judicial office should possess. In \n     our view, he does not have the humility or the demeanor \n     typical of worthy nominees to our nation's federal bench. He \n     does not appear to us to be even-tempered. While Mr. Estrada \n     may have been understandably apprehensive about the \n     opportunity to meet with PRLDEF to allay its concerns, he was \n     surprisingly contentious, confrontational, aggressive and \n     even offensive in his verbal exchanges with us.\n       He made several inappropriately judgmental and immature \n     comments about PRLDEF. He characterized some of PRLDEF's \n     president's comments as ``boneheaded.'' He indicated that \n     were it not for his quasi-public status as a judicial \n     nominee, our comments might otherwise be actionable. He \n     stated that we ``had probably already made up [our] minds to \n     oppose his nomination because the person [we] had supported \n     had lost the presidential election.'' In fact. PRLDEF had not \n     made up its mind nor had it endorsed any presidential \n     candidate. Mr. Estrada also made a fleeting reference to \n     ``[our] Democratic senator friends on the Hill.'' In fact, \n     PRLDEF has Republican senator friends on the Hill as well. He \n     also challenged PRLDEF's board chair on how [we] could say \n     that ``there is a strong consensus among Hispanic attorneys \n     and Hispanics in general that they do not want to see a \n     Hispanic Clarence Thomas on the U.S. Supreme Court.''\n\n\n                             VI. conclusion\n\n       For all of the above reasons, we strongly believe that Mr. \n     Estrada's nomination should be opposed and rejected. \n     Potential nominees who aspire to such important positions as \n     circuit judges should be better qualified and possess the \n     unquestioned ability to be fair, open-minded and committed to \n     equal justice for all Americans. They should be connected to \n     the real-world concerns of the people who will be governed by \n     their decisions. They should also be even-tempered. In our \n     view, Mr. Estrada clearly does not possess the qualities \n     necessary to be placed in such an important position of \n     trust--for a lifetime--interpreting and guarding the rights \n     of ordinary Americans.\n       For more information contact the offices of Pierre M. \n     LaRamee, Executive Vice President Puerto Rican Legal Defense \n     and Education Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, very briefly, we were going back and forth. \nI agreed to let the Senator from Arizona go out of order. I see the \nSenator from Iowa waiting, and he will also be out of order. I know the \nSenator from California is coming to the Chamber. Will the Senator from \nIowa give me some idea how much time he wants? I have no objection to \nhim going out of order.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have no objection coming back at 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Iowa is here, and the Senator from \nCalifornia is not here. Why doesn't the Senator from Iowa go forward \nand then yield to the Senator from California after she arrives? Will \nthe Senator from Iowa have any objection to that?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In other words, if she comes in, I would stop and let \nher speak?\n  Mr. LEAHY. How much time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I think 20 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, why doesn't the Senator just go ahead.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Like I said, I can come back at 5:30 p.m.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator should feel free to go ahead. When he is \nfinished, then if the Senator from California can be recognized next.\n  I might also note the Senator from Arizona was speaking of stopping a \nfilibuster; otherwise stopping somebody from being heard on the floor. \nI note there are many ways of doing this. For example, the Senator from \nArizona is one who voted against even the motion to proceed on Judge \nRichard Paez and then also voted against him. That is\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\none of the many well-qualified or highest qualification nominees of \nPresident Clinton's against whom he voted. That is one of the many ways \nof stopping a nomination.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since the Senator from Vermont just mentioned \nmy name, may I briefly respond?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona mentioned my name \nabout 20 different times. If we are going to respond to each one, I \nwill be glad to do it. I am trying to yield so the Senator from Iowa \ncan have the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Iowa give me 15 \nseconds, and I will be happy to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I voted for invoking cloture on the Paez nomination because, \nof course, I agree with Senator Leahy that we should not filibuster a \njudge nominated by the President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. As I recall, we all voted for cloture. The motion to \nproceed to even get there was the crucial vote when the Senator from \nArizona voted against the motion to proceed.\n  I yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield me 10 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. There were several votes against cloture that did not pass \nunanimously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy \nfor his consideration. Obviously, since I voted for this nomination out \nof committee and I argued last year that the nomination should have \ncome up last year, I am strongly in support of President Bush's \nnominee, Miguel Estrada. I think he is a very qualified judicial \nnominee and will make an excellent member of the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the DC Circuit.\n\n  Not only is he regarded as one of the Nation's top appellate lawyers, \nbut the American Bar Association, which I think Democrats consider the \ngold standard of determination of a person's qualifications to be a \njudicial nominee, has given him a unanimous rating of, in their words, \n``well qualified.'' This happens to be the highest American Bar \nAssociation rating. It is a rating they would not give to just any \nlawyer who comes up the pike. According to the American Bar \nAssociation, quoting from their standard:\n\n       To merit a rating of well qualified, the nominee must be at \n     the top of the legal profession in his or her legal \n     community, have outstanding legal ability, breadth of \n     experience, the highest reputation for integrity and either \n     have demonstrated or exhibited the capacity for judicial \n     temperament.\n\n  Just think of some of those words: ``The highest reputation for \nintegrity'' and having ``demonstrated or exhibited the capacity for \njudicial temperament.'' This was from the American Bar Association's \nrating of well qualified.\n  We ought to demand that more of these people be appointed to the \nbench rather than fighting their nomination. Mr. Estrada then certainly \ndeserves the American Bar Association's most qualified rating.\n  As my colleagues know, I am not a lawyer. There is nothing wrong with \ngoing to law school, but I did not. I have been on the Judiciary \nCommittee my entire time in the Senate. I know some of the \nqualifications that are needed to be a Federal judge and particularly a \nFederal judge on this DC Circuit that handles so many appeals from \nadministrative agencies and is often considered, by legal experts, to \nbe the second highest court of our land.\n  Mr. Estrada's academic credentials are stellar. He earned his juris \ndoctorate from Harvard University, magna cum laude, where he was editor \nof the Harvard Law Review. Mr. Estrada did not just attend Harvard Law \nSchool; he graduated with honors. He also served as the editor of the \nHarvard Law Review.\n  To be selected as the editor of a law review is a feat that only the \nmost exceptional of law students attain. Not only did he excel in law \nschool, but he graduated from Columbia University with his bachelor's \ndegree magna cum laude and was also a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n  Mr. Estrada certainly has the intellect required to be a Federal \nCourt of Appeals judge. His professional background also gives \ntestament to his being qualified for a Federal Court of Appeals \njudgeship as opposed to just any judgeship.\n  After law school, Mr. Estrada served as a law clerk to the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals, and to Justice Kennedy, on the United States \nSupreme Court. Subsequently, he served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney \nand Deputy Chief of the appellate section of the U.S. Attorney's Office \nof the Southern District of New York, and then as assistant to the \nSolicitor General of the United States of America, officed in \nWashington, DC.\n  Mr. Estrada has been in the private sector as well. He is a partner \nwith the Washington, DC, office of the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher. So for a very young lawyer, I think I can give my colleagues \na person who can truly be labeled an American success story. In fact, \ninstead of downgrading his ability to serve as a circuit court judge, \nwe should all be proud of Mr. Estrada's many accomplishments.\n  We are hearing that the Democrats are considering a filibuster of \nthis exceptionally qualified lawyer. In all my years on the Judiciary \nCommittee--and that has been my entire tenure in the Senate--\nRepublicans never once filibustered a Democratic President's nominee to \nthe Federal bench. There are many I may have wanted to filibuster, but \nI did not do it--we did not do it--because it is not right.\n  This nominee, like all nominees, deserves an up-or-down vote. \nAnything less is absolutely unfair. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will strongly consider this proposed filibuster \nbefore they cross this Rubicon and establish new precedent for \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. Estrada's opponents claim he has not answered questions or \nproduced documentation, and so he should not be confirmed to the \nFederal bench. I can think of a number of Democratic nominees who did \nnot sufficiently answer even my questions, but that did not lead me to \nfilibuster. As far as I know, Mr. Estrada has answered all questions \nposed to him by the Judiciary Committee members, and that the Justice \nDepartment has directed certain in-house memos not be turned over \nbecause this is the policy of the Department and this documentation has \nnever been produced to the Judiciary Committee. This is not just the \npolicy of this administration, the Bush administration, a Republican \nadministration. This has also been the policy under Democratic \nPresidents.\n  So once more, we see a coalescing of liberal activists circling the \nwagon around a very talented, very principled, highly qualified legal \nmind to defeat Mr. Estrada's nomination solely because these activists \nhave determined that he may not comply with some sort of liberal \nideological agenda. These liberal interests only want the Senate to \nconfirm judicial nominees who will be sure to implement a left-wing \nagenda, and if there is any question they will not do their bidding, \nthen those judges and those nominees better watch out.\n  As far as I can see, the concerns raised about Mr. Estrada are pure \nspeculation and, most importantly, highly politically motivated. This \nis a disgrace. It is an outrage, but we must put a stop to these \nunfounded political attacks and get on with the business of confirming \nto the Federal bench good men and women who are committed to doing what \njudges should do, interpret law as opposed to those who make law from \nthe bench, because it is our responsibility to make law as members of \nthe legislative branch.\n  Additionally, we have concerns materializing out of thin air that Mr. \nEstrada may not have the right judicial temperament for the job. Of \ncourse, that goes contrary to the analysis made by the American Bar \nAssociation committee which gave him a well-qualified determination, \nand that well-qualified determination only goes to those people who \nhave judicial temperament.\n  This determination against Mr. Estrada, by these activists, goes to \nthe point that he is some right-wing ideologue who will impose his own \nviews and cannot be trusted to follow the law written by Congress. In \nmy opinion, these concerns and these allegations\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\nare fabrication and pure speculation. They have no basis in fact. To \nthe contrary, numerous present and former co-workers, as well as \nindividuals who know Mr. Estrada and his work very well, have written \nletters to the Judiciary Committee expressing strong support for Mr. \nEstrada. They go on to say he will take the law seriously, apply \nSupreme Court precedent faithfully, and not rule based upon personal \nviews and political perspectives.\n  If a judge has the law in front of him, if a judge is willing to \nfollow the interpretation of the Supreme Court, and if a judge leaves \nout his personal views and leaves out his own political perspectives, \nthen what he has in front of him is only the language of the law and \nthe precedent. That is what a judge is supposed to make his decision \non. That is what he said he would do. More importantly, people who have \nknown him over a long period of time are convinced he will so do.\n  Letters from Republicans and Democrats have highly praised Mr. \nEstrada's intellect, judgment, integrity, and ethics. Yet we still have \nsome who are quick to lend credence to unfounded attacks which appear \nto have been generated primarily by Paul Bender, a former politically \nappointed supervisor in the Solicitor General's Office during the \nClinton administration.\n  Clearly, Mr. Bender's allegations are politically motivated. Not only \nis Mr. Bender a liberal activist, his own out-of-the-mainstream views \non matters such as pornography cast serious doubts on his ability to \nfairly judge Mr. Estrada's qualifications. Need I remind my colleagues \nof the Clinton administration where they had a flip-flop fiasco in the \nKnox case, where Mr. Bender had a heavy hand in formulating a very \nextremist position that directly ran counter to a child pornography \nstatute and to clear congressional intent about that child pornography \nstatute.\n  Need I remind my colleagues that Mr. Bender's position would have \nresulted in the freeing of a twice-convicted child pornographer who had \ndemonstrated a tendency to lure underage girls into criminal \nrelationships. Need I remind my colleagues of the resolution they \nthemselves voted on in the House and Senate that soundly rejected Mr. \nBender's position in the Knox brief? I highly doubt Mr. Bender's own \njudgment is unbiased enough to provide an accurate recommendation of \nMr. Estrada's ability to be a judge on the DC Circuit, particularly \nwhen these statements contradict Mr. Bender's own contemporaneous, \nglowing evaluations of Mr. Estrada when Mr. Estrada was one of those he \nsupervised at the Solicitor General's office. Mr. Estrada was given \nglowing evaluations by Mr. Bender.\n\n  I also point out that Mr. Bender appears to be the only one of Mr. \nEstrada's former colleagues at the Department of Justice that now \nquestions Mr. Estrada's ability to be a good judge. In fact, as far as \nI know, everyone else who has worked with Mr. Estrada has praised his \nrecord to the high heavens and believes he is more than qualified for \nthis judgeship. It is obvious that Mr. Estrada's record and his \nintegrity have been unfairly and baselessly attacked by a political \nhatchet person.\n  To whom are we going to listen? To whom do we 100 Senators listen? \nThe American Bar Association, which interviewed scores of people and \ngave Mr. Estrada a unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating. The colleagues \nwho know and who have observed Mr. Estrada's work over the years? Or \nare we going to listen to an advocate for freeing child pornographers, \na man who is so extreme that his outrageous legal views were \nuniversally condemned in that vote on child pornography in the House \nand Senate?\n  In addition, last week, in a Democratic caucus press conference held \nby the Senator minority leader, a representative of the Mexican \nAmerican Legal Defense and Education Fund criticized the statement that \nI made in the Judiciary Committee's consideration of Mr. Estrada when I \nwas speaking for his name to be voted out of committee. This is what I \nsaid: If we deny Miguel Estrada this position on the DC Circuit, it \nwould be to shut the door on the American dream for Hispanic Americans \neverywhere.\n  I said that because I believe it. Mr. Estrada is an example and a \nrole model for all Americans, but he is a particularly bright and \nshining light for the Hispanic and immigrant communities in the United \nStates of America. I don't happen to be alone in that belief. The \nLeague of United Latin American Citizens agrees with me because in a \nletter to Senator Leahy, the League of United Latin American Citizens \nexpressed its strong support for Mr. Estrada, saying: Few Hispanic \nattorneys have as strong educational credentials as Mr. Estrada, who \ngraduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia College and magnum cum laude \nfrom Harvard, where he was editor of the Harvard Law Review.\n  Continuing: He also served as a law clerk to the Honorable Anthony M. \nKennedy in the U.S. Supreme Court, making him only one of a handful of \nHispanic attorneys to have had this opportunity. He is truly one of the \nrising stars in the Hispanic community and a role model for our youth. \nThat is from the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n  The Latino Coalition, a national Latino organization, also agrees \nthat Mr. Estrada should be approved. They expressed in a press release \nlast April that ``to deny Latinos, the Nation's largest minority, the \nopportunity to have one of our own serve on this court in the Nation's \nCapital is unforgivable.'' I agree.\n  We also have the National Association of Small Disadvantaged \nBusinesses. In another letter to Senator Leahy, the president of the \nNational Association of Small Disadvantaged Businesses said: Mr. \nEstrada's appointment as a first Hispanic member of the DC Circuit will \nbe a benefit to us in further illustrating the wide range of talent in \nthe minority community just waiting to be effectively and fully used.\n\n  Mr. Estrada was not nominated just because he is Hispanic. The \nPresident nominated him because he is one of the most qualified lawyers \nin the country to serve in this position, not one of the most qualified \nHispanic lawyers. However, because he is Hispanic, his nomination sends \nthe clear message that with hard work anyone can achieve success. It \nspeaks all about opportunity, the offering of opportunity for all kinds \nof people in America. In this case, especially, to Hispanics. He \nabsolutely is the kind of role model that Hispanic youth should look up \nto, and we ought to encourage that opportunity.\n  Unfortunately, some in the Hispanic community do not believe Mr. \nEstrada is Hispanic enough. I don't know where they are coming from--\nHispanic enough? What does that mean? According to the National Review \nat last week's Democratic press conference, representatives of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, an organization I referred to before \nwith the acronym MALDEF, and then another organization, the Puerto \nRican Legal Defense and Education Fund, criticized Mr. Estrada for not \nbeing authentically Hispanic. If you are Hispanic, who is going to say \nwhether or not you are authentically Hispanic? He is Hispanic as a \nresult of his birth and the background of generations before him. Is \nthat somehow supposed to fit people into a class that you isolate \nyourself and you have to have certain aspects about you that are \nuncompromising, or is it OK in America, whether you are German, \nItalian, African American, Hispanic, don't you have a right to be an \nindividual? Can't you just be Mary Smith and Joe Smith and Mr. Estrada \nand anybody else you want to be as an individual? What is there about \nbeing authentically Hispanic?\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the National Review \nentitled ``Dems to Miguel Estrada: You're not Hispanic Enough'' be \nprinted in the Record after my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Also at that press conference, remarks were made that \none had to have more than a Hispanic surname to be considered Hispanic. \nI find these remarks do not make any sense. What they are saying is, \nunless you think as they do, you are not really Hispanic. In other \nwords, if you do not think as they do, you cannot possibly be Hispanic. \nWhat an outrageous idea in 21st century America. The tag line that Mr. \nEstrada ``isn't Hispanic enough'' is code words for ``he isn't liberal \nenough.'' Yet at this Democratic\n\n[[Page S2085]]\n\npress conference, participants describe the underrepresentation of \nHispanics in the legislative and executive branches of the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  The President has nominated one of the most qualified attorneys in \nthe country to be a judge on the second highest court of the land, and \nthis person, of outstanding capabilities, with degrees from Columbia \nand Harvard, happens to be a Hispanic. Not only is he Hispanic, but he \nis an immigrant to this country who at the age of 17 came here from \nHonduras speaking little English. He learned the language, worked hard, \nrose to the top of his legal profession. One would think these groups \nwould be happy with this nomination. But no, they stand in firm \nopposition to Mr. Estrada. You see, these groups believe a person is \nonly Hispanic when he or she believes what these groups believe.\n  That is intellectual prejudice. I urge my colleagues to resist the \nrhetoric of ideological prejudice and to overwhelmingly support the \nconfirmation of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. Court for the DC Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the National Review, Feb. 6, 2003]\n\n           Dems to Miguel Estrada: You're Not Hispanic Enough\n\n                            (By Byron York)\n\n       The headline from Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle's news \n     conference Wednesday was his threat to filibuster the \n     appeals-court nomination of Miguel Estrada. ``There is \n     overwhelming opposition within our caucus to Mr. Estrada,'' \n     Daschle said. ``Because we're in the minority, we have no \n     other option in some cases . . . than to filibuster \n     nominations. We don't take that responsibility lightly, but \n     we hold it to be an important tool that we will use.'' \n     Daschle said he will make the filibuster decision next week.\n       But the more interesting story from Daschle's appearance \n     was the strange disconnect between the reasons he gave to \n     oppose Estrada and the reasons cited by a number of Hispanic \n     interest-group leaders who appeared with Daschle.\n       To hear Daschle tell it, Estrada's alleged refusal to \n     answer questions at his confirmation hearing had virtually \n     forced Democrats to vote against him, and perhaps to \n     filibuster the nomination. Democratic senators take their \n     advise-and-consent role very seriously, Daschle said, and, \n     ``In our view, we have been thwarted from fulfilling our \n     constitutional obligation.''\n       But to hear representatives from the Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, and \n     others tell it, the Estrada nomination should be killed not \n     because of Estrada's alleged refusal to answer questions or \n     because of constitutional obligations but because Estrada, \n     who was born and raised in Honduras before coming to the \n     United States and learning English at the age of 17, is \n     simply not authentically Hispanic.\n       ``Being Hispanic for us means much more than having a \n     surname,'' said New Jersey Rep. Bob Menendez, a member of the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus. ``It means having some \n     relationship with the reality of what it is to live in this \n     country as a Hispanic American.'' Even though Estrada is of \n     Hispanic origin, and even though he lives in this country, \n     Menendez argued, he falls short of being a true Hispanic. \n     ``Mr. Estrada told us that him being Hispanic he sees having \n     absolutely nothing to do with his experience or his role as a \n     federal court judge. That's what he said to us.'' Menendez \n     found that deeply troubling.\n       But Menendez was relatively kind to Estrada compared to the \n     representatives of Hispanic interest groups. Angelo Falcon, \n     an official of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund, railed about the ``Latino Horatio Alger story that's \n     been concocted'' about Estrada's success and, more generally, \n     about the ``concocted, invented Latino imagery'' of Estrada's \n     life.\n       ``As the Latino community becomes larger and larger in the \n     country, as we gain more political influence, as we become \n     more diverse, the issue of what is a Hispanic becomes more \n     problematic,'' Falcon explained. ``It's not good enough to \n     simply say that because of someone's genetics or surname that \n     they should be considered Hispanic.''\n       Marisa Demeo from the Mexican American Legal Defense and \n     Education Fund went even farther. Not only is Estrada not \n     authentically Hispanic, Demeo argued, but his elevation to \n     the federal bench would ``crush'' the American dream for \n     millions of genuine Hispanics in the United States.\n       Demeo was particularly angry at Republican Judiciary \n     Committee member Sen. Charles Grassley, who last week said \n     that, ``If we deny Mr. Estrada a position on the D.C. \n     Circuit, it will be to shut the door on the American dream of \n     Hispanic Americans everywhere.'' ``Actually, the reverse is \n     true,'' Demeo said. ``If the Senate confirms Mr. Estrada, his \n     own personal American dream will come true, but the American \n     dreams of the majority of Hispanics living in this country \n     will come to an end through his future legal decisions.''\n       Through it all, Daschle stood by impassively. He couldn't \n     very well cite Estrada's alleged lack of authentic Hispanic-\n     ness as a reason to filibuster and kill the nomination; even \n     the most partisan Democratic senator would have a hard time \n     making that argument. Yet he remained quiet while his allies \n     bashed Estrada in the most personal terms.\n       It made some observers question just why Democrats are \n     opposing Estrada. Do they really believe their words about \n     their ``constitutional obligations,'' or are they going along \n     with the angry interest groups who are pushing them to do it?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, could I read something for the \nadministrative staff?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I assume this is without objection from the other side. \nI thank the Senator from California.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 5 o'clock today the Senate proceed to \nthe consideration of the following nominations en bloc: Executive \nCalendar Nos. 28, 29, 30; provided further that there be 15 minutes of \ndebate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that following that debate, the Senate \nthen immediately proceed to three consecutive votes on the confirmation \nof the nominations, with no intervening action or debate; provided \nfurther that, following those votes, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to explain my position on the \nnomination of Miguel Estrada and to speak more generally on the state \nof the nomination process in today's Senate.\n  This is a difficult time for all of us in the Senate and, indeed, the \nNation. We stand on the brink of war, with an economy that is \nsputtering, and the threat of international terrorism as close at hand \nas it has ever been. These are serious issues, issues the American \npeople have sent us here to debate and to try to solve. In doing so, it \nis vital we come together as a Government, not as Democrats versus \nRepublicans, or Congress versus the White House, but as one Government \nand one Nation. As best we can, we should work together, consult each \nother, debate the issues forthrightly and with strength of purpose, and \nthen come to agreement on how to solve the problems that confront us.\n  One of the reasons this issue is so important is because the judges \nwe confirm over the next few years will help decide whether acts of \nCongress will stand or will be struck down. They will decide how far \nthe law will go to protect the safety and rights of the American \npeople. They will have the power to limit or expand civil rights \nprotections. They will have great leeway to interpret the laws \nprotecting or limiting a woman's right to choose. They will be able to \nexpand or limit gun control laws, laws against child pornography, \ncampaign finance laws, and many more. In a real sense, these judges \nwill have as much power, or more, than any of us in this body. Clearly, \nthe court with the biggest impact will be the Supreme Court. But the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit Court is a close second and is often cited \nas the most powerful court in the Nation. It is no coincidence that the \nDC Circuit has produced more Supreme Court Justices than any other \ncircuit. Three of the nine current Justices--Justice Scalia, Justice \nThomas, and Justice Ginsburg sat on the DC Circuit. In fact, it is hard \nto overstate the importance of an appointment to the United States \nCircuit Court of Appeals and particularly the DC Circuit.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States is our Nation's court of last \nresort. But it heard less than 80 cases in the 2000-2001 session. In \ncontrast, the Federal courts of appeal considered over 27,000 cases \nduring the same period. For so many of the legal injuries for which \npeople seek redress, the courts of appeal are the last stop, the \nultimate decisionmaker. And the DC Circuit is the most important of all \ncircuit courts because it is the court that most closely oversees the \nactions of Federal agencies; actions that have\n\n[[Page S2086]]\n\nreal, everyday impact on the lives of all Americans. The DC Circuit \nreviews appeals regarding decisions by the Federal Communications \nCommission, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Election \nCommission, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, the Endangered Species Act, and the \nEnvironmental Protection Act, including the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act; the Superfund, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, \nand countless other agencies and statutes.\n  Because the Supreme Court reviews so few cases, the DC Circuit \nessentially has the last say on whether decisions by these agencies \nwill stand or will not stand. In recent years, the DC Circuit has \nbecome a hostile forum for environmental protections. Since 1990, the \nDC Circuit has struck down or hindered a long list of crucial \nenvironmental protections, including clean air protections for soot and \nsmog, habitat protection under the Endangered Species Act, clean water \nprotection for millions of acres of wetlands, fuel efficiency standards \nknown as CAFE standards, designation of sites on the Superfund National \nPriorities List, and guidelines on treatment of petroleum wastewater.\n  As Senator Kennedy pointed out in Miguel Estrada's hearing, the \nrecent case of Maryland/DC/Delaware Broadcasters Association v. the \nFCC, the DC Circuit found a portion of the FCC's equal opportunity \npolicy unconstitutional. Specifically, the court struck down a policy \nof broad outreach for minority broadcasters. This decision, right or \nwrong, will have a significant impact on the ability of the FCC to \nencourage minority participation in the broadcast industry.\n  Incidentally, Mr. Estrada essentially refused to comment on this case \nwhen asked to do so.\n  Steffan v. Perry involved a young man at the U.S. Naval academy, \nJoseph Steffan, who admitted to two of his classmates that he was gay, \nalthough he never admitted actually performing any homosexual acts. \nSteffan was discharged under Department of Defense regulations \nindicating that homosexuality is incompatible with military service. \nSteffan argued his dismissal was impermissible, as it was based on \nstatus--being gay--not conduct. The DC Circuit held, in 1994, that the \nDefense Department regulations were permissible, however, and that the \nSteffan dismissal would stand.\n  I could go on and on with cases--United States v. Bailey, for \ninstance. Or AKA v. Washington Hospital Center, where the court ruled \nin favor of an orderly who, after 19 years of work, was forced to have \nheart surgery and who was then denied the right to transfer to another \njob within the hospital that would not require the same level of \nphysical activity.\n  The District of Columbia Circuit is also the court that most often \nreviews terrorism cases on appeal.\n  All in all, it is quite clear that the District of Columbia Circuit \nis constantly at the center of complex key issues of the day.\n  Currently, there is a delicate balance on this court. There are four \nRepublican appointees, four Democratic appointees, and four vacancies. \nTherefore, this nominee effectively tilts the balance on that court. \nThat is why many of us believe it is so important to learn how this \nnominee thinks, what his judicial temperament would be, and so on.\n  During the last several years of the Clinton administration, two \nhighly qualified Clinton nominees were blocked permanently. Some \nbelieve its purpose was to initiate a concerted, planned effort to keep \nvacancies open on that court so they could be filled with conservatives \nin the event of a Republican President.\n  When President Bush took office, he sent us two nominees for the \ndistrict circuit. One of them is Miguel Estrada. I don't believe it is \nappropriate for us to simply block all nominees to the District of \nColumbia Circuit in retaliation for that having been done to Democratic \nnominees. That is not why I am here today. But at the same time, we \ncannot ignore the fact that this important circuit is now so closely \ndivided. In deciding whether to confirm a given nominee to such a \ndelicately balanced court, we must ensure that the judges we send to \nthe court can administer the law fairly and impartially. That is the \ncase before us today: Can Miguel Estrada administer the law fairly and \nimpartially?\n  We have before us a 41-year-old nominee about whom we know very \nlittle. To properly discharge our constitutionally derived advise and \nconsent function, the Members of the Senate must be given enough \ninformation to make the right decision about a given nominee.\n  In this case, I have heard many comments on this nominee as a very \nbright but ideologically driven young attorney, one who would put his \nbeliefs ahead of the law if confirmed to the Federal bench. So I want \nto try to figure out whether or not that is true. Many who knew him, \nknow him, have supervised him, or have spoken to him believe strongly \nthat he does not have the temperament or impartiality necessary to \nfairly administer the law.\n  My office has received literally thousands of calls about this \nnomination--more than 7,900 phone calls, to be exact. Fewer than 300 of \nthose 7,900 calls were in favor of Miguel Estrada's nomination.\n  To counteract serious concerns from those who know him and from those \nwhom we represent, we need evidence that would contradict these \nopinions. Quite frankly, we do not have that evidence.\n  Miguel Estrada has never been a judge. So we have no record of \njudicial decision-making to examine. This is not dispositive in itself, \nbut it is the first area where we find no record to help us in our \ndecision.\n  Mr. Estrada is not a prolific writer. So we have no real record of \nwriting to examine. Again, this alone would not be dispositive, but it \nis strike 2 in terms of where we can get information about this \nnominee.\n  We have not been granted access to the memos he wrote at the \nDepartment of Justice. So we can only take the word of the man who \nsupervised him that those memos were ideologically driven and that he \ncould not be trusted.\n  Mr. Estrada refused to adequately participate in his own confirmation \nhearings, which I will comment on as a great surprise to me and the \nreason I changed my view. So we have no real answers to our questions.\n  Let me expand on this last point because I think it is instructive to \nexamine and contrast our experience with Mr. Estrada and our experience \nwith one other nominee.\n  At last week's markup, I was struck by the lack of information about \nthis nominee. Yet, as I said, I liked him very much when I met with him \npersonally. But I was startled by his performance at the public \nhearing.\n  So I got the transcripts, and I reread the transcripts to try to see \nif there was anything I missed--something I could zero in on that would \nlet me know he would in fact be fair and impartial.\n\n  What came to my mind was the real contrast with another nominee. That \nnominee is a man by the name of Jeffrey Sutton. He also was \ncontroversial. The disabilities community had a lot of concerns about \nhim. But Mr. Sutton at his hearing answered every question put to him \nintelligently, in a fulsome way, and I thought forthrightly. So I could \ntell how he would act as an appellate court judge. The committee was \nable to gauge his intelligence, his manner of thinking, and we can use \nthat back-and-forth to help us predict whether Mr. Sutton would be a \ngood and fair judge or whether he would skew outcomes of cases to meet \nhis own ideological goals.\n  Mr. Estrada, on the other hand, did his best to keep from putting \nhimself on the record on any issue of real substance. For instance, \nwhen Senator Schumer asked Mr. Estrada to name three Supreme Court \ncases in the last 40 years with which he disagreed, Mr. Estrada simply \nrefused to answer.\n  When I asked him whether he believed Roe v. Wade was correctly \ndecided, he declined to answer on the basis that he had not done what \nthe ``judicial function would require'' to determine whether the Court \ncorrectly decided the case.\n  When Senator Leahy asked him what he thought of the decision in Romer \nv. Evans, a case involving discrimination against homosexuals, Estrada \nresponded ``I can't know because I was not a judge in the case.''\n  When Senator Kennedy asked Mr. Estrada a written question about a\n\n[[Page S2087]]\n\nunion retaliation case decided by the DC Circuit in 2001 and reversed \nby the Supreme Court last term, Estrada responded ``Although I have \nread the Supreme Court's opinion . . . I have not read the briefs in \nthe case, was not present at the oral argument, and have not \nindependently researched the issue decided by the Court. For those \nreasons, I am not in a position to know how I might have resolved the \nissue . . . nor am I in a position to answer the question whether the \nSupreme Court acted appropriately.''\n  When Senator Kennedy asked him in writing whether another case \ninvolving diversity outreach had been decided correctly, Estrada again \nfell back on the argument that because he had not heard oral arguments \nand had not read the briefs, he could not answer.\n  When Senator Kennedy asked Estrada about yet another Supreme Court \ncase, American Trucking v. EPA, where the Supreme Court reversed the \nDistrict of Columbia Circuit, Estrada again fell back on the argument \nthat he had not been present for oral arguments and could not, \ntherefore, comment on whether the case had been correctly decided.\n  That kind of answer makes it truly difficult to get a sense of where \na nominee is coming from in terms of thoughtful process, analysis, and \nlegal expertise.\n  When it comes to the most important circuit court in the Nation and \nthere is no record and there is no writing, the Senate of the United \nStates is entitled to know these answers.\n  It strains credibility that a nominee for the circuit court of \nappeals would still have no opinion on whether a case such as Roe was \ncorrectly decided or whether any case in the last 40 years was \nincorrectly decided.\n\n  Finally, it is troubling to get these answers from a nominee about \nwhom we know so little and who is nominated to a court that will decide \nso much for so many.\n  Taken as a whole, I could not, in good conscience, vote for this \nnominee, with so little information, recommending him to such an \nimportant lifetime appointment. And I cannot help but wonder: Why \ndidn't the President appoint him to a District court? He is younger \nthan my daughter. Give him an opportunity to produce a record and then \nmove him on to an appellate court when that record could, in fact, be \nexamined.\n  A few days after I cast my committee vote against Mr. Estrada, White \nHouse Counsel Al Gonzales sent a letter addressed to me personally \ncriticizing my vote and asking me to reconsider. Because Judge Gonzales \nhas made the letter available to others, and it has now appeared in the \npress, I find it necessary that I correct the record. And I would like \nto do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter from White \nHouse Counsel Alberto Gonzales, dated February 3, 2003, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write in response to your vote in \n     the Judiciary Committee on the nomination of Miguel Estrada \n     and to respectfully urge that you reconsider this important \n     nomination when you vote on it in the full Senate. I write in \n     particular because it appears from your statement in the \n     Committee (and on your web site) that you may possess \n     inaccurate or incomplete information on certain issues that \n     you have deemed important to the Estrada nomination.\n       First, it appears you relied on the fact that Estrada has \n     no previous judicial service. But five of the eight judges \n     currently serving on the D.C. Circuit had no previous \n     judicial experience when appointed. That includes two of \n     President Clinton's nominees, Merrick Garland, whose Justice \n     Department record was quite similar to that of Miguel \n     Estrada, and David Tatel. In addition, Judge Harry Edwards \n     had no prior judicial experience when he was nominated by \n     President Carter in 1979, and he was younger than Estrada. In \n     addition, several Ninth Circuit judges from California who \n     were appointed by President Clinton, and had your support, \n     had no prior judicial experience. That includes Judge William \n     Fletcher, Judge Raymond Fisher, and Judge Marsha Berzon.\n       The American Bar Association, which Democrat Senators Leahy \n     and Schumer have referred to as the ``gold standard,'' \n     unanimously rated Estrada ``well qualified'' for the D.C. \n     Circuit, the ABA's highest possible rating. We think the ABA \n     rating was quite appropriate in light of Estrada's excellent \n     record, including his work as an Assistant Solicitor General \n     in the Clinton and Bush Administrations, his record as a \n     federal prosecutor in New York, his service as a law clerk to \n     Justice Kennedy, and his pro bono work including his \n     volunteer representation of a death row inmate before the \n     Supreme Court. He has argued 15 cases before the Supreme \n     Court of the United States, a figure that few lawyers can \n     match, and particularly impressive for someone who immigrated \n     to this country at age 17 speaking little English.\n       Second, you also referenced a news report quoting the views \n     of Paul Bender, a former Deputy Solicitor General. Mr. Bender \n     has not written a letter to the Committee or otherwise \n     publicly explained his views, so we are unclear whether this \n     news report was accurate. But more important, as I explained \n     in a September 17, 2002, letter to then-Chairman Leahy and \n     Senator Hatch, Paul Bender in fact signed the performance \n     reviews of Miguel Estrada for the two years that they worked \n     together. The performance reviews for those years gave \n     Estrada the highest possible rating of ``outstanding'' in \n     every possible category. Significantly, the performance \n     reviews that Bender signed also stated the following to \n     support the judgment that Estrada's performance was \n     ``outstanding.''\n       ``States the operative facts and applicable law completely \n     and persuasively, with record citations, and in conformation \n     with court and office rules, and with concern for fairness, \n     clarity, simplicity, and conciseness.''\n       ``[I]s extremely knowledgeable of resource materials and \n     uses them expertly; acting independently, goes directly to \n     point of the matter and gives reliable, accurate, responsive \n     information in communicating position to others.''\n       ``[A]ll dealings, oral and written, with the courts, \n     clients, and others are conducted in a diplomatic, \n     cooperative, and candid manner.''\n       ``[A]ll briefs, motions or memoranda reviewed consistently \n     reflect no policies at variance with Department or \n     Governmental policies, or fails to discuss and analyze \n     relevant authorities.''\n       ``[i]s constantly sought for advice and counsel. Inspires \n     co-workers by example.''\n       Apart from the contemporaneous reviews that Mr. Bender \n     himself signed, it also bears mention that the Committee has \n     received letters from Seth Waxman, President Clinton's \n     Solicitor General, and a bipartisan group of 14 former \n     colleagues of Mr. Estrada in the Solicitor General's office. \n     Seth Waxman wrote to the Committee that Estrada is a ``model \n     of professionalism and competence'' and that he has ``great \n     respect both for Mr. Estrada's intellect and for his \n     integrity.'' He continued: ``In no way did I ever discern \n     that the recommendations Mr. Estrada made or the views he \n     propounded were colored in any way by his personnel views--or \n     indeed that they reflected anything other than the long-term \n     interests of the United States.'' And the bipartisan group of \n     former colleagues from the Office of Solicitor General wrote \n     to the Committee that Estrada ``would be a fair and honest \n     judge who would decide cases in accordance with applicable \n     legal principles and precedents.'' Finally, to the extent Mr. \n     Bender's own personal political and ideological views are \n     relevant, we call your attention to Senator Hatch's opening \n     statement at the hearing on September 26, 2002.\n       Third, you referenced the fact that Miguel Estrada has been \n     `accused'' of using an ideological litmus test when assisting \n     Justice Kennedy in the selection of his law clerks. We \n     respectfully do not think this ``accusation'' is credible or \n     supported. In fact, Mr. Estrada explained at his hearing that \n     he in fact has been very supportive, for example, of the \n     hiring of one law clerk for Justice Kennedy who at the time \n     worked for President Clinton, is a strong Democrat, and now \n     works for Senator Leahy on the Judiciary Committee.\n       Fourth, you noted concern among ``Hispanic organizations.'' \n     In fact, the overwhelming majority of national Hispanic \n     organizations have supported Mr. Estrada. That includes the \n     Hispanic National Bar Association, the League of United Latin \n     American Citizens, the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the \n     Hispanic Business Roundtable, and the Latino Coalition, among \n     many others. To be sure, MALDEF and PRLDEF do oppose Mr. \n     Estrada. As to Hispanic members of the House, we understand \n     that all of the Republican Hispanics support him while the \n     Democrat Hispanics do not. In any event, LULAC's statement is \n     noteworthy, as it states: ``[Estrada] is truly one of the \n     rising stars in the Hispanic community and a role model for \n     our youth.''\n       Thank you for considering this nominee in light of the \n     above information. This is an historic nomination, as Miguel \n     Estrade would be the first Hispanic to serve on the D.C. \n     Circuit. We urge you to vote to confirm him.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, in his letter, Judge Gonzales \nsuggested I based my decision to vote against Mr. Estrada on \n``inaccurate or incomplete information on certain issues that you have \ndeemed important to the Estrada nomination.''\n\n[[Page S2088]]\n\n  Needless to say, I disagree with that assessment. It is not because I \nwas misinformed that I voted against this nominee. It is because this \nnominee did not inform the committee enough. Simply put, Mr. Estrada \ndid not adequately answer the questions put to him in his hearing.\n  Particularly with a nominee who is so young, has such a very limited \nor nonexistent written record, and has been accused by so many of being \ntoo ideologically driven to serve impartially on the second highest \ncourt in the land, it is incumbent on each Member of the Senate, in our \nadvise and consent role, to thoroughly examine the nominee's thought \nprocesses and to determine whether the nominee can and will be an \nimpartial judge.\n  In this case, it was impossible to make such an assessment because \nthe nominee himself would not let us.\n  Judge Gonzales raised four specific issues in his letter. I would \nlike to take some time to go through the Gonzales charges and to answer \nthem one by one.\n  First, Judge Gonzales stated in his letter to me ``[I]t appears that \nyou relied on the fact that Estrada has no previous judicial service.''\n  It is true that Mr. Estrada has no previous judicial experience, but \nI did not rely on Mr. Estrada's lack of judicial experience, at least \nnot exclusively.\n  I said in my statement before the committee ``[i]n this case, it is \ntruly difficult to make this decision, because we have before us a \nfairly young nominee--just 41 years old--who has never been a judge, \nhas little written record to speak of, and who has not given us a real \nsense of what kind of judge he would be. He, essentially, is a blank \nslate. And if confirmed, he could serve for 30, 40 or even 50 years on \none of the highest courts in this nation. We had better be right about \nthis decision.''\n  I truly believe this. This is a big decision, as are all our \ndecisions to place nominees in lifetime positions of such power and \ninfluence over the lives of people.\n  I was concerned, and I remain concerned, that given Mr. Estrada's \nlack of judicial experience, the Judiciary Committee needed to turn to \nother sources of information to get a better sense--any sense, really--\nof the kind of judge he would be.\n  Unfortunately, we had few other sources of information to which we \ncould turn. With so few writings, no record as a professor, no access \nto legal memos he wrote while at the Department of Justice, our \ncommittee was left with little to go on as we contemplated this \nnominee.\n  Mr. Estrada's lack of judicial experience was just one factor that \nmade it more difficult to review his way of thinking and to determine \nwhat kind of judge he would become if confirmed.\n  I have supported nominees without judicial experience in the past--I \ndon't want anyone to get the wrong idea--and I would not hesitate to do \nso again when appropriate. Although I think it preferable, if possible, \nto have nominees with judicial experience, I also recognize that many \nbrilliant lawyers with no such experience have become excellent and, in \nfact, even legendary judges.\n  In this case, it was not the lack of judicial experience itself that \nconcerned me but the fact that this lack of experience, when combined \nwith the lack of information from other sources, left the committee \nwith no real basis to evaluate this nominee.\n  In his letter to me, Judge Gonzales mentioned a number of specific \nindividuals nominated to the Ninth Circuit by President Clinton, \nnominees I supported despite their lack of judicial experience. These \nnominees--Judges William Fletcher, Marsha Berzon, and Raymond Fisher--\nall had distinguished backgrounds and a wealth of background materials \nfor the committee to review, but no judicial experience.\n  Since these specific nominees were mentioned, I thought it would be \ninteresting to note the paths they took to confirmation because the \nnature of the deliberative process the Senate was able to undertake \nwith these nominees is in striking contrast to what we are confronted \nwith today.\n  William Fletcher, for instance, was nominated on April 25, 1995. His \nfirst hearing came on December 19, 1995, about 8 months later. Dr. \nFletcher had been a prolific academic writer and a distinguished law \nprofessor at the University of California at Berkeley for almost 20 \nyears by the time he was nominated. At his hearing, he had the \nopportunity--and he took it--to discuss articles he had written that \nwere critical of certain Supreme Court decisions and to explain and \ndiscuss other articles he had written on a variety of subjects. The \nJudiciary Committee had access to a wide range of written materials \nabout or written by Dr. Fletcher. And just as importantly, the \ncommittee members also had the opportunity to engage in a back and \nforth with the nominee to learn about his thought process.\n\n  In contrast to the Estrada hearing, Professor Fletcher answered every \nquestion forthrightly and fully. Where Estrada stated he could not \nanswer, Fletcher engaged in real discussion.\n  Despite this, however, William Fletcher's nomination sat without \naction until April of 1998, 3 years after his first hearing. And after \nthose 3 years, he was not yet given a vote. Instead, he was given a \nsecond hearing.\n  Finally, on October 8, 1998, almost 3\\1/2\\ years after he was first \nnominated, William Fletcher was finally confirmed. Judge Fletcher, at \nthe time of his nomination, had no judicial experience, but the \ncommittee had a wealth of other information about him and written by \nhim to properly gauge his suitability for the Ninth Circuit.\n  Furthermore, it has been reported that his nomination finally moved \nforward only after Dr. Fletcher's mother, a Federal judge herself, \nagreed to take senior status, and after President Clinton and the \nRepublican leadership agreed to appoint a judge, named by Republicans, \nto a vacancy on the Ninth Circuit. That is a good example of \ncommunication and even negotiation between the White House and the \nSenate on the issue of judicial nominations. I remember it well. And I \nthank those leaders of our committee who engaged in those discussions.\n  I am not saying that I believe Judge Fletcher's nomination path \nshould become the norm, but since Judge Gonzales mentioned Judge \nFletcher by name, it is interesting to note how that nominee, with no \njudicial experience, fared under the Republican-controlled Senate back \nthen.\n  Marsha Berzon, another nominee mentioned in Judge Gonzales' letter, \nwas nominated on January 27, 1998. Her first hearing came 6 months \nlater--not bad--on July 30, 1998. Again, at that hearing Mrs. Berzon \nanswered every conceivable question about her background, her thought \nprocess, and her other issues. Right, she had no prior judicial \nexperience. Then almost a year went by with no further action until she \nunderwent a second hearing and again submitted herself to questioning \nby the committee.\n  Just to cite one example from that second hearing, Senator Sessions \nasked Mrs. Berzon to expand upon an answer she had given at her first \nhearing about the death penalty. Quoting Senator Sessions now:\n\n       I remember I asked you about Justice Brennan's decision on \n     the unconstitutionality of the death penalty. He believed \n     that the death penalty was unconstitutional. . . . [a]nd I \n     asked you . . . .how you felt about Justice Brennan's view, \n     and you said you did not like to say what you agree with and \n     what you do not agree with when you haven't had time to think \n     about it. Fair enough. Have you had time now and would you \n     like to comment now?\n\n  In her response, Mrs. Berzon stated:\n\n       . . . I certainly have had a chance to think about it and \n     go back and look at the Constitution. And having done so, I \n     would certainly agree that the indications of that document \n     are that the Framers of the Constitution understood that \n     capital punishment would be permitted under the Constitution. \n     . . . I was a law clerk to Justice Brennan, as you know, I \n     admire him enormously as a man and a mentor. I did not agree \n     with everything that he said, and I think in particular that \n     I intend to take a more literal view to statutes and to \n     constitutional provisions than he does. It makes me more \n     comfortable, and it is the way I tend to think.\n\n  It is this back and forth that gives committee members a sense of how \nnominees think and, therefore, how they will approach the duties \nconfronting them as Federal judges.\n  By the time Marsha Berzon was finally confirmed on March 9, 2000, \nmore than 2 years and two hearings after she had been nominated, the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate had more than enough of a record to \njudge her nomination, despite her lack of judicial\n\n[[Page S2089]]\n\nexperience. This information is simply not there for Miguel Estrada.\n  Raymond Fisher was the third Ninth Circuit nominee mentioned in the \nGonzales letter. Here again is a nominee with no judicial experience \nbut, here again, unlike Mr. Estrada, Raymond Fisher had a depth and \nbreath of other experiences that allowed the committee to fully examine \nthe nominee and his nomination and come to an informed decision.\n  Raymond Fisher proved himself in many different functions to be \nimpartial, to gain the respect of his peers, and to evidence the \ntemperament required to be a Federal judge. From serving as a Supreme \nCourt clerk to working in private practice, to serving as the head of \nthe Los Angeles Police Department's civilian oversight panel, Fisher \nwas often in the public eye and continuously showed an evenhandedness \nand ability to work through complex issues that would clearly serve him \nwell from the bench.\n  Then-mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles, a Republican, said that he \nchose Fisher for the police commission job ``because he did not have a \npolitical agenda and called the facts as he saw them.''\n  That is exactly what we look for in a nominee. And in the case of \nMiguel Estrada, I am not convinced that we have it.\n  Additionally, in the Fisher, Berzon, and Fletcher cases, we had \nvolumes of support letters from every conceivable source of every \npolitical background and, most importantly, there was not significant \nopposition as exists in the Estrada case.\n  Quite frankly, if everyone who knows a nominee comes to the committee \nwith glowing praise and statements that the nominee has perfect \nknowledge, experience, and temperament to be a judge, it is obviously \neasier to feel comfortable confirming that nominee regardless of the \nlevel of actual judicial experience. Likewise, even a nominee with \noverwhelming judicial experience might face trouble if a large number \nof people who had worked with or for that nominee expressed strong \nconcerns about his or her impartiality.\n\n  Here, with Miguel Estrada, we have a man with no judicial experience \nand who has been the subject of a large volume of concern about his \ntemperament and his ability to fairly and impartially judge a given \nsituation. This, in my opinion, presents a problem.\n  The second issue raised in the Gonzales letter involves Professor \nPaul Bender, Mr. Estrada's direct supervisor at the Solicitor General's \noffice. Specifically, I mentioned in my committee statement on the \nEstrada nomination that I was concerned about a statement Professor \nBender had made in the press that Miguel Estrada is so ``ideologically \ndriven that he couldn't be trusted to state the law in a fair, neutral \nway.''\n  In response to this quote from me, Judge Gonzales cited a number of \ninternal Justice Department evaluations indicating that Professor \nBender had given Mr. Estrada positive reviews while at the Justice \nDepartment. It is relevant to the decisionmaking process when a \nnominee's former supervisor feels compelled to comment that he is too \nideologically driven to be a fair judge, and it is certainly possible \nat the very least that an attorney could be both an excellent legal \nscholar and an excellent advocate but be ill-suited for the judiciary, \nas suggested by Professor Bender.\n  In any event, I recently asked my staff to contact Professor Bender \nby telephone and ask him about his comments to the press and his past \nevaluations of Miguel Estrada. In doing so, my staff discovered some \ninteresting facts. First, I am told that Professor Bender stands by his \nstatements to the press ``100 percent'' and would say so if asked.\n  Second, according to Professor Bender, the positive evaluations that \nJudge Gonzales and others cited consisted merely of boilerplate \nlanguage next to check marks. He stated every employee received the \nhighest evaluation automatically.\n  And perhaps of most relevance, Professor Bender indicated to my staff \nthat he was already so concerned about Mr. Estrada's ideological bent \nwhile supervising him at the Department of Justice that he learned not \nto rely on his memos and in fact stopped assigning him important work. \nIn other words, as an employee of the Justice Department whose job it \nwas to advocate to the best of his ability, Miguel Estrada's direct \nsupervisor did not trust him to be fair and impartial.\n  I asked my staff to call Professor Bender and read this to him, and \nhe stands by it. This was not a last-minute conversion as some have \nsuggested but an ongoing concern.\n  I have listened to some of the attacks on Mr. Bender. I don't think \nthey reflect well on the Senate. I may not agree with everything \nProfessor Bender has done or advocated within his lifetime, but this is \na man with very impressive credentials.\n  Paul Bender graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in \n1957.\n  He served as a law clerk to Judge Learned Hand of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit and then was a law clerk to Supreme \nCourt Justice Felix Frankfurter before embarking on a distinguished \ncareer as a professor and in the U.S. Solicitor General's Office. He \nspent 24 years as a faculty member at the University of Pennsylvania \nLaw School, and he also served as dean of the Arizona State College of \nLaw. He has argued more than 20 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As a result, I think it is worth taking his comment into \nconsideration as one of many factors we must look at when trying to \ndetermine whether Mr. Estrada can be a fair and impartial judge.\n  The third issue raised in the letter sent to me and published by \nWhite House counsel is the fact that I ``referenced the fact that \nMiguel Estrada has been `accused' of using an ideological litmus test \nwhen assisting Justice Kennedy in the selection of his law clerks.''\n  This is true. Specifically, I was concerned that two individuals who \nhad tried to get a clerkship with Justice Kennedy believed very \nstrongly that they had been subjected to a litmus test for being too \nliberal and had been rejected out of hand as a result. Both individuals \nhad been quoted in the press, and while these accusations were by no \nmeans dispositive in my decisionmaking, they were yet another example \nof comments made by those who know Mr. Estrada, or worked with him, \nthat he is simply too ideological for the bench.\n  When I first heard about these comments, I was concerned but also \nwary. Because the quotes we were given came from anonymous sources in a \nnews article, I wanted to be sure they were accurate.\n  But having done a bit more research on the subject, I am confident \nthese two individuals truly believe that a litmus test was applied to \nthem.\n  Without countervailing evidence, such as a written record or \nsubstantive responses to committee questioning, it is difficult to \nassuage the concerns raised by these applicants and others.\n  Now that I have outlined some of my concerns about Miguel Estrada, I \nwant to take a few moments to talk about the general state of the \nnominations process and what I see as a real lack of consultation \nbetween the White House and many Members of the Senate in making these \nnominations. It is this lack of consultation in the nominations process \nthat has led, I think, many in the minority party to become \nincreasingly concerned about individual nominees, about scheduling, and \nwhether or not there will be any real advice and consent for the \nSenate.\n  Early on in the Bush Presidency, I sat down with representatives from \nthe White House and we worked out together a system for nominating \ndistrict court judges in California that works, and works well. \nEssentially, we set up one nominating committee for each district in \nCalifornia. Each committee is made up of six members, three chosen by \nthe White House and one chosen by me, one chosen by Senator Boxer, and \nthen Senator Boxer and I choose the third representative together. In \nother words, each committee is made up of three Democrats and three \nRepublicans, an even number. No name can be forwarded to the President \nfor nomination unless a majority of the commission members agree. So \nthis means that at least one member of each party must consent to every \nname forwarded to the President for consideration. For each vacancy, \nthe commission submits several names, so the President may still choose \nthe\n\n[[Page S2090]]\n\nparticular nominee. But we have agreed that no individual will be \nnominated without first receiving at least a majority vote.\n  This has really worked, Mr. President, and worked well. It is \nproducing well-qualified, nonideological judges for California district \ncourts. These commissions have already worked to produce eight highly \nqualified, noncontroversial nominees. Five of those have already been \nconfirmed, one more was voted out of committee, and two more were only \nrecently received by the Senate.\n  Here is the point: The five judges now confirmed spent an average of \nonly 93 days--about 3 months--from the day they were nominated to the \nday they were confirmed. The process is working.\n  It was my hope when we established this process that the White House \nwould move quickly to establish similar agreements with other States. \nAfter all, the Constitution gives the Senate the responsibility of \nadvising the President on his or her nominees, and consenting or \ndeclining to consent to those nominations. It is thus our duty to work \nwith each President in helping to select and to judge the \nqualifications of nominees to the Federal bench.\n  This advise and consent role should not be taken lightly. Helping to \nshape the Federal judiciary may well be one of the most important \nthings any Senator will do during his or her term. The quality and \nnature of the nominees we pass through the Senate will alter the makeup \nof the courts for years to come, often long after we have retired from \nthis body.\n  Too many of my colleagues have found themselves with no ability to \nconsult on nominees to the district court, or even the circuit court. \nIndeed, in some instances the White House has completely disregarded \nthe advice or even nominated the candidate most opposed by a home State \nSenator. In other instances, vacancies kept open by the deliberate \ninaction of the Republican-controlled Senate of recent years may now be \nfilled en masse, with far more ideological nominees, artificially \nskewing these courts to the right. This is the environment surrounding \nthe nomination of Miguel Estrada. We have before us a nominee who was \ncontroversial from the very start.\n  When the Judiciary Committee tried to find out more about him, we \nwere stymied at every turn: No written record, no work product, and \nunresponsive answers to our questions at the hearing.\n  The Constitution established a system of checks and balances, one \nthat has served this Nation well for more than two centuries. The \nPresident is the Commander in Chief, but the Congress declares war and \nfunds the military. The President signs treaties, the Senate ratifies \nthem. The President makes nominations, but we advise him in that role \nand consent to the nominees themselves.\n  Without any prior advice role, it sometimes becomes necessary for the \nconsent process to become more confrontational, as it has recently. But \nit is my hope that in coming months we will come together as a Senate--\nnot as Democrats or Republicans, but one body--to work through the \nnomination issues that have so torn us apart over the last decade.\n  It is also my hope that this President will work with all Senators, \nas he has worked with me, to establish a framework for producing \nmoderate, qualified judges for every district court in the Nation. It \nis my hope that we can make these debates about substance and \nqualifications, not about ideology or partnership.\n  I cannot at this time support Miguel Estrada for the D.C. Circuit \ncourt. As I pointed out earlier, I might very well support him for a \ndistrict court position. He is 41. This is a 40- or 50-year position.\n  This is a debate that will not end today or tomorrow or in the coming \nmonths, unless we can all calm the rhetoric, sit down, and discuss how \nwe can move through the process with greater consultation, greater \nfairness, and a greater respect for the constitutional role of the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia for an excellent presentation to the Senate outlining the \nhistoric responsibilities that the executive and the Senate have in \nmeeting all of our responsibilities to ensure we have qualified members \non the courts of this country. She gave an excellent analysis of both \nthe past activities of the court and rebutting a number of the \nmisrepresentations that have been made about those who have raised \nserious questions about this nominee.\n  I thought the Senator from California summarized in an important way \nthe compelling reasons why many of us have reservations about this \nnominee. I thank her very much for the statement, and I hope our \ncolleagues will pay close attention to it.\n  One of the most important functions of the Senate is its \nconstitutionally mandated advise-and-consent role in the selection of \njudges. This role is meant to ensure the appointees to the Federal \ncourts are independent and fair judges, who hear all cases with an open \nmind, independent of the political process but also of personal \nideology.\n  We have all asked at one time or another what is the criteria we use \nin the advise-and-consent role. I have over time supported the idea \nthat, obviously, enormous deference is given at the time a President is \nelected to the fact that he or she ought to be able to have the \nadvisers of their choice. That is a period of time, before the \nPresident's term expires, when there ought to be at least a willingness \nto give any benefit of the doubt to those nominees.\n  Then we have independent agencies which go on for a period of time \nbeyond the time of a given President, and we advise and consent on \nthose nominees. And then we have the Federal courts. If we make a \nmistake in terms of a particular judge, we have the circuit courts to \nwhich matters can be appealed, and then ultimately the Supreme Court. \nOur highest value is focused on the Supreme Court--lifetime \nappointments, and under the distribution of powers defined in the \nConstitution, a shared power with the President appointing and the \nSenate giving its advice and consent. It is a shared power.\n  Many assume the Senate of the United States should rubberstamp a \nnominee; if we cannot find something wrong with a nominee, that we \nshould give our stamped approval. That clearly is in conflict with the \nviews of our Founding Fathers and in conflict with the great traditions \nof this institution.\n  We have a very high standard when it comes to this particular court \nbecause, although it is not the Supreme Court, it is a lesser court, of \nthe very special responsibilities and unique responsibilities it has. \nTherefore, we have a duty to find out the views and commitments of a \nnominee to the core values of the Constitution, not expecting that a \nnominee is going to answer a question about a particular case or a \nparticular outcome, but talk about their views, their developed views, \ntheir mature views about constitutional values, issues on civil rights, \nissues on the first amendment, on the role of the Congress in terms of \nour responsibilities in meeting the general welfare clause, the \nseparation of church and State, the issues of privacy and other civil \nrights issues--all of these matters which are of enormous importance \nand consequence to the people of this country in which we have seen a \ngeneration struggle and individuals in a number of instances give their \nlives to these causes.\n  We have a very special and important responsibility to make sure \nthose words that are above the Justice Department, ``Equal Justice \nUnder Law,'' are going to be equal justice under law for every person \nin this country.\n\n  There is, I believe, a responsibility, not just to any member of the \nJudiciary Committee, not just to the Judiciary Committee, but to the \nAmerican people, that a nominee has because we act as their agents in \nterms of our votes, and there is a responsibility to the American \npeople that a nominee will at least talk about the Constitution and \ntalk about these fundamental values and what the Constitution means. \nThat has been the time-honored tradition of a nominee, going back for \npretty much the history of this country.\n  In this instance, there is such a complete contrast. There is an \nindividual who will not give any information, or\n\n[[Page S2091]]\n\nrespond to any of the constitutional issues he was asked, not just by \nany single member, but by all the members, and also a refusal to \nprovide the material which other nominees for other positions have \nprovided in the past. Judge Bork provided material when he was a \nnominee for the Supreme Court; Brad Reynolds, when he was being \nconsidered as head of the Civil Rights Division, and other nominees, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. With Mr. Estrada, no; no, we are not \ngoing to provide that information to the Judiciary Committee. No, we \nare not going to answer questions about views on the Constitution. No, \nwe are not going to provide past work. No, we are not going to provide \nthat. No, we are not going to give that information. And yet we expect \nsomehow the Senate will go ahead and give its approval to a nominee who \ncomes to this nomination.\n  I congratulate Mr. Estrada. He comes to this position on the basis of \nvery humble roots and a life of personal achievement. Does that \nguarantee one will hold a position on the district court because one \nhas had that experience? Should that entitle someone? Should one think \nof serving on the courts as an entitlement or as a reward? Clearly not. \nThere are too many issues involving the everyday life experience of \nAmerican citizens that are being decided by that court and that will \naffect the lives of individuals in this country. Therefore, this is too \nimportant a position for anyone, as talented as they are and as unique \nas their past experience, to expect they are just going to be in a \nprivileged position and not have to be responsive to the inquiries of \nthe members of the committee.\n  That is the dilemma in which we find ourselves with this particular \nnominee. The Senator from California reviewed the facts, and I wish to \naddress them as well this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, we also heard important testimony about the judgment, \ntemperament, and the commitment to statutory projections and core \nconstitutional values that are necessary to serve as a Federal judge, \nespecially on a court as important as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDC Circuit. Then we have had the assault and attack on those who \nquestion his core commitment to the values of the Constitution, but the \nfact is, we do not know because he refused to answer the most basic \nquestions.\n  We heard the pillorying by many who expressed opinions in opposition \nto Mr. Estrada, and their characters were assaulted as well, I think \nunfairly and unjustly. We would not have to resort to the opinions of \nothers if Mr. Estrada had been willing to respond to the questions.\n  Mr. Estrada has refused to answer the basic questions posed to him in \nthe confirmation process. As I mentioned, the White House refused to \nrelease the materials necessary for a full review of his \nqualifications.\n  With this troubling and inadequate record, I do not believe Mr. \nEstrada should be confirmed to this important court, the second most \npowerful court in the Nation.\n  The Federal courts have the power to make far-reaching decisions \naffecting lives of people and the life of our Nation. We have the \nresponsibility to ensure that the people who serve on the courts will \nprotect important constitutional and statutory rights. I do not believe \nMr. Estrada is such a person.\n  Although he is a distinguished legal advocate, his commitment to core \nconstitutional values is far from clear. Mr. Estrada prevented us from \nlearning much at all about his legal and constitutional philosophy, and \nthroughout this process he has evaded even the most basic questions \nconcerning how he would serve as a judge. In addition, Mr. Estrada and \nthe administration refused to produce the documents from Mr. Estrada's \ntime in government practice that might have helped us answer questions. \nSo these are very serious problems, and they would require this body to \nreject any nominee who came before it.\n  Unfortunately, some of our Republican colleagues have decided it is \nin their best interest to claim that we are opposing Mr. Estrada \nbecause he is Latino. This irresponsible accusation is absurd. It is \nbelied by the strong history of those who are members of our party who \nhave fought for opening the doors for all minorities in America, \nincluding Latinos. The Republican accusation is also dangerous and \ndestructive. It has even been said that if we did not confirm Mr. \nEstrada to the DC Circuit, we would shut the door on the American dream \nof Hispanic Americans everywhere. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. As they say in sports, let's look at the record. In fact, \nPresident Clinton nominated 11 Latinos to the Nation's most powerful \ncourts. He nominated 21 Latinos to the district courts. For these \nnominees, achieving the American dream meant being sensitive to the \ncore values that make this country strong, that are embodied in the \nwords at the entrance to the Supreme Court: ``Equal justice under \nlaw.''\n  Nonetheless, Republicans unfairly blocked many of these nominees. Not \nonly these nominees, but I remember Bill Lann Lee who was an Asian \nAmerican, who was denied the opportunity to have a vote. He was \nabsolutely an extraordinary and distinguished nominee whose life \nexperience in many respects was similar, if not more compelling, in \nterms of his own personal success. He came from extraordinarily humble \nbeginnings. He did not speak the language. He worked his way through \nschool, was able to get a scholarship, I believe to Yale University. He \nhad an absolutely distinguished record, went on as a lawyer to help \nknock down the walls of discrimination. He was selected as the head of \nthe Civil Rights Division. He had just about every defendant against \nwhom he had tried a case over the period of his career--a young man \ncame before the committee and said: Look, we differed with Bill Lann \nLee on the issues of the facts, but we want to tell this committee that \nthis was an extraordinary lawyer who did a lawyer's job in \nunderstanding the law when arguing his case. We had nothing but the \nhighest regard and respect for his presentation, his ability, and the \nway he conducted himself. Senators testified to this before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  But was Bill Lann Lee able to get a vote in the Judiciary Committee? \nNo, absolutely not. Do you think he was able to get consideration on \nthe floor of the Senate? No, he was denied that. With all of the hopes \nand dreams there were for hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of \nAsian Americans and the hopes and dreams of all of his family and \nrelatives, he was denied confirmation and turned back. We will let the \nother side give the explanations for that. But this outstanding \nnominee, who eventually had a temporary appointment to the Justice \nDepartment and did an extraordinary job, was denied the opportunity to \nbe voted on.\n  The Bush White House, by contrast, until a short time ago, has \nnominated only one Latino to the court of appeals, and that is Mr. \nEstrada.\n  One of the most important functions of the Senate is constitutional \nadvice and consent. We cannot perform this function if we are not \nallowed access to the nominee's record, and by refusing to provide the \nSenate with the most important memoranda produced by Mr. Estrada when \nhe was in the Solicitor's Office, the administration is trying to \nprevent us from performing our constitutional duty.\n  The administration's refusal to provide these memoranda is not based \nin law or precedent. Past administrations have disclosed the legal \nmemos in connection with both judicial and executive nominations. We \nhave repeatedly made the administration aware of the clear precedence \non the disclosure of confidential internal documents relating to the \nnominations of several judges, including Robert Bork to become \nAssociate Justice on the Supreme Court, Brad Reynolds as Assistant \nAttorney General, Benjamin Civiletti to become Attorney General, \nStephen Trott to become a judge on the Ninth Circuit, Justice Rehnquist \nto become Chief Justice.\n  In some of those instances, they made those memoranda available only \nto the members of the committee, and then they asked us for the \nmemoranda back. Agreements were worked out with the members of the \nJudiciary Committee. But not with regard to this nominee. We were \neffectively denied all of this. Justice Rehnquist, Bradford Reynolds, \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Benjamin Civiletti to \nbecome Attorney General, Robert Bork to become an Associate Justice of \nthe Supreme Court--we were able to get\n\n[[Page S2092]]\n\nthose memoranda. But not from Mr. Estrada. They told us: You cannot \nhave the memoranda. And we have a nominee who will not answer any \nquestions on this. Then Members are asked why they are concerned about \nthis process.\n  Indeed, the administration has itself disclosed the past memoranda \nfor purposes of evaluating its nominees. The Bush White House disclosed \nlegal memoranda written by an attorney in the White House Counsel's \nOffice in connection with the nomination of Jeffrey Holmstead for the \nposition of assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection \nAgency. They are prepared to give all of the memoranda to the \nappropriate committees for Jeffrey Holmstead, when he was in the White \nHouse Counsel's Office in connection with a position as assistant \nadministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, but they will not \ngive it to the Senate for a nominee for the DC Circuit in our Nation's \nCapital. Why is that? Why do they give it on the one hand and refuse to \ngive it on the other? What is the justification that they do not have \nto do it?\n  Then they list a number of prominent figures, many of them Democrats, \nwho say they are under no obligation to do it. But clearly, in the \npast, under Republicans and Democrats, when there has been an interest \nin trying to reach accommodation and to have an understanding about the \nnominees, there has been a willingness to do it. But, no, they are not \ngoing to do it.\n  We can only assume that the Administration's inconsistent position \nmeans that it has something to hide in Mr. Estrada's memoranda.\n  Given the administration's recalcitrance about providing the Estrada \nmemoranda, the Senate is left with very little to review to assure \nourselves that Mr. Estrada has the commitment to constitutional and \nstatutory protections necessary to serve on the DC Circuit. What little \nwe do know is very troubling because Mr. Estrada's direct supervisor in \nthe office has raised questions about whether Mr. Estrada had the \nnecessary temperament to sit on the DC Circuit.\n  As my friend and colleague from California has pointed out, Mr. \nBender has stated that those statements he made were entirely true and \nhe still stands by them. We will hear a brutal assault on Mr. Bender \nand his character. We have heard it previously in the Judiciary \nCommittee, and we have heard it here. He is an outstanding individual, \na former clerk to Justice Frankfurter. He argued before the Supreme \nCourt, had an extraordinary and distinguished record, but we will hear \nhim assaulted because he has questioned the temperament of Mr. Estrada.\n  These serious allegations require some response on the merits and \nsome evidence to the contrary. Instead, some of my colleagues in the \nSenate have responded by attacking Mr. Bender.\n  Mr. Bender is not alone in the assessment of Mr. Estrada. It has been \nreported that some of Mr. Estrada's colleagues have said he is not \nopen-minded and he ``does not listen to other people.''\n  After an in-depth meeting with Mr. Estrada, a member of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus said he appeared to have a short fuse and \ndid not have the judicial temperament necessary to be a judge. \nAccording to the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund, with whom Mr. Estrada \nmet, he is not even-tempered and he became angry during their meetings \nwith him and even threatened the group with legal action because they \nraised concerns about his record.\n  Now, we have that information, but we are denied any information on \nthe other side. Anyone who has questioned Mr. Estrada finds they are \nquestioned themselves. But we are denied the information that may \nreflect an entirely different temperament.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues have said Democrats who oppose Mr. \nEstrada's nomination are motivated by his ethnic background, but these \nreports that raise serious concern about Mr. Estrada come from some of \nthe most important Latino organizations in the country. These groups \ncorrectly point out that Mr. Estrada had not taken any steps to reflect \nor serve his community and has never provided any pro bono legal \nexpertise, supported or joined or participated in events of any \norganization dedicated to serving or advancing the Latino community, \nnever made any efforts to open the doors of opportunity for Latino law \nstudents or junior lawyers. Mr. Estrada appears to be committed neither \nto his community nor to an open, fair, and impartial judicial process.\n  Mr. Estrada has attempted in the past to limit the first amendment \nrights of minorities. I have inquired about his standing in this \nparticular case. He sits on the board of the Center for Community \nInterest which advocates for police tactics that have often led to \nharassment and racial profiling, and his efforts reflect a lack of \nconcern for important American ideals.\n  In a case heard by the Supreme Court, Chicago v. Morales, he \nrepresented the U.S. Conference of Mayors in an amicus brief defending \na tenant-loitering ordinance in Chicago. The Center for Community \nInterest also submitted a brief in support of the ordinance. The \nChicago antiloitering ordinance applied to any group of two or more \nindividuals who gather, with no apparent purpose, in any public place, \nincluding streets, parks, restaurants, or any other location open to \nthe public, and mandated if a police officer reasonably believed any of \nthe individuals to be a gang member, he could order all of the \nindividuals, including those not suspected of gang membership, to \ndisperse and remove themselves from the area. The Supreme Court found \nthe ordinance violated the due process clause of the 14th amendment. It \nheld the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague because it did not \nprovide adequate notice of the prescribed conduct and did not set \nminimum guidelines for law enforcement.\n  At his hearing, Mr. Estrada suggested that minority lawmakers \nsupported the antiloitering ordinance. This is false. In fact, the \nordinance was initiated by residents in a predominantly white \nneighborhood, and drawn up by several white aldermen. The majority of \nthe African American aldermen on the Chicago City Council voted against \nit. Several aldermen compared it to an apartheid-era law in South \nAfrica. When the case came before the Supreme Court, many of the civil \nrights minority groups joined amicus briefs against the ordinance, \nincluding the National Council of La Raza, Mexican American Legal \nDefense, and the NAACP.\n  Before I come back to that issue, I take a moment to discuss the \nopposition to Mr. Estrada's nomination that has been voiced by some of \nthese groups. Let me finish with the legal defense. Now we had the \nholding by the Supreme Court in finding that the Chicago ordinance was \nunconstitutional. The Supreme Court said the broad antiloitering \nordinance in the Chicago-Morales case was unconstitutional. Mr. Estrada \ndevoted man-hours in defending the City of Annapolis following this \nagainst the challenges to the Constitution of a similar antiloitering \nordinance. When the NAACP challenged the ordinance, he would take the \ncity's case all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary, free of \ncharge. Mr. Estrada lost that case, too, however, after a district \ncourt struck down the law as unconstitutional.\n\n  Here he went all the way to the Supreme Court on the antiloitering. \nThe Supreme Court made a finding, and then he takes the time to go \nright back to another antiloitering ordinance and insists on taking all \nof that and it was struck down in the district. It is difficult to \nunderstand on an issue such as that why he would have been so involved \nin that kind of continued activity when it reaches issues involving the \nfirst amendment.\n  I am deeply concerned by Mr. Estrada's intense focus on enforcing an \nantiloitering ordinance. As MALDEF noted, many of the individuals who \nare targeted under such ordinances are minorities. Often Latino urban \nyouth are harassed by police enforcing such ordinances, and day \nlaborers--most often newly arrived immigrants--congregating on \nparticular streets waiting to be offered a manual labor job are often \ntargeted. Mr. Estrada does not seem to appreciate this effect on the \nminority population and did not let it affect his defense of those \nstatutes.\n  Other statements by Mr. Estrada raise additional concern about his \ncommitment to civil rights, expressing skepticism about affirmative \naction. The DC Circuit has become closely divided on affirmative action \nand public employment programs, and a narrow\n\n[[Page S2093]]\n\nmajority of the DC Circuit held the Federal Government cannot require \nbroadcasters to conduct targeted outreach to minorities and women even \nfor the purpose of increasing the pool of qualified applicants.\n  According to MALDEF, in meetings where Mr. Estrada has answered \nquestions, he has made statements about affirmative action, calling \ninto question whether he would find a compelling interest to justify \nsuch programs. Mr. Estrada indicated he has not raised the issue of \ndiversity in places where he has worked and he would not be \nparticularly vigilant about giving opportunities to Hispanic clerks. \nMr. Estrada was asked about the possible reason for the lack of \nminority law clerks by a reporter for USA Today. According to the \narticle, Mr. Estrada dismissed statistics showing little representation \nof minorities and indicated if there was some reason for \nunderrepresentation, it would be something to look into, but I don't \nhave any reason to see it as other than a trend in society. This is \ncontrasted with quotes of others saying there are a variety of reasons \nfor the lack of minority clerks.\n  All of these aspects of Mr. Estrada's prior work indicate he would \nnot bring a fair and open mind and sensible judicial temperament and \ncommitment to civil rights and equal opportunity to the bench.\n  During the course of the hearing on Mr. Estrada, he did little to \nallay our concerns about his record. In fact, many concerns were \nactually intensified by Mr. Estrada's unwillingness to respond to even \nthe most basic and innocuous questions about his views. For instance, \nMr. Estrada refused to name a single Supreme Court case of which he was \ncritical.\n  In addition, Chairman Leahy asked Mr. Estrada whether an employer or \nschool could take race or ethnicity into consideration in hiring \nadmissions and Mr. Estrada refused to give any opinion on the matter. \nChairman Leahy asked Mr. Estrada what he thought about the Supreme \nCourt decision in Romer v. Evans, a decision he was purported to \ncriticize, and he refused to agree whether he agreed with the decision, \nstating because he did not hear the arguments he could not have an \nopinion. At the same time, Mr. Estrada gave contradictory answers in \nresponse to a series of questions about whether he had an applied \nideological litmus test to clerks.\n  I take a moment or two again to underline the importance of the DC \nCircuit Court. Mr. Estrada's nomination is particularly troubling, \ngiven the importance of the DC Circuit to issues of concerns for a \nbroad range of Americans seeking to enforce their basic rights. The DC \nCircuit is widely regarded as the second most important court in the \nUnited States, behind only the Supreme Court. With a unique and \nprominent role among the Federal Courts of Appeal, particularly in the \narea of administrative law, it has exclusive jurisdiction over many \nworkplace, environmental, civil rights, and consumer protection \nstatutes. Because the Supreme Court grants reviews of only a small \nnumber of lower court decisions, most administrative law is established \nby the DC Circuit. Despite the importance of the DC Circuit to a broad \narray of Americans, some Republicans have worked to undo any balance on \nthe court. During the Clinton administration, the Senate, controlled by \nRepublicans, refused to approve two of President Clinton's nominees to \nthe DC Circuit, Elena Kagan and Allan Snyder.\n\n  Last fall's hearing for Mr. Estrada was the first hearing for a \nnominee to the DC Circuit in 5 years. No questions were raised about \nthe qualifications of either Ms. Kagan or Mr. Snyder. Both had stellar \nqualifications. Nevertheless, hearings for these nominations were \ndelayed. After they finally received hearings, they were refused a vote \nin the committee or on the floor. Many Republicans argued that the DC \nCircuit did not need any more judges. Yet shortly after President Bush \nwas elected, two judges were nominated for the court.\n  I see my good friend and colleague from New York here, Senator \nSchumer. I know others want to speak about this important issue.\n  The DC Circuit Court has a major influence on decisions involving the \nNational Labor Relations Board. The National Labor Relations Board is \nthe arbiter of disputes between workers and employers. We have a \nprocess where that board is to work and work effectively. There has \nbeen enormous deference given to administrative boards by the circuits \ngenerally, and by the DC Circuit in particular, but that is no longer \nthe case. We are finding increasing numbers of decisions that are made \nby the National Labor Relations Board appealed to the DC Circuit and \neffectively overturned. This has an enormous impact and affect on \nworkers' rights, with all of the implications that workers' rights have \nin terms of health care policy, in terms of wages, and in terms of \npensions.\n  This DC Circuit Court has great influence on whether our occupational \nhealth and safety laws are going to be enforced.\n  We have seen over the period of recent times a reduction in funding \nfor the enforcement of these laws. That has been true. But, \nnonetheless, some of these find their way on up to the DC Circuit \nCourt. Having someone there who is going to understand the law, \nunderstand the importance of that legislation, and who can interpret \nthat legislation in a fair and reasonable way is going to be enormously \nimportant if we want safety in the workplace. The DC Circuit Court is \nthe court that makes those judgments and decisions.\n  We have seen what has happened, even since OSHA has been enacted. We \nhave reduced the number of deaths in the workplace by half.\n  We see a number of other new challenges coming in the workplace in \nmore recent times. Nonetheless, it has been effective legislation.\n  Do you care about wetlands, do you care about clean air, do you care \nabout clean water? The D.C. Circuit Court is the final court that is \ngoing to be making judgments on these environmental issues. We have \nseen where the administration has gone ahead and cut back on the \nprotection of those environmental issues. We have already seen the \nappeals working their way through the courts and they are going to end \nup to the DC Circuit courts. Do you care about clean air? Do you care \nabout clean water? Do you care about the environment? The DC Circuit \nCourt is where these matters are going to be decided.\n  Do we have anything from Mr. Estrada to indicate whether he has any \ninterest at all in protecting the environment? Whether he has any \ninterest at all in workplace justice? Any interest at all in workplace \nsafety? It just goes on from there.\n  The D.C. Circuit will also hear cases on civil liberties. In the \npast, the wiretap issue has come up in the appeals process. Are we \ngoing to be a country that protects its Constitution?\n  The list goes on, issue after issue, defining what this country \nstands for. In terms of protecting rights, the D.C. Court is the court. \nTo stonewall the committee on each and every one of these subjects, as \nthe nominee has done, refusing to talk about any of them, I think \nreflects a contemptuous attitude towards the whole nomination process. \nIn that way, he is not worthy to receive the support of the Senate of \nthe United States.\n  To reiterate, one of the most important functions of the Senate is \nits constitutionally mandated advice and consent role in the selection \nof Federal judges. This role is meant to ensure that appointees to the \nfederal courts are independent and fair judges who hear all cases with \nan open mind, independent not only of the political process but also of \npersonal ideology.\n  Miguel Estrada does not fit this model. He lacks the judgment, \ntemperament, and commitment to statutory protections and core \nconstitutional values that are necessary to serve as a Federal judge, \nespecially on a court as important as the United States Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit. He has refused to answer many basic \nquestions posed to him in the confirmation process, and the White House \nhas refused to release the materials necessary for a full review of his \nqualifications. On this troubling and inadequate record, Mr. Estrada \nshould not be confirmed to this important court, the second most \npowerful court in the nation.\n  We cannot stand by and allow a Republican White House and Republican-\ncontrolled Senate to steamroll the confirmation of controversial \nnominees like Mr. Estrada, who would undermine\n\n[[Page S2094]]\n\nthe important role of the Federal courts as a place for a full, fair, \nand impartial hearing. The Federal courts have the power to make far-\nreaching decisions affecting the lives of our people and the life of \nour Nation. We have the responsibility to ensure that the people who \nserve on these courts will protect important constitutional and \nstatutory rights.\n  Mr. Estrada is not such a person. Although he is a distinguished \nlegal advocate, his commitment to core constitutional values is far \nfrom clear. Mr. Estrada has prevented us from learning much at all \nabout his legal or constitutional philosophy. Throughout this process, \nhe has evaded even the most basic questions concerning how he would \nserve as a judge. In addition, Mr. Estrada and the administration have \nrefused to produce documents from Mr. Estrada's time in government \npractice that might help us answer questions about his record and the \napproach he would bring to judging.\n  These are very serious problems, and they would require this body to \nreject any nominee who came before it. Some of our Republican \ncolleagues, unfortunately, have decided it is in their interest to \nclaim that we are opposing Mr. Estrada because he is Latino. This \nirresponsible accusation is absurd. It is belied by a strong history in \nthe Democratic Party of opening doors for all minorities in America, \nincluding Latinos. The Republicans' accusation is also dangerous and \ndestructive.\n  It has even been said that if we do not confirm Mr. Estrada to the \nD.C. Circuit, we would ``shut the door on the American dream of \nHispanic-Americans everywhere.'' Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. In fact, President Clinton nominated 11 Latinos to the Nation's \npowerful appellate courts. He nominated 21 Latinos to the district \ncourts. For these nominees, achieving the American dream meant being \nsensitive to the core values that make this country strong, and that \nare embodied by the words above the entrance to the Supreme Court: \n``equal justice under law.'' Nonetheless, Republicans unfairly blocked \nmany of these nominees.\n  The Bush White House, by contrast, has, until last week, nominated \nonly one Latino to the courts of appeals: Mr. Estrada.\n  The White House and some Senate Republicans have complained that \nSenate Democrats have not supported Mr. Estrada because he is Latino. \nWe should not lightly accuse other Members of this body of such \nprejudice, but make no mistake: That is exactly what some Republicans \nare accusing Democrats of. The record belies this accusation.\n  Until last week, President Bush had nominated 130 people to the \nFederal courts. Out of those 130 nominees, there were only 8 Latinos. \nSix of these Latino nominees were confirmed last session when Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate. The record is clear that Senate Democrats are \neager to see the diversity of the Federal bench increased by confirming \nLatino nominees, even when those nominees come from a Republican White \nHouse.\n  Senate Democrats have eagerly confirmed Latino nominees, even when \nthose Latino nominees are relatively conservative. So when some Members \nof the Senate say that Democrats have a different standard for Latino \nnominees, that accusation is unfounded.\n  Nonetheless, these accusations have continued. It is a dangerous and \nirresponsible attempt to play politics with important issues of race, \nand frankly it is beneath the dignity of this body. For example, \nSenator Lott has said quite bluntly that Democrats ``don't want Miguel \nEstrada because he's Hispanic.''\n  Senator Hatch has said that Democrats are creating a glass ceiling \nfor Latinos, so that ``if they do not think a certain liberal way . . . \nthen they are not good enough.''\n  Senator Domenici has said that he is perilously close to saving our \nopposition to Miguel Estrada's nomination is because of his race. \nSenator Domenici is right about one thing, these statements are \nperilous.\n  They are also just plain wrong. During the last Democratic \nadministration, 23 Latino nominees were confirmed to the Federal \ncourt--more than in any prior administration, Republican or Democrat.\n  It has been Senate Republicans who have unfairly blocked the \nconfirmation of Latino nominees. The Republican-controlled Senate \nrefused to confirm eight Latino nominees. No one accused Republicans of \nprejudice. Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno, both nominated to the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals from Texas, were not even afforded hearings by \nthe Republicans. Still, no one cried prejudice.\n  Mr. Rangel and Mr. Moreno each waited more than a year in the Senate. \nWhen Senate Republicans refused to give these nominees a hearing, their \nnominations were returned to the White House. President Clinton \nrenominated Enrique Moreno, but President Bush withdrew his nomination. \nIn his place, President Bush nominated Judge Pickering and Justice \nOwen, two divisive and controversial nominees with very troubling \nrecords on issues such as civil rights.\n  Just as disturbing, Senate Republicans expressed the notion that Mr. \nMoreno may not have been qualified for the position. Mr. Moreno, like \nMr. Estrada, was a Harvard-educated lawyer who was adjudged well-\nqualified by the American Bar Association. Mr. Moreno was eminently \nqualified for the position, but Senate Republicans disparaged him \nwithout even affording him a hearing. Still, we did not say this was \nthe result of bigotry.\n  Other Hispanic-Americans who were never confirmed by the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate include Christine Arguello, nominated to the Tenth \nCircuit Court of Appeals from Colorado; Ricardo Morado, nominated to \nthe District Court in Texas; and Anabelle Rodriguez, nominated twice to \nthe District Court in Puerto Rico. None of these qualified individuals \nwere confirmed by the Republicans.\n  Mr. Estrada, on the other hand, received a hearing from the \nDemocratic-controlled Senate. We wanted to look into his record and see \nwhat kind of judge he would be. But we were blocked at every turn. The \nBush administration refused to let us look at some of Mr. Estrada's \nmost important work as a Deputy Solicitor General in the Justice \nDepartment. Mr. Estrada himself has refused to answer questions about \nhis views on the law and the courts.\n  We have serious concerns about Mr. Estrada that have nothing to do \nwith his ethnic background. We have been prevented from learning \nanything about him. We certainly have not been allowed to learn enough \nto justify support for this nomination.\n  Our Republican colleagues also claim that Mr. Estrada ``has \ntremendous support among Hispanic people.'' In fact, major Latino \norganizations have raised strong concerns about Mr. Estrada. The \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus has opposed his nomination. Other Latino \norganizations that have opposed or raised concerns about Mr. Estrada \ninclude: the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, the Puerto Rican \nLegal Defense Fund, the National Association of Latino Elected and \nAppointed Officials, the National Council of La Raza, the California La \nRaza Lawyers, the Southwest Voter Registration Project and the Illinois \nPuerto Rican Bar Association.\n\n  These groups represent a wide array of views and the broad diversity \nof the Latino community. Listen to what they say about him, and why \nthey oppose him. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has said:\n\n       The appointment of a Latino to reflect diversity is \n     rendered meaningless unless the nominee can demonstrate an \n     understanding of the historical role courts have played in \n     the lives of minorities in extending equal protections and \n     rights; has some involvement in the Latino community that \n     provides insight into the values and mores of the Latino \n     culture in order to understand the unique legal challenges \n     facing Latinos; and recognizes both the role model \n     responsibilities he or she assumes as well as having an \n     appreciation for protecting and promoting the legal rights of \n     minorities who historically have been the victims of \n     discrimination.\n       Based on the totality of the nominee's available record and \n     our meeting with him, Mr. Estrada fails to meet the CHCs \n     criteria for endorsing a nominee.\n       In our opinion, his lack of judicial experience coupled \n     with a failure to recognize or display an interest in the \n     needs of the Hispanic community do not support an appointment \n     to the federal judiciary.\n\n  There is no mention of the fact that Mr. Estrada is conservative. The \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus did not come out against the other Latino \nnominees put forward by the Bush administration. Their opposition is \ngrounded in the fact that Mr. Estrada\n\n[[Page S2095]]\n\nhimself does not reflect the views of the Latino community, and that he \nhas shown to be unable or unwilling to set aside his conservative \nideology in his legal analysis.\n  The Mexican American Legal Defense Fund issued a statement opposing \nMr. Estrada last Monday, stating:\n\n       The most difficult situation for any Latino organization is \n     when a President nominates a Latino who does not reflect, \n     resonate or associate with the Latino community, and who \n     comes with a predisposition to view claims of racial \n     discrimination and unfair treatment with suspicion and doubt \n     instead of with an open mind. Unfortunately, the only Latino \n     who President Bush has nominated in two years to any federal \n     circuit court in the county is such a person. President Bush \n     nominated Mr. Estrada to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       After a thorough examination of his record, his \n     confirmation hearing testimony, and his written answers to \n     the U.S. Senate, we announce today our formal opposition to \n     his nomination.\n\n  Is this the racism that Senator Domenici is perilously close to \nclaiming? No. These groups and others raise serious concerns about Mr. \nEstrada's ability or willingness to be sensitive to the needs Latino \nand other minority communities.\n  Other groups have echoed these concerns. The Puerto Rican Legal \nDefense Fund also oppose his nomination. They have stated:\n\n       We strongly believe that Mr. Estrada's nomination should be \n     opposed and rejected. Potential nominees who aspire to such \n     important positions as circuit judges should be better \n     qualified and possess the unquestioned ability to be fair, \n     open-minded and committed to equal justice for all Americans. \n     They should be connected to the real-world concerns of the \n     people who will be governed by their decisions. They should \n     also be even-tempered. In our view, Mr. Estrada clearly does \n     not possess the qualities necessary to be placed in such an \n     important position of trust--for a lifetime--interpreting and \n     guarding the rights of ordinary Americans.\n\n  These groups and others like them raise serious concerns about this \nnominee. They certainly are not opposed to Mr. Estrada because of his \nrace, and neither are the Senate Democrats who feel that this nominee \nlacks the judgment and temperament to serve on the Court of Appeals for \nthe D.C. Circuit.\n  One of the most important functions of the Senate is our \nconstitutional advice and consent role. We cannot perform this \nfunction, however, when we are not allowed access to a nominee's \nrecord. By refusing to provide the Senate with the important memoranda \nproduced by Mr. Estrada when he was in the Solicitor General's office, \nthe administration is trying to prevent us from performing our \nconstitutional duty.\n  The administration's refusal to provide these memoranda is not based \nin law or precedent. Past administrations have disclosed legal memos in \nconnection with both judicial and executive nominations, including the \nnominations of justice Rehnquist to be Chief Justice of the United \nStates, and of Stephen Trott to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit.\n  Indeed, this administration has itself disclosed past memoranda for \npurposes of evaluating its nominees, including the nomination of \nJeffrey Holmstead for the position of Assistant Administrator at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. We can only assume that \nthe administration's inconsistent position means that it has some thing \nto hide in Mr. Estrada's memoranda.\n\n  Given the administration's recalcitrance about providing Mr. Estada's \nmemoranda, the Senate is left with very little to review to assure \nourselves that Mr. Estrada has the commitment to constitutional and \nstatutory protections necessary to serve on the D.C. Circuit. What \nlittle we do know is very troubling. Mr. Estrada's direct supervisor in \nthe Office of the Solicitor General has raised questions about whether \nMr. Estrada has the necessary temperament and moderation to sit on the \nD.C. Circuit.\n  Mr. Bender is not alone in this assessment of Mr. Estrada. It has \nbeen reported that some of Mr. Estrada's colleagues have said that he \nis not open-minded and that he ``does not listen to other people.'' \nAfter an in-depth meeting with Mr. Estrada, a member of the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus stated that Mr. Estrada appeared to have \na ``very short fuse'' and that he did not ``have the judicial \ntemperament that is necessary to be a judge.'' According to the Puerto \nRican Legal Defense Fund, with whom Mr. Estrada met, he is not ``even-\ntempered''--indeed he became angry during their meetings with him, and \nhe even threatened the group with legal action because they had raised \nconcerns about this record.\n  Some of our Republican colleagues have said that Democrats opposed to \nMr. Estrada's nomination are motivated by his ethnic background, but \nthese reports that raise serious concerns about Mr. Estrada come from \nsome of the most important and committed Latino organizations in the \ncountry.\n  These groups correctly point out that Mr. Estrada has not taken any \nsteps to reflect or serve his community. He has never provided any pro \nbono legal expertise to the Latino community. He has never joined, \nsupported, volunteered for or participated in events of any \norganization dedicated to serving and advancing the Latino community. \nAnd he has never made any efforts to open doors of opportunity to \nLatino law students or junior lawyers. Mr. Estrada appears to be \ncommitted neither to his community, nor to an open, fair and impartial \njudicial process.\n  Mr. Estrada has attempted in the past to limit the first amendment \nrights of minorities. He even sits on the board of the Center for \nCommunity Interest, which advocates for police tactics that have often \nled to harassment and racial profiling in minority communities. His \nefforts reflect a startling lack of concern for important American \nideals.\n  In a case heard by the Supreme Court, Chicago versus Morales, Mr. \nEstrada represented the U.S. Conference of Mayors in an amicus brief \ndefending an antiloitering ordinance in Chicago.\n  The Chicago antiloitering ordinance applied to any group of two or \nmore individuals who gather with ``no apparent purpose'' in any public \nplace including streets, parks, restaurants, and any other location \nopen to the public. The ordinance allowed police to disperse any group \nof two or more individuals, so long as they reasonably believed any of \nthe individuals to be a gang member. The Center for Community Interest \nalso submitted a brief in support of the ordinance. Many civil rights \nand minority groups joined amicus briefs against the ordinance, \nincluding the National Council of La Raza, the Mexican American Legal \nDefense Fund, and the NAACP.\n  The Supreme Court found that the ordinance violated the Due Process \nClause of the fourteenth amendment.\n  I want to take a moment here and discuss the opposition to Mr. \nEstrada's nomination that has been voiced by some of the groups that \nargued against the Chicago ordinance. These groups, including the \nNational Council of La Raza and MALDEF have understandably opposed Mr. \nEstrada's nomination. Some of my Republican colleagues would have you \nbelieve that this opposition, which I share, is somehow on account of \nhis ethnic background. It is not. One of our colleagues has said of \nDemocrats that ``if you're a conservative and a minority, we hate \nyou.'' In fact, the Democratic-led Senate has confirmed a number of \nLatino judges who have been nominated by the conservative White House. \nWe confirmed Judge Christina Armijo, Judge Phillip Martinez, Judge Jose \nMartinez, Magistrate Judge Alia Ludlum, Randy Crane, and Judge Jose \nLinares.\n  Mr. Estrada is opposed, not because he is Latino, but because what \nlittle record we have been allowed to review shows that he is not \nconcerned with important constitutional rights, and he is unable to \nseparate his ideology from his legal analysis.\n  Even after the clear rebuke from the Supreme Court about broad \nantiloitering ordinances in Chicago versus Morales, Mr. Estrada devoted \nmany hours to defending the City of Annapolis against challenges to the \nconstitutionality of a similar antiloitering ordinance. When the NAACP \nchallenged the ordinance, Mr. Estrada ``offered to take the city's case \nall the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary, free of charge.'' \nMr. Estrada lost that case too, however, after a Federal District Court \nstruck down the law as unconstitutional.\n  I am deeply concerned by Mr. Estrada's intense focus on enforcing \nantiloitering ordinances. As MALDEF has noted,\n\n     many of the individuals who are targeted under such \n     ordinances are minorities, and\n\n[[Page S2096]]\n\n     often, Latino urban youth are harassed by police enforcing \n     such ordinances. Day laborers who are most often newly \n     arrived immigrants who look for work by congregating on \n     particular public streets to wait to be offered a manual \n     labor job for the day\n\nare often targeted under these ordinances. Mr. Estrada did not seem to \nappreciate this effect on the minority population, and he certainly did \nnot let it affect his defense of those statutes.\n  Other statements by Mr. Estrada raise additional concerns about his \ncommitment to civil rights. For instance, Mr. Estrada has expressed \nskepticism about affirmative action. The D.C. Circuit has recently been \nclosely divided on affirmative action in public employment programs. A \nnarrow majority of the D.C. Circuit recently held that the Federal \nGovernment cannot require broadcasters to conduct targeted outreach to \nminorities and women even for the purpose of increasing the pool of \nqualified applicants.\n  According to MALDEF, in meetings where Mr. Estrada has answered \nquestions since his nomination, he has made statements about \naffirmative action that call into question whether he would find a \ncompelling interest to justify such programs. Mr. Estrada indicated \nthat he had not raised the issue of diversity in places where he has \nworked, and that he would not be particularly vigilant about giving \nopportunities to Hispanic clerks.\n  Mr. Estrada was asked about the possible reasons for the lack of \nminority law clerks by a reporter for USA Today. According to the \narticle, Mr. Estrada ``dismissed the statistics showing little \nrepresentation of minorities'' and stated that ``if there was some \nreason for under-representation, it would be something to look into, \nbut I don't have any reason to think it is anything other than a \nreflection of trends in society.'' His quote was contrasted with \nstatements by others that a variety of reasons are to blame for the \nlack of minority clerks.\n  All of these aspects of Mr. Estrada's prior work indicate that he \nwould not bring a fair and open mind, a sensible judicial temperament, \nand a commitment to civil rights and equal opportunity to the bench.\n  Mr. Estrada's hearing did little to allay our concerns about his \nrecord. In fact, many concerns were actually intensified by Mr. \nEstrada's unwillingness to respond to even the most basic and innocuous \nquestions about his views. For instance, Mr. Estrada refused to name a \nsingle Supreme Court case of which he was critical. In addition, \nChairman Leahy asked Mr. Estrada whether an employer or a school could \ntake race or ethnicity into consideration in a hiring or admissions \ndecisions. Mr. Estrada refused to give any opinion on the matter.\n  Chairman Leahy asked Mr. Estrada what he thought about the Supreme \nCourt decision in Romer versus Evans--a decision he was reported to \nhave criticized. Mr. Estrada again refused to answer whether he agreed \nwith the decision, stating--incredibly--that because he did not hear \nthe arguments in the case, he could not have an opinion.\n  At that same time, Mr. Estrada gave contradictory answers in response \nto a series of questions about whether he had applied an ideological \nlitmus test to clerks. Mr. Estrada, along with other former law clerks \nof Justice Anthony Kennedy, helps the Justice in choosing clerks by \ninterviewing applicants. Two prospective clerks stated in an article in \nthe Nation last September that Mr. Estrada told them that he screened \nclerks for Justice Kennedy in order to prevent Justice Kennedy from \nhiring any liberal clerks, apparently in response to Justice Kennedy's \nvoting to strike down the anti-gay rights statute at issue in Romer \nversus Evans.\n  Senator Schumer asked Mr. Estrada whether he ``had ever told anyone \nthat you do not believe any person should clerk for Justice Kennedy \nbecause that person is too liberal, not conservative enough, because \nthey didn't have the appropriate ideology, politics, or judicial \nphilosophy or because you were concerned that person would influence \nJustice Kennedy to take positions you did not want him taking?'' Mr. \nEstrada answered unequivocally that he had not. After the break for \nlunch, however, Mr. Estrada revised his answer saying:\n\n     there is a set of circumstances in which I would consider \n     somebody's ideology, if you want to call it that, in trying \n     to interview somebody for Justice Kennedy, whether on the \n     left or on the right. And that is to say, if I thought that \n     there was somebody who had views that were so strongly held \n     on any subject, whether, you know, the person thinks there \n     ought not to be the death penalty or whether the person \n     thinks that the income tax ought not to be constitutional or \n     anything, if I think that the person has some extreme view \n     that he will not be willing to set aside.\n\n  Again, when Senator Schumer repeated his earlier question, Mr. \nEstrada hedged, saying that ``I have taken account the ideological \nlearnings of a potential law clerk only when it appears to me--and this \nis something that I don't have a final say on, but I do tell Justice \nKennedy that this person has a strongly held view on a subject that he \nwould not be willing to put aside in the service of the Justice.''\n  Mr. Estrada later conceded that ideology was one of the areas he \n``would explore in trying to find whether the law clerk candidate was \nsuitable for Justice Kennedy.''\n  This response is troubling, because it suggests a lack of candor in \nanswering the first, very clear question put to Mr. Estrada by Senator \nSchumer. Clearly, it would be troubling if Mr. Estrada were subjecting \nclerks to an ideological litmus test in order to ensure that only \nconservative clerks would gain clerkships with Justice Kennedy and to \navoid outcomes that Mr. Estrada found unfavorable.\n  My Republican colleagues, unfortunately, have decided to react to \nthese serious allegations by simply leveling personal attacks against \nthe individuals who were interviewed by Mr. Estrada. Such personal \nattacks seem to be a pattern. Our Republican colleagues have attacked \nPaul Bender, Mr. Estrada's direct supervisor, because they did not like \nwhat he had to say about Mr. Estrada's inability to separate his \nideology from his legal analysis. They have attacked Senate Democrats, \naccusing us of opposing Mr. Estrada on account of his ethnic \nbackground, when the concerns we raised are legitimate concerns about \nhis ideology. And now they attack these law clerk applicants, whose \nvoices have joined a growing chorus of people who question Mr. \nEstrada's ability to keep his conservative ideology from affecting his \nprofessional judgment. I call upon my Republican colleagues to halt \nthese personal attacks, and talk about Mr. Estrada's qualifications to \nserve on the D.C. Circuit.\n\n  Mr. Estrada's nomination is particularly troubling given the \nimportance of the D.C. Circuit to issues of concern to a broad range of \nAmericans seeking to enforce their basic rights. The D.C Circuit is \nwidely regarded as the second most important court in the United \nStates, behind only the Supreme Court. It has a unique and prominent \nrole among the federal courts of appeals, particularly in the area of \nadministrative law. It has exclusive jurisdiction over many workplace, \nenvironmental, civil rights, and consumer protection statutes. Because \nthe Supreme Court grants review of only a small number of lower court \ndecisions, most administrative law is established by the D.C. Circuit.\n  Despite the importance of the D.C. Circuit to a broad array of \nAmericans, some Republicans have worked to undo any balance on the \ncourt. During the Clinton administration, the Senate, controlled by \nRepublicans, refused to approve two of President Clinton's nominees to \nthe D.C. Circuit--Elena Kagan and Allan Snyder. Last fall's hearing for \nMr. Estrada was the first hearing for a nominee to the D.C. Circuit in \n5 years. No questions were raised about the qualifications of either \nMs. Kagan or Mr. Snyder--both had stellar qualifications. Nevertheless, \nhearings for these nominees were delayed, and after they finally \nreceived hearings they were refused a vote in the Committee or on the \nfloor.\n  Many Republicans argued then that the D.C. Circuit did not need any \nmore judges. Yet shortly after President Bush was elected, two judges \nwere nominated to the D.C. Circuit.\n  Given the importance of this circuit, and the Republicans' \nobstruction of President Clinton's nominees, scrutiny of this nominee \nis particularly warranted.\n  Mr. Estrada's record is troubling, and his unwillingness to \nsupplement the record with meaningful answers to\n\n[[Page S2097]]\n\nquestions or the production of the memoranda from his tenure at the \nSolicitor General's office, preclude his confirmation to the important \nD.C. circuit. A life-tenure appointment to a court so important is \nresolving issues involving workers, immigrants, women, and the \nenvironment cannot be given to a nominee about whom we know so little.\n  The Constitution does not contemplate a Senate that acts as a rubber \nstamp. A genuine advise and consent role is essential. If the \nadministration continues to nominate judges who would weaken the core \nvalues of our country and roll back the civil rights laws that have \nmade our country a more inclusive democracy, the Senate should reject \nthem.\n  Everything we know of Miguel Estrada leads to the conclusion that he \nwould be such a judge. His confirmation should be rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUNUNU). The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I listened to my good friend and colleague \nfrom Massachusetts and you would think only Democrats care about clean \nair, clean water, the environment, workers' rights, civil liberties. I \nwant him to know we care about them, too. But we want them to work. We \ndon't want them all left-wing, one-sided approaches.\n  I have had questions in committee from some of my friends on the \nother side asking some of these nominees who have served in judicial \npositions why they have not found, always, for the worker? And actually \nthey have been criticised because they occasionally--or many times--\nfound for the corporation, as if corporations can't be right and that \nworkers are always right.\n  We all know, regarding workers' issues generally, the ones that are \nlegitimate and good are generally always settled. Any attorney who has \ndealt in labor law knows that. The hard cases come to the courts. Many \ntimes the corporations are right. But to hear our colleagues, any case \nthat goes against a worker, the judge has to be biased and bigoted and \nwrong. That just is not true. If we have to have judges just finding \nfor one side, whether they are right or wrong--especially if they are \nwrong--then what kind of justice would that be in America?\n  I have heard this antiloitering case business. By the way, the \nhearing was conducted by the Democrats. They conducted it. They could \nhave made it however long they wanted. They know there are certain \nquestions nobody is going to answer, especially when it comes to issues \nthat possibly could be decided by the court upon which the nominee may \nsit. Any nominees who do answer those kinds of questions, you \nreally have to question whether they have the judicial standing and the \njudicial acumen to be able to be on the courts.\n\n  We have had top authorities from both sides, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, say you should not be discussing in nomination hearings \nissues that might possibly come before the court that you will be \nsitting upon.\n  We have quoted regularly and with good reason--Lloyd Cutler is one of \nthe great lawyers in this country. He is a Democrat. He has been chief \ncounsel for both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. He had no difficulty at \nall working with us up here because we all respect him. But he said, \nregarding judicial nominees, in unequivocal terms ``candidates should \ndecline to reply when efforts are made to find out how they would \ndecide a particular case.''\n  In Lloyd Cutler's opinion, he says: ``What is most important is the \nappointment of judges who are learned in the law.''\n  You are going to have to go a long way to be more learned than Miguel \nEstrada, who, by the way, has the highest rating, by their own \nstandard, of the American Bar Association--unanimously highest rating. \nNormally that would put anybody through this process. But it is not \ngood enough for this Hispanic gentleman who they are afraid, if he gets \non the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, might not rule the way they want \nhim to rule. Because, No. 1, he is a Republican and he may be \nconservative. He may even be critical of Roe v. Wade, the great \nstandard that seems to be the underlying problem with all of these so-\ncalled moderate to conservative nominees. Lloyd Cutler says:\n\n       What is most important is the appointment of judges who are \n     learned in the law, who are conscientious in their work \n     ethic, and who possess what lawyers describe as judicial \n     temperament.\n\n  I have heard some comments about judicial temperament here. The only \nperson who indicated even slightly that Miguel Estrada may have a \ntemperament problem is Paul Bender, who is as far left a law professor \nas you can find. He is a brilliant man. I have no problems there. What \nI have problems with is a man who gives him the highest performance \nratings while he is serving under him at the Solicitor General's \noffice, ratings that just brag about him and then, when the chips are \ndown and he is up for a nomination, undermines him with comments that \nhe is an ideolog. Paul Bender is the only one I know of who has said \nthat--from the Solicitor's office.\n  In fact, let me talk a little bit about temperament. I have heard \nsome of my Democratic colleagues say allegations have been raised about \nMiguel Estrada's temperament. The only person I know who has raised \nquestions about his temperament happens to be Paul Bender. We all know \nhe lacks credibility.\n\n  But let me say a word about relying on anonymous allegations about \nMr. Estrada's temperament. These allegations certainly should not be \nbelieved. These allegations violate not only a basic right to confront \none's witnesses, but also longstanding committee policy that prevents \nthe consideration of anonymous allegations against a nominee. These are \nalso grossly inconsistent with Mr. Estrada's superiors' and colleagues' \nstatements that Mr. Estrada's work in the Solicitor General's Office \nwas superb and that he was a well-respected colleague.\n  Seth Waxman, President Clinton's Solicitor General, a Democrat, but \none we all respect, wrote to us that Estrada is a ``model of \nprofessionalism and competence'' and that he had ``great respect both \nfor Mr. Estrada's intellect and for his integrity.''\n  Mr. Waxman, this Democrat, former Solicitor General under the Clinton \nadministration, continued:\n\n       In no way did I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. \n     Estrada made or the views he propounded were colored in any \n     way by his personal views, or indeed that they reflected \n     anything other than the long-term interests of the United \n     States.\n\n  But Mr. Waxman isn't the only Democrat who testified to Estrada's \nfairness and integrity. A bipartisan group of 14 colleagues from the \nOffice of the Solicitor General also wrote to the committee that \nEstrada ``would be a fair and honest judge who would decide cases in \naccordance with applicable legal principles and precedents.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 19, 2002.\n     Re nomination of Miguel A. Estrada.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SD-224 Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, SD-152 \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Hatch: We are writing to \n     express our support for the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada \n     to be a Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit. We served with Mr. Estrada in \n     the Office of the Solicitor General, and we know him to be a \n     person of exceptional intellect, integrity, and \n     professionalism who would make a superb Circuit Judge.\n       Miguel is a brilliant lawyer, with an extraordinary \n     capacity for articulate and incisive legal analysis and a \n     commanding knowledge of and appreciation for the law. \n     Moreover, he is a person whose conduct is characterized by \n     the utmost integrity and scrupulous fairness, as befits a \n     nominee to the federal bench. In addition, Miguel has a deep \n     and abiding love for his adopted country and the principles \n     for which is stands, and in particular for the rule of law. \n     We hold varying ideological views and affiliates that range \n     across the political spectrum, but we are unanimous in our \n     conviction that Miguel would be a fair and honest judge who \n     would decide cases in accordance with the applicable legal \n     principles and precedents, not on the basis of personal \n     preferences or political viewpoints.\n       We also know Miguel to be a delightful and charming \n     colleague, someone who can engage in open, honest, and \n     respectful discussion of legal issues with others, regardless \n     of their ideological perspectives. Based on our experience as \n     his colleagues in the Solicitor\n\n[[Page S2098]]\n\n     General's office, we are confident that he possesses the \n     temperament, character, and qualities of fairness and respect \n     necessary to be an exemplary judge. In combination, Miguel's \n     exceptional legal ability and talent, his character and \n     integrity, and his deep and varied experience as a public \n     servant and in private practice make him an excellent \n     candidate for service on the federal bench.\n       We hope this information will be of assistance to the \n     Committee in its consideration of Mr. Estrada's nomination. \n     He is superbly qualified to be a Circuit Judge for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit, and we urge your favorable \n     consideration of his nomination.\n           Very truly yours,\n         Thomas G.

Mr. President, the anonymous rumors about his temperament \nare just that--mean-spirited rumors that have been ginned up by liberal \nspecial interest groups that don't want to have a smart minority member \nof the judiciary who does not toe their special-interest line on the \nissues. That is exactly what is behind all of this. The fact is Mr. \nEstrada has overwhelming support among Hispanic organizations and the \nHispanic community, and he should. I am ashamed of some of those who \nhave just played partisan politics because they said Mr. Estrada is not \nHispanic enough. Can you believe that? Some of his own fellow Hispanics \nsay he is not Hispanic enough. He has only been here since he was 14 \nyears of age. My gosh.\n  The oldest Hispanic organization, the League of United Latin American \nCitizens--the oldest one--is behind him. The Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation--the Hispanic lawyers in this country--is behind Estrada; \nthe United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce--very prestigious; the \nHispanic Business Roundtable; the Latino Coalition; and many other \nLatino organizations strongly support Estrada.\n  I was surprised to see this antiloitering case stuff brought up here. \nI was surprised that there is a question raised here about antigang-\nloitering cases Mr. Estrada worked on. Although some have attempted to \nmischaracterize the statutes that were the crux of these cases as \nracially discriminatory, the exact opposite is true. These statutes \nwere enacted to protect the quality of life of low-income minorities \nwhose neighborhoods are too often devastated by drug violence. That is \nwhat was behind it.\n  For example, according to a 1997 report issued by the Clinton Justice \nDepartment, ``Gangs have virtually overtaken certain neighborhoods, \ncontributing to the economic and social decline of these areas and \ncausing fear and lifestyle changes among law-abiding residents.''\n  Another Reno-era Justice Department report concluded that:\n\n       From the small business owner who was literally crippled \n     because he refused to pay protection money to the \n     neighborhood gang to the families who are hostages within \n     their homes living in neighborhoods ruled by predatory drug \n     trafficking gangs, the harmful effect of gang violence is \n     both physically and psychologically debilitating.\n\n  At this hearing, Mr. Estrada told us he got involved in the City of \nChicago v. Morales case at the request of the Democratic leadership of \nChicago.\n  If the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts doesn't like the fact \nhe was representing these people in this case, and decries the fact \nthat this may have involved some first amendment principles--which I am \nsure it did--then he ought to go back to his Democratic friends in the \nCity of Chicago who were concerned about these matters. He tried this \ncase at their request. One of the primary proponents of the Chicago \nordinance was none other than Democratic Mayor Richard Daley.\n  Let me read a few quotes about the ordinance by Mayor Daley, who the \nNew York Times described as the ``law's fiercest advocate.'' If you are \ngoing to criticize Miguel Estrada, criticize Mayor Daley, too, except I \ndon't think either deserves criticism. I think these quotes will dispel \nany notion that the law was somehow intended to hurt rather than help \nminority residents of Chicago. But then, again, in Miguel Estrada's \ncase, why is it they are stooping to such a level as to criticize him \non sincerely-fought cases, and especially this one where he was \nbasically representing the Democrats in Chicago?\n  But here is what Mayor Daly said.\n  I might say that in November--we have a chart--Mayor Daley said:\n\n       I tell you one thing, those drug dealers and gangbangers \n     are terrorists, too.\n\n  In November 2001, Mayor Daley defended his antiloitering law in the \nChicago Sun-Times by making that comment.\n  In October 2000, he observed:\n\n       I don't see too many gangbangers on Lake Shore Drive.\n\n  Everyone knows Lake Shore Drive is an exclusive area of Chicago.\n  Mayor Daley is trying to solve some problems for minorities, and here \nit is being criticized because Miguel Estrada tried the case at their \nrequest.\n  Again, in January 2000, Mayor Daley said:\n\n       [T]hese aren't middle-class communities. These are poor \n     communities. People want a right to survive. It is as simple \n     as that.\n\n  I could go on and on. But, instead, I ask unanimous consent that a \nlist of quotes by Mayor Daley in support of the antigang-loitering \nordinance be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Chicago Democratic Mayor Richard Daley on Anti-Gang Loitering Statutes\n\n       ``I tell you one thing, those drug dealers and gang-bangers \n     are terrorists, too.'' Chicago Sun-Times, Nov. 23, 2001.\n       ``It's the average person on a block; it's a senior \n     citizen; it's an eight year old girl going to a school or \n     trying to get to the bus stop, or someone trying to go to the \n     store. They can't go there. The gangs and drug dealers own \n     the corner. And that's what this is all about.'' All Things \n     Considered, June 10, 1999.\n       ``We are determined to get those gangs off our streets, \n     where they sell dope, terrorize innocent people and attract \n     drive-by shootings. Chicago Daily Herald, March 29, 2000.\n       ``[W]e have to ask ourselves if it is constitutional for \n     gang-bangers and drug dealers to own a corner. . . . \n     [E]veryone knows that they aren't out there cooking hot dogs \n     and studying Sunday-school lessons.'' New York Times, June \n     12, 1999.\n       ``I don't see too many gang-bangers on Lake Shore Drive.'' \n     Chicago Tribune, Oct. 1, 2000.\n       ``[T]hese aren't middle-class communities. These are poor \n     communities. People want a right to survive. It is as simple \n     as that.'' Chicago Tribune, January 12, 2000.\n       ``We held hearings all over the city [to find out] what \n     community leaders wanted. Their message was very clear: Do \n     whatever you have to do to satisfy the court, but get those \n     gang-bangers and dope dealers off our corners.'' Chicago Sun-\n     Times, January 12, 2000.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, one of the things I like about Mayor Daley \nis he is a really good mayor who is trying to do the best job he can, \nand he will do it in a bipartisan way, if he can. And here Miguel \nEstrada is getting criticized for supporting him. These are ordinances \nthat were supported by members of the minority community.\n  One thing I find ironic is the persons who criticize the antigang-\nloitering statutes rarely live in the neighborhoods plagued by chronic \ngang activity. I am not too sure anybody in the Senate is living in \nthose types of areas. But the ones who complain generally have never \nhad to live in those gang areas. These ordinances were enacted in \ndirect response to pleas by communities that have members of gangs.\n  As Mayor Daley explained:\n\n       We held hearings all over the city to find out what \n     community leaders wanted. Their message was very clear: Do \n     whatever you have to do to satisfy the court, but get those \n     gangbangers and dope dealers off our corners.\n\n  Betty Meaks, head of the Southwest Austin Council on Chicago's West \nSide, lived in a neighborhood where gang members routinely sold drugs \non street corners and intimidated passers-by.\n  According to Meaks:\n\n       If we don't use this law as a tool, how are we going to get \n     these guys off the corner? What about the constitutional \n     rights of my neighbors whose kids have to walk by that corner \n     every day on their way to school?\n\n  That is a resident of that gangbanger area and that drug-ridden area \nwho is tired of it.\n\n[[Page S2099]]\n\n  Another Chicago resident, 74-year-old Emmitt Moore, saw his house \nsprayed with bullets during a gang turf war. Referring to the anti-gang \nloitering law, he said:\n\n       The Constitution is supposed to protect my rights, too. \n     What is a more basic right than feeling safe on my property \n     or being able to walk on my street?\n\n  The fact these cases were lost doesn't take away from the fact these \nwere sincere people living in gang-ridden areas and drug-ridden areas \ntrying to do what they could to get these problems solved. And their \nrights were being taken away while we talk about esoteric rights of the \nfirst amendment. Nobody believes in the first amendment more than I do. \nBut I have to tell you there are other rights involved, too, that are \nalso first amendment rights. These poor people living in these areas \nhave some rights, too.\n  The Annapolis ordinance was even a more explicit example of the \nunderprivileged taking the initiative to combat crime in their \nneighborhoods.\n  What gets me is some of these Hispanic groups that are against Miguel \nEstrada say he hasn't done enough in the Hispanic community.\n  Think about these cases where he took them on--yes, in a losing \ncause, but took them on--trying to help these minority residents in \nthese tough communities. There are not too many people who could have \ndone it.\n  Under the Annapolis ordinance, an area could be designated as a \n``drug loitering free zone'' only if a neighborhood association or \nresident first submitted a petition to the city council. Some critics \nhave described Mr. Estrada's Annapolis case because it challenged the \nNAACP's standing to bring the action against the ordinance. But, as Mr. \nEstrada testified at the hearing, the decision to challenge the NAACP's \nstanding was made by other lawyers--not him--before he ever got \ninvolved in the case. Yet they are trying to pin that on him. That is \nthe kind of ``fairness'' we have had in this whole process.\n  I do not think anybody watching this process would say it is very \nfair. And you can start with Paul Bender. Either Paul Bender is right \nwhen he says Miguel is an ideologue--long after the fact--or he was \nright when he was ethically giving his opinion that Miguel Estrada is \none of the best people who ever worked down there at the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. Which is it? I suggest to you that it was the written \nopinions given in the Justice Department, that are backed up by Seth \nWaxman and 14 other coworkers, all of whom say Miguel is great and a \ngood person. It is amazing to me that some of these arguments are made.\n  Although Mr. Estrada's efforts to defend the constitutionality of \nthese statutes were unsuccessful, he may have lost the battle but he \nwon the war, as they say. I am referring to the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Morales. Although the Court held that the Chicago ordinance \nwas unconstitutionally vague, Justices O'Connor and Breyer wrote a \nconcurring opinion that gave municipalities a roadmap on how to enact \nconstitutionally sufficient antiloitering laws. So it was not a battle \nthat was in vain. It was a battle that ultimately will lead to \nresolution of those inner-city poor people's problems. And it was \nMiguel Estrada who took them on, took on the gangs, took on the drug \ndealers--and, I might add, at the request of Mayor Daley. And Mayor \nDaley took them on--something any good mayor I think would do, but \ncertainly I respect Mayor Daley.\n  Under Mayor Daley's leadership, in following the O'Connor-Breyer \nroadmap, Chicago enacted a new ordinance in the year 2000. So, yes, he \nlost the case before the Supreme Court but won it in the end, in \nhelping these poor people in Chicago to have some protection from \ngangbangers and drug dealers. And he is being criticized by my \ncolleagues on the other side during these nomination proceedings? No. \nThe thing that is wrong with Miguel Estrada is he is not the right kind \nof Hispanic. He does not agree with them in everything, maybe. I don't \nknow what his positions are in every degree, but I can tell you this: \nHe is honest, he is smart, he is capable, he answered a lot of \nquestions before our committee--even though he did not please all the \nDemocrats--and he has the highest rating anybody can get, unanimously, \nfrom the American Bar Association.\n  The problem of inner-city gang violence is so pervasive that we in \nCongress recognized it and addressed it in 1994. Were we bad people \nbecause we tried to address this problem that might have curtailed some \npeople's rights to do whatever they wanted to do in our society? That \nis what criminal laws are about.\n  Mr. President, 18 U.S.C. 521 mandated additional penalties of up to \n10 years imprisonment for individuals convicted in certain gang-related \noffenses. I note that eight of my Democratic colleagues on the \ncommittee, who were Members of Congress in 1994, voted in favor of \nsection 521.\n\n  Now, where is the beef? I have been asking that all the way through--\nborrowing Walter Mondale's comment. Where is the legitimate criticism \nof this person other than these esoteric and, I think, unfair \ncriticisms that I have been hearing on the floor since this debate \nbegan?\n  Calling for a vote against Estrada because he does not have any \njudicial experience--oh, he was a law clerk to two Federal judges, one \na Supreme Court Justice. If that isn't judicial experience, then I \ndon't know what is. He did not decide the cases, but he helped write \nthe answers, and he sat there and watched all the judicial proceedings. \nAnd I have just listed 26 Democratic appointees to the Federal bench, \nnone of whom had any judicial experience before we confirmed them, \nwithout raising that ridiculous issue. So the lack of judicial \nexperience is a red herring, as are all of these issues. If you really \nget into them, if you really go through them, you realize there is not \nany substance to these arguments.\n  Now, apparently Paul Bender told Senator Feinstein's staff that he \nstood by his comments, that he believes Miguel Estrada is an ideologue, \nand that the personal reviews that he gave, that were so laudatory and \ncommendable about Miguel Estrada, were just boilerplate that they did \nfor everybody. And apparently, according to what he told Senator \nFeinstein's staff, he stopped assigning important matters to Estrada \nbecause he was too ideological.\n  At the request of the committee, Mr. Estrada provided copies of his \nannual performance evaluations during his tenure at the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. These documents cast serious doubt on Mr. Bender's \nallegations about Mr. Estrada. The evaluations show that during each \nyear that Mr. Estrada worked at the Solicitor General's Office, he \nreceived the highest possible rating of ``outstanding'' in every job \nperformance category. Either Mr. Bender was telling the truth then or \nhe is playing politics now. The rating official who prepared and signed \nthe performance reviews for 1994 to 1996 was none other than Mr. \nBender.\n  I will admit Mr. Bender is a very bright and intelligent man. I will \nadmit he has been a law professor for many years. And I will admit he \nhas many wonderful qualities. But anybody who looks at what has \nhappened here knows he is playing partisan politics right down the \nline.\n  Let me read a few excerpts from the evaluations Mr. Bender signed. \nThey say that Mr. Estrada:\n\n       States the operative facts and applicable law completely \n     and persuasively, with record citations, and in conformance \n     with court and office rules, and with concern for fairness, \n     clarity, simplicity, and conciseness.\n\n  I do not know any lawyer in the world who would not want to have that \nset of accolades written about them.\n  He goes on to say, Miguel Estrada:\n\n       Is extremely knowledgeable of resource materials and uses \n     them expertly; acting independently, goes directly to point \n     of the matter and gives reliable, accurate, responsive \n     information in communicating position to others.\n\n  Or this one:\n\n       All dealings, oral and written, with the courts, clients, \n     and others are conducted in a diplomatic, cooperative, and \n     candid manner.\n\n  Or this one:\n\n       All briefs, motions or memoranda reviewed consistently \n     reflect no policies at variance with departmental or \n     governmental policies or fails to discuss and analyze \n     relevant authorities.\n  You see, Miguel Estrada was also working for the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Another quote: ``is constantly sought for advice and counsel; \ninspires coworkers by example.''\n  Either Mr. Bender was telling the truth then or he isn't telling the \ntruth now. Both of them can't be accurate.\n\n[[Page S2100]]\n\n  These comments represent Mr. Bender's contemporaneous evaluation of \nMr. Estrada's legal ability, judgment, temperament, and reputation for \nfairness and integrity. These comments unmask Mr. Bender's more recent \nstatements made after Mr. Estrada's nomination for what they are--a \npolitically motivated effort to smear Miguel Estrada and hurt his \nchances for confirmation. I am disappointed in Mr. Bender, or Professor \nBender, if you want me to use those terms. I am disappointed that a law \nprofessor would play this game, which is what he is doing.\n  The performance evaluations confirm what other Clinton administration \nlawyers and virtually every other lawyer who knows Miguel Estrada have \nsaid about him--that he is a brilliant attorney who will make a fine \nFederal judge.\n  The nature of the request of my Democratic colleagues for unfettered \naccess to the universe of Mr. Estrada's privileged attorney-client work \nproduct is really extraordinary and unprecedented. These documents were \nnot requested for the eight previous circuit court nominees who had \nworked in the Solicitor General's Office. This request was opposed by \nall seven living former Solicitors General in a letter to the committee \nciting the debilitating effect it would have on how the Department of \nJustice does business. Democrats Archibald Cox, Seth Waxman, Drew Days, \nand Walter Dellinger all signed this letter--as they should have.\n  The Democrats have failed to show a persuasive precedent for this \nrequest. They first claimed that the Department of Justice has a \nhistory of disclosing previously confidential internal documents in \nconnection with confirmation proceedings. This is simply not accurate. \nIt is not fair either. In a letter dated October 8, the Department of \nJustice points out that since the beginning of the Carter \nadministration, there have been 67 former Department of Justice \nemployees, 38 of whom, like Miguel Estrada, had no prior judicial \nexperience. Eight of these nominees had worked in the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. The Department of Justice could find no record of \nhaving produced internal deliberative materials created by the nominee \nwhile the Department of Justice lawyer in any of those cases--in any of \nthose cases.\n  My Democratic colleagues have mentioned six nominees in connection \nwith whom they claim the Department of Justice released confidential \ninternal memoranda or documents. The Department of Justice has \nexplained in a letter to the committee that of these nominees, the \nhearings of only one, Judge Bork, involved documents from his service \nin the Solicitor General's Office.\n  In that case, the Department of Justice produced a limited number of \ndocuments related to specific topics of interest to the committee. They \ndid not allow a fishing expedition into the private memoranda of \nemployees of the Solicitor General's Office, given with good intent to \ntheir superiors so they can make decisions on behalf of our country, \nsomething that would certainly be chilled if they knew that sometime in \nthe future their documents or these documents with their best advice \ncould be utilized to destroy their chances of being on one of the \nFederal courts.\n  As the Department of Justice observed:\n\n       The vast majority of memoranda authored or received by \n     Judge Bork when he served as solicitor general were neither \n     sought nor produced, and the limited category of documents \n     that were produced to the committee did not reveal the \n     internal deliberative recommendations or analysis of the \n     assistant to the solicitor general regarding appeals, \n     certiorari or amicus recommendations in pending cases. This \n     is hardly the unfettered, unprecedented access to privileged \n     work product that has been argued.\n\n  In that case, the Bork case, the Department of Justice produced a \nlimited number of documents related to specific topics of interest to \nthe committee. As the Department of Justice observed:\n\n       The vast majority of memoranda authored or received by \n     Judge Bork when he served as solicitor general were neither \n     sought nor produced, and the limited category of documents \n     that were produced to the committee did not reveal the \n     internal deliberative recommendations or analysis of the \n     assistant to the solicitor general regarding appeals, \n     certiorari or amicus recommendations in pending cases.\n\n  This is hardly the unfettered, unprecedented access to privileged \nwork product that my Democratic colleagues now seek.\n  As for the claim that the Department of Justice produced internal \nmemoranda written by Seventh Circuit Judge Frank Easterbrook, DOJ has \nno record of producing these documents to the committee, and there is \nno indication that the committee ever requested those documents. So how \ndid they come about? Probably through leaks by people who wanted to \nscuttle now-Judge Easterbrook's confirmation process.\n  It is important to note that the Republicans have not used this \ntactic ever--never once--as much as there have been criticisms and \nquestions about Democratic nominees through the years. In fact, during \nthe last Congress, when Jonathan Adelstein, a former aide to Senator \nDaschle, was a nominee to the FCC, Republicans could have asked for all \nof the internal memoranda written by him, but we did not.\n  I would like to respond to a matter that deeply troubled me at Mr. \nEstrada's hearing which has now been resurrected. I am appealing to my \ncolleagues, to their sense of fairness on this matter, which I think \nis, frankly, serious and, frankly, outrageous.\n  At his hearing, Miguel Estrada was asked a series of questions \nregarding some anonymous allegations about him that appeared in an \narticle in the ultraliberal political magazine, The Nation. These \nallegations concern comments that he supposedly made to persons who \ncame to him in search of a Supreme Court clerkship with Justice \nKennedy. It is bad enough to put a witness in the impossible position \nof defending against anonymous allegations, but things got worse when \nMiguel Estrada was asked followup questions about these allegations \nthat were so broadly worded, vague, and compound that he could not have \npossibly crafted a satisfactory answer under the circumstances.\n  It has long been the policy of the committee--that is, the Judiciary \nCommittee--instituted under the leadership of Senator Biden, chairman \nat the time, that we will not subject nominees to anonymous charges. \nUnfortunately, that is just what happened to Miguel Estrada.\n  It is worth reminding my colleagues about Senator Biden's standard \nwhen it came to anonymous sources. He said:\n\n       The nominee has the right to be confronted by his accuser \n     so any accusation against any nominee before any committee \n     which I chair that is not able to be made public to the \n     nominee will not be made known to the Senate unless the \n     individual wishes to do it all by themselves. Then it is \n     known to the nominee. This is not a star chamber.\n\n  I surely agree with Senator Biden.\n  Here is another example of Senator Biden's policy on anonymous \nsources. In 1992, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported:\n\n       Committee Chair Joseph Biden, according to his staff, felt \n     strongly that he was not going to circulate some anonymous \n     charge.\n\n  This is a standard of fairness that the committee has always \nfollowed, and we have really gone way below the deck here. Some of my \ncolleagues are bullying this nominee into a political game of gotcha. \nThat is what it comes down to. More fundamentally, the anonymous \nallegations of The Nation are at odds with the overwhelming evidence of \nMr. Estrada's fairness that we have received in letters of support and \nin examples of cases he has argued. I have mentioned letters from Seth \nWaxman and others.\n  They are simply not credible on their face, particularly when you \nconsider Mr. Estrada's recommendation to Justice Kennedy that he hire a \nlaw clerk who was a colleague of Mr. Estrada's in the Clinton Justice \nDepartment and who now works as a staffer for Senator Leahy, or did \nwork up until recently.\n  At a fundamental level, these are simply not the actions of a right-\nwing ideologue. That is just true. It is a shame to try to make \nsomething out of anonymous allegations that Mr. Estrada wasn't even \ngiven the privilege of trying to answer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know my good friend from Utah feels \nvery strongly about this and has spoken for about 30 minutes, so I \nthink it\n\n[[Page S2101]]\n\nwould be appropriate to go to the other side. But I have spoken to my \ncolleague from Ohio and he only has about 10 minutes of remarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Ohio be allowed to go \nfor 10 minutes and then I be given the floor when he has finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Miguel \nEstrada's nomination. I wish to talk about just one aspect of this \nnomination, one aspect about this debate. I am very concerned about an \nargument some have been making regarding their ability to assess this \nnominee's nomination to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Some are \narguing that they cannot judge Miguel Estrada's qualifications because \nthey have not seen some memos that he wrote when he worked for the \nDepartment of Justice from 1990 to 1997. Some argue they cannot vote in \nfavor of his nomination because they have not seen these memos.\n  I am here this afternoon because I believe that this line of thinking \nis really not a prudent way to view the debate on this nomination. This \nis why. First, Mr. Estrada has nothing to do with whether these memos \nare released. Under the rules of privilege, it is not the attorney who \nproduces the work who decides whether or not to disclose it. Instead, \nit is the client for whom the work was produced who has this right. To \nbe blunt, this is not Mr. Estrada's fight. In fact, Mr. Estrada has \ntestified that were it up to him personally, he would be willing to \nturn over the memos. In fact, let me quote from a transcript of his \nnomination hearing:\n\n       You are right that I have not opposed the release of those \n     records. I have been a lawyer in practice for many years now, \n     and I would like the world to know that I am exceptionally \n     proud of every piece of legal work I have done in my life. If \n     it were up to me as a private citizen, I would be more than \n     proud to have you look at everything that I have done for the \n     Government or for a private person.\n\n  I think it is clear that Mr. Estrada believes he has nothing to hide \nin those memos and would be willing to turn them over. However, as Mr. \nEstrada understands, it is not up to him to decide whether or not those \nmemos are released. Instead, it is up to his client--in this case, the \nJustice Department. It is their decision. So it is clear that Mr. \nEstrada is not responsible for this dispute. It would be very unfair, I \nmaintain, to hold up Mr. Estrada's nomination because these memos have \nnot been released.\n  Perhaps more importantly, in terms of the underlying merits of the \ndispute, it is clear that the Justice Department is correct in refusing \nto turn over these memos. Precedent is clearly on their side. It is \nentirely appropriate for the Department to assert its privilege in \norder to protect work product that was used as part of the Department's \ninternal deliberative process. Mr. Estrada discussed this issue at his \nnomination hearing, and he put it well when he said the following:\n\n       I do recognize that there are certain interests that have \n     been asserted in this case that go beyond my own personal \n     interest, and those are the institutional interests of the \n     Justice Department.\n\n  Mr. Estrada was pressed to ask the Attorney General to release the \nmemos. He was asked: Won't you go to the Attorney General and ask them \nto release the memos? This is what he said:\n       I have been a practicing lawyer for all these years, and \n     one of the things I have come to learn is that a practicing \n     lawyer . . . ought not put his own interests ahead of the \n     stated interests of his client. . . .\n\n  The argument has been made that since he is no longer the Assistant \nSolicitor General, and because he no longer works at the Department of \nJustice, he doesn't have to protect their internal deliberations. But \nthat argument really, of course, misses the point entirely. What is \nimportant is that these privileges do not exist to protect the lawyer. \nRather, these privileges exist to protect the client. Accordingly, \nthese privileges simply do not disappear when the lawyer no longer \nworks for his client.\n\n  A lawyer's obligation to protect his client's privileges carries on \nindefinitely, whether that client is a private person, the Attorney \nGeneral, or a U.S. Senator. In the case of a private person who hires a \nlawyer, the attorney-client privilege exists to encourage full and \nfrank communication between clients and their attorneys. A client can \nconfidently disclose all relevant information to his attorney so that \nthe attorney can provide informed advice to the client.\n  If the client thought that the attorney would reveal the client's \nhighly personal information, full disclosure would be significantly \nchilled. Similarly, it is in the client's interest that a lawyer's \nadvice to him or her remains confidential. Any number of a client's \ndecisions could be undermined if the attorney's advice influencing \nthose decisions were revealed.\n  In a May 28, 2002, editorial supporting Mr. Estrada's nomination, the \nWashington Post recognized that:\n\n       Such a request for an attorney's work product would be \n     unthinkable if the work had been done for a private client.\n\n  The Washington Post got it right. It seems completely reasonable to \nsupport private assertions of privilege. Some, however, will argue that \nthis situation is different. Some will argue that this is a Government \nlawyer whose client is the people of the United States. Some will argue \nthat all those documents and deliberations should be public because the \npublic is the client. But that simply ignores reality, how the real \nworld works and should work.\n  The Department of Justice makes difficult decisions about litigating \nsome of the most complex and sensitive cases before our courts. The \nDepartment must decide which cases to pursue and what arguments to \npresent in each case. It is in the interest of the public that these \nissues are fairly debated and vetted internally so that the Attorney \nGeneral or the Solicitor General can make informed decisions.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft described the internal second-guessing that \na career attorney could go through if the Department of Justice \ndisclosed these internal deliberative memos. That attorney may \nquestion: Are these memos somehow going to be used against me later so \nthat I should tone down my response? Should I adjust what I am saying \nbecause someday a Senate committee, or someone else, is going to want \nto look at it? Should I act in ways that are more consistent with my \naspirations to be a judge someday instead of my responsibility to serve \nin a particular case?\n  Ultimately, we need an environment that allows for a complete \ndiscussion of all the arguments, both the pros and the cons. Attorneys \nhave to be able to present all sides of a case. If an attorney who is \nengaged in a case discussion holds back, it hurts the case, it hurts \nthe free and open exchange of ideas. If an attorney is afraid to talk \nabout all the arguments and angles of a case because he or she is \nafraid of getting quoted at some future point, it hurts the case. It \nhas a chilling effect on the discussion. It hurts the entire litigation \nprocess.\n\n  Let's bring this a little closer to home. Most Members of the Senate \nhave attorneys on their staffs. This is especially true for those of us \nwho serve on the Judiciary Committee. We often require counsel on \ncomplex legal and policy issues that come before the committee. I have \nseveral attorneys on my staff. Other Members do as well. We rely on our \nstaffs, attorneys and nonattorneys, for candid and complete advice.\n  I insist they provide me with points of view and arguments from all \nsides of any given policy debate. Often, one of my attorneys will \npresent one side of a debate and the other will take up the other side \njust so we get a give-and-take. This is a scenario that takes place \nmany times a day every day in the Senate. I must have and other Members \nmust have complete faith that we are getting the entire picture from \nour staffs and that we are receiving their unvarnished opinions. As it \nstands now, I am confident that I get such advice because my staff \nknows anything they communicate to me is completely internal and will \nnot be disclosed.\n  Imagine the difference if their advice were subject to disclosure. \nMany staffers are in the early stages of their careers and may find \nthemselves down the road serving the Government in many different \ncapacities. Some may go on to appointed positions that might require \nSenate confirmation. How could I rely on their work if it were \ninfluenced by some fear that their advice would someday be revealed in\n\n[[Page S2102]]\n\nthe confirmation process? Think about it.\n  I know I am protected as a Member by the speech and debate clause and \nthat my staff's advice to me will not be revealed because of that \nprotection, but the principles are really the same. Our staff, \nCongress's staff, needs to be able to do its work without fear of \nfuture repercussions for arguments made in good faith, but the same is \ntrue of the staff of the Attorney General or the Solicitor General.\n  I wish to reiterate that this is not Mr. Estrada's fight.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. This is not Mr. Estrada's fight. He should not be \npunished for a dispute that is really just about disclosure of \ndocuments between branches. It is that simple.\n  I support his nomination. I will be back in the Chamber later to talk \nabout the merits, but I wanted to talk about this one particular aspect \nof the debate.\n  Mr. President, later today, in less than 2 hours, we will be voting \non several district court nominations. One of them is John Adams from \nthe State of Ohio. I personally know John Adams. John Adams is a very \nwell respected judge from Summit County. He is a very decent human \nbeing. He is someone who is well respected in the community. He will \nbring great common sense to the Federal district court bench. I urge my \ncolleagues to approve his nomination when we vote on it later today.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nYork is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I very much thank my colleagues from Utah and Iowa for \ngoing through the order we did. I have spoken about this issue before \nfor what, at least for me, is an uncharacteristically long amount of \ntime. I did not finish what I had to say then. There is more to say. I \nwish to take up where I left off.\n  We are beginning to hear that anyone who opposes Mr. Estrada is anti-\nHispanic. I have to tell you, Mr. President, I am disappointed in that \nrhetoric. I think it is low, I think it is not appropriate, and I think \nit is a way of hiding the real feelings here.\n  I cannot confine my remarks to such expressions because they do not \nbegin to convey how deeply offensive those statements are. We deserve \nan apology, the American people deserve an apology, and, frankly, Mr. \nEstrada today deserves an apology.\n  This is not a debate about Mr. Estrada's ethnic background, plain and \nsimple, and everyone in this Chamber knows it. It is a cheap argument \nto invoke.\n  Let me tell you, Mr. President, what this debate is really about. \nThis debate is about whether the Senate should automatically defer to \nthe President or whether the Senate should fully exercise its \nconstitutional powers and closely examine Mr. Estrada before we hand \nhim a lifetime appointment to the Nation's second most important court. \nThis debate is about whether we should blithely rubberstamp nominees or \nwhether we should insist that when we have questions, they are answered \nto our satisfaction.\n  We have been subject to accusations and allegations that would be \nfunny if they were not so demeaning to those who state them and to \nthose they are purporting to defend. Let me quote verbatim some of the \nremarks the other side has made in the course of debating this \nnomination.\n  We have heard it often said of late, but I believe Senator Lott was \nthe first to say this last year:\n\n       They don't want Miguel Estrada because he's Hispanic.\n\n  It is so ludicrous that it is hard to imagine we have to respond to \nit, but to make sure the record is set straight, I will.\n  Under Chairman Leahy's leadership in the last Congress, we considered \nevery other Latino nominee who could be considered, all six of them: \nChristina Arguello from New Mexico, Judge Philip Martinez from Texas, \nRandy Crane from Texas, Judge Jose Martinez from Florida, Judge Alia \nLudlum from Texas, and Jose Linares from New Jersey. Every one of them \nwas picked by the President, every one of them was confirmed quickly, \nand every one of them is Hispanic. We moved them on the bench because \nno red flags were raised suggesting they were extremists and because \nthey did nothing to undermine the Senate's role in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  A seventh Latino nominee, Judge Otero from California, was \nunanimously supported by the Judiciary Democrats just last week, myself \nincluded, and I have every reason to believe the entire Democratic \ncaucus will support his nomination when the majority leader brings it \nto the floor as scheduled later this evening. So this has nothing to do \nwith Mr. Estrada's race, his ethnicity, or his heritage.\n  The only ones around here who are claiming that this debate is about \nrace, ethnicity, and heritage are my colleagues from across the aisle, \nand their position puts them in the ludicrous position of saying the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus or the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund is \nanti-Hispanic because they oppose Mr. Estrada. As I said, it is \nludicrous. It is demeaning. Let's debate this on the merits but not on \nanything else.\n  As I mentioned, Senate Democrats unanimously supported seven Latino \nnominees already, all candidates offered by the President; all, I \npresume, sharing a conservative legal philosophy. I do not know if they \nare Democrats or Republicans, but I doubt all seven were Democrats. So \nthen a lot of people on this side of the aisle supported Republican \nHispanics, conservative Hispanics. It seems only when one disagrees \nwith my good friend from Utah and those on the other side of the aisle \ndo, the names get hurled and there is no consistency, there is no \nmeasure of appropriateness. It is similar to using a sledgehammer, a \nbludgeon, to get the nominee through.\n  None of the seven who have been nominated by President Bush--I do not \nknow if my colleagues know how many are Republican. I do not, but again \nprobably most of them--have raised red flags that they will be \nactivists on the bench. None raised serious concerns that they will try \nto make law instead of interpreting law.\n\n  So when a Republican Senator says if someone is a minority and a \nconservative, we are against them, that is not only ludicrous, it is \nwrong; it is dead wrong and it is disproven by the facts of what has \nhappened in the Judiciary Committee and on the floor of this Senate \nrepeatedly last year and even tonight. Those kinds of allegations do \nnot do anything to heighten the quality of dialog and debate. I am \nsaddened by it. It is not a high moment for the Senate, and it is not \nthe way to win a nomination. I wish, probably hope against hope, that \nwe would try to raise the level of this debate, because those kinds of \ncomments debase us, they debase this process, and everyone knows they \nare false. They are a red herring.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. No wonder people are fed up with Washington. No wonder \nthey do not want to pay attention to the work we are trying to do. \nComments like that turn people off. It is a real disservice to the \nprocess, to the Senate, and to the country, and it ought to stop.\n  I will defer for a brief moment to my colleague from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator has been making the point that no one on his \nside is making this a racial problem or a Hispanic problem. Is the \nSenator aware of an important letter I received this morning from \nJennifer Braceras, who is a commissioner on the U.S. Commission on \nCivil Rights? Let me bring it to the Senator's attention, because I \nknow he is a fair Senator. He is tough but fair, and he is my friend. I \nfound him to be honest.\n  We know there are those in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus of the \nHouse who have made comments that certainly have caused a lot of \nconsternation in the Hispanic community. This is a letter I received \njust this morning from Jennifer Braceras, who is a commissioner on the \nU.S. Commission on Civil Rights, and I will tell the Senator what Ms. \nBraceras had to say about what she believes some Senate Democrats are \ndoing to Miguel Estrada's nomination.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to reclaim my time.\n\n[[Page S2103]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask the Senator if he is aware of this? I hope the \nSenator will give me some time to read this letter. It is from a \nleading member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The Senator has \nmade these comments. I know he is fair, and I think this is something \nthat is right on point.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to reclaim my time from my colleague, if I \nmight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am not familiar with those comments. I will certainly \nread them, but I do not think one person on a commission--I do not know \nwho she is. I do not know if she is a Republican appointee or a \nDemocratic appointee or anything to that effect.\n  Mr. HATCH. She is Hispanic.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. But it does not gainsay the argument that we have \nrepeatedly approved Hispanic nominees in this body, Hispanic nominees \nnominated by President Bush, Hispanic nominees who are Republican, and \nHispanic nominees who are conservative.\n  I say this to my good friend from Utah: Of the 10 Hispanic appellate \njudges currently seated in the Federal courts, eight were appointed by \nPresident Clinton. Three other Hispanic nominees of President Clinton \nto the appellate courts were blocked by the other side a few years ago. \nI did not hear charges from Senators--I do not know what the outside \nworld says, but I do not recall a single charge by a Senator saying \nthat blocking those was anti-Hispanic. If somebody made those charges, \nthey would be wrong.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a point of clarification?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Just as my colleague from Utah considers us friends, so \ndo I. I have tremendous respect for him and I say the same as he said \nabout me. He is tough, but he is fair. Please.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am grateful for that and I very much rely on that \nfriendship on the committee.\n  The Senator is aware, is he not, that members of the House, \nspecifically Representative Menendez of the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus, has said on several occasions that Mr. Estrada is not Hispanic \nenough and there have been other comments made that are very similar?\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at \nthis point so that my dear friend can read it, because Ms. Braceras is \nnot only a member of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights but her father \nis a judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              U.S. Commission on Civil Rights,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 8, 2003.\n     Re nomination of Miguel Estrada.\n\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As an Hispanic American and a member of \n     the United States Commission on Civil Rights, I write to \n     express my outrage over the efforts of the Senate Democratic \n     leadership to oppose by dishonorable means the nomination of \n     Miguel Estrada to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Many fellow Latinos and I are disturbed that the Democratic \n     leadership has chosen this moment to apply a new test for \n     judicial nominees--to attack a nominee on the ground that \n     there is no evidence that would otherwise disqualify him--and \n     to choose a Latino candidate as their first target of this \n     disingenuous test.\n       In the absence of a principled or coherent basis for \n     opposition to this nomination, the Democratic leadership has \n     shamelessly attempted to play the race card against our \n     people--speaking in code words and questioning the ethnic \n     authenticity of one who emigrated from Honduras at age 17, \n     and who, indeed, still speaks with the Spanish accent of his \n     homeland. This effort to paint Mr. Estrada as Hispanic ``in \n     name only'' is an insult to the intelligence of all \n     Americans, but most especially to the dignity of Latinos \n     throughout the country. It has exposed a deep hypocrisy, \n     rooted in racism, on the question of diversity.\n       Contrary to the assumptions of the Democratic leadership, \n     the Latino community is truly diverse--we come in all colors, \n     religions, and, yes, political inclinations. Yet the \n     Democratic leadership has decided that the only ``genuine'' \n     Latinos are those they can control. Anyone else is simply \n     unacceptable, a renegade to be extirpated as not truly \n     ``Hispanic.''\n       The Democratic leadership seeks political cover for its \n     despicable actions from the left-wing special interest groups \n     that have assumed the mantle of ``spokesmen'' for our \n     community. But Hispanics are in no sense represented by non-\n     membership organizations such as the Mexican-American Legal \n     Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF)--the true constituencies \n     of these purveyors of victimization are the foundations and \n     donors who bankroll them.\n       The effort to stigmatize as unfit for public office an \n     eminently well-qualified Latino simply because he has failed \n     to pledge all allegiance to the liberal orthodoxy is an \n     affront to the diverse Latino community of this nation. It \n     promises to do lasting damage to the American polity and \n     ultimately undermine the Democratic party's efforts to \n     maintain a base in the Hispanic community.\n       Make an mistake about it, Hispanic Americans seek nothing \n     less than full integration into the American system, with \n     prominence in both major political parties. Miguel Estrada \n     embodies these aspirations, and his nomination to one of the \n     most prestigious courts in the land is a source of pride for \n     Latinos across the country. That is why non-partisan Hispanic \n     organizations like the Hispanic National Bar Association, the \n     Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the League of United Latin \n     American Citizens (the nation's oldest and largest Latino \n     membership organization) support the nomination. And that is \n     why I write to lend my unequivocal support to Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination to the District of Columbia Circuit.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Jennifer C. Braceras,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I might add Ms. Braceras' father is a Clinton appointee to \nthe Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and she is outraged at what is \nhappening to Miguel Estrada.\n  I thank my colleague for giving me those few minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to read the letter. What I was saying was \nthat of 10 Hispanic appellate judges currently seated in the Federal \ncourts, eight were appointed by President Clinton. Three other Hispanic \nnominees of President Clinton to the appellate courts were blocked by \nmy friends from the party on the other side, in addition to others for \nthe district courts.\n  In fact, in contrast to President Bush's selection of only one \nHispanic circuit court nominee in more than 2 years, with the second \nbeing nominated only last week, three of President Clinton's first 14 \njudicial nominees were Hispanic. He nominated more than 30 Hispanics to \nthe Federal courts.\n  I am not saying Clinton's superior record on appointing Hispanic \njudges makes anyone on the other side or President Bush anti-Hispanic. \nThat claim would be ludicrous, the same as to say those of us who are \nopposing the nomination of Miguel Estrada are anti-Hispanic. I just \nwant to go over what happened to some Hispanic nominees when the \nRepublicans ran the Senate during President Clinton's tenure. The \nconsideration of Judge Richard Paez was delayed for over 1,500 days. \nThirty-nine Republicans voted against it, because of his liberalism and \ntheir allegations that he was a judicial activist. These allegations \nwere centered around two sentences contained in a lecture he gave to an \naudience of law students. They ran Judge Paez up and down the ladder. \nThey demanded he answer more questions and produce more documents.\n  Did my colleagues put Judge Paez through the ringer because they were \nanti-Hispanic? I ask that to my colleague from Utah. Did his friends, \nnot him--I know he tried to get the nominee through. After 1,500 days, \nhe succeeded. That is close to 4 years. I think it is a little more \nthan 4 years, but some of his colleagues and my friends on that side of \nthe aisle vehemently opposed Judge Paez. Some of the arguments they \nmade were the Ninth Circuit is out of balance, has a very liberal \nrepresentation, and it does not need another liberal judge. Those \narguments can be weighed for whatever they are worth, and different \npeople will think they are worth different things, but it clearly does \nnot make our friends from the other side who held up that nomination \nanti-Hispanic.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to----\n  Mr. HATCH. I thought the Senator asked me a question.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield to my colleague for the last time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I was disappointed with the Paez nomination.\n  It took too long. But there were legitimate questions that were \nraised that had nothing to do with race. There were various questions \nabout cases, but it took too long. I worked very hard to get him a \nfinal vote and, as the Senator knows, I voted for him. I have to say I \ntook a certain amount of criticism from some who felt very deeply,\n\n[[Page S2104]]\n\nnot against Judge Paez as a Hispanic person but because they thought he \nwas a judicial activist, and there were a number of cases that \ncertainly were very questionable cases and even I had problems with \nthat.\n  I also found Judge Paez, who--after a lengthy period of time I asked \nhim if he would come and see me and I was very impressed with Judge \nPaez as a human being. It did not hurt him a bit that his family lived \nin Utah, and they are very good people. That certainly was very \npersuasive to me, too. And he is a very good person. But there were \nlegitimate legal questions that had been raised that had to be kind of \nsifted through in order for me to get to a point where we could have \nthat vote.\n  I agree with my colleague; it took too long. I agree there have been \nfaults on both sides throughout this process, as long as I have been on \nthe Judiciary Committee, and there have always been people who have not \nmade it who have been left over at the end, but I have to tell my \ncolleague during my tenure we put through 377 Clinton judges, the \nsecond highest total, only five less than Reagan.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am going to reclaim my time because we do not want to \ngo through a rehash of who put through more judges. I do not think that \nis helpful.\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say this to my friend from Utah. He said his \ncolleagues on the other side thought Paez might be a judicial activist. \nThey disagreed with some of the ways Judge Paez thought. Fair enough. I \ndid not agree with them. Nobody called them anti-Hispanic. We have had \ncharges on this floor that to oppose Mr. Estrada makes one Senator or \nanother anti-Hispanic. That is my point. That is demeaning to this \nprocess, and it ought to stop. The Senators who are opposing Mr. \nEstrada are no more anti-Hispanic than those who opposed Mr. Paez.\n\n  By the way, there were 39 Republicans who voted against him. Are \nthose 39 Republicans anti-Hispanic? We would laugh at that. If someone \non this side of the aisle tried to raise that charge, there would be a \nfury over there. Correctly so.\n  If someone had never voted for a Hispanic nominee, if President \nClinton had not nominated Hispanic nominees, then maybe there would be \nsomeone bringing up this argument. But the record is to the contrary. \nIn terms of the criteria of Hispanic nominees to the bench, this side \nof the aisle has a far better record than the other side.\n  I think those comments are demeaning. Those comments are wrong. Some \non the outside may make them. We cannot help that. This is a free \ncountry. God bless America. They should not be made on the floor of the \nSenate. I implore my colleagues to cease. They know it is wrong. It is \nnot even an effective debating technique.\n  Let me go over a few other Latino nominees. There were two Latino \ncircuit nominees, Rosemary Barkett and Sonia Sotomayor, who were also \ndelayed. Judge Sotomayor, who was appointed to the district court by \nPresident George H.W. Bush, was targeted by some on the other side for \ndelay or defeat on the grounds of ideology or philosophy. Were they \nanti-Hispanic when they opposed her? I doubt it. While she was \neventually confirmed, 29 Republicans voted against her. Were they anti-\nHispanic? I doubt it. Yet we hear from some who voted against Judge \nSotomayor and against Judge Paez, from some of those who have held \nthose nominees up, the charge here. It was wrong then. It is wrong now. \nIt ought to stop.\n  Judge Barkett was targeted for delay and defeat on the claims about \nher judicial philosophy. Thirty-six Republicans voted against her \nconfirmation. My good friend from Utah--again, a true good friend; that \nis not just rhetoric, a fine man--said this of Judge Barkett: I led the \nfight to oppose her confirmation because her judicial records indicated \nshe would be an activist who would legislate from the bench.\n  I don't doubt for a minute my friend's sincerity. I don't doubt for a \nminute that Chairman Hatch opposed Judge Barkett because he disagreed \nwith her ideology and thought she would be an activist on the bench. I \ndon't doubt for a minute he does not have an anti-Hispanic bone or atom \nin his body.\n  However, I say to my colleague, the same is true, the mirror image is \ngoing on here. Some on this side disagree with Mr. Estrada's \nphilosophy. There are some who believe he will be a judicial activist, \nalthough none of us know for sure because the record is so thin. So \nthere is an additional argument about the record.\n  Just as we did not doubt the sincerity of our friends from across the \naisle when they opposed Hispanic nominees who they thought would be \nactivist judges--not my words; out of the mainstream, who would \nlegislate from the bench--I hope they will not doubt ours.\n  When scores and scores of our colleagues delayed Judge Barkett and \nJudge Sotomayor, when scores of Republicans voted against them, was it \nabout race? Was it about ethnicity? Was it about heritage? Of course \nnot. They had concerns about what kind of jurists Judge Barkett and \nJudge Sotomayor would be. It was not because they are Hispanic.\n  By the way, that is, in my judgment, just what the Founding Fathers \nwanted. They wanted to debate the philosophy and views of potential \nnominees as well as their legal ability, their probity, and where they \ncame from in terms of judicial philosophy. That is what they wanted.\n\n  But it seems there is a double standard in this Senate now. It is OK \nto say Hispanics on the left are not qualified because of ideology, but \nit is not OK to say Hispanics on the right are not qualified because of \nideology. That is patently unfair. That is wrong. Again, it demeans \nthis great Senate. It is a sad day for the Senate when that happens. It \nought to stop.\n  Enrique Moreno, Christine Arguello, and Jorge Rangel were all \nnominated to the circuit courts by President Clinton and were never \nafforded a hearing or vote in the Judiciary Committee when Republicans \ncontrolled. In addition, Hispanic district court nominees such as \nRicardo Morado and Hilda Tagle of Texas were also blocked. Mr. Moreno \nand Mr. Rangel were blocked by blue slips. Senator Hatch, my friend and \ncolleague, exercised his legitimate power as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee to honor the blue slips from a Texas Senator or Texas \nSenators. Of course, now that we have someone else appointing the \njudges, Senator Hatch is changing the blue slip policies. But that is \nnot the point. The point is, when a Texas Senator is blocked, Mr. \nMoreno and Mr. Rangel and the Republican leadership allowed these well-\nqualified, widely respected, moderate Hispanic nominations, approved by \nthe bar association, just as Mr. Estrada was, to die on the vine.\n  I don't recall any claims coming from Senators on this side of the \naisle that they they were anti-Hispanic. Again, to bring charges from \noutside this body, whether it be someone on the civil rights commission \nor someone in one of what my friend from Utah calls the ``left-wing \nHispanic groups''--all the groups he disagrees with are left-wing \nHispanics and all the groups he agrees with are fine Hispanic groups. \nBut the point being we should not bring these issues up among ourselves \nbecause it demeans this body.\n  When these nominees were blocked, I assume my colleagues had their \nreasons. Maybe they were negotiating something. Maybe they had concerns \nabout how the fine men would perform on the bench. But I assume those \nconcerns had nothing to do with their being Hispanics. So why is it \nwhen they use procedural powers to block a nominee it is OK, but when \nwe want a nominee to answer questions, disclose written materials and \nshow he is not out of the mainstream, that he is not extreme, we get \ncalled vituperative names?\n  It sounds like a bad joke. I feel as if I traveled through the \nlooking glass. We have a candidate whose picture is permanently on the \nfloor but whose answers are permanently absent, who will not tell us \nwhat he really thinks. This is not the way the world really works. The \nSenate, if we do not watch it, could turn into a nonsensical California \nWonderland.\n  Last week my good friend from Utah, who is doing a fine job defending \nsomething he believes in deeply here this afternoon and throughout this \nweek and last weekend, said: I have never seen any Hispanic nominee \nwhose nomination has so resonated with the\n\n[[Page S2105]]\n\nLatino community except for the partisans, the partisan Democrats.\n  That is just not the case. The fact is the opposite. No Hispanic \nnominee has ever engendered such opposition. Many mainstream Latino \nleaders and organizations have come to the conclusion that Mr. Estrada \nshould not be confirmed. The nomination is not resonating with them. \nThe nomination is not resonating with the millions of Hispanic \nAmericans represented by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \nFund, the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, La Raza, and most of all \nthe Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n  I have heard that there are some groups of Hispanic lawyers who \nsupport Mr. Estrada or Hispanic businesspeople. Good for them. They are \nparticipating in the American process. But in my State, Congressman \nSerrano and Congressman Velazquez represent not only Hispanic lawyers \nand Hispanic businesspeople, but the whole Hispanic community. They are \nthe two highest elected Latino officials we have. They would seem to me \nto speak better than any group, left, right, or center, for or against \nMr. Estrada--at least talking about Hispanics in New York. They are \nagainst him.\n  So this battle of the organizations is a little silly. But it seems \nto me that by the very precepts of our democracy, those who have been \nelected to office are the ones who are probably the most \nrepresentative, unless there is something so flawed in our democracy \nthat it doesn't work. They seem to be overwhelmingly--not exclusively, \nbut overwhelmingly against Mr. Estrada.\n  I have sat and talked to the members of the Hispanic Caucus. It is \nnot simply a political issue to them. They feel it passionately. They \nbelieve deeply that the views that best represent those of the Hispanic \npeople are not the views of Mr. Estrada.\n  These are the very organizations, by the way, some of the \norganizations I mentioned and some of the individuals I mentioned, who \nhave worked vigilantly for years to put more Hispanics on the bench. \nNot so many of the others, who are claiming someone is not truly \nrepresenting the Hispanic community. But these are the people who have \ndone it. Do we think they have taken this position blithely, when they \ntake such pride and have spent so much of their time trying to elevate \nHispanics in the courts? Of course not. They have serious concerns, \nconcerns about what kind of judge Mr. Estrada would be, legitimate \nconcerns about what Mr. Estrada will do if given a lifetime appointment \nto the Nation's second highest court.\n  My friends across the aisle have accused my good friend and \ncolleague--I know he is a friend and colleague of my friend from Utah--\nSenator Leahy, of ``playing star marionette to these Hispanic groups.''\n  That is an insult both to our colleague from Vermont and to these \nfine organizations. It is absurd, and it ought to stop. They may have a \nphilosophy closer to that of the Senator from Vermont--or to mine, for \nthat matter--but they clearly make up their own minds. It is one of the \nmeanest things I have heard in 30 years in government. Again, it is \ndemeaning. It is demeaning to this body; it is demeaning to the groups; \nit is demeaning to Senator Leahy. It ought to stop.\n  I have not heard a single word on this floor denigrating the groups \nwho have supported Mr. Estrada. I don't know who the Hispanic Chamber \nof Commerce is, but I am sure they are fine people. I don't know who \nthe Hispanic Lawyers Association is, but I am sure they are fine \npeople. I am not going to denounce them. I am not going to characterize \nthem. So why is it OK to characterize other Hispanic groups, with whom \nsome on the other side disagree, in such derogatory ways? I just assume \nthat the groups on one side, cited by one Senator, and the groups cited \nby another looked at the same nominee and came to a different \nconclusion; that is all.\n  Another thing our colleagues across the aisle said was that we are \ntaking blindfolded swings at Mr. Estrada. Maybe there is a little Freud \nin there. To the extent that we are blindfolded, it is only because Mr. \nEstrada will not answer questions, won't give us the memos he wrote, \nand we are being kept in the dark about what he believes.\n\n  I suggest we get this debate out of the low levels where it has been, \nat least at certain points in time, and back on the merits. Let's stop \nthis foolishness. Let's start talking about whether the Senate should \nconfirm a man about whom so many red flags have been raised, a man who \nI believe is thwarting the Senate's role in the constitutional process \nby refusing to answer questions, a man who is asking us to hand to him \na lifetime appointment to this Nation's second most vital court without \ngiving us even the slightest inkling as to what kind of judge he would \nbe in terms of how he would rule, in terms of his philosophy.\n  In the interest of moving the debate along, let me move to the \nattacks that some have made on our insisting that Mr. Estrada answer \nthe questions we have asked him. Another place where we venture into \nAlice in Wonderland is this idea, How dare we ask Mr. Estrada to answer \nquestions?\n  Go back and look. The very ones of our colleagues who are condemning \nquestions being asked of Mr. Estrada asked the most questions of \nprevious nominees. God bless them for it. That is their right. It \nhelped the debate. It helped the process.\n  Our friends have suggested that the questions put to Mr. Estrada, the \nquestions he refused to answer, were unreasonable. I say to my friends \non the other side that they ought to look more closely at the questions \nwe asked, and then look in the mirror--or perhaps more correctly, look \nin the record--because virtually every question we asked Mr. Estrada \nwas asked by Republican Senators of President Clinton's judicial \nnominees. The only difference is that when the Republicans asked \nquestions, President Clinton's nominees gave answers.\n  It is also worth noting that we put the same questions to other \nnominees of President Bush. The only difference here, too, is that they \nanswered. But don't take my word for it; let's go to the record.\n  Senator Durbin asked Mr. Estrada:\n\n       In terms of judicial philosophy, please name several \n     judges, living or dead, whom you admire and would like to \n     emulate on the bench.\n\n  Mr. Estrada declined, claiming there is no judge whatsoever, not one \nsingle judge in the entire history of jurisprudence, whom he would \n``seek to emulate on the bench, whether in terms of judicial philosophy \nor otherwise.'' He named a couple of judges he was friendly with, a \ncouple of judges he had personal respect for, but not one judge living \nor dead whom he would emulate in terms of judicial philosophy or \notherwise. That is a pretty extraordinary answer from a man who wants a \nlifetime appointment on the Nation's second highest court. He is \nbasically saying: ``Trust me, I am very smart''--which he is--``so I'll \nbe a good judge.''\n  Forgive us if we want a little more proof. If a party in court before \nMr. Estrada tried to make a case with such a paucity of evidence, I \ncan't imagine that Mr. Estrada, then a judge, would rule in his favor.\n  Maybe this is an unfair question. Maybe, as my friends from the other \nside are suggesting, this question should not have to be answered by \nsomeone seeking such a powerful position. Maybe it is wrong for us to \npropound such questions to judicial nominees.\n  Perhaps we should call up the Department of Justice and ask the \nAttorney General what he thinks about Senator Durbin's question, \nbecause when Attorney General Ashcroft was a Senator, he agreed that \nSenator Durbin's question was a fair one. How do I know? Because \nSenator Ashcroft asked the very same question himself. And guess what. \nWhen Senator Ashcroft asked it, the question was answered. Let me quote \nSenator Ashcroft:\n\n       Which judge has served as a model for the way you would \n     want to conduct yourself as a judge, and why?\n\n  In response, William Traxler, a nominee of President Clinton, \nresponded by naming a specific judge, John Gentry, a State court judge \nbefore whom Mr. Traxler appeared when he was a litigator, as exactly \nthe kind of judge Mr. Traxler would want to emulate.\n  I am sure my friends on the other side will say, Well, you know, \nSenator Ashcroft didn't specifically ask about judicial philosophy. But \nremember, Mr. Estrada's answer to Senator Durbin's question went way \nbeyond judicial philosophy. Mr. Estrada said he could not\n\n[[Page S2106]]\n\nname one single solitary judge he would want to emulate, in terms of \njudicial philosophy ``or otherwise.''\n  Regardless, we don't have to get into that argument. Let us look at \nwhat happened when the same question was put to another of President \nClinton's nominees, Inge Prytz Johnson. Guess what. She answered.\n  Senator Ashcroft's question was: ``Which Supreme Court Justice, past \nor present, do you most admire and why?\n  Judge Johnson named Justice Potter Stewart and explained why she \nadmired him.\n  Senator Ashcroft's followup question was: ``What Judge or Justice has \nmost influenced your thinking concerning the constitutional separation \nof powers?''\n  Now we are getting right into judicial philosophy.\n  Now this is, for all intents and purposes, a question addressing the \nnominee's judicial philosophy on separation of powers issues.\n  I want to read Judge Johnson's answer in its entirety because it is \nreally a model answer. It is the kind of answer we should not only \nexpect from nominees, it is the kind of answer we should demand from \nthem.\n  Judge Johnson said:\n\n       Judge Learned hand was one of the preeminent advocates of \n     judicial restraint and of respect for the doctrine of \n     separation of powers. He said: ``Some of us have chosen \n     America as the land of our adoption; the rest of us have come \n     from those who did the same. For this reason we have some \n     right to consider ourselves a picked group, a group of those \n     who had the courage to break from the past and brave the \n     dangers and the loneliness of a strange land. What was the \n     object that nerved us, or those who went before us, to this \n     choice? We sought liberty. . . .''\n       Judge Learned Hand demonstrated through his opinions that \n     this liberty can most fiercely be protected through respect \n     for our constitutional doctrine of separation of powers.\n\n  That is a pretty straightforward answer. It shows us a little bit \nabout what kind of judge this nominee aspired to be. It helped the \nSenate decide that she merited confirmation. There was nothing wrong \nwith Senator Ashcroft asking the question and there was nothing wrong \nwith Judge Johnson answering it.\n  Shall we go on?\n  I asked Mr. Estrada to name a Supreme Court case he disagreed with. I \nfirst asked him to name a case from the last 40 years of Supreme Court \nhistory. Then I expanded the question to cover all of Supreme Court \njurisprudence. He refused to answer, claiming he could not name a \nsingle such case.\n  My friends on the other side suggest there is something unfair about \nthis question. Let me tell you, as I go through the records of \nquestions they put to President Clinton's nominees, this question pales \nin comparison.\n  Time and again, Republican Senators asked Clinton nominees to take \npositions on issues that would come before them if confirmed as Federal \njudges. If you want us to detail those instances for you, we are happy \nto do so. Just let us know and we will put together some charts \ndemonstrating the double standard of these attacks on us. I think we \nall know what that research would show. I think we all know how unfair \nand inconsistent the other side is being. I don't want to go back a \ncouple of years to the questions they asked, but we can do it if we \nhave to.\n\n  By the standards our colleagues set and by any objective measure, our \nquestions were well within bounds. And, frankly, these weren't even \nhardball questions. There was no surprise in these questions--they had \nall been asked before in one form or another. Mr. Estrada simply just \ndid not want to answer.\n  My colleagues have cited Canon 5 of the Code of Judicial Conduct of \nthe American Bar Association as the defense for Mr. Estrada's refusing \nto answer questions.\n  As Chairman Hatch has said, Canon 5 that expressly forbids nominees \nto judicial duty from making ``pledges or promises of conduct in office \n[or] statements that commit or appear to commit the nominee with \nrespect to cases, controversies, or issues that are likely to come \nbefore the courts.''\n  Let us be clear. My questions were about already decided Supreme \nCourt cases, cases that by definition will never come before Mr. \nEstrada; cases that he can never reconsider; and cases that would not \neven arguably justify invoking Canon 5 as a basis for refusing to \nanswer.\n  Why are these questions important? Because the answers will give us \ninsight into how Mr. Estrada approaches the law. They will help tell us \nwhat kind of judge he will be. Is he likely to be a Marshall or a \nScalia? A Brennan or a Rehnquist? Probably not. There is quite a bit of \ndifference among those judges. These are legitimate questions that \ndon't even begin to lead to a violation of Canon 5.\n  But don't take my word for it. Take John Ashcroft's.\n  I don't mean to limit my laudatory comments to Senator Ashcroft, but \nhe asked such good questions when he was here that I can't help citing \nhim favorably. Mr. Attorney General, if you are watching this debate, I \nhope that by complimenting your fine work on this issue I'm not hurting \nyour reputation with certain communities.\n  Then-Senator Ashcroft asked this question of Marcia Berzon, a Ninth \nCircuit nominee:\n\n       Please define judicial activism. Is Lochner v. New York an \n     example of judicial activism? Please identify three Supreme \n     Court opinions that you believe are examples of judicial \n     activism (not including Lochner if your answer to the \n     previous question was yes). Is Roe v. Wade an example of \n     judicial activism?\n\n  Judge Berzon answered. She waited a few years for the Senate to \nconfirm her, but she answered. She said Lochner was an example of \njudicial activism. She said Roe was not. And she named three other \nSupreme Court cases that she believed were judicial activism.\n  So there is just no question that our questions were reasonable.\n  So there was no question that, at least by John Ashcroft's standard, \nour questions were reasonable.\n  Once again, why isn't it that what is good for the goose has to be \ngood for the gander? Why does it seem there is a double standard; that \nit is OK when there were Democratic nominees to ask them question after \nquestion after question about their philosophy, but when Mr. Estrada \ncomes before us we don't need to know anything more? All he has to do \nis say, I will follow the law.\n  Suggesting that there's something wrong with our asking the exact \nsame questions our friends asked is nothing short of absurd.\n  Let me note as well, that the very same question I asked of Mr. \nEstrada, I asked of the five District Court nominees whose hearings \nwere held the same day as Mr. Estrada's. They all answered. I asked the \nsame question of Jeffrey Sutton, a circuit court nominee whose hearing \nwe held a couple of weeks ago. He answered too.\n  Judge Linda Reade, a judge who I voted for in committee and on the \nFloor--one of the 96 Bush judicial nominees I have supported so far--\nand whom we unanimously confirmed to a District Court judgeship in \nIowa, gave some particularly interesting answers.\n  Judge Reade was crucial of two Supreme Court cases that expanded \npolice powers and diminished privacy rights under the fourth amendment. \nShe answered interesting questions. It was a great moment for the \ncommittee.\n  One of the cases, United States v. Rabinowitz, held that police had \nthe power to search someone's office when he was arrested with an \narrest warrant but without a search warrant.\n  The other case was Harris v. United States where the court held, \nagain, that a search of an arrestee's entire four-bedroom apartment was \nconstitutional despite the fact that the police did not have a search \nwarrant.\n  Her concerns about these cases reflect a heightened sensitivity to \nprivacy rights protected by the fourth amendment. I don't want judges \nwho read the fourth amendment so expansively that the police are \nhandcuffed and unable to do their jobs. I want judges who will balance \nprivacy rights with law enforcement interests.\n  I tend to be more conservative on criminal justice issues. I tend to \nside more with law and order than with the liberals out there. So I may \nnot agree 100 percent with Judge Reade's answers. But her answers are \nfair and reasonable, and it allowed those of us on the committee to see \nwhat she was talking about.\n  Her answers suggest to me that Judge Reade will be attuned to \nAmerican's privacy rights. I appreciate her candor, I appreciate her \nforthrightness, and I appreciate her straightforwardness. She is not \nhiding a thing. She is telling us what she thinks.\n\n[[Page S2107]]\n\n  And there is obviously not a single Senator in this body who thinks \nJudge Reade's answers disqualify her for a Federal judgeship. Not a \nsingle one of us objected to her nomination or voted against her. The \nsame is true of the four other nominees we asked questions the day of \nMr. Estrada's hearing.\n\n  So this idea that the canons of ethics will be violated by asking \nquestions about judicial philosophy is contradicted, is gainsaid, by \nthe very fact that all of us voted for somebody who answered questions \nsuch as that. I do not think we would vote for someone who we thought \nrepeatedly violated the canons of ethics.\n  So we want answers, we want forthright answers; we do not want the \nball hidden. And then if judges appear to be somewhere within the \nmainstream--even though we may not agree with them on just about every \nissue--we will confirm them. That is what we did with these four \nnominees. We did it quickly. I voted for every one of them.\n  If the questions had been unreasonable, my colleagues on the other \nside, I presume, would not have asked them of Democratic nominees. But, \nas we have seen a little glimpse, the very questions we asked Mr. \nEstrada, Senators on the other side asked Democratic nominees, and \nthere was no outcry or objection.\n  Just recently, I asked this question of a potential nominee in New \nYork whom the President asked me to consider. I have not taken a \nposition on her yet. She has not even been nominated. But let me tell \nyou how much she impressed me with her answers. She named two cases, \nboth of recent vintage.\n  The first case came from just last year, striking down the Child \nPornography Prevention Act. In that case, a 6-to-3 Supreme Court said \nthe first amendment protects purveyors of child pornography when they \nare using images of virtual children instead of actual children. I \nthink the Court got the answer totally wrong. We are hopefully going to \nremedy that problem caused by the Court with legislation I am \ncosponsoring with Senators Hatch and Leahy, among others. But I was \npleased to hear that the nominee agreed that the Court got the ruling \nwrong.\n  The other case was another decision from last year where the Court \nheld that police were allowed to ask bus passengers permission to \nsearch their bags without explaining that passengers have the right to \nsay no.\n  Just as I was with Judge Reade's answers, I was conflicted about this \none. I believe in privacy rights, but I also believe, in this post-9/11 \nworld, police have to have some legitimate tools at their disposal to \nfight both crime and terrorism. So while I may not agree or disagree at \nthis point with the answer, I was pleased to hear that if this nominee \nbecomes a judge, this nominee will be sensitive to citizens' privacy \nrights.\n  I do not doubt that Judge Reade and the other nominees who have named \nSupreme Court cases with which they disagree will faithfully follow the \nlaw despite their disagreements. These are mainstream judges who have \nconservative but not extreme ideologies. I respect them. I have voted, \nas have almost all of my colleagues, for 99 percent--or some number \nlike that--of them so far. And I will continue to vote for them as long \nas I believe they will not be activists or extremists on the bench.\n  We are simply trying to hold Mr. Estrada to the same set of standards \nthat other nominees are meeting. We are asking even less of him than \nRepublicans asked of President Clinton's nominees. It is obvious these \nare fair, reasonable, and legitimate questions. It is obvious there is \nnothing wrong, constitutionally or by the canons of ethics or anything \nelse, with answering them because hundreds of nominees have and they \nhave been approved by this body. It is also obvious that Mr. Estrada is \nstonewalling us by refusing to tell us what he thinks.\n\n  So these two areas that I have had a chance to discuss today--whether \nopposition to Mr. Estrada can legitimately be labeled anti-Hispanic in \nany way, and whether it is fair to answer questions--again, are both \npervaded by a double standard. It seems what folks on the other side of \nthe aisle were saying 2 years ago they are not saying today.\n  I hope we will be somewhat consistent. I hope we will be somewhat \nfair. The nomination of judges, and then the advice and consent the \nSenate gives them, is a sacred process, one that the Founding Fathers \ndebated long and hard. To ridicule the process by saying there are not \nlegitimate questions to be asked and answered, to ridicule the process \nby saying that when those questions are not answered someone is \nopposing a nominee because of his background, particularly when so many \nof those opposing this nominee have had great records in terms of \nbringing Hispanics to the bench--far better than President Bush or \nthose on the other side of the aisle--is unfair, is unwise, and demeans \nthis body. I hope it will end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise and speak on \nbehalf of Miguel Estrada, a fellow Virginian and President Bush's \nnominee to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia.\n  I have been listening to the Senator from New York and listening to \nhis description of what is fair and reasonable. I do find it \ninteresting that the Senator, on several occasions, talked about the \nstandards of questions that were propounded in years past by Senator \nAshcroft.\n  If Senator Ashcroft was such a wonderful model for questioning and \njudicial standards, I do find it interesting that that same Senator \nfrom New York, when given an opportunity to vote for Senator Ashcroft \nto be Attorney General, voted against him. So we do see some \ninconsistencies on citing Senator Ashcroft and then not voting for him.\n  Let's focus on this situation and the nomination before this body: \nMiguel Estrada. Miguel Estrada is a highly qualified nominee to be a \njudge. He has impeccable character. People always look at the character \nof an individual to determine how that person will act when put in a \nposition of responsibility. One way to judge is by their past \nperformance.\n  Some will say that Miguel Estrada does not have judicial experience. \nThere are others who have been appointed to the courts who do not have \njudicial experience. So then you try to determine their judicial \nphilosophy. I am convinced, in my examination of Miguel Estrada, that \nhe has the right judicial philosophy. I am confident that when Miguel \nEstrada puts on that robe and is appointed for life, he will understand \nthat judges are to interpret the law, not to make the law, which is the \nresponsibility of the legislative branch. I am very confident that as a \njudge on the DC Court of Appeals, Miguel Estrada will adhere to this \nprinciple.\n\n  Others have said that since he has not been a judge, how are we going \nto know about his temperament. There are not many Latino or Hispanic \nAmericans who serve on the federal courts. By arguing that he has not \nhad judicial experience, and therefore, he cannot serve, implicitly \nwould make it very difficult, if nearly impossible, for many Hispanic \nAmericans to serve on the federal bench.\n  Miguel Estrada has justifiably been called the personification of the \nAmerican dream. He was born in Honduras and immigrated to the United \nStates when he was a teenager at the age 17. He learned English as a \nsecond language and then went on and ultimately graduated with honors--\nmagna cum laude from Columbia College and magna cum laude from Harvard \nLaw School. He was even a member of the editorial board of the Harvard \nLaw Review.\n  Mr. Estrada went on to serve as a law clerk on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit and also served as the Assistant to the \nSolicitor General of the United States. During his legal career, Miguel \nEstrada argued 15 cases in the Supreme Court of the United States, \nwinning two-thirds of those cases.\n  Miguel Estrada has also performed significant pro bono service, or \nfree legal services, including representation of a Virginia death row \ninmate before the U.S. Supreme Court, to which Miguel Estrada dedicated \napproximately 400 hours of time.\n  We previously heard from the Senator from New York that he wanted to \ndetermine whether Miguel Estrada had mainstream judicial values or had \na\n\n[[Page S2108]]\n\nmainstream view of the role of the courts in various cases, stare \ndecisis, and precedent.\n  Miguel Estrada has unanimously earned the highest rating of ``well \nqualified'' from the American Bar Association. The American Bar \nAssociation's rating is based on ``integrity, professional competence \nand judicial temperament.''\n  In addition, Miguel Estrada's nomination is strongly supported by the \nHispanic National Bar Association; the League of United Latin American \nCitizens, LULAC, which is the nation's oldest and largest Hispanic \ncivil rights organization; the United States Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce; and the Hispanic Business Roundtable.\n  Miguel Estrada is also supported by these other mainstream \norganizations: The Latino Coalition; the National Association for Small \nDisadvantaged Businesses; the Mexican American Grocers Association; the \nHispanic Chambers of Commerce from a variety of towns and cities across \nthe country, including the Greater Kansas City area and Las Cruces; the \nPuerto Rican American Foundations; the Federation of Mayors of Puerto \nRico; the Hispanic Engineers Business Corporation; the Association for \nthe Advancement of Mexican Americans; Nueva Esperanza; the Hispanic \nEngineers Business Corporation, the Hispanic Contractors of America, \nthe Cuban Liberty Council, the Cuban American Voters National \nCommunity, and the Cuban American National Foundation.\n  This is a broad spectrum of individuals, organizations and \nassociations from a variety of backgrounds and enterprises from all \nacross the country which are very much a part of the mainstream of \nAmerica which support Miguel Estrada.\n  I believe the Senate's prompt action on Mr. Estrada's long-delayed \nnomination is especially important. The DC Court of Appeals is one of \nthe most important courts of appeal in the entire country, with cases \nof national implication. It is a primary forum for determining the \nlegality of federal regulations and laws that control vast areas of \nAmerican life. Recent retirements have left this court slowed down with \nfour vacancies--four vacancies which are hindering the court's ability \nto decide cases expeditiously.\n  Delays in administration of justice in the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals have consequences that can cost millions of dollars and affect \nthousands of lives. Indeed, justice delayed is justice denied.\n  The senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, said on this \nfloor, at approximately 2:37 p.m., that he was concerned about the \nprocess of the Miguel Estrada nomination. I will express my concerns \nabout the process.\n  Today there is a crisis in our courts, as too many federal courts \nlack a sufficient number of judges, especially the DC Court of Appeals, \nwhich has four of their 12 judgeships vacant. That means 33 percent of \nthe DC Court of Appeals has vacancies in those seats.\n  What Senator Hatch and I want is fair consideration and confirmation \nof the President's well-qualified and diverse judicial nominees. While \nmany on the other side may work to hijack the nominations process to \nscore partisan political points or obstruct fair consideration, this \nnomination deserves a vote. It has deserved a vote for a long time.\n  This nomination has been pending since May 9, 2001. That is over 20 \nmonths ago. A hearing was not even held for Miguel Estrada until \nSeptember of 2002.\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to fill these vacancies--\nparticularly this vacancy on the DC Circuit Court--and vote to confirm \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Look at the record. You will find that Miguel Estrada is superbly \nqualified to serve on the DC Circuit. Indeed, Miguel Estrada is an \nAmerican success story, with exemplary credentials and qualifications. \nHispanic Americans will rejoice in his success, as indeed all Americans \nwill rejoice and applaud his success.\n  I join my Latino constituents in saying: Sigamos adelante con Miguel \nEstrada. Let us move forward with Miguel Estrada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, an independent Federal judiciary is a \nfundamental part of our constitutional democracy. In fact, nominating \njudges to the Federal bench is among the most important and lasting \ndecisions that a President can make. Equally important is the Senate's \nrole of advice and consent on judicial nominations. Breakdowns in the \nnomination and confirmation process can impact not only the proper \nfunctioning of the judicial branch but the independence which is so \ncritical to maintaining public confidence in the courts.\n  It is the President's responsibility to work with Senators of both \nparties to fill vacancies on the Federal courts. It is the duty, the \nconstitutional duty of the Senate to carefully deliberate over the \nPresident's nominees.\n  Nobody can challenge the President's authority to nominate judges. It \nis indisputable. That the Senate has the right to advice and consent is \nequally indisputable. The two rights exist in the very same sentence of \nthe Constitution.\n  That is why the administration's repeated failure to consult with \nDemocratic Senators on the nomination of Federal judges is so \ntroubling. Refusal by a nominee to provide the Senate with adequate \ninformation to evaluate their record undermines our ability to carry \nout our constitutionally mandated duties.\n  It is this latter point, the lack of information provided by a \nnominee to evaluate their record, which is particularly relevant to the \nnominee currently under consideration, Miguel Estrada. Mr. Estrada is \nnominated for a lifetime appointment on what is arguably the second \nhighest court in the land. The DC Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction \nover a broad range of cases, including issues from consumer and \nenvironmental protection to civil rights and workplace rules. The \ncourt's jurisdiction is vast.\n  The DC Circuit has the obligation to interpret rules for access to \ncourts which allow Americans to challenge the Government when any \nagency takes an action which affects their health. It is this circuit \nwhich is charged with protecting Americans to challenge the Government. \nIt is this DC Circuit that has either concurrent jurisdiction or \nexclusive jurisdiction in cases involving the NLRB, OSHA, Federal \nCommunications Commission, Americans with Disabilities Act, Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, Federal Elections Commission, Endangered \nSpecies Act, and the Environmental Protection Agency, just to name a \nfew.\n  The judges on this court are widely viewed as potential nominees to \nthe Supreme Court. In fact, three current members of the Supreme \nCourt--Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Ginsberg--served on the DC Circuit.\n  Despite the importance of the issues that routinely come before the \ncourt, we have very little information about the current nominee's \nviews on fundamental constitutional issues. Mr. Estrada has no judicial \nexperience so we have no record of decisions from which to draw an \nimpression of his judicial philosophy. Mr. Estrada is not widely \npublished. He has apparently not published since he wrote an article on \nbanking law in law school. It is not a disqualification if a person has \nno judicial experience or has not published their views on the law. \nHowever, the lack of a record gives the Senate a particular obligation \nin carrying out our constitutional duty to look at the views of \nsomebody on very fundamental constitutional issues.\n  We have a higher duty, a greater responsibility to probe where there \nis no decision record and where there are no writings upon which to \nbase a judgment. The administration's failure to provide the Senate \nwith legal memoranda and Mr. Estrada's failure to ask the \nadministration to provide the Senate with those memoranda--\nparticularly, again, in light of the absence of a judicial record and \npublications--will make it more difficult for Senators to weigh the \nevidence as to what kind of a judge Mr. Estrada would be, nominated as \nhe is to what, in effect, is the second highest court in the land.\n  There is much evidence from the record before the Judiciary Committee \nas to a failure on the part of Mr. Estrada to give information that is \nhighly relevant to the Senate and to the committee. Senator Leahy \nasked:\n\n       Is diversity a factor that an employer or a school could \n     take into consideration?\n\n  Answer:\n\n\n[[Page S2109]]\n\n\n       Because this is a matter that is being actively litigated \n     in the courts and may come before the court, if I am \n     confirmed, I don't think it would be appropriate generally to \n     answer that question.\n\n  In fact, it is very appropriate generally to answer the question. \nWhat is inappropriate would be to answer that question relative to a \nspecific set of facts that are pending before a court or might come \nbefore a court if Mr. Estrada is confirmed.\n  Senator Kohl asked:\n\n       In light of growing evidence that a substantial number of \n     innocent people have been sentenced to the death penalty, \n     does that provide support in your mind for the two Federal \n     district court judges who have recently struck down the death \n     penalty as unconstitutional?\n\n  Answer:\n\n       I am not familiar with the cases, Senator, but I think it \n     would not be appropriate for me to offer a view on these \n     types of issues which are currently coming in front of the \n     court and may come before me as a judge.\n\n  Not even offer a view on these types of issues--not on the specific \nissues in the cases referred to by Senator Kohl, but these types of \nissues.\n  Senator Kohl says:\n\n       To what extent should a judge be required to balance the \n     public's right to know against the litigant's right to \n     privacy when the information sought could be sealed and could \n     keep secret a public health and safety hazard?\n\n  Mr. Estrada:\n\n       Senator, there is a long line of authority in the DC \n     Circuit, as it happens, dealing with public access in cases \n     that are usually brought to gain access to Government records \n     by news organizations, and those cases, as I recall--I \n     haven't looked at them in some time--do recognize a common \n     law right of access to public records, which must be balanced \n     against the interest of the governmental actor that is \n     asserting the need for confidentiality. I am not aware of any \n     case, though there may be some that dealt with this issue in \n     the context that you've outlined, but I would hesitate to say \n     more than that because I don't know how likely it is that \n     that very issue that you have just outlined would come before \n     me in the DC Circuit if I were fortunate enough to be \n     confirmed.\n\n  So now if he believes there are cases that might come before the DC \nCircuit, he says: I am not going to comment even in general on the \nsubject matter of those cases. But where he doesn't know whether or not \nissues are coming before the DC Circuit, he says: I am not going to \ncomment on that either. Again, he said: I hesitate to say more than \nthat because I don't know how likely it is that that very issue that \nyou have outlined would come before me in the DC Circuit if I am \nconfirmed.\n\n  Either way, he is not going to give us an opinion. Other nominees \nhave provided information of the type that Mr. Estrada will not give \nus. We have the circumstance--for instance, there are multiple cases \nwhere the Justice Department cooperated with past requests of the \nJudiciary Committee. The Senate requested past Justice Departments to \nprovide this type of memoranda, such as memoranda relating to appeals \nwritten by Department attorneys, including the memoranda of William \nBradford Reynolds, nominated for Associate Attorney General; Benjamin \nCiviletti, nominated for Attorney General. Steven Trott, nominated for \nthe Ninth Circuit; and William Rehnquist, when he was nominated for \nChief Justice, among others.\n  The current Bush administration, in fact, provided the Senate with \nlegal memoranda, which Jeffrey Holmstead wrote--an attorney with the \nWhite House counsel's office--when there was an inquiry during the \nconsideration of his nomination to be Assistant Administrator to the \nEPA. So these requests are not unprecedented.\n  The key is, will Mr. Estrada ask the administration to release the \ndocuments? That would give this Senate an opportunity to get his ideas \nabout basic constitutional issues. He is not obligated to request the \nJustice Department to provide this information. We should be clear on \nthat. There is no obligation on the part of Mr. Estrada to request the \nJustice Department to provide the information that I have discussed, \nbut his refusal to do so comes at risk to his nomination.\n  We are not obligated to vote for someone who is not willing to ask \nthe Justice Department to provide information that will give us the \nopportunity to get a better feel for where a nominee is on some basic, \nfundamental constitutional issues.\n  Justice Rehnquist said the following in a 1972 case:\n\n       Since most Justices come to this bench no earlier than \n     their middle years, it would be unusual if they had not by \n     that time formulated at least some tentative notions that \n     would influence them in their interpretation of the sweeping \n     clauses of the Constitution and their interaction with one \n     another. It would be not merely unusual, but extraordinary if \n     they had not at least given opinions as to constitutional \n     issues in their previous legal careers.\n\n  I agree with Justice Rehnquist. Apparently, Mr. Estrada does not.\n\n  When asked by Senator Schumer at the Judiciary Committee hearing to \nname three cases of which he was critical in the last 40 years of \nSupreme Court jurisprudence, Mr. Estrada said he was ``not sure that I \ncould think of three that I would be--that I would have a sort of \nadverse reaction to. . . .''\n  As we have heard from Senator Schumer, other nominees have been more \nthan willing to state where they have not been in agreement with \nSupreme Court opinions. Yet this nominee is not willing to give us even \none Supreme Court opinion in the last 40 years where he would ``have a \nsort of adverse reaction,'' to use his words.\n  He was asked by Senator Durbin to name judges, living or dead, whom \nhe admired and would emulate on the bench.\n  He answered:\n\n       There is no judge, living or dead, whom I would seek to \n     emulate on the bench, whether in terms of judicial philosophy \n     or otherwise.\n\n  Finally, after one particularly unhelpful exchange, Senator Kohl \nseemed to sum up the feeling of many members of the committee when he \ntold Mr. Estrada:\n\n       With all due respect to your answer, I am trying to know \n     more about you, and I am not sure I am.\n\n  That sort of sums it up. With all due respect, we are trying to know \nmore about you, and we are not sure we are able to.\n  Mr. Estrada's failure to provide members of the Judiciary Committee \nwith answers to even the most basic questions on his view of the law is \ndeeply troubling. We don't have writings. There are none. That is not \nhis fault. It does not disqualify him, but there are none. We don't \nhave opinions. That is not his fault. He has never been a judge. There \nare none. But what is his decision? It is not to ask the administration \nfor documents which he wrote that would give us some answers as to \nwhether or not we are in agreement with his fundamental legal \nphilosophy.\n  His tactic of refusing to answer questions could become a standard \nmethod of operation for future nominees, to the detriment of both the \nnominating process and the frustration of the Senate's advice and \nconsent duty, if we accept the standard he is setting forth by his \nrefusal.\n  Mr. Estrada and the administration had the opportunity to make the \ncase for confirmation. The administration chose not to provide \ninformation for Senators to properly evaluate his nomination. Mr. \nEstrada chose to remain silent on key questions despite opportunities \nto clarify his views.\n  Mr. President, I understand from a signal from the Parliamentarian \nthat we are supposed to stop at this time,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is \nscheduled to consider en bloc several nominations at 5 o'clock.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will finish with other views of Mr. Estrada at another \ntime. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2109-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2109-S2113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATIONS OF JOHN R.

Under the previous order, there are 15 minutes \nequally divided for debate on the nominations.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Enzi \nof Wyoming be recognized for up to 10 minutes immediately following the \nfinal vote in the series of votes at 5:15 p.m. to speak on the Estrada \nnomination and that Senator Feingold be accorded at least 10 minutes \nimmediately following Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Am I correct, while \nthere is time divided between the distinguished chairman and myself \nprior to these votes, there will be three separate votes, and have the \nyeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to request the \nyeas and nays on all three nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on all three nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask my dear friend if it is possible to \nvote on all three en bloc, with one vote being considered three \nseparate votes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in answer to that question, to accommodate \na number of Senators on the distinguished chairman's side of the aisle, \nat the time I was chairman, I tried doing that once, and the objection \nwas so vociferous from both sides that I said I was never going to try \nthat again. I would have no objection. I have tried to do that. I have \nbeen told there are many who feel that would be inappropriate, so we \nwill not be able to do it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, these are three excellent district court \nnominees. They deserve to be confirmed, as I think all of President \nBush's nominees deserve to be confirmed. I recommend every Senator vote \nfor each of these three nominees. I hope we can get other nominees to \nthe floor as soon as possible as well.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side for being willing to move to \nthese three nominees last week in our markup and to allow them to be \nbrought up this early. I believe we will all be pleased we can vote for \nsuch excellent nominees. I hope we can move all the other judgeship \nnominees this President has nominated as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we will vote on three judges. Let me \nmention them briefly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time. I may have a few \npeople who wish to speak. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of John Adams to the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Ohio. Judge Adams, incidentally, is named to \nreplace Judge George Washington White, so we have the historical \ncircumstance of another John Adams following another George Washington.\n  Judge Adams has had an admirable career as an attorney and a judge. \nHe has worked in private practice and served as a prosecutor. He has \nhandled civil matters as well as criminal, and he has devoted a \nsignificant amount of time to issues beyond his law practice. As a \njudge, Mr. Adams has been a member of the Summit County Civil Justice \nCommission, whose goal is to institute reforms in the administration of \ncivil justice in Summit County, and the Summit County Criminal Justice \nCoordination Council, whose goal is to make recommendations and oversee \nthe operations of the criminal justice system and corrections in Summit \nCounty. He is also involved in the Ohio Community Corrections \nOrganization, which tries to work together to develop, improve, expand, \nand promote adult and juvenile community corrections by bringing \njudges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement officials, \ntreatment providers and other parties together to work toward common \ngoals of community intervention for offenders.\n  Judge Adams has been involved in a number of other charitable, civic \nand professional organizations. He is a life member of the NAACP. He \nhas also served as a member of, among others, the following \norganizations: the Summit County Mental Health Association, part of a \nnetwork of professionals and volunteers committed to improving \nAmerica's mental health and seeking victory over mental illness. His is \nthe sort of solid record of accomplishments, and not ideology, that the \nPresident should try and seek out in his future federal court nominees.\n  I congratulate Judge Adams and his family and friends on his \nconfirmation.\n  Today the Senate will also vote on the confirmation of Robert Junell, \nnominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. \nHis will be the eighth of President Bush's district court judges \nconfirmed to serve in the State of Texas. Seven of those judges were \ngiven hearings and votes during the 17 months I served as chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. That was nearly one judge for Texas every \nother month, in addition to the four United States Attorneys and three \nUnited States Marshals who were reviewed and confirmed in that period \nof time.\n  This is in great contrast to the fate of many of President Clinton's \nnominees from Texas, who were blocked and delayed by the Republican \nmajority, including Enrique Moreno, nominated to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals who never got a hearing, never got a vote; Jorge \nRangel, nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals who never got a \nhearing, never got a vote, and; Hilda Tagle to the District Court, \nwhose confirmation was delayed nearly two years for no good reason.\n  So I am glad to see another judge appointed to the Texas bench, and \nam confident he will serve with more distinction than at least one of \nhis future colleagues, Judge Ron Clark. Judge Clark, a personal friend \nof the President's was among the judges we confirmed last year to a \ndistrict court seat in Texas. Judge Clark's commission was not \nimmediately forthcoming from the White House. We learned that Mr. Clark \nwas quoted as saying that he had asked the White House to delay signing \nhis commission while he ran for political office as a Republican so \nthat he could help Republicans keep a majority in the Texas State House \nuntil the end of the session in mid-2003. The White House was \napparently complicit in these unethical partisan actions by a person \nconfirmed to the federal bench. Clark, who was confirmed to a seat on \nthe federal district court in Texas, was actively campaigning for \nelection despite his confirmation.\n  These actions brought discredit to the court to which Mr. Clark was \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and call into \nquestion Judge Clark's ability to put aside his partisan roots and be \nan impartial adjudicator of cases. Even in his answers under oath to \nthis Committee, he swore that if he were ``confirmed'' he would follow \nthe ethical rules. Canon 1 of the Code of Conduct for United States \nJudges explicitly provides that the Code applies to ``judges and \nnominees for judicial office'' and Canon 7 provides quite clearly that \npartisan political activity is contrary to ethical rules. In his \nanswers to me, Mr. Clark promised ``[s]hould I be confirmed as a judge, \nmy role will be different than that of a legislator.'' Yet, even after \nhis confirmation he was flaunting the promises he made to me, to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and to the Senate as a whole. That the White \nHouse was prepared to go along with these shenanigans reveals quite \nclearly the political way they approach judicial nominations.\n  Only after the New York Times reported these unseemly actions, did \nthe President sign Judge Clark's appointment papers. Judge Clark then \nannounced that he would stop ``campaigning'', but he insisted on \nreminding State voters that they still had a choice in the election in \nNovember. His\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nname remained on the ballot. And indeed, he was elected to his old seat \nin the Texas Legislature.\n  I trust that Mr. Junell, who comes highly recommended by \nRepresentative Charlie Stenholm of Texas, and who has also been a \nmember of the Texas House of Representatives, has a better \nunderstanding of the proper role of a Federal judge than did Mr. Clark, \nand will serve the people of the Western District of Texas with \ndistinction. Mr. Junell has certainly worked hard during his varied \ncareer as a litigator and a politician to help numerous disadvantaged \nindividuals. A life member of the NAACP, Mr. Junell is also a former \nmember of the board of directors of the La Esperanza clinic.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation.\n  With today's confirmation of Judge S. James Otero to be a United \nStates District Judge for the Central District of California, the \nSenate is filling a vacancy that by all rights could have been filled \nyears ago. Judge Otero, now serving on the Los Angeles Superior Court, \nwill be filling a seat left open on the elevation of Judge Richard Paez \nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2000. Judge Paez, of course, \nwas nominated to that vacancy on the appellate court more than 4 years \nbefore he was confirmed.\n  Judge Otero's nomination is a good example of the kinds of bi-\npartisan candidates the President ought to be sending the Senate. He \ncomes to us after being unanimously approved by California's bipartisan \nJudicial Advisory Committee--a committee established through an \nagreement Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer reached with the White \nHouse. This committee works to take the politics out of judicial \nnominations. It reviews qualified, consensus nominees who will serve on \nthe Federal judiciary with distinction. Too often in the last 2 years \nwe have seen the recommendations of such bipartisan panels rejected or \nstalled at the White House. Instead, they should be honored and \nencouraged.\n  I note that Judge Otero has contributed strongly to his community, \nworking with and on behalf of Latinos nationally and in California. He \nhas worked on a pro bono project for the Mexican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, and served as a member of the Mexican Bar Association, \nthe Stanford Chicano Alumni Association, and the California Latino \nJudges Association, among others. This stands in stark contrast to a \nnominee such as Miguel Estrada, whose nomination has dominated debate \ntoday. Judge Otero has taken many opportunities to help Hispanics and \nall Californians.\n  During the 17 months I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nworked hard to ensure that Hispanics were confirmed to the Federal \nbench, and I am proud of that record. Many Hispanics nominated by \nPresident Clinton were blocked or delayed by the Republican majority, \nand I did not want to see that repeated. Fine nominees such as Jorge \nRangel, Enrique Moreno and Ricardo Morado were never given hearings. \nOthers, including Judge Richard Paez, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and Judge \nHilda Tagle, were stalled for no good reason. I am proud that did not \nhappen on my watch, I am glad to say that we quickly considered and \nconfirmed nominees such as Christina Armijo to the District Court in \nNew Mexico, Philip Martinez to the District Court in Texas, Jose \nMartinez to the District Court in Florida, Alia Ludlum to the District \nCourt in Texas, and Jose Linares to the District Court in New Jersey.\n  I congratulate Judge Otero and his family on his confirmation and the \npeople of California on a fine Federal judge to fill the seat of such \nJudge Richard Paez in the Central District.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as she may consume to Senator Hutchison \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how many minutes remain for Senator \nHatch?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the Presiding Officer to notify me at 3 \nminutes.\n  Madam President, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of someone who \nI really know well and have a great deal of confidence in, and that is \nState Representative Rob Junell. Rob is being nominated, and hopefully \nconfirmed today, to be the U.S. district judge for the Western District \nof Texas. He will reside in Midland.\n  This is a very important court. It has been designated as a judicial \nemergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  Rob is a native of West Texas and is currently of counsel to a San \nAngelo law firm. He served seven terms in the Texas legislature where \nhe was chairman of the Appropriations and Budget Committees. I worked \nwith him to try to make sure Texas had a limitation on State debt, and \nit was because of Robert Junell's absolute insistence we pass this \nlegislation that we were able to do it in one session, and it has \nserved my State of Texas well to have a limit on State debt. Rob Junell \ndeserves credit for that.\n  Rob Junell earned a degree from the New Mexico Military Institute and \nfrom Texas Tech University. He also graduated from the University of \nArkansas with a master's degree in political science and a law degree \nwith honors from Texas Tech Law School.\n  Rob Junell has been a leader in the State of Texas. I have worked \nwith him in many ways. I think he is one of the smartest people with \nwhom I have ever worked. He also took time to be a part of his \ncommunity of San Angelo. He served on the boards of the United Way of \nConcho Valley and the San Angelo AIDS Foundation. He is a lifetime \nmember of the NAACP. He meets the high standards we set for Federal \njudges. I know he is going to be a really terrific Federal judge, \nbecause he knows the law and he knows what is fair. He has that sense \nabout him of what is right and what is not. He also knows the place of \na judge. Having been a legislator, he knows it is the elected \nrepresentatives who should make law, not judges with lifetime \nappointments. So he will change his course now from being a legislator, \nelected by the people, and making very important laws for my State of \nTexas, to becoming a judge and interpreting those laws and trying to \nsee what the legislature meant.\n  It is my honor to speak on behalf of Rob Junell and recommend him to \nmy colleagues in the Senate for confirmation.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Hatch, and the ranking member, Senator \nLeahy, for acting expeditiously on this nomination, and I especially \nthank Senator Hatch for reserving time for me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge John Adams. Judge Adams, from Akron, has been nominated to be \nU.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio. He currently \nserves as a Judge on the Court of Common Pleas in Summit County, Ohio.\n  Judge Adams is a 1978 graduate of Bowling Green State University, \nwhere he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Education. In 1983, he \nreceived his law degree from the University of Akron School of Law. \nWhile a law student at Akron, Judge Adams clerked for Judge W.F. Spicer \nwith the Summit County Court of Common Pleas.\n  Following this clerkship, Judge Adams spent 5 years in private \npractice with the law firm of Germano, Rondy, Ciccolini Co., and during \nthis time, also served as Assistant Summit County Prosecutor. In 1989, \nJudge Adams returned to private practice as an associate and then a \npartner at the firm of Kauffman & Kauffman in Akron.\n  Since 1999, Judge Adams has served as a Judge on the Court of Common \nPleas for Summit County. In this position, Judge Adams has demonstrated \nthat he is an intelligent, hard working, and dedicated jurist. He is \nwell respected, both inside the courtroom and out, and exhibits an \nexcellent judicial temperament. He has shown that he has what it takes \nto be an excellent District Court Judge.\n  In endorsing his re-election effort last November, the Akron Beacon \nJournal stated that Judge Adams ``has the potential to be a \ndistinguished federal judge, building on the record of fairness and \nthoughtfulness that has marked his three years on the county bench.'' I \nagree completely with that sentiment.\n  Judge Adams' accomplishments are indeed impressive, and I am pleased\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\nthat the Senate is voting on his nomination today. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in voting to confirm Judge Adams.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased that we have three excellent \ndistrict court nominees on the floor this evening, John Adams for the \nNorthern District of Ohio, Robert Junell for the Western District of \nTexas, and Judge Samuel Otero for the Central District of California. \nThey have been nominated to fill seats considered judicial emergencies \nby the U.S. Judicial Conference, so our action today is especially \nimportant. I support all of them without any reservation, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in confirming their nominations. Let me say a few \nwords about each nominee.\n  John Adams, Jr., our nominee to the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Ohio, has extensive experience in both the private \nand public sectors of the legal community. Judge Adams has 15 years of \nexperience in private practice, and he served for 3 years as an \nassistant county prosecutor at the Summit County Prosecutor's Office. \nSince 1999, Judge Adams has served on the Court of Common Pleas for \nSummit County.\n  Robert A. Junell, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Texas, has distinguished himself both as an \nadvocate and a legislator. Mr. Junell has over 25 years of civil \nlitigation experience, with a specialty in personal injury law, and he \nhas served as a member of the Texas House of Representatives since \n1988.\n  Our third nominee, Judge Samuel Otero, who has been nominated for the \nCentral District of California, served as a Los Angeles deputy city \nattorney for 10 years, handling approximately 130 superior court and \nmunicipal court cases during his tenure. Since being nominated to the \nCalifornia bench in 1988, Judge Otero has served on both the Los \nAngeles Superior and Municipal Courts.\n  I am confident that all three nominees will serve with honor and \ndistinction. I compliment the President for putting their nominations \nforward and I look forward to their confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the time is running, but I ask the distinguished \nSenator from Utah if he would ask the majority leader if we could have \n10-minute votes after this first vote which is 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that after the first vote, the two \nremaining votes be no longer than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof John Adams, of Ohio, to be United States district judge for the \nNorthern District of Ohio.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Under the previous order, there are 15 minutes \nequally divided for debate on the nominations.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Enzi \nof Wyoming be recognized for up to 10 minutes immediately following the \nfinal vote in the series of votes at 5:15 p.m. to speak on the Estrada \nnomination and that Senator Feingold be accorded at least 10 minutes \nimmediately following Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to request the \nyeas and nays on all three nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on all three nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask my dear friend if it is possible to \nvote on all three en bloc, with one vote being considered three \nseparate votes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in answer to that question, to accommodate \na number of Senators on the distinguished chairman's side of the aisle, \nat the time I was chairman, I tried doing that once, and the objection \nwas so vociferous from both sides that I said I was never going to try \nthat again. I would have no objection. I have tried to do that. I have \nbeen told there are many who feel that would be inappropriate, so we \nwill not be able to do it.\n  Mr. HATCH. I withdraw the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, these are three excellent district court \nnominees. They deserve to be confirmed, as I think all of President \nBush's nominees deserve to be confirmed. I recommend every Senator vote \nfor each of these three nominees. I hope we can get other nominees to \nthe floor as soon as possible as well.\n  I thank my colleagues on the other side for being willing to move to \nthese three nominees last week in our markup and to allow them to be \nbrought up this early. I believe we will all be pleased we can vote for \nsuch excellent nominees. I hope we can move all the other judgeship \nnominees this President has nominated as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we will vote on three judges. Let me \nmention them briefly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I reserve the remainder of my time. I may have a few \npeople who wish to speak. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate will vote on the \nconfirmation of John Adams to the United States District Court for the \nNorthern District of Ohio. Judge Adams, incidentally, is named to \nreplace Judge George Washington White, so we have the historical \ncircumstance of another John Adams following another George Washington.\n  Judge Adams has had an admirable career as an attorney and a judge. \nHe has worked in private practice and served as a prosecutor. He has \nhandled civil matters as well as criminal, and he has devoted a \nsignificant amount of time to issues beyond his law practice. As a \njudge, Mr. Adams has been a member of the Summit County Civil Justice \nCommission, whose goal is to institute reforms in the administration of \ncivil justice in Summit County, and the Summit County Criminal Justice \nCoordination Council, whose goal is to make recommendations and oversee \nthe operations of the criminal justice system and corrections in Summit \nCounty. He is also involved in the Ohio Community Corrections \nOrganization, which tries to work together to develop, improve, expand, \nand promote adult and juvenile community corrections by bringing \njudges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, law enforcement officials, \ntreatment providers and other parties together to work toward common \ngoals of community intervention for offenders.\n  Judge Adams has been involved in a number of other charitable, civic \nand professional organizations. He is a life member of the NAACP. He \nhas also served as a member of, among others, the following \norganizations: the Summit County Mental Health Association, part of a \nnetwork of professionals and volunteers committed to improving \nAmerica's mental health and seeking victory over mental illness. His is \nthe sort of solid record of accomplishments, and not ideology, that the \nPresident should try and seek out in his future federal court nominees.\n  I congratulate Judge Adams and his family and friends on his \nconfirmation.\n  Today the Senate will also vote on the confirmation of Robert Junell, \nnominated to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. \nHis will be the eighth of President Bush's district court judges \nconfirmed to serve in the State of Texas. Seven of those judges were \ngiven hearings and votes during the 17 months I served as chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee. That was nearly one judge for Texas every \nother month, in addition to the four United States Attorneys and three \nUnited States Marshals who were reviewed and confirmed in that period \nof time.\n  This is in great contrast to the fate of many of President Clinton's \nnominees from Texas, who were blocked and delayed by the Republican \nmajority, including Enrique Moreno, nominated to the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals who never got a hearing, never got a vote; Jorge \nRangel, nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals who never got a \nhearing, never got a vote, and; Hilda Tagle to the District Court, \nwhose confirmation was delayed nearly two years for no good reason.\n  So I am glad to see another judge appointed to the Texas bench, and \nam confident he will serve with more distinction than at least one of \nhis future colleagues, Judge Ron Clark. Judge Clark, a personal friend \nof the President's was among the judges we confirmed last year to a \ndistrict court seat in Texas. Judge Clark's commission was not \nimmediately forthcoming from the White House. We learned that Mr. Clark \nwas quoted as saying that he had asked the White House to delay signing \nhis commission while he ran for political office as a Republican so \nthat he could help Republicans keep a majority in the Texas State House \nuntil the end of the session in mid-2003. The White House was \napparently complicit in these unethical partisan actions by a person \nconfirmed to the federal bench. Clark, who was confirmed to a seat on \nthe federal district court in Texas, was actively campaigning for \nelection despite his confirmation.\n  These actions brought discredit to the court to which Mr. Clark was \nnominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, and call into \nquestion Judge Clark's ability to put aside his partisan roots and be \nan impartial adjudicator of cases. Even in his answers under oath to \nthis Committee, he swore that if he were ``confirmed'' he would follow \nthe ethical rules. Canon 1 of the Code of Conduct for United States \nJudges explicitly provides that the Code applies to ``judges and \nnominees for judicial office'' and Canon 7 provides quite clearly that \npartisan political activity is contrary to ethical rules. In his \nanswers to me, Mr. Clark promised ``[s]hould I be confirmed as a judge, \nmy role will be different than that of a legislator.'' Yet, even after \nhis confirmation he was flaunting the promises he made to me, to the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and to the Senate as a whole. That the White \nHouse was prepared to go along with these shenanigans reveals quite \nclearly the political way they approach judicial nominations.\n  Only after the New York Times reported these unseemly actions, did \nthe President sign Judge Clark's appointment papers. Judge Clark then \nannounced that he would stop ``campaigning'', but he insisted on \nreminding State voters that they still had a choice in the election in \nNovember. His\n\n[[Page S2111]]\n\nname remained on the ballot. And indeed, he was elected to his old seat \nin the Texas Legislature.\n  I trust that Mr. Junell, who comes highly recommended by \nRepresentative Charlie Stenholm of Texas, and who has also been a \nmember of the Texas House of Representatives, has a better \nunderstanding of the proper role of a Federal judge than did Mr. Clark, \nand will serve the people of the Western District of Texas with \ndistinction. Mr. Junell has certainly worked hard during his varied \ncareer as a litigator and a politician to help numerous disadvantaged \nindividuals. A life member of the NAACP, Mr. Junell is also a former \nmember of the board of directors of the La Esperanza clinic.\n  I congratulate the nominee and his family on his confirmation.\n  With today's confirmation of Judge S. James Otero to be a United \nStates District Judge for the Central District of California, the \nSenate is filling a vacancy that by all rights could have been filled \nyears ago. Judge Otero, now serving on the Los Angeles Superior Court, \nwill be filling a seat left open on the elevation of Judge Richard Paez \nto the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2000. Judge Paez, of course, \nwas nominated to that vacancy on the appellate court more than 4 years \nbefore he was confirmed.\n  Judge Otero's nomination is a good example of the kinds of bi-\npartisan candidates the President ought to be sending the Senate. He \ncomes to us after being unanimously approved by California's bipartisan \nJudicial Advisory Committee--a committee established through an \nagreement Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer reached with the White \nHouse. This committee works to take the politics out of judicial \nnominations. It reviews qualified, consensus nominees who will serve on \nthe Federal judiciary with distinction. Too often in the last 2 years \nwe have seen the recommendations of such bipartisan panels rejected or \nstalled at the White House. Instead, they should be honored and \nencouraged.\n  I note that Judge Otero has contributed strongly to his community, \nworking with and on behalf of Latinos nationally and in California. He \nhas worked on a pro bono project for the Mexican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund, and served as a member of the Mexican Bar Association, \nthe Stanford Chicano Alumni Association, and the California Latino \nJudges Association, among others. This stands in stark contrast to a \nnominee such as Miguel Estrada, whose nomination has dominated debate \ntoday. Judge Otero has taken many opportunities to help Hispanics and \nall Californians.\n  During the 17 months I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I \nworked hard to ensure that Hispanics were confirmed to the Federal \nbench, and I am proud of that record. Many Hispanics nominated by \nPresident Clinton were blocked or delayed by the Republican majority, \nand I did not want to see that repeated. Fine nominees such as Jorge \nRangel, Enrique Moreno and Ricardo Morado were never given hearings. \nOthers, including Judge Richard Paez, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and Judge \nHilda Tagle, were stalled for no good reason. I am proud that did not \nhappen on my watch, I am glad to say that we quickly considered and \nconfirmed nominees such as Christina Armijo to the District Court in \nNew Mexico, Philip Martinez to the District Court in Texas, Jose \nMartinez to the District Court in Florida, Alia Ludlum to the District \nCourt in Texas, and Jose Linares to the District Court in New Jersey.\n  I congratulate Judge Otero and his family on his confirmation and the \npeople of California on a fine Federal judge to fill the seat of such \nJudge Richard Paez in the Central District.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield such time as she may consume to Senator Hutchison \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, how many minutes remain for Senator \nHatch?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the Presiding Officer to notify me at 3 \nminutes.\n  Madam President, I am very pleased to speak on behalf of someone who \nI really know well and have a great deal of confidence in, and that is \nState Representative Rob Junell. Rob is being nominated, and hopefully \nconfirmed today, to be the U.S. district judge for the Western District \nof Texas. He will reside in Midland.\n  This is a very important court. It has been designated as a judicial \nemergency by the Judicial Conference of the United States.\n  Rob is a native of West Texas and is currently of counsel to a San \nAngelo law firm. He served seven terms in the Texas legislature where \nhe was chairman of the Appropriations and Budget Committees. I worked \nwith him to try to make sure Texas had a limitation on State debt, and \nit was because of Robert Junell's absolute insistence we pass this \nlegislation that we were able to do it in one session, and it has \nserved my State of Texas well to have a limit on State debt. Rob Junell \ndeserves credit for that.\n  Rob Junell earned a degree from the New Mexico Military Institute and \nfrom Texas Tech University. He also graduated from the University of \nArkansas with a master's degree in political science and a law degree \nwith honors from Texas Tech Law School.\n  Rob Junell has been a leader in the State of Texas. I have worked \nwith him in many ways. I think he is one of the smartest people with \nwhom I have ever worked. He also took time to be a part of his \ncommunity of San Angelo. He served on the boards of the United Way of \nConcho Valley and the San Angelo AIDS Foundation. He is a lifetime \nmember of the NAACP. He meets the high standards we set for Federal \njudges. I know he is going to be a really terrific Federal judge, \nbecause he knows the law and he knows what is fair. He has that sense \nabout him of what is right and what is not. He also knows the place of \na judge. Having been a legislator, he knows it is the elected \nrepresentatives who should make law, not judges with lifetime \nappointments. So he will change his course now from being a legislator, \nelected by the people, and making very important laws for my State of \nTexas, to becoming a judge and interpreting those laws and trying to \nsee what the legislature meant.\n  It is my honor to speak on behalf of Rob Junell and recommend him to \nmy colleagues in the Senate for confirmation.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Hatch, and the ranking member, Senator \nLeahy, for acting expeditiously on this nomination, and I especially \nthank Senator Hatch for reserving time for me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge John Adams. Judge Adams, from Akron, has been nominated to be \nU.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio. He currently \nserves as a Judge on the Court of Common Pleas in Summit County, Ohio.\n  Judge Adams is a 1978 graduate of Bowling Green State University, \nwhere he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Education. In 1983, he \nreceived his law degree from the University of Akron School of Law. \nWhile a law student at Akron, Judge Adams clerked for Judge W.F. Spicer \nwith the Summit County Court of Common Pleas.\n  Following this clerkship, Judge Adams spent 5 years in private \npractice with the law firm of Germano, Rondy, Ciccolini Co., and during \nthis time, also served as Assistant Summit County Prosecutor. In 1989, \nJudge Adams returned to private practice as an associate and then a \npartner at the firm of Kauffman & Kauffman in Akron.\n  Since 1999, Judge Adams has served as a Judge on the Court of Common \nPleas for Summit County. In this position, Judge Adams has demonstrated \nthat he is an intelligent, hard working, and dedicated jurist. He is \nwell respected, both inside the courtroom and out, and exhibits an \nexcellent judicial temperament. He has shown that he has what it takes \nto be an excellent District Court Judge.\n  In endorsing his re-election effort last November, the Akron Beacon \nJournal stated that Judge Adams ``has the potential to be a \ndistinguished federal judge, building on the record of fairness and \nthoughtfulness that has marked his three years on the county bench.'' I \nagree completely with that sentiment.\n  Judge Adams' accomplishments are indeed impressive, and I am pleased\n\n[[Page S2112]]\n\nthat the Senate is voting on his nomination today. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in voting to confirm Judge Adams.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased that we have three excellent \ndistrict court nominees on the floor this evening, John Adams for the \nNorthern District of Ohio, Robert Junell for the Western District of \nTexas, and Judge Samuel Otero for the Central District of California. \nThey have been nominated to fill seats considered judicial emergencies \nby the U.S. Judicial Conference, so our action today is especially \nimportant. I support all of them without any reservation, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in confirming their nominations. Let me say a few \nwords about each nominee.\n  John Adams, Jr., our nominee to the U.S. District Court for the \nNorthern District of Ohio, has extensive experience in both the private \nand public sectors of the legal community. Judge Adams has 15 years of \nexperience in private practice, and he served for 3 years as an \nassistant county prosecutor at the Summit County Prosecutor's Office. \nSince 1999, Judge Adams has served on the Court of Common Pleas for \nSummit County.\n  Robert A. Junell, nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Texas, has distinguished himself both as an \nadvocate and a legislator. Mr. Junell has over 25 years of civil \nlitigation experience, with a specialty in personal injury law, and he \nhas served as a member of the Texas House of Representatives since \n1988.\n  Our third nominee, Judge Samuel Otero, who has been nominated for the \nCentral District of California, served as a Los Angeles deputy city \nattorney for 10 years, handling approximately 130 superior court and \nmunicipal court cases during his tenure. Since being nominated to the \nCalifornia bench in 1988, Judge Otero has served on both the Los \nAngeles Superior and Municipal Courts.\n  I am confident that all three nominees will serve with honor and \ndistinction. I compliment the President for putting their nominations \nforward and I look forward to their confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I know the time is running, but I ask the distinguished \nSenator from Utah if he would ask the majority leader if we could have \n10-minute votes after this first vote which is 15 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that after the first vote, the two \nremaining votes be no longer than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof John Adams, of Ohio, to be United States district judge for the \nNorthern District of Ohio.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n     CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT--Continued\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday \nthere be an additional 6 hours for debate on the Estrada nomination; \nprovided further, that the time be equally divided between the chairman \nand the ranking member, or their designees; and that following the \nconclusion of that time, the Senate proceed to a vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have had a robust debate on the \nnomination. I still remain very hopeful that we will reach a consent to \nhave a vote on the nomination after some further reasonable period of \ntime. I hope our colleagues on the other side will permit a vote on \nMiguel Estrada. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Utah yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. I think the debate \nhas been very constructive today. The chairman of the committee and \nthis Senator spoke with the majority leader today, and we expect some \nmore debate tomorrow. The two leaders will speak tomorrow after the \ncaucuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the Senator is in the Chamber, it is \nmy understanding that Senator Enzi is going to speak for a period of 10 \nminutes and the Senator from Wisconsin will speak for up to 12 minutes. \nI am wondering if there are any other speeches. We have an important \nconference committee that starts at 6:30 tonight.\n  Mr. HATCH. I know of no other speeches.\n  Mr. REID. I do not think we have anyone on our side.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these be the \nlast speeches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Washington, DC, Circuit. \nWe have a great need in our Nation for qualified judges who have the \npatience, perseverance, and integrity to ensure that the United States \ncontinues to be a nation that is ruled by law and not by uncontrolled \nemotion; by reason and not by political expediency.\n  I am confident that Mr. Estrada is that kind of man and will be that \nkind of judge. There is no question that Mr. Estrada is qualified. He \nhas proven himself through his education. He has proven himself through \nhis work experience. And he has proven himself through his own \nperseverance, for he has been forced to wait for almost 2 years--2 \nyears--for the Senate to consider this nomination. He has done this \nwith the kind of patience and integrity that befits a U.S. Federal \njudge.\n  We often talk about the ideal in our debates in the Senate. We hold \nup a picture of what things should look like and how things should be \ndone in the hope that someday we can move our Nation forward to the \npoint where the ideal is more than a dream, but is instead a reality.\n  One of those ideals that has been presented is a world where our \njudges and our courts are more representative of America. Our courts \nhave been accused of being elitist. The Bush administration has been \nworking hard to change that image by making sure our judges are more \ndiverse. By confirming Miguel Estrada to the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals, we will, for the first time, have a Hispanic judge in the DC \nCircuit. But I can tell you, Mr. Estrada was not nominated just because \nhe is Hispanic. He was nominated because he graduated magna cum laude \nand Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree from Columbia University in \n1993. He was nominated because he also graduated magna cum laude from \nHarvard Law School in 1986 where he was also editor of the Law Review. \nHe served as a law clerk for Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, as \na Federal prosecutor in New York, and as an Assistant Solicitor General \nfor both the Bush and Clinton administrations, and as the leading \nappellate lawyer at a national law firm. Altogether, he has argued 15 \ncases before the Supreme Court, including one case in which he \nrepresented a death row inmate pro bono.\n  One will have to search long and hard to find anyone anywhere more \nqualified for a position on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, and yet in \nspite of all of his qualifications and personal integrity, Mr. Estrada \nhas had to wait almost 2 years for the Senate to complete his \nnomination.\n  Why? I must say that as far as I can tell, his confirmation has been \ndelayed for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with his \nqualifications or integrity as a judge. Instead, they have everything \nto do with partisan politics and partisan bickering.\n  What is most tragic about this situation is that these delays have \nnot come without a cost. There are victims in this situation who have \nbeen denied their rights to a fair and impartial judicial process \nbecause there are not enough judges to hear their appeals. The real \nvictims of these delays are not Mr. Estrada or the Bush administration \nor even the Republican Party. No. The real victims are the people whose \nrights have been set aside by partisan bickering and whose appeals are \nforced to wait because we do not have enough judges.\n  There is a saying: Justice delayed is justice denied. There are those \nin Washington who are willing to deny justice by making people with \nvery real needs and very real issues wait while they try to score a few \npoints in this game of politics. They force people seeking justice to \ndrag out their court costs, their attorney's fees, their restitution \nand damage payments, all because they want to get one up on the other \nparty.\n  We have a crisis in our courts that we can solve. Mr. Estrada is part \nof that solution. He was given the highest possible rating of \nunanimously well qualified by the American Bar Association. He has \nsimilar, if not more, experience than five of the eight judges \ncurrently serving in the DC Circuit. He has been praised by his \ncolleagues as having those attributes most sought for in a judge; \nnamely, brilliance, compassion, fairness, and a respect for precedence.\n  It is not only my opinion that is changing. I picked up a copy of \nRoll Call today and found a full-page ad by the Latino Coalition, which \nis a little bit upset over the delay in getting this nomination \napproved. They say the\n\n[[Page S2114]]\n\nonly controversy regarding Miguel Estrada is his race. This is an \nimpression that is being given to America. They say Senators have \nsupported non-Hispanic judicial nominees with fewer qualifications and \nless experience. So the only difference here is that they cannot \nsupport an independent-minded and well-qualified Hispanic, an \nimpression that is being put out there to America.\n  Of course, they give the arguments that he is qualified, that the \nAmerican Bar Association gave him a well-qualified rating, that he does \nhave experience, and that there is a double standard for Hispanics. \nFive of the eight judges currently serving on the DC Circuit had no \nprevious judicial experience when appointed. That includes two of \nPresident Clinton's nominees: Merrick Garland, whose Justice Department \nrecord was quite similar to that of Miguel Estrada, and David Tatel. In \naddition, Judge Harry Edwards had no prior judicial experience when he \nwas nominated by President Carter in 1979, and he was younger and had \nless experience than Estrada.\n  They go on to talk about whether he has a conservative ideology, and \nthey suggest you tell that to Clinton appointees, prominent Democrats, \nand they mention a number of them. Again, this is an impression that is \nout there in the world about what is happening right here and now.\n  They are concerned about the comments they have heard that perhaps he \nis not Hispanic enough, and they are a little upset with that. They \nlisted a number of organizations that are backing him and are getting \nthe message out that here is a person who is well qualified and that \nthere is a belief that there is some discrimination occurring.\n  I hope we can get this rapidly concluded and get this outstanding man \non the bench.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada. Let me take a few minutes to explain why.\n  First, I want to discuss the background of this nomination, which I \nthink is an important factor for the Senator to consider. The DC \nCircuit, to which Mr. Estrada has been nominated, as many people have \nsaid, is widely regarded as the most important Federal circuit. It has \njurisdiction over the actions of most Federal agencies. Many of the \nhighest profile cases that have been decided in recent years by the \nSupreme Court concerning regulation of economic activity by Federal \nagencies in areas such as the environment, health and safety \nregulation, and labor law, went first to the DC Circuit. In the area of \nadministrative law and the interpretation of the major regulatory \nstatutes such as the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the \nOccupational Safety and Health Act, the National Labor Relations Act, \nand even the Federal Election Campaign Act, the DC Circuit is the last \nword, as the Supreme Court accepts relatively few cases on appeal from \nthe circuit courts.\n  The DC Circuit is now evenly split, and has been for some time, \nbetween nominees of Democratic and Republican Presidents. There are \nfour judges who were appointed by Republicans and four by Democrats, \nand there are four vacancies. In the last Congress of President \nClinton's term, he made two nominations that were never acted upon by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. In one case, the committee held a \nhearing but never scheduled a vote, and in another, the Clinton nominee \nwas not even given the courtesy of a hearing.\n  Now we hear that President Bush is not only going to fill those two \nseats, but also two others that Republicans have argued for years did \nnot need to be filled at all because of the court's supposedly smaller \nworkload in comparison to other circuits. I have heard this time and \nagain in the Judiciary committee, we do not need these positions \nfilled. Now that there is a Republican Senate, suddenly they are going \nto be filled. So this nomination becomes a pivotal nomination, and this \ncircuit could very quickly become divided 8 to 4 between Republican \nappointees and Democratic appointees. Again, this is the context where \nPresident Clinton's nominees were not given a chance to have a vote.\n  I am disappointed that the Bush administration has not been willing \nto extend an olive branch on this circuit in particular. There are \nenough vacancies to accommodate both of the pending nominees and the \ntwo nominations by President Clinton who were treated so badly in the \n107th Congress. But that does not seem likely to happen.\n  It is worth mentioning as well that seats on the DC Circuit have also \nin recent years served as springboards for the Supreme Court. Three of \nthe current nine justices on the Supreme Court, Justices Scalia, \nGinsburg, and Thomas, first sat on the DC Circuit.\n  Many commentators and activists, on the right and the left, believe \nthat Mr. Estrada is being groomed for a Supreme Court appointment.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe it is our duty to give this \nnomination very close scrutiny. Unfortunately, Mr. Estrada has not made \nthis task easy. In fact, by failing to answer questions at his hearing \ncandidly and completely, he has made it even more difficult. Unlike \nmany of the circuit court nominees that the Judiciary Committee has \nreviewed so far, Mr. Estrada is not a judge on a lower court, with a \nrecord of judicial opinions that we can review to get an idea of his \nviews and his judicial philosophy for this lifetime appointment. Unlike \nsome of the other nominees we have seen, he is not a law professor, \nwith extensive written work that we can review and about which we can \nask questions. He is a private attorney, with no published writings \nsince law school. The Justice Department has refused to let the \ncommittee see his memos from when he worked in the Solicitor General's \noffice, which may or may not be revealing of his views.\n  This is where we are: we were left with the hearing to explore with \nMr. Estrada directly the question of what kind of judge he would be on \nthe D.C. circuit. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I attended \nmuch of that hearing. Mr. Estrada steadfastly refused to help us get a \nsense of his views. And his way of resisting the committee's legitimate \ninquiry was, in my mind, extraordinary. I have been on that committee \nfor over 8 years and have never quite seen this. He took the position \nthat he could not express an opinion about a case that had already been \ndecided by the Supreme Court unless he took the time to review not only \nthe opinion of the court, which for many would be sufficient, but all \nthe briefs and the arguments of the parties, and also, and I'm quoting \nhere from one of his answers: ``[doing] all the legwork of \ninvestigating every last clue that the briefs and the arguments offer \nup.''\n  Mr. Estrada says he has to do all that just to give his reaction to a \ndecision of the Supreme Court. That is not the type of approach I have \nseen most people take when being up for a nomination in front of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. The result? Mr. Estrada gave us no evidence \nof the kind of judge he would be. For me, given the importance of his \ncircuit and the history of appointments to this circuit, that is a big \nproblem. The Senate has a right to complete and responsive answers to \nits questions before confirming someone to a life term on such an \nimportant court.\n  In a few areas, we have something to go on because Mr. Estrada \nundertook pro bono representation of a group called the Center for \nCommunity Interest on whose board he served. Unfortunately, even though \nthis is one of the few pieces of information we have, I was not \nreassured by what I learned. Mr. Estrada not only defended an anti-\nloitering statute ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court, but on a \nradio program he took a very aggressive stance in dismissing the \narguments made against the statute. He even went so far as to suggest \nthere was something improper about the fact that this legal challenge \nhad been brought, and that attitude carried over in his arguments in a \nchallenge to another anti-loitering ordinance, which Mr. Estrada argued \nthat the NAACP did not have standing to challenge the law.\n  I was also not satisfied with Mr. Estrada's answers to questions \nconcerning his role in helping to screen law clerk applicants for \nJustice Anthony Kennedy of the Supreme Court. Allegations have been \nmade that Mr. Estrada saw himself as an ideological gatekeeper of \nsorts, with the task of\n\n[[Page S2115]]\n\nmaking sure no one was too liberal for his tastes to be a clerk for the \nJustice. After first asserting the comments ascribed to him were meant \nas a joke, Mr. Estrada then gave very careful lawyerly answers to \nfollow-up questions.\n  I cannot say for certain that he was untruthful. I am not saying \nthat. But he certainly was not forthcoming. And this is the pattern \nthroughout the process of trying to examine this nomination of Mr. \nEstrada.\n  Both to this area and in answers to questions concerning specific \ndecisions of the courts or legal principles, I think the Senate has the \nright and duty to demand more openness and responsiveness from someone \nwhose public record is so thin and who has been nominated for such an \nimportant judicial position.\n  Let me be clear, I very much want to be fair about something such as \nthis. I probably would vote to confirm Miguel Estrada to a Federal \ndistrict court judgeship. He has a distinguished academic and \nemployment record. But for this crucial seat on this crucial court, we \nneed to be confident that a nominee, if confirmed, will be fair, \nimpartial, and not devoted to advancing an ideological agenda.\n  Based on the record before us, I do not have that confidence in Mr. \nEstrada.

In the last Congress Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 4, 2000, \nin Grant Town, WV. Arthur ``J.R.'' Carl Warren, Jr., 26, an openly gay \nAfrican-American man, was brutally murdered. The two 17-year-old boys \nwho killed Warren beat him and repeatedly kicked him with steel-toed \nboots. They threw him in a car and drove across town where they beat \nhim further and drove back and forth over his body, ultimately killing \nhim. The attackers were known to describe Warren using racial epithets \nand antigay slurs.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2115-4", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION FOR FARMERS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to \nexpress my concern about yet another implementation foulup at the \nDepartment of Agriculture. Over the past several months, many \ncolleagues and I have been extremely disappointed to find that USDA has \ndeliberately ignored congressional intent in implementing the farm \nbill. Today, I want to point out to my colleagues that this pattern is \nnot limited to the farm bill.\n  Six months ago, we enacted comprehensive trade legislation that gave \nthe President trade promotion authority. In return for this authority, \nthe President embraced an expansion of the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram to help those who suffer ill effects as a result of trade \nagreements. I was extremely pleased that this expansion of Trade \nAdjustment Assistance included legislation I authorized to make the TAA \nprogram work for farmers.\n  When a trade agreement causes manufactured imports to increase, and \nplants close and workers lose their jobs, the workers are eligible for \ncash benefits and retraining under TAA so that they can adjust to this \ndislocation and find new work. But when a trade agreement or change in \nour trade policy results in a flood of agricultural imports that \ncollapse prices and cost farmers tens of thousands of dollars in the \nlost income, farmers could not qualify for assistance because the \nprogram requires that you lose your job. Farmers don't lose their jobs. \nThey still bring in the harvest. But when prices collapse, they can end \nup losing a lot more than income than the manufacturing worker who does \nlose a job. That is unfair, and it is wrong.\n  My TAA for Farmers legislation would fix it to make sure farmers can \nreceive assistance when trade causes their prices and incomes to \ncollapse. The law we passed last year directed USDA to get this program \nup and running by February 3--this past Monday. But just a few days \nago, without any prior warning, USDA informed me that Secretary Veneman \nand her top deputies had ignored the law. They never bothered to direct \nanyone to write the rules to implement TAA for Farmers. USDA is only \nnow getting started on this project, and it will take at least 6 months \nbefore the rules are in place. That means farmers who were hurt by \ntrade last year will not be able to get the assistance to which they \nare entitled under the law. That is just not right.\n  Year in and year out, agriculture is one of the few bright spots in \nour international trade picture. At a time when we are running $400 \nbillion annual trade deficits, agriculture is one of the few sectors to \nshow a trade surplus. Yet too often in trade negotiations our \nagricultural interests have been traded away to get agreement in other \nareas. And the results can be devastating.\n  For example, in North Dakota we have had a bitter experience with the \nCanadian Free Trade Agreement. As a result of defects in that \nagreement, North Dakota wheat and barley growers have been subjected to \na flood of unfairly traded Canadian imports, costing our farmers \nhundreds of millions of dollars in lower prices and lost sales. Not \nsurprisingly, support for trade expansion out in farm country, where it \nought to be stronger than anywhere else, has slipped dramatically. My \nTAA for Farmers legislation is designed to create a safety net to help \nfarmers in this circumstance. My hope is that this legislation will \nalso help rebuild support for trade agreements than can increase our \nagricultural imports.\n  But that certainly won't happen if Secretary Veneman and the USDA \nignore the law and fail to implement the program. So I want to put the \nSecretary on notice that, while I cannot say I am surprised that she \nhas once again failed to come through for farmers, I am certainly \ndisappointed. And I will be watching very closely to make sure that the \ntimetable does not slip again and that the final rule is consistent \nwith congressional intent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2115-5", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2115-S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the observance \nof Black History Month.\n  Dr. Carter Godwin Woodson launched ``Negro History Week'' in 1926 to \ncounter widespread ignorance and distortion about the history of \nAfrican Americans in the United States. In 1976, the week was expanded \nto a month and renamed ``Black History Month.'' February was chosen \nbecause many key dates in black history occur in that month: the \nbirthdays of Fredrick Douglass, W.E.B. Dubouis, Langston Hughes, and \nAbraham Lincoln; the founding of the NAACP; the swearing in of the \nfirst African American Senator, the Honorable Hiram Revels; and passage \nof the 15th amendment to the Constitution proclaiming the right of U.S. \ncitizens to vote regardless of race, color, or previous condition of \nservitude.\n  African-Americans are responsible for rich contributions to the State \nof Wisconsin as well as the entire Nation. I would like to encourage \nall Wisconsin residents to honor Black History Month by utilizing local \nresources such\n\n[[Page S2116]]\n\nas America's Black Holocaust Museum in Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Black \nHistorical Society, and the Milwaukee Art Museum. In addition, numerous \nsites around the State commemorate Underground Railroad activity in \nWisconsin including the Milton House Museum. These sites, as well as \nyour local library, are wonderful resources for learning more about the \ninvaluable contributions of African-American teachers, writers, \nartists, healers, freedom fighters, farmers, businessmen and women, and \nfamilies to the history of our Nation.\n  Many Wisconsin colleges and universities are celebrating African-\nAmerican contributions and heritage this February as well. For example, \nthe University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point is holding the annual Soul \nFood Dinner and Gospel Festival. The University of Wisconsin-Superior \nwill be hosting a visit from author Bakari Kitwana, and the Association \nof Students of African Descent will sponsor performances of African \nAmerican readings, poetry, and music. At the University of Wisconsin-\nMadison, the Wisconsin Black Student Union is sponsoring lectures and \nmovie showings.\n  As stimulating as all this activity in February is, however, we \nshould not relegate the study of black history to just this 1 month. \nFebruary should be, and remain a starting point for a year long and \nlife long exploration of the rich and varied contributions of our \nAfrican-American communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2116-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   RECOGNIZING DR.

Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. William R. \nHarvey as he celebrates his 25th year as the President of Hampton \nUniversity.\n  A native of Brewton, AL, he is a graduate of Southern Normal High \nSchool and Talladega College. After graduating from Talladega College, \nDr. Harvey served 3 years on active duty with the United States Army. \nDuring that time, he served in Europe and the United States. He is \ncurrently a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve. He earned his \ndoctorate in college administration from Harvard University in 1972. \nPrior to assuming his current position, he served as administrative \nvice president at Tuskegee University; administrative assistant to the \npresident of Fisk University; and as assistant for governmental affairs \nto the dean of the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University.\n  President of Hampton University since 1978, Dr. William R. Harvey has \nintroduced innovations that have solidified Hampton University's \nstellar position among the Nation's colleges and universities. His \ninnovative leadership is reflected in the growth and quality of the \nUniversity's students, academic programs, physical facilities and \nfinancial base. During Dr. Harvey's tenure as President, the student \nenrollment at Hampton University has increased from approximately 2,700 \nstudents to over 6,000. Moreover, the SAT scores of entering freshmen \nhave increased approximately 300 points. His commitment to expansion \nand innovation in academic programs has resulted in 45 new academic \nprograms. These new programs, together with existing ones, have placed \nand kept Hampton on the cutting edge of higher education.\n  Dr. Harvey has long been active on the national scene as a result of \nhis appointments to national boards by four United States presidents. \nHe has served on the President's National Advisory Council on \nElementary and Secondary Education, the Defense Advisory Committee on \nWomen in the Service, the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary \nEducation, the Commission on Presidential Scholars, the President's \nAdvisory Board on Historically Black Colleges, and the U.S. Department \nof Commerce Minority Economic Development Advisory Board. Currently, \nDr. Harvey serves as a board member of the First Union National Bank \n(Mid-Atlantic Division--South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, \nVirginia, Washington, D.C., and Maryland); Newport News Shipbuilding, \nInc., and Trigon Blue Cross Blue Shield of Virginia.\n  His achievements have been recognized through inclusion in \nPersonalities of the South, Who's Who in the South and Southwest, Who's \nWho in Black America, Who's Who in American Education, International \nWho's Who of Intellectuals, Two Thousand Notable Americans, Who's Who \nin Business and Finance, and Who's Who in America.\n  I congratulate Dr. Harvey on his accomplishments and wish him \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2116-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nGrants, NM, and the 20th Annual Mount Taylor Winter Quadrathlon. ``The \nUltimate Challenge'' is a great program that encourages tourism and \nhealth in New Mexico.\n  I commend the people of Grants and Cibola County for their initiative \nto promote tourism in New Mexico through conducting the world-renowned \nMount Taylor Winter Quadrathlon. ``The Ultimate Challenge'' is an \ninnovative program which has adapted the traditional Triathlon to the \nvarying terrain of Grants and the surrounding area. Instead of being a \ntraditional Triathlon, which includes biking, running, and swimming, \ncontestants have the opportunity to bike, run, ski and snow-shoe.\n  The Quadrathlon begins in Grants at 6,500 feet and continues all the \nway up Mount Taylor to an elevation of 11,301 feet, and concludes with \na return trek to Grants. This multi-sport event allows those in the \nrace to see the bountiful beauties of New Mexico, from our pristine \ndeserts to our snow-covered mountains.\n  The race, which starts out with a 13-mile bike ride, begins in the \ndesert; as the competition continues up Mount Taylor, the athletes are \nable to see 100 miles from horizon to horizon on a clear day and are \ngiven the opportunity to appreciate why New Mexico is indeed the Land \nof Enchantment.\n  I applaud Grants for being innovative in not only promoting tourism, \nbut also by encouraging healthy lifestyles throughout their community \nand the world. The Quadrathlon, which solicits participants from New \nMexico and across the globe, has improved the lives of many New \nMexicans by giving them healthy goals for which to strive.\n  Grants has fostered a world renowned event by promoting the \nQuadrathlon for the past 20 years. I am proud to recognize Grants and \nthe surrounding community for continually supporting such a beneficial \nevent. On behalf of the Senate and the State of New Mexico, I thank \nthese special New Mexicans for making a difference in our \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2116-3", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING LARRY LAYMAN\n\n Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, today I recognize the Gazette-\nVirginian newspaper in South Boston, Virginia, as it celebrates its \n100th birthday.\n  The Gazette-Virginian is Virginia's ninth largest nondaily newspaper. \nIts predecessor, the South Boston Times, began publication over 114 \nyears ago as a weekly newspaper serving the South Boston area of \nVirginia. In 1903, the\n\n[[Page S2117]]\n\nname was changed to the Halifax-Gazette.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize \nthe U.S. Post Office in Bailey, MS, as it celebrates its 100th year of \nexistence. The Bailey Post Office began its service in December of the \nyear 1902, when John A. Bailey was appointed as the first local \npostmaster by Henry C. Payne, the Postmaster General of the United \nStates. The Bailey Post Office was opened in the already existing \nstructure of the Bailey Grocery and has been serving the Bailey \ncommunity ever since.\n  Since its inception in 1902, the Bailey Post Office has reliably \nserved the people of the city of Bailey and the surrounding area and \ncurrently has two mail routes that cover 700 families in the Bailey \ncommunity. Such longevity can be attributed to the character and work \nethic that Bailey Post Office employees have exhibited over the years, \nbut more than that, it is a tribute to the small town values present in \na place such as Bailey. The fact that Leon Bailey, the grandson of the \nfirst ever Postmaster General in Bailey, still lives in Bailey speaks \nvolumes about the tightly knit community the people of Bailey enjoy. \nDuring the recent centennial celebration, more than 300 members of the \ncommunity gathered to commemorate the occasion.\n  Such a sense of community is rare in today's world, and as such it \nshould be commended. That is why I felt the need to pay tribute to the \ncurrent and past workers of the Bailey Post Office as well as the \ncurrent and past members of the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2117-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT DATED FEBRUARY 2003 WITH THE ANNUAL \n       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR 2003--PM 14\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Joint Economic Committee:\n\n\n                    economic report of the president\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The economy is recovering from the effects of the slowdown that began \nin the middle of 2000 and led to the subsequent recession. The American \neconomy has been hit hard by the events of the past three years, most \ntragically by the effects of the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001. Our economy and investor confidence were hurt when we learned \nthat some corporate leaders were not playing by the rules. The combined \nimpact of these events, along with the three-year decline in stock \nvalues that impacted business investment, slowed growth in 2002. \nDespite these challenges, the economy's underlying fundamentals remain \nsolid--including low inflation, low interest rates, and strong \nproductivity gains. Yet the pace of the expansion has not been \nsatisfactory; there are still too many Americans looking for jobs. We \nwill not be satisfied until every part of our economy is vigorous and \nevery person who wants a job can find one.\n  We are taking action to restore the robust growth that creates jobs. \nIn January, I proposed a growth and jobs plan to add needed momentum to \nour economic recovery. We will accelerate the tax relief already \napproved by Congress and give it to Americans now, when it is most \nneeded. Lowering tax rates and moving more Americans into the lowest \ntax bracket will help our economy grow and create jobs. Faster marriage \ntax relief and a faster increase in the child tax credit will \nespecially help middle-class families, and should take effect now. We \nwill take steps to encourage small business investment, helping them to \nexpand and create jobs. We will end the unfair double taxation of \ncorporate income received by individuals. By putting more money back in \nthe hands of shareholders, strengthening investor confidence in the \nmarket, and encouraging more investment, we will have more growth and \njob creation. These steps will allow Americans to keep more of their \nown money to spend, save, or invest. They will boost the economy, \nensure that the recovery continues, and provide long-term economic \nbenefits through higher productivity and higher incomes.\n  As our economy recovers, we also have an obligation to help Americans \nwho have lost their jobs. That is why we extended the unemployment \npayments for workers who lost their jobs and improved incentives for \ninvestment to create new jobs. I also proposed a bold new program of \nreemployment accounts to help workers searching for jobs.\n  Our commitment to a strong economy does not stop with these important \nsteps. We will continue to strengthen investor confidence in the \nintegrity of our markets. We will develop better ways to train workers \nfor new jobs. We will make the Nation's regulations and tax code less \nonerous and more reflective of the demands of a dynamic economy, and \nexpand opportunities for open trade and stronger growth in all nations, \nespecially for emerging and developing economies.\n  Our Nation's economic progress comes from the innovation and hard \nwork of Americans in a free market that creates opportunities no other \nsystem can offer. Government does not create wealth, but instead \ncreates the economic environment in which risk takers and entrepreneurs \ncreate jobs. with the right policies focused on growth and jobs, strong \neconomic fundamentals--and hard work--I am confident we will extend \neconomic opportunity and prosperity to every corner of America.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to promote elder justice, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 333, the Elder \nJustice Act. Despite the rapid aging of America, few pressing social \nissues have been as systematically ignored as elder abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation.\n  This abuse of our seniors takes many forms. It can be physical, \nsexual, psychological, or financial. The perpetrator may be a stranger, \nan acquaintance, a paid caregiver, a corporation and, far too often, a \nspouse or another family member. Elder abuse happens everywhere--in \npoor, middle-class and upper income households; in cities, suburbs, and \nrural areas. It knows no demographic or geographic boundaries.\n  The cost of such abuse and neglect is high by any measure. The price \nof this abuse is paid in needless human suffering, inflated health care \ncosts, depleted public resources, and the loss of one of our greatest \nnational assets--the wisdom and experience of our elders.\n  With scientific advances and the graying of millions of baby boomers, \nthis year the number of elderly on the planet passed the number of \nchildren for the first time. Although we have made great strides in \npromoting independence, productivity, and quality of life, old age \nstill brings inadequate health care, isolation, impoverishment, abuse, \nand neglect for far too many Americans.\n  Studies conclude that elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation are \nwidely under reported and these abuses significantly shorten the lives \nof older victims. A single episode of mistreatment can tip over an \notherwise independent, productive life, triggering a downward spiral \nthat can result in depression, serious illness, and even death.\n  Too many of our frailest citizens suffer needlessly and cannot simply \nmove away from the abuse. Frequently, they cannot express their wishes \nor suffering. And, even if they can, often they do not, fearing \nretaliation.\n  Congress has passed comprehensive bills to address the ugly truth of \ntwo other types of abuse--child abuse and crimes against women. These \nbills placed these two issues into the national consciousness and \naddressed the issues at a national level.\n  The law created new Federal infrastructure and funding--focusing \nresources, creating accountability, and changing how we think about and \ntreat abuse of women and children. And most\n\n[[Page S2121]]\n\njurisdictions now have established coordinated social service-public \nheath-law enforcement approaches to confront these abuses.\n  But despite dozens of congressional hearings over the past two \ndecades on the devastating effects of elder abuse, neglect and \nexploitation, interest in the subject has waxed and waned, and, to \ndate, no Federal law has been enacted to address this issue in a \ncomprehensive manner. In these hearings, elder abuse was called a \n``disgrace'' and a ``burgeoning national scandal.'' Indeed, we found no \nsingle Federal employee working full time on elder abuse in the entire \nFederal Government.\n  The time has come for Congress to provide seniors a set of \nfundamental protections. That is why, along with Senators Hatch, \nBaucus, Collins, Smith of Oregon, Lincoln, Bond, Nelson of Florida, \nBurns, Rockefeller, Santorum, Landrieu, Jeffords, Harkin, Miller, \nStabenow, and Kohl, I am introducing a bill, the Elder Justice Act, the \nfirst comprehensive Federal effort to address elder abuse in the United \nStates.\n  Our bill will elevate elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation to the \nnational stage in a lasting way. We want to ensure Federal leadership \nto provide resources for services, prevention, and enforcement efforts \nto those on the front lines.\n  A crime is a crime whoever the victim and wherever it occurs. \nCrimes against seniors must be elevated to the level of child abuse and \ncrimes against women.\n\n  It is clear in confronting child abuse and violence against women \nthat the best methods of prevention is two-pronged--through both law \nenforcement and social services. With offices in the Departments of \nHealth and Human Services and Justice, this legislation ensures a \ncombined public health-law enforcement coordination at all levels. In \naddition, because elder abuse and neglect have been virtually absent \nfrom the national research agenda, this bill establishes research \ncenters of excellence, and funds research projects to fuel future \nlegislation.\n  These measures lay the foundation to address, in a meaningful and \nlasting way, a devastating and growing problem that has been invisible \nfor far too long. We can no longer neglect these difficult issues \nafflicting frail and elderly victims.\n  This effort takes numerous steps to prevent and treat elder abuse:\n  It improves prevention and intervention by funding projects to make \nolder Americans safer in their homes, facilities, and neighborhoods, to \nenhance long-term care staffing and to stop financial fraud before the \nmoney goes out the door.\n  It enhances detection by creating forensic centers and developing \nexpertise to enhance detection of the problem.\n  It bolsters treatment by funding efforts to find better ways to \nmitigate the devastating consequences of elder mistreatment.\n  It increases collaboration by requiring ongoing coordination at the \nfederal level, among Federal, State, local and private entities, law \nenforcement, long-term care facilities, consumer advocates and \nfamilies.\n  It aids prosecution by assisting law enforcement and prosecutors to \nensure that those who abuse our Nation's frail elderly will be held \naccountable, wherever the crime occurs and whoever the victim.\n  It helps consumers by creating a resource center for family \ncaregivers and those trying to make decisions about different types of \nlong-term care providers.\n  The importance of defending our right to live free of suffering from \nabuse and neglect does not diminish with age. If we can unlock the \nmysteries of science to live longer, what do we gain if we fail to \nensure Americans live longer with dignity?\n  More and more of us will enjoy longer life in relative health, but \nwith this gift comes the responsibility to prevent the needless \nsuffering too often borne by our frailest citizens.\n  I appreciate the work of my fellow members and a wide array of groups \non behalf of elder justice and look forward to continued support from \nboth sides of the aisle and in both houses to make elder justice a \nreality for those Americans who need it most.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 334. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \neligibility for astronauts for Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance; to \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, our Nation continues to mourn the \nterrible tragedy that we all experienced on Saturday with the explosion \nof the Space Shuttle Columbia. The loss of these seven brave men and \nwomen proved that space flight is still dangerous. Unfortunately, I \ncome to the floor today to call my colleagues' attention to another \ntragedy, one which Congress can and should correct.\n  After the 1986 Challenger explosion, a terrible oversight on the part \nof our government came to light. We learned that NASA astronauts, with \nthe exception of those in the military, often cannot get life \ninsurance. Their jobs are too high-risk for them to be able to easily \nobtain private insurance. And, up until now, the government has not \nprovided any type of safety net for these men and women, who risk their \nlives every day to advance our Nation's space program.\n  Fortunately, a private fund, the Space Shuttle Children's Trust Fund, \nwas formed to fill this breach. The fund paid an estimated $1.2 million \nto the families of the astronauts killed in the Challenger explosion. I \nwould like to take a moment to commend Mr. Delbert Smith, a Washington, \nDC attorney and chairman of the fund, as well as all of the other men \nand women who stepped forward to help the families of these national \nheroes. It is selfless individuals like Mr. Smith and his colleagues \nthat make America the greatest nation in the world.\n  Despite the sacrifice of these individuals, the fact is that the \ngovernment should have taken care of the families of these astronauts. \nJust as we take care of our veterans, we should ensure that our \nastronauts do not have to worry about the financial survival of their \nfamilies if the unthinkable happens. And while there will always be a \nplace for organizations like the Space Shuttle Children's Trust Fund, \nCongress has a responsibility to take care of the brave men and women \nin our human space flight program.\n  Unfortunately, it pains me to say that this is one lesson we did not \nlearn from the Challenger disaster. After the Columbia explosion, I was \nshocked to learn that there is still no provision for the Federal \nGovernment to ensure that the families of astronauts are taken care of \nin these tragic circumstances.\n  We all pray that we will never have to suffer through another tragedy \nlike the Challenger and Columbia explosions. But it is the \nresponsibility of Congress to ensure that we are prepared in case it \ndoes happen again. Therefore, today I am introducing a bill that would \nallow astronauts to participate in the Servicemember's Group Life \nInsurance program. As my colleagues know, this is the insurance program \nthat is set up for our men and women in the military. With relatively \nlow payments, service members are eligible to up to $250,000 in life \ninsurance. I believe that astronauts should also be eligible for this \nprogram, and that is why I am proposing this legislation.\n  In closing, something like this should have been done in 1986, \nfollowing the Challenger disaster. Unfortunately, 17 years later, \nCongress still has not acted to fix this problem. I say to my \ncolleagues, we must not let even one more astronaut put his or her life \nat risk until we have ensured that the government will be there to \nprovide for their children and their families. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting this measure, and I hope we can get it \napproved quickly. I thank the chair.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 336. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to expand \nreimbursement for travel expenses of covered beneficiaries for \nspecialty care in order to cover specialized dental care; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation \nentitled the ``Military Family Access to Dental Care Act.'' This \nlegislation, while limited in its scope, will have a profound effect on \nthe lives of our military service members and their families \nparticularly those serving our country at remote rural bases.\n\n[[Page S2122]]\n\n  Current law provides reimbursement for military dependents who, when \nreferred, must travel at least one-hundred miles to receive specialty \nhealth care. However, specialty dental care has not been interpreted \nwithin the scope of this provision. In a rural State like New Mexico, \nthis exclusion has a real impact on quality of life.\n  For example, a military dependent stationed at Cannon Air Force Base \nin eastern New Mexico is not able to receive periodontic or orthodontic \ncare in nearby Clovis these specialties are simply not available. \nInstead, to receive such care, that dependent would have to travel 225 \nmiles to Albuquerque, 110 miles to Lubbock, Tx, or 104 miles to \nAmarillo often two or three times to alleviate a special dental \nproblem. The cost of traveling these long distances can eat away at a \nmilitary family's income and degrade their quality of life.\n  The legislation I propose expands the scope of existing law to ensure \nthat travel of at least one-hundred miles for referred specialty dental \ncare is reimbursable. It is my firm belief that this small but \npractical bill can improve the lives of many military families, \nespecially those assigned to bases in the West. What is more, it sends \na signal to our military personnel and their families that we recognize \nthe sacrifices they make for us and want to respond by addressing their \nneeds whenever we can. I hope that my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REIMBURSEMENT OF COVERED BENEFICIARIES FOR CERTAIN \n                   TRAVEL EXPENSES RELATING TO SPECIALIZED DENTAL \n                   CARE.\n\n       Section 1074i of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``In any \n     case''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(b) Specialty Care Providers.--For purposes of subsection \n     (a), the term `specialty care provider' includes a dental \n     specialist (including an oral surgeon, orthodontist, \n     prosthodontist, periodontist, endodontist, or pediatric \n     dentist).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 337. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act and the Solid Waste Disposal Act to prohibit the use of \narsenic-treated lumber as mulch, compost, or a soil amendment, and to \nprohibit the manufacture of arsenic-treated wood for use as playground \nequipment for children, fences, walkways, or decks or for other \nresidential or occupational purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an \nissue I've fought long and hard on--the risk posed to children by \narsenic-treated wood playground equipment.\n  There is now a government study which demonstrates the link between \nwood laced with an arsenic preservative called chromated copper \narsenate or CCA and an increased risk of lung and bladder cancer.\n  Last Friday, the scientists at the Consumer Product Safety Commission \nissued a report that concluded that 2 to 100 children out of 1 million \nwill get bladder and lung cancer from their exposure to arsenic-treated \nwood playground equipment.\n  This is disturbing.\n  Especially since CCA was used to preserve 98 percent of the wood \nproduced for residential uses in the United States in 2001.\n  Since March of 2001, when media reports emerged about elevated levels \nof arsenic in playground soil and numerous playgrounds in the State of \nFlorida closed as a result, I have been pushing the Environmental \nProtection Agency to complete its long-awaited study on the dangers \nposed by this arsenic preservative.\n  I am still waiting.\n  To spur action on this issue, in the last 2 years, I have filed \nlegislation mandating warning labels on all arsenic-treated wood to \ninform consumers that the wood they were purchasing contained a \ncarcinogen.\n  Further, my past legislation required the EPA to complete its study, \nbegun long before the CPSC started its study, regarding the risks posed \nby arsenic-treated wood.\n  And, finally, I introduced legislation to ban the residential uses of \narsenic-treated wood.\n  Meanwhile, EPA reached an agreement with the wood preserving industry \nto voluntarily phase out the manufacture of CCA-treated wood for \nresidential purposes by December 31, 2003.\n  However, a year has passed since EPA reached that agreement and they \nstill have not published a final rule in the Federal Register making \nthe phase-out permanent, they still have not completed their own risk \nassessment of the dangers posed to children playing on CCA-treated \nequipment and a New York Times article in December 2002, reported that \nthe administration may be reconsidering the phaseout.\n  For those reasons, today I again introduce legislation to ban the \nmanufacture of arsenic-treated wood for residential uses, including use \nas a mulch, to set a date certain for completion of EPA's risk \nassessment and to require the EPA to conduct a public education program \nto inform the public about how they can decrease their risk of \ncontracting cancer from CCA-treated wood.\n  The legislation also provides for the safe disposal of CCA-treated \nwood to prevent arsenic from contaminating our groundwater.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 338. A bill to protect the flying public's safety and security by \nrequiring that the air traffic control system remain a Government \nfunction; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Safe and \nSecure Skies Act of 2003, a bill that would protect the safety and \nsecurity of the flying public by requiring that air traffic control \nremain a government function. This legislation is necessary because the \nBush administration has taken several steps to privatize our Nation's \nair traffic control system.\n  On September 11 air traffic controllers across the Nation performed \nheroically, as they guided thousands of aircraft out of the sky. From \nthe tower at Newark International Airport, air traffic controllers in \nmy State could see the Twin Towers burning as they worked to return \ntens of thousands of Americans to the ground safely.\n  Like many public servants on that day, they are heroes. Along with \npolice, firefighters, and other emergency personnel, these public \nemployees gave 110 percent to secure the safety of the American people.\n  In the aftermath of these tragic events, the American people demanded \none thing in particular of their government: they wanted government \npersonnel--not private contract firms--to perform security screening of \nbaggage at our Nation's airports. And Congress compiled with this \nrequest, as we turned the privatized baggage screening system over to \nFederal workers with the new Transportation Security Agency.\n  That is why it is so surprising to me that the administration is now \ntaking steps to privatize the air traffic control system in this \ncountry. It makes little sense, especially after September 11. It is \nthe opposite of what the public wants.\n  The safety and security of the American people should not be the \nresponsibility of the lowest bidder. Rather, it is a core \nresponsibility of government.\n  But the administration is moving rapidly in the opposite direction. \nAlready we have seen the jobs of air traffic control specialists--those \nwho repair, inspect, and maintain the air traffic control system--\nopened up to outsourcing. And the administration just completed a \n``feasibility study'' of privatizing the jobs of flight service station \ncontrollers--the experts who provide critical weather, safety, and \nsecurity alerts to pilots.\n  Next on the agenda for the administration are the air traffic \ncontrollers, who monitor and guide thousands of aircraft every day over \nthe United States.\n  The administration has already proposed air traffic controller \nprivatization in two of its annual budgets. In\n\n[[Page S2123]]\n\nJune 2002, President Bush issued an executive order stripping air \ntraffic services of its ``inherently governmental'' status. And in \nDecember 2002, the administration issued a document designating air \ntraffic control a ``commercial'' activity, opening the door to \ncontracting out the jobs of air traffic controllers to the lowest \nbidder.\n\n  This change from ``inherently governmental'' to a ``commercial'' \nfunction is more than a technical change--``inherently governmental'' \nfunctions can never be privatized, while ``commercial'' functions may \nbe outsourced.\n  The administration is trying to accomplish its privatization plan \nunder the public's radar screen through the Office of Management and \nBudget's A-76 process. We in Congress have the power to stop this \nprocess and the bill I am introducing today will reverse the \nadministration's plan.\n  My Safe and Secure Skies Act will return air traffic control \nfunctions to ``inherently governmental'' status, thus barring any \nprivatization action. I do want to note, however, that my legislation \nwill not affect the existing FAA ``Contract Tower'' program, which \ninvolves some small, visual flight rules airports.\n  We currently have the best air traffic control system in the world. \nOver 15,000 dedicated Federal air traffic controllers guide more than 2 \nmillion passengers a day home safely. Maintaining and inspecting the \nsystem are over 11,000 air traffic specialists, and nearly 3,000 flight \nservice station controllers provide critical information and alerts to \npilots. They are expert professionals who perform under pressure every \nday to keep our skies safe.\n  I believe our air traffic controllers are almost a wing of the \nmilitary, and they play a major role in homeland security. When \nPresident Bush gave the State of the Union speech last month, it was \nthe flight service station air traffic controllers who sent alerts to \navoid the expanded ``no-fly'' zone around Washington. And when the \nspace shuttle Columbia tragically disintegrated in the skies over \nTexas, it was the air traffic controllers who directed aircraft away \nfrom the falling debris field.\n  These men and women perform a critical government function.\n  Some claim that privatization will save money. But when you look at \nother countries' experiments with air traffic control privatization, \nall you see are financial messes and safety hazards. Australia, Canada, \nand Great Britain all have privatized systems that are now in crisis. \nCosts have gone up and safety has gone down.\n  Since Great Britain adopted privatization, near misses have increased \nby 50 percent and delays have increased by 20 percent. The British \nGovernment has already had to bail out the privatized air traffic \ncontrol company twice.\n  Privatization of the air traffic control system is bad fiscal policy, \nbad safety policy, bad homeland security policy, and the public doesn't \nwant it.\n  I therefore ask my colleagues to support my Safe and Secure Skies \nAct, which will declare these critical air traffic control functions to \nbe ``inherently governmental'', and therefore not eligible for \noutsourcing.\n  The safety of our skies should not be put in the hands of the lowest \nbidder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/10/senate-section/article/S2123-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 50--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                           FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. LUGAR submitted the following resolution; from the Committee on \nForeign Relations; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 10, S. Res. 49.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 49) designating February 11, 2003 as \n     National Inventors' Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is passing S. Res. \n49 that Senator Hatch and I introduced to recognize February 11, 2003, \nas National Inventors' Day.\n  More than 200 years ago, on July 30, 1790, Samuel Hopkins, a resident \nof Vermont, was granted the first United States patent. He had \ndiscovered a process for making potash, and was\n\n[[Page S2124]]\n\nawarded his patent by President George Washington, Attorney General \nEdmund Randolph and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.\n  Samuel Hopkins is just one of the many resourceful and creative \ninventors from Vermont. The town of Brandon can boast Thomas Davenport, \na self-educated blacksmith interested in electricity and magnetism. \nThrough hands-on experiments with electromagnets, he built the first \ntrue electric motor in 1834. Initially, his patent request was denied \nbecause there was no prior patent on electric machinery. But he \ngarnered the support of numerous professors and philosophers who \nexamined his invention and endorsed his right to a patent on his novel \ndevice. In 1837, his determinism paid off, and he secured a patent.\n  John Deere was born in Rutland, VT and spent most of his early life \nin Middlebury. After moving out West, John Deere realized the cast-iron \nplows he and other settlers brought with them were not going to work in \nthe Midwest soil. He studied the problem and developed the first \nsuccessful steel plow using steel from a broken saw blade. This new \nsteel plow became the key for successful farming in the West, and \n``John Deere'' is still synonymous with farming equipment today.\n  Vermont continues to be a leader in inventing and obtaining patents. \nMy State ranks fourth in the Nation for number of patents issued. IBM's \nEssex Junction Plant, which designs and makes computer technology for a \nwide range of products, received 411 patents from the U.S. Patent & \nTrademark Office in 2002. Vermont's plant also has 18 inventors who \ntogether have earned more than 600 patents. One of those inventors is \nSteve Voldman, the top patent winner. Over the past 10 years, he has \nreceived 110 patents. In 2002, he received 29. Many of his 2002 patents \nhad to do with silicon germanium, a new technology that has produced \nthe world's fastest chip.\n  Today's inventors are individuals in a shop, garage or home lab. They \nare teams of scientists working in our largest corporations or at our \ncolleges and universities. In the spirit of independent inventors, \nsmall businesses, venture capitalists and larger corporations in \nVermont and all over the United States, I would like to recognize \nFebruary 11, 2003, as `'National Inventors' Day.''\n  Mr. ENZI.
