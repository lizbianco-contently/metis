Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof the Foreign Operations appropriations measure. Senator McConnell and \nthe ranking member will be available to discuss and debate amendments. \nThere is an expectation that this bill can be completed in short order. \nTherefore, if Members do intend to offer amendments, they should \ncontact the cloakroom soon so they are not precluded by a unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  As a reminder, at 5:30 p.m. today, the Senate will conduct a cloture \nvote with respect to the nomination of Michael Leavitt to be \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. That rollcall \nvote will be the first vote of today's session. I do anticipate we will \nbe able to invoke cloture and, therefore, would like to complete this \nnomination procedure at some point tonight.\n  For the remainder of the week, we will consider and complete the \nappropriations bills that are available. I will be discussing with \nSenator Stevens the remaining appropriations process. This week, we \nwill also be addressing any appropriations conference reports that are \nmade available.\n  In addition to these bills, the Senate must still act on the fair \ncredit reporting bill. I look forward to the first opportunity to bring \nthat bill to the floor, most likely this week. The Internet tax \nmoratorium legislation has been discussed as a possibility for this \nweek. I do hope Members will be able to work out any differences on \nthat bill. We will need to address this bill soon due to the existing \nexpiration of that moratorium.\n  Healthy Forests continues to remain a challenge. There had been an \ninitial hope for an agreement to move forward on this bill with \namendments that would be relevant. However, we have not been able to \nhave an agreement reached on the relevancy of those amendments, and we \nwill have to consider other options.\n  The CARE Act is still sitting at the desk ready for conference, but, \nonce again, there is an outstanding objection to that procedure. I \nmentioned at the end of last week and will mention again, the gun \nliability measure is one that should be considered before we close out \nthis session. Again, we will be looking for time to do just that.\n  As mentioned on the floor at the end of last week, we expect to be \ndealing with the appropriations bills for the most part over the course \nof the day and spending the early or very late afternoons and early \nevenings addressing these other very important measures. There may be \nexceptions to that as issues present themselves, but it will be \nimportant for us to continue a dual-tracking approach as agreed to on \nboth sides of the aisle to address the important issues that must be \naddressed.\n  As we know and will see later this afternoon and evening, nominations \nare critically important. They are always a focus. Tonight's vote shows \nthe\n\n[[Page S13234]]\n\nchallenge we have on each and every one of these executive nominations, \nas well as all of the judicial nominations. I will continue to look for \nways to give the executive nominations their due process--an up-or-down \nvote on the Senate floor. Again, this is with respect to both executive \nnominations and judicial nominations.\n  The list I have just mentioned is lengthy in part, but it is within \nreason. We can complete these issues, and we will do our very best to \ncomplete all these issues, including the appropriations process, \nincluding the Energy conference report, including the Medicare \nprescription drug conference report, before we leave. It is going to \nrequire working together. It will require a lot of cooperation on both \nsides of the aisle to accomplish that.\n  With that cooperation, with the expectation we can work hand in hand \non these issues, we will be able to still adjourn in a timely way this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 6 or 7 minutes \nas in morning business. I ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today I would like to announce a \nsignificant achievement for this Congress, for the nursing home \ncommunity, and for nursing home residents throughout the United States. \nI announce that the nursing home community committed itself to spending \nabout $4 billion over the next decade to direct care and services for \nall patients in skilled nursing facilities.\n  This past August, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \ncorrected for errors in rate calculations and adjusted Medicare \npayments to nursing homes by 3.26 percent. I approached the nursing \nhome community and asked that they use a substantial portion of those \nfunds for direct, hands-on care to residents. They not only agreed, but \nthey committed their agreement to writing.\n  The American Health Care Association, the Alliance for Quality \nNursing Home Care, the American Association of Homes and Services for \nthe Aging, the American Health Quality Association, and the American \nHospital Association all have agreed to spend a large portion of the \nincrease in funding from that 3.26-percent adjustment formula for \ndirect hands-on care to residents, specifically on registered nurses, \nlicensed practical nurses, and on certified nursing assistants. These \nare the people who touch the nursing home residents' lives most \ndirectly, and they are the backbone of the nursing home system of \nquality care if there is going to be quality care.\n  Moreover, by committing to use these funds for hands-on direct care, \nthese providers are acknowledging that more hands-on direct care will \nhelp to continue improving the quality of care provided nursing home \nresidents.\n  I first got involved in the nursing home quality of care issue in \n1997 when I chaired the Special Committee on Aging. There was, at that \ntime, concern about thousands of deaths in the State of California due \nto dehydration, malnutrition, bed sores, and a lot of other conditions \nthat indicate lack of concern, lack of quality of care. This may have \nbeen just in the State of California, but it was probably also true of \nother States. These were brought to my attention at that particular \ntime.\n  At that time I seized the opportunity to expose the sad state of \naffairs in too many nursing homes across the Nation. In 1998, the \npicture wasn't pretty. The General Accounting Office said there were \nserious quality care problems in about 30 percent of California's \nnursing homes. That report inaugurated a new and targeted effort to \nimprove the quality of care in nursing facilities, and the quality of \noversight and enforcement by responsible State and Federal agencies.\n  Since 1998, there have been about 17 General Accounting Office \nstudies on nursing homes, and even more if you count the work done by \nthe Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human \nServices. Improving the quality of care provided in nursing homes is of \nparamount concern to all of us. At the same time, we must recognize \nthat not all nursing homes are bad actors. Unfortunately, those who are \ncast the entire community in a bad light.\n  Over the years in fighting the battle to improve care in nursing \nhomes I have come to learn two very important realities about providing \nquality care to one of our most vulnerable populations. The first \nreality is that there is no quick fix that will cure the problem. There \nis no law, no penalty, no guidance that will eliminate the problem.\n  The second reality is that we need the will to direct Federal funds \nright where they are most needed, to those hands-on professionals who \nfeed, bathe, and turn the residents of a nursing home. That is what we \nhave done here with this agreement among these various professional and \ntrade associations. We worked hand in glove with these associations of \nthe nursing home community, a community that provided me their written \ncommitment to use real money to improve the plight of nursing home \nresidents.\n  The nursing home community put their money where their mouth is by \ncommitting to use billions for hands-on direct care to their residents. \nToday I applaud them, I thank them, and I look forward to more such \nagreements, all in the name of making sure that there is quality of \ncare at the nursing homes of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13234-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13234-S13237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2004\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1968) was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to explain an \namendment that was in the package I just sent forward: Conditioning \nassistance to Malaysia on a determination\n\n[[Page S13235]]\n\nby the Secretary of State that the Government of Malaysia supports and \npromotes religious freedoms, including tolerance for people of the \nJewish faith.\n  On October 16--just very recently--Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir \nMohamed delivered a speech before the Tenth Islamic Summit Conference \nin Malaysia during which he made incredible anti-Semitic comments.\n  Let me just give you a direct quote from what the Prime Minister of \nMalaysia had to say. Incredibly, here is what he said:\n\n       The Muslims will be forever oppressed and dominated by the \n     Europeans and the Jews. . . . 1.3 billion Muslims cannot be \n     defeated by a few million Jews.\n       [Muslims] are actually very strong.\n\n  He said:\n\n       1.3 billion people cannot be simply wiped out. The \n     Europeans killed 6 million Jews out of 12 million. But today \n     the Jews rule this world by proxy. They get others to fight \n     and die for them.\n\n  If that was not bad enough, the Prime Minister of Malaysia went on. \nHe said:\n\n       They survived 2000 years of pogroms not by hitting back, \n     but by thinking. They invented and successfully promoted \n     Socialism, Communism, human rights and democracy so that \n     persecuting them would appear to be wrong, so they may enjoy \n     equal rights with others. With these they have so gained \n     control of the most powerful countries and they, this tiny \n     community, have become a world power.\n\n  Now, what could be more outrageous in 2003 than for the prime \nminister of any country to make such unbelievably erroneous statements? \nThey are dangerously wrong, and they play directly into the hands of \nthe radical Islamic extremists throughout the region.\n  This is not an issue of free speech. His anti-Semitic remarks lend \ncredence and legitimacy to the hateful messages of local terrorists who \nseek to sow mayhem throughout the region.\n  As I understand the importance of fighting terrorism in Mahathir's \nown backyard--and that his comments do not reflect the views of all \nMalaysians--I include, in the amendment already approved, a national \nsecurity waiver that will allow the provision of $1.2 million in IMET \nassistance--that is the military-to-military assistance--to that \ncountry to be eliminated unless the President believes it is in the \nnational security interests of the United States to continue it.\n  Now, the good news is that Mahathir's words were criticized around \nthe world, as they certainly should have been. The bad news is that the \nPrime Minister just does not get it. Given an opportunity to clarify \nhis comments a few days later, he said, in an interview with the \nBangkok Post, on October 21--this is what he said to the Bangkok Post, \nhaving listened to the criticism and having an opportunity to retract \nhis comments--he said: ``Well, the reaction of the world [to my \ncomments] shows that [the Jews] control the world'' and, ``Well, many \nnewspapers are owned by the Jews. They only see that angle and they \nhave a powerful influence over the thinking of many people.''\n  Mahathir himself has influence over the thinking of many people. My \nadvice is that in the future he should think before he speaks.\n  Let me close by encouraging Prime Minister Mahathir to \nunconditionally release former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim \nbefore stepping down from office later this month. This injustice has \ngone on for far too long.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1969\n\n     (Purpose: To require that the Administrator of the Coalition \n Provisional Authority be an officer who is appointed by the President \n           by and with the advice and consent of the Senate)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in considering the President's $87 billion \nfor Iraq, the House of Representatives adopted a provision that would \nrequire the U.S. official responsible for coordinating the \nreconstruction efforts in Iraq to be appointed by the President by and \nwith the advice of the Senate.\n  It is almost embarrassing that the House of Representatives had to \nact on behalf of the Senate to include such a requirement.\n  The House was responding to the news that the President had appointed \nNational Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice to lead a task force that \nwould assume responsibilities for rebuilding Iraq. Unlike Secretaries \nRumsfeld and Powell, who testified before the Congress to explain the \nactions of Defense and State Department personnel in Iraq, the actions \nof the task force will likely be shielded from the public by what may \nbe said to be executive privilege.\n  The National Security Adviser, as a member of the President's staff, \ntraditionally does not testify before the Congress, except under \nextreme circumstances. It is an unconfirmed position and its actions \nare hidden from the view of the Congress, the media, and the public.\n  The House of Representatives has valid concerns that if the National \nSecurity Adviser is responsible for the administration's reconstruction \nefforts in Iraq, her actions could be shielded from the public.\n  Senators will recall that the White House tried something similar to \nthis last year.\n  After the September 11 attacks, the White House unilaterally created \nthe Office of Homeland Security inside the White House and used \nexecutive privilege to cloak the office and its director, Tom Ridge, \nfrom the Congress and the public. Senator Stevens and I at that time \nwrote to the White House, and we wrote repeatedly, seeking testimony \nfrom Mr. Ridge. But he was not allowed to testify before the \nAppropriations Committee or any other congressional committees.\n  For 14 months, the actions of our chief homeland security officer, \nMr. Tom Ridge, were hidden from the public. Not until the Congress \nforced the hand of the administration did the President acknowledge the \ndangers of such a situation. To end the stalemate, the President went \nso far as to reorganize the entire Federal Government--almost--by \ncreating a new Department of Homeland Security, making its Secretary \nconfirmable by the Senate.\n  So I certainly hope the present situation won't have to be resolved \nby creating a new Department of Iraqi Reconstruction.\n  The American people need to be sure that whoever the President \nchooses to lead the administration's reconstruction efforts in Iraq \nwill be held accountable for their actions.\n  The Iraqi war effort, including the recently passed supplemental, has \ncost the American taxpayers $118 billion; 351 U.S. soldiers have lost \ntheir lives. The administration has wagered the lives, the treasure, \nand international prestige of the American people on its Iraqi \nendeavors. With so much at stake, the Congress has a responsibility on \nbehalf of the American people to ensure that whoever is running things \nin Iraq is answerable for their decisions to the Congress and to the \nAmerican people.\n  I am not just referring to the National Security Adviser; I am also \nreferring to the Administrator of the coalition Provisional Authority \nthat now governs Iraq. This is an entity which has not been sanctioned, \nwhich has not been approved by the Congress. Its head has not been \nconfirmed by the Senate. It is operating without any mandate from the \nAmerican public. Yet it claims to be vested by the President with all \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial authority necessary to achieve its \nobjective.\n\n  Mr. President, we are not even sure what its objectives are supposed \nto be. The President signed a national security directive earlier this \nyear outlining the Iraqi civil administrator's authorities, but that \ndirective is classified, hidden away from the American public. Yet the \nCongress is handing over another $20 billion to this entity without \ninsisting that the administrator be held accountable to the \nrepresentatives of the people of our country. It is an idea so absurd \nthat even the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has tried \nto stop it, and with good reason.\n  Let us look at the way the Marshall plan was crafted to rebuild \nEurope after World War II. In comparison, the Congress has allowed the \nadministration to assume sweeping unchecked authorities for its efforts \nin Iraq. From\n\n[[Page S13236]]\n\nthe first, the Truman administration worked closely with the Congress \nin the development of a foreign aid plan to rebuild Europe. Congress \ndid not just appropriate funds whenever the administration asked for \nthem. Congress developed a 4-year financial aid plan. It drafted \nenabling legislation that was debated for months in the House and the \nSenate. The Congress ensured that U.S. foreign aid commitments did not \nput its domestic interests in peril.\n  Unlike the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, the Federal \nentity responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Marshall \nplan was authorized by statute. The Congress defined the scope of its \npowers and its authorities and built a public record of 7 weeks of \nhearings outlining its objectives and responsibilities. President \nTruman not only appointed a member of the opposition party, Republican \nbusinessman Paul G. Hoffman, to head that organization, but his \nappointment was subject to confirmation by the Senate. The Senate \nForeign Affairs Committee had the opportunity to hold hearings and to \nask questions about potential conflicts of interest to determine his \nqualifications.\n  On the other hand, the Coalition Provisional Authority and its \nAdministrator can claim none of that.\n  The Congress has not sanctioned it by law. The Senate has not given \nits consent to the Administrator chosen to lead it. There is no public \nrecord detailing the potential conflicts of interest that may be \npertinent to the Administrator's responsibility in administering the \nreconstruction of Iraq. Once the Congress appropriates its budget, the \nAdministrator of the CPA could very well just begin to decline \ninvitations to testify before the Congress, at least until he needs \nmore money. It could further shield its actions from the public. With \nso little in statute tying the Congress to the CPA, the Congress needs \nto assert its authority to ensure that the CPA's Administrator will be \nheld accountable to the Congress and to the American people.\n  While many Members of Congress may feel comfortable with the \ndecisionmakers in the current administration, there will come a time \nwhen a new administration will take office, either Democrat or \nRepublican, when Members of Congress may disagree with the \nadministration officials wielding this power. We need to look beyond \nthe party label of the current administration. We need to take a longer \nterm view of accountability.\n  The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has taken that \nlonger term view. The Senate would be wise to follow the lead of the \nHouse of Representatives. So I have an amendment that would, effective \nMarch 1, 2004, prohibit the Coalition Provisional Authority from using \nfunds appropriated until its Administrator is appointed by the \nPresident, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. In that \nway, the Congress will have a mechanism to make sure these funds are \nspent wisely and there be accountability of their expenditure to better \nprotect our troops and ensure their quick return home.\n\n  In proposing its $87 billion supplemental request for Iraq, the \nadministration has urged the Congress not to walk away from our troops. \nThe irony is that in handing this money over to administration \nofficials who are not accountable to the American people or their \nrepresentatives in the Congress, that is exactly what we would be \ndoing. We would be throwing our hands in the air telling the \nadministration to fix the problem themselves; the Congress will give \nyou more money later when you need it. That is not the way the House of \nRepresentatives sees it.\n  The Congress has more of a responsibility than that. We owe it to the \ntroops to be more meticulous about how Iraqi reconstruction dollars are \nbeing spent. We owe it to the troops to ask questions and to ensure \nthat the CPA is making decisions in their best interest. So I urge \nSenators not to turn away from the troops. The Senate should follow the \nlead of the House of Representatives and ensure accountability for how \ntaxpayer dollars are spent. I urge the adoption of the amendment which \nI shall offer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nset aside so that I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I send to the desk an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1969:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Sec.  .

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on Burma)\n\n       On page 111, after line 12, insert the following:\n       (c) It is the sense of the Senate that the United Nations \n     Security Council should debate and consider sanctions against \n     Burma as a result of the threat to regional stability and \n     peace posed by the repressive and illegitimate rule of the \n     State Peace and Development Council.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, my amendment is rather straightforward. \nIt relates to the current regime in Burma. It simply states that it is \nthe sense of the Senate that the United Nations Security Council should \nconsider sanctions against Burma as a result of the threat to regional \nstability and peace posed by the repressive and illegitimate rule of \nthe State Peace and Development Council; that is, the military junta \nthat has ruled Burma for the last few decades.\n  While the United Nations Secretary General and his special envoy to \nBurma have publicly raised the struggle for freedom in that country, \nthe Security Council itself has not considered the matter, which it \nshould do at the earliest opportunity. The facts are self-evident. \nUnder the SPDC, Burma poses a clear and present danger to itself and to \nits neighbors. Narcotics, HIV/AIDS, and refugees fleeing gross human \nrights abuses spill over Burma's borders and create humanitarian and \nsecurity crises in Thailand, India, and China.\n  The Secretary General and his special envoy should understand that \nactions--not words--are required to free Burmese democracy leader Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and all her compatriots who remain oppressed and imprisoned \nin Rangoon.\n  While I appreciate the President and the Secretary of State raising \nthe issue of democracy in Burma with Thai Prime Minister Thaksin \nSinawatra, I am afraid the message of freedom has again fallen on deaf \nears.\n  As a democratic nation and an ally of the United States, Thailand has \na particular obligation to support democracy and justice in Burma. Many \nof us in Washington are gravely concerned that Thailand inexplicably \nseems to rush to the defense of the SPDC at every single opportunity, \ndeflating pressure even before it can be effectively applied.\n  Frankly, I expect--and the community of democracies should demand--\nthe Thai Prime Minister to be more proactive in supporting Suu Kyi and\n\n[[Page S13237]]\n\nthe National League for Democracy, which I recall for my colleagues was \noverwhelmingly elected back in 1990 but never allowed to take power.\n  The comments of the Prime Minister of Thailand, as reported in the \npress, say the United States does not understand the issue well. That \nis ridiculous.\n  I would suggest that the Prime Minister may be the one who is \nconfused as to how best to bring about democratic change in Burma. The \nThai policy of engagement with Rangoon has been a predictable complete \nand total failure--a total failure.\n  Prime Minister Thaksin should understand that under a democratic \nBurmese Government, cross border trade would comprise of legitimate \ngoods and services--and not those illicitly purchased or prostituted in \nback allies of Bangkok.\n  China, too, would benefit immeasurably from a government in Burma \nthat is rooted in freedom and the rule of law. HIV/AIDS and the \nnarcotics trade are akin to cancers in the Middle Kingdom's underbelly. \nUnder the SPDC's misrule, these malignancies have grown out of control \ninto Burma and affect the neighboring countries.\n  As Beijing already knows, there is no denying the socioeconomic \nimpact of these security threats. It is time for China to treat the \ndisease and not only the symptoms.\n  I note that next week China and the European Union will be meeting to \ndiscuss issues pertaining to Burma, Iraq, and North Korea. The United \nStates must use its diplomatic prowess to influence China and the EU \nand move these parties toward engagement with the SPDC that results in \nthe immediate release of Suu Kyi and other political prisoners. \nAgreeing that Burma is a pariah state, but not acting accordingly, is \nsimply not going to work.\n  So I commend Secretary Powell for tackling this issue with the ASEAN \nmembers during his recent visit to Thailand just a week or two ago. I \nencourage him and the entire State Department to continue to implement \nan aggressive and unrelenting full court press to secure freedom and \njustice for the people of Burma.\n  To be sure, ASEAN has a critical role to play in promoting freedom \nand justice in Burma. Now is not the time for Southeast Asian nations \nto bury their collective heads in the sand, or to make bizarre comments \npraising ``positive developments'' in Burma--where there have not been \nany positive developments--as ASEAN members did following the recent \nsummit in Bali, Indonesia.\n  The unfortunate tendency of ASEAN members to ignore regional threats \nis precisely why the U.N. Security Council should consider discussing \nthe threats to regional stability and peace posed by a repressive \nBurmese regime.\n  Let me close by saying that the only positive development would be if \nASEAN members get with the program and implement sanctions against the \nSPDC. Who better to spur them into action than the United Nations?\n  So this amendment simply calls on the U.N. to do what it should have \ndone a long time ago, which is to get involved in helping us bring \nabout the needed regime change in Burma, to bring to power the duly \nelected government of the National League of Democracy headed by Aung \nSan Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Prize winner, who remains under house \narrest, which is where she has been for most of the time for the last \n15 years--15 years essentially under house arrest. It is time for the \nU.N. to get interested in this issue and to take action.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13237-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13237-S13251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      NOMINATION OF MICHAEL O. LEAVITT TO BE ADMINISTRATOR OF THE \n                    ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2 \no'clock having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session to \nresume consideration of the following nomination, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael O. Leavitt, of \nUtah, to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \nshall be divided as follows: 1 hour 15 minutes under the control of the \nchairman of the committee, Mr. Inhofe or his designee; 2 hours and 15 \nminutes under the control of the ranking member, Mr. Jeffords, or his \ndesignee. The last 20 minutes are equally divided between the chairman \nand ranking member, with the final 10 minutes under the control of the \nchairman.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of Governor Mike Leavitt to be \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. I am supporting \nhis confirmation because we need a leader at the Agency. The EPA needs \nto be represented during Cabinet meetings and be a strong advocate for \na budget that will allow the agency to enforce the environmental \nprotections our citizens deserve. I am very concerned about the morale \nof the employees at the Agency. They are dedicated to environmental \nprotection. Yet the direction the administration has taken on \nprotecting the environment is troubling.\n  The record of the Environmental Protection Agency under this \nadministration is abysmal. We have watched this administration roll \nback environmental law and regulations day after day, week after week, \nand month after month. They have been dismantling our environmental law \nand the protections that our citizens have come to expect and, I \nbelieve, deserve from their Government.\n  This administration has allowed the sale of properties contaminated \nwith PCBs, exposing our citizens to highly toxic chemicals. The \nadministration has limited a State's decision for allowing offshore oil \ndrilling on its own coastline. This administration has allowed the fund \nthat pays for cleaning up abandoned toxic Superfund sites across this \ncountry to go bankrupt. This administration has omitted an entire \nsection on climate change from a White House report on the state of the \nNation's environment, despite convincing evidence to the contrary. This \nadministration has decided not to classify carbon dioxide as a \npollutant.\n  This administration has forced the Environmental Protection Agency to \n``add reassuring statements and delete cautionary ones'' relating to \nair quality standards surrounding the Ground Zero site following the \nSeptember 11 attacks.\n  This administration has proposed rules that would narrow the waters \nprotected over the last 30 years under the Clean Water Act. This \nadministration has allowed major polluters to avoid installing modern \ncontrol equipment in the New Source Review rule, devastating years of \nprogress under the Clean Air Act. This is a life-threatening decision.\n  Many of these decisions have been made with little input from the \npeople who will be most affected by them and must implement them.\n  As ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nand other members of our committee have oversight responsibility for \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. Yet I do not believe we can carry \nout that responsibility without the cooperation of the administration \nand I, for one, have not received that cooperation. I have made \nrepeated requests of the EPA to provide information and have not \nreceived it.\n  For example, I have asked for the analysis of the effects that the \nNew Source Review rules will have on the environmental and public \nhealth. I have not received it, and the EPA will not collect \ninformation to answer my questions. The lack of transparency in this \nadministration's decisionmaking and lack of cooperation with Congress \ntroubles me. This is particularly true in the case of the New Source \nReview. According to a new GAO report, it appears that administration \nofficials have misled Congress and intentionally undermined ongoing \nenforcement cases. I am hopeful that Governor Leavitt will have much \nmore luck than Governor Whitman did with the White House. EPA needs to \nbe an independent\n\n[[Page S13238]]\n\nagency, as Congress and President Nixon intended. It cannot be a rubber \nstamp for the polluters' lobbyists and should not be a political lapdog \nfor the White House.\n\n  I am hopeful Governor Leavitt can make an improvement in White House \nenvironmental policies because I find it terribly hard to believe that \nthe President would want to continue diminishing his father's \nenvironmental legacy.\n  However, it is not an auspicious sign that the Senate takes up the \nGovernor's nomination on the very day that the Bush administration has \nformally committed the single greatest rollback on clean air since \nthere has been a Federal Clean Air Act. I am referring to the final NSR \nrule being published today that allows the dirtiest, oldest powerplants \nto continue polluting forever. This is a life-and-death matter, a \nserious health matter.\n  I hope against hope that by supporting Governor Leavitt we might \nbring some accountability and rationality to this White House, and he \ncan improve its environmental record. But more and more, I think an \nelection will be necessary before we can see real and positive change \non the environment at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I rise today to speak about an important vote that will take place a \nlittle less than 4 hours from now. At 5:30 this evening, the Members of \nthis body will have an opportunity to invoke cloture on the nomination \nof Governor Mike Leavitt to become the new Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and to end the months of delay and \nPresidential politics that have marred his nomination.\n  Tonight's vote is more than a mere procedural formality. It is more \nthan a simple motion. It is a vote about leadership and the health of \nour natural surroundings. It is a vote that will show the American \npeople we are serious about protecting the environment, about providing \nthe much-needed leadership the EPA has been missing since the departure \nof the former Administrator.\n  Every ship needs a captain. Every plane needs a pilot. As elected \nofficials representing the greatest people in the greatest Nation, we \nmust provide that captain, that pilot for our Nation's chief \nenvironmental department. We can begin by voting tonight to invoke \ncloture. The politics of delay must end tonight. President Bush has \nnominated a very worthy candidate to take the helm at the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  I have learned that experience makes a difference. Perhaps no other \nqualification that Governor Leavitt possesses is as important to me as \nhis experience in the real world. As president and chief executive \nofficer of the Leavitt Group, he has paid taxes and made payroll. \nThrough his business experience, he learned the impact of government \nregulations on commerce and industry. Moving beyond his time as a \nprivate entrepreneur and into the realm of public service, Governor \nLeavitt is the country's longest serving Governor and has a long \nhistory of experience and accomplishments that make him eminently \nqualified for the position of Administrator. The confirmation of the \nAdministrator must be a top priority for all who care about the \nenvironment.\n  I challenge my colleagues to focus on the achievements of our \nnational environmental policy and not on penalties and politics. We \ncannot ignore the fact that the air we breathe today is cleaner than it \nwas 4 years ago and that the water our children drink is more safe \ntoday than ever before. But there is a danger lurking in the \nformulation and implementation of our national environmental policy. \nExtremist measures that impose strict mandates and demand compliance \nthrough arbitrary means and unclear science could undermine the very \ninstitutes of our democracy and of our market economy.\n  Governor Leavitt knows that our system of environmental regulations, \nenvironmental mandates and administrative and judicial rulings, work \ntogether to protect our most precious resources, and have helped spur \nenvironmental recovery in many areas. But he is also aware that these \nsame layers of laws have also created tremendous burdens for \nmunicipalities, businesses and the ongoing development and maintenance \nof our public infrastructure.\n  The evolution of environmental rules and regulations that control so \nmany aspects of life must be realistic goals that are established \nthrough a course of open deliberation and sound science. The impact EPA \nhas on individual lives is real, not fictitious. New laws and \nenforcement decisions cannot be taken lightly.\n  I am pleased that President Bush's approach has been one of reform--\nchanging command-and-control mandates to innovative, market-based \napproaches that utilize cutting edge technology to bolster \nenvironmental benefits. I know that this type of strong, principled \nleadership will continue into the future. We must not simply wipe the \nslate clean and sweep away basic environmental rules, but we can--we \nmust--develop an environmental agenda that protects private property \nrights while balancing environmental achievement with the need for \ncontinued economic progress.\n  Governor Leavitt is the one person who has the intellect, the \ncourage, and the right philosophical temperament to get this job done. \nGovernor Leavitt hails from the western United States. Perhaps no other \ngeographic region in the country has felt the heavy hand of \nenvironmental regulation more than the public land States of the West--\nbe it in the form of forthcoming EPA mercury standards or the \nDepartment of the Interior's Endangered Species Act.\n  Many Members of this body do not understand the impact that Federal \nland ownership has on a State and on its people, and that includes the \nmuch publicized battle over RS 2477. At some point today, I have no \ndoubt that opponents may try to attack the Governor on his approach to \nsolving this long standing Federal land issue. As a fellow westerner \nwhose State is also affected by the dispute, I want to clear up the \nscare tactics and half-truths used by the extremist groups in an \nattempt to undermine the nominee's credibility.\n  Governor Leavitt has never been involved in secret deals and behind-\nclosed-doors shenanigans to destroy public lands. Instead, Governor \nLeavitt believes the public is best served through negotiation rather \nthan litigation. His actions to resolve a 30-year dispute over \nownership rights of rural county roads resulted in the enactment of a \nreliable mechanism that will preserve and promote the interests of the \npublic. This is just plain common sense.\n  Governor Leavitt understands the complicated web of environmental \nrules and the impact that they have on health and property. As a \nGovernor, he has worked hard to increase the well-being of the people \nin his State, and he has worked diligently to improve the state of the \nenvironment. Governor Leavitt understands the fundamental need to \nprotect the environment from irresponsible actors. Just as important, \nthough, he understands the need to protect the environment through \npolicies and programs that generate results and that create incentives \nto improve land, water and air quality, not just penalties and fines. \nHe knows that heavy-handed action is not nearly as important as the \nresults that can be achieved through cooperation and collaboration.\n  The development of such enlibra principles has received a bipartisan \nendorsement from the National Governor's Association and deserves a \ngreat deal of attention. Governor Leavitt, along with the Governor of \nOregon, was one of the pioneers of a concept that they dubbed enlibra. \nThis concept, derived from Latin root words and meaning ``to move \ntoward balance,'' promotes the type of balanced environmental \nstewardship that I have been talking about and includes eight \nprinciples that help on this course. Governor Leavitt has done a great \ndeal to clean up both the air and water and to protect thousands of \nacres of premier public lands in the State of Utah.\n  In just one example of how he has worked for cleaner air, Governor \nLeavitt is a co-chair of the Western Regional Air Partnership, also \nknown as WRAP. WRAP is a partnership of 13 States, 13 tribes and 3 \nFederal agencies. This organization worked to formulate a regulatory \ncommitment to reduce SOX levels by 50-70 percent by\n\n[[Page S13239]]\n\nthe year 2040. But, they didn't just formulate regulations. They also \nput together a plan to help those affected by the regulations, \nproviding guidance on how to reach these aggressive clean air goals. \nUnder Governor Leavitt's leadership, Utah now meets all Federal air \nquality standards.\n\n  But its not just the air that is improved. Seventy-three percent of \nUtah's streams currently meet Federal water quality standards, compared \nto 59 percent 10 years ago. This is a remarkable improvement since \nGovernor Leavitt took office.\n  In what undoubtedly will be a common theme today as other members \ncome to the floor to show their support for Governor Leavitt, I would \nlike to point out that our Nation lives today in a cleaner, healthier \nenvironment, far more clean than it was when President Bush first took \noffice. In the last 30 years, water quality has improved and emissions \nof the six principal air pollutants have been cut 48 percent. This \nprogress comes even as the country has experienced a 164 percent \nincrease in gross domestic product, a 42 percent increase in energy \nconsumption, and a 155 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled. This \nimprovement has occurred over the course of 34 years, 22 of which came \nunder the leadership of Republican administrations.\n  The environment is not a partisan issue. Success comes through \npartnership and the desire to take the responsible, common-sense \naction. As mentioned, the most recent EPA data shows that sulfur \ndioxide emissions from power plants were 10.2 million tons in 2002, 9 \npercent lower than in 2000 and 41 percent lower than 1980. \nNOx emissions from power plants are also lower, measuring \n4.5 million tons in 2002. This is a 13 percent reduction from 2000 and \na 33 percent decline from 1990 emissions levels. In Colorado, the Bush \nadministration's efforts to clean-up the Shattuck, Vasquez Boulevard \nand Rocky Flats sites deserve many thanks. The administration continues \nto prove its commitment to the people of Colorado through responsible \nstewardship and active protection.\n  Governor Leavitt's accomplishments are not just in the environmental \nfield, however. His environmental principles are getting the most \nattention and, given the current debate, rightfully so. However, I \nbelieve that Governor Leavitt has had other accomplishments in the \nState of Utah that I believe speak to the kind of person and leader \nthat he is. In the area of education, funding for public education has \nincreased by $762 million in 10 years between fiscal years 1994 and \n2004. The number of teachers in the classrooms has increased, teacher \npay has increased, student-to-teacher ratios have decreased and, \nperhaps at least in part to the three previous factors, teacher \nretention has increased. Student SAT scores, and student scores on \nother national tests, have also increased steadily. Initiatives \nintroduced or promoted by Governor Leavitt have increased the number of \nschool options as well. Students wanting to attend Utah public schools \nnow have more options, such as: charter schools, high-tech schools and \nan electronic high school, to enable them to find the educational \nmethod that fits them best.\n  Utah schools are also second in the Nation in Internet accessibility. \nThanks to an initiative called Technology 2000, 99% of Utah's schools \nhave access to the Internet.\n  Higher education funding has also increased. Again, between fiscal \nyears 1994 and 2004, higher ed funding increased slightly over 73%, a \ntotal of $379 million. Student enrollment has increased, as has the \nenrollment of students in engineering, math and computer sciences.\n  Numerous plans to improve the lives and health of families and \nchildren have been implemented. Between the years of 1992 and 2001, \nimmunization rates rose by 73 recent, teen smoking rates fell by 32 \npercent, and teen pregnancy rates fell by 33 percent.\n  Under HealthPrint, a Leavitt plan to increase the number of State \nresidents who are covered by insurance, the numbers of insured persons \nincreased by 404,000. Of these 72,000 were children. Governor Leavitt \nwas also a leader in the push to get us here in Congress to authorize \nthe Children's Health Insurance plan, or CHIP. The numbers of children \ncovered by CHIP in Utah continue to rise.\n  These remarkable achievements could only have been accomplished by \nsomeone who is thoughtful and deliberative, someone who is able to \nconsider all relevant information and make the decision that will be \nbest for the greatest number of people. The strong mark of success the \nGovernor has built in Utah over the past 11 years bodes well for his \nsuccess at the helm of EPA--an agency that employs 18,000 people across \nthe country and an agency that needs a leader like Leavitt. The \ncommitment President Bush has made to improving the environment is \nstrong, clear and unquestionable. Mr. Leavitt will ably serve the \npeople of the United States as he fulfills his oath to meet these \ngoals.\n  I look forward to this evening's vote and to the confirmation of \nGovernor Leavitt. Let's end this hold-up and do just that.\n  Mr. President, this nomination should move ahead, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in voting for cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be divided \nproportionally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to Senator Bennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for the opportunity to speak about \nUtah's Governor. In a way, I hope he will soon not be Utah's Governor \nbecause he has been nominated by the President to be the head of the \nEPA. On the other hand, we will be sorry to lose him as Utah's Governor \nbecause he has done a truly outstanding job. Many of his qualifications \nhave already been discussed here. As I did in the hearing, I would like \nto speak of him a little bit personally so Members of the Senate can \nget an understanding of who he is and what qualifications he brings to \nthis particular assignment.\n  Governor Leavitt and I first became well acquainted when we served \ntogether on a strategic planning group formulated to come up with a \nplan for the Utah State Board of Education. At the time, we were both \nconsiderably younger. He particularly looked quite young. He has the \nadvantage of looking younger than he really is. As the Presiding \nOfficer can relate, those of us who are bald look like we are 60 \nregardless of how old we may be. That is a disadvantage when you are 30 \nor 40. It becomes an advantage when you get beyond 60 because people \nthink you are younger. Governor Leavitt, with a full head of hair, \nstruck me as, frankly, quite a young man when we first got acquainted. \nI thought, What is somebody so young and, by implication, inexperienced \ndoing on this particular committee? As soon as he opened his mouth and \nwe started having a conversation, it became very clear what he was \ndoing on that committee; he was very bright; he was extremely well \ninformed; he had many exciting ideas about what ought to be done with \nrespect to Utah's schools and Utah's education.\n\n  I derived a great sense of respect for him in that situation and said \nto people: This is a young man who has a great future. This is a young \nman who will be doing important things for the State.\n  Then he showed up in my office one day and said he wanted to talk to \nme. When I asked why, he said, Well, I am planning to run for Governor \nand I am here to get your support. I said, Well, I am not going to be \nable to give you my support for Governor because I am planning to run \nfor the Senate, and it is appropriate that I not endorse any candidate \nfor Governor and I understand it is appropriate that you not endorse \nany candidate for the Senate. But we began our campaigns together in \n1992 and went through the gauntlet\n\n[[Page S13240]]\n\nof conventions and primaries that is part of the Utah political scene.\n  I watched him in that situation. I watched him grow. I watched him \nflourish. I watched him get engaged in the battle of ideas and emerge \nfrom a second-place position to the first-place position where he won \nthe nomination, became the candidate, and then in a three-way race for \nGovernor won the governorship.\n  He started out with those same kinds of ideas and energy and \nexcitement I had seen when we were talking about school issues some \nyears before. He has been very inventive as Governor. He has come up \nwith ideas that, frankly, a lot of people scoffed at that have come to \nfruition. He is the driving force, for example, behind the creation of \nthe Western Governors University--a virtual university on line where \npeople can and now have received degrees and graduate degrees that have \nallowed them to improve their economic standing and their professional \nstanding. Not only has he brought the Western Governors University from \nan idea to fruition in a very short period of time, but he has also \nseen to it that the caliber of the material offered by the Western \nGovernors University is of sufficiently high status that it is now \nfully accredited. A degree from the Western Governors University \ncarries the same accreditation as a degree from the University of Utah \nor the University of Kansas or, for that matter, the private \nuniversities such as Harvard, Yale, Stanford, whatever. This is the \nbrainchild and the product of the energy of Michael Leavitt--an idea of \ntaking something that is new in the field and turning it into a final \nproduct.\n  I cite that because I think what we need at the Environmental \nProtection Agency is someone who has some creative ideas and the drive \nto try something new and see it through to fruition. That is Michael \nLeavitt. He is the perfect person for this kind of assignment.\n  I talked to him when the newspapers first broke the idea that he \nmight receive this position and said, Should I call the White House on \nyour behalf and weigh in to say I think you would be good for this job? \nHe said, No, don't bother. He said, They have talked to me about it and \nI have told them I don't have any interest. I said, Why don't you have \nany interest? I was thinking that was probably a good idea on his part, \ngiven the difficulties of this position. He suggested the reason he \ndidn't have any interest was because it seemed to him people were \nlooking for a business-as-usual administrator of the EPA, someone who \nwould continue to go through the motions of previous administrators who \nwent through the motions of the administrators who preceded them. No. \nHe said, I told them if you are thinking about doing something else and \nbreaking some new ground, then call me back. But if all you want to do \nis what you have been doing, I don't have any interest.\n\n  That is a very dangerous thing for a nominee to say because it leaves \nthe door open for them to come back after you have refused the \nposition. Obviously, the folks in the White House--particularly the \nPresident himself--decided they liked the idea of someone who would \nattempt to do something a little differently. They liked the idea of \nsomeone who would try to break new ground, who would use the experience \nhe had had in breaking new ground in State government to see if there \ncould be some changes for the better at the EPA.\n  The President himself got hold of Michael Leavitt. It wasn't just \nsomeone in the personnel office. These two who had served together as \nGovernors sat down and talked about it. I am not privy to that \nconversation, but I am sure Governor Leavitt made the same kind of \npitch he described to me. If all you want, Mr. President, is business \nas usual at EPA, I am not your man. But if you are interested in \nbreaking some new ground and doing things a little differently, then I \nmight consider it.\n  I am assuming that was the conversation which took place between the \nformer Governor of Texas and the then existing Governor of the State of \nUtah. Whatever the conversation, Michael Leavitt has agreed to take on \nthis assignment.\n  I have talked to him since he made that agreement. I am delighted \nwith his attitude. He is excited about it. He is determined to view it \nas a challenge, he is determined to view it as an opportunity, and he \nis determined to go at it with the same vigor and with the same \nenthusiasm he went at his new assignment as Governor of the State of \nUtah.\n  I can think of no better set of qualifications for someone to have in \ntackling the position at EPA than the background Governor Leavitt has \nand the attitude and sense of challenge he possesses. For that reason, \nI was delighted the EPA committee reported this nomination by a 16-2 \nmargin, indicating that even though there are people who had serious \nreservations about the past performance of EPA, they were willing to \ngive Governor Leavitt a chance to show us what will happen with respect \nto the future.\n  I urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to recognize the \nbackground, the enthusiasm, and the attitude this particular nominee \nhas. It would be a great shame if we were to allow this nomination to \nbe derailed because of people's concern about previous administrations \nat EPA. This nomination, as with all appointments, has to do not so \nmuch with the past as with the future.\n  This nomination has to do with the job Michael Leavitt can do, not \nwith the job that some other Administrator may have done. So I am very \nhopeful that in this Chamber we will invoke cloture, we will shut off \ndebate and allow Michael Leavitt to have a vote.\n  If he has a straight up-or-down vote, I think we will see much the \nsame kind of margin we saw in committee with the 16-to-2 vote in favor \nof reporting him to the Senate. I am hoping for a 70- to 80-, even 90-\nMember positive vote in the Chamber to give this young man from Utah an \nopportunity to show the country what he can do in this position.\n  The people from Utah have seen what he can do. He has maintained an \napproval rating 70 to 80 percent normally through his entire period of \ntime as our Governor. I believe he can do the same kind of thing for \nthe country.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for cloture, and then, when it is \ninvoked, to vote for Michael Leavitt.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Dole). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, in looking around, I do not see any \nother speakers, so I would like to be recognized for whatever time I \nshall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First, Madam President, I do rise in strong support--\nstrong support--of Mike Leavitt to be confirmed as Administrator of the \nEPA. I think this vote is long overdue. But for those who have watched \nthis nomination closely, we have seen a spectacle that does not reflect \nfavorably on this institution.\n  Governor Michael Leavitt is a kind, courteous, and decent person. \nEveryone who knows him loves him. Very rarely do you see that in \npoliticians--other than the Presiding Officer, of course. But everyone \nseems to love Mike Leavitt. He is that kind of a person. Yet from day \none his nomination has been delayed and obstructed by partisanship and \nPresidential politics.\n  I watched this play out with real disappointment because the process \nsurrounding these nominations has never succumbed to such pressures. \nToday, we are going to move beyond this obstacle and show to the \nAmerican people what everyone in this debate well knows; that is, \nGovernor Leavitt enjoys overwhelming support from both Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  This process, which has dragged on now for over 50 days, has been \nsomewhat perplexing to me because my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle have nothing but the highest praise for Governor Leavitt.\n  The other day my good friend, Senator Jeffords, the ranking member on \nthis committee, said:\n\n       First of all, it has nothing to do with the qualifications \n     of Mr. Leavitt. I will vote for him and I am hopeful that at \n     the same point I will be able to do so. I look forward to \n     that. I consider him a friend. I have worked with him in the \n     past on matters of education. The issues are not related to \n     his qualifications.\n\n\n[[Page S13241]]\n\n\n  I say to my good friend from Vermont, I appreciate that testament \nvery much.\n  Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat Senator from Nebraska, who is a former \nGovernor who served with Mike Leavitt, wrote a strong letter of support \nfor Governor Leavitt. He said in his letter:\n\n       But beyond his record of achievement for the citizens of \n     Utah, I have also found Governor Leavitt to be easy to work \n     with, open to new ideas, and willing to make sensible \n     compromises to reach shared goals. I believe nearly \n     everyone--if not everyone--with whom Governor Leavitt [has] \n     worked in the NGA [National Governors Association] would \n     state they had a favorable impression of him. As we know all \n     too well, such a record is important for any federal \n     position, but particularly one such as this, where there \n     needs to be much coordination with our State governments. . . \n     .\n\n  Still quoting Democrat Senator Ben Nelson:\n\n       I wholeheartedly support Mike Leavitt's nomination to serve \n     as EPA Administrator. He is eminently qualified for the \n     position; but even more than that, he has both the \n     personality and the desire to be successful at the job.\n\n  As the preceding quotes show, those who have worked with Governor \nLeavitt hold him in the highest regard. Those who have seen his \ndedication and commitment to solving environmental problems all support \nhim.\n  Last week my committee received a letter from Governor Bill \nRichardson, with whom I used to serve over in the House, the Governor \nof New Mexico--another Democrat Governor. This is what he said about \nGovernor Leavitt:\n\n       He has worked effectively with other Governors regardless \n     of party. Obviously the same willingness and ability to work \n     collaboratively with other elected and appointed \n     environmental officials is crucial to the effectiveness of \n     any EPA Administrator.\n\n  Mike Leavitt is a consensus builder and can bring people together.\n  Again, these are things that Democrats say about him. Many have heard \nme recount the details of Governor Leavitt's long distinguished career \nin public service, but considering the circumstances, I think they are \nworth recounting again. His resume is absolutely stellar. He was the \nchairman of the National Governors Association, the Republican \nGovernors Association, the Western Governors Association. His record on \nenvironmental accomplishment reflects his experience. Just look at the \nfacts:\n  Utah meets all Federal air quality requirements. That is very rare. \nUtah meets all Federal air quality requirements. This was not true when \nGovernor Leavitt was first elected. Visibility in the West has improved \ndramatically, largely as a result of Governor Leavitt's service as \ncochairman of the Western Regional Air Partnership and vice chairman of \nthe Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission. The Commission has \nmade over 70 recommendations, improving visibility at 16 national parks \nand wilderness areas in the Colorado plateau.\n  During his 11-year tenure, Governor Leavitt made great strides in \nimproving Utah's water. The State's watersheds are now among the \ncleanest in the Nation. Thirty-seven percent of Utah's streams \ncurrently meet Federal water quality standards compared to 59 percent \n10 years ago, a 24-percent improvement since Governor Leavitt took \noffice 11 years ago. Currently, 60 percent of the Nation's streams meet \nthis standard.\n  I return briefly to the process behind this nomination, because I \nhope we won't repeat it at any time in the future since it was \nunprecedented. Let there be no question that Governor Leavitt was \nsubjected to a double standard. First, prior to Governor Leavitt's \nhearing, the minority demanded that Governor Leavitt answer nearly 100 \nprehearing questions. That was unprecedented.\n  Second, prior to his markup, committee Democrats submitted nearly 400 \nquestions to Governor Leavitt. The Democrats submitted nearly 400 \nquestions to Governor Leavitt. The volume, again, is unprecedented.\n  Let's compare this to the nomination of Carol Browner. In 1993, she \nreceived a mere 67 questions from Republicans. Even Governor Christie \nWhitman, in 2001, received approximately only 100 questions from the \nDemocrats. Let's look at how long it took to approve previous nominees \nto head the EPA. In 1989, the first President Bush nominated William \nReilly. The Senate received his nomination on January 20. The EPW \nCommittee, the committee I chair, had a hearing on January 31 and then \nreported him to the floor on February 2, the same day he was confirmed \nby the Senate. All told, the nomination took just 13 days.\n  How about Carol Browner? The Senate received her nomination January \n20. The EPW Committee actually had a hearing for Ms. Browner on January \n11, 9 days before she was officially nominated. She was reported out by \nthe EPW Committee on January 19, 8 days after the hearing. She was \nconfirmed by the Senate on January 21. From the time of her hearing to \nthe day she was confirmed, just 10 days.\n  Governor Whitman faced a similar path. She was confirmed by the \nSenate just 13 days after nomination. Let's repeat that: Bill Reilly \nwas 13 days; Carol Browner, 10 days; Whitman, 13 days. Governor Leavitt \nhas now waited 55 days. Some on the other side argue that comparisons \nof timing with previous nominees is unfair. In their view those \nnominations were made at the beginning of a new administration, so \nthere is no environmental record to judge. I find this very \ninteresting.\n\n  Here the other side is essentially admitting that the nomination is \nabout President Bush, not about Mike Leavitt because they are talking \nabout President Bush's record. I think that is very unfair. It has \nnothing to do with Mike Leavitt. For weeks we have heard nothing about \nGovernor Leavitt and everything about President Bush. We have heard \nthat under President Bush the air is dirtier, more kids are suffering \nfrom asthma attacks, respiratory diseases; precious lakes, rivers, \nstreams, and forests are more polluted, and big oil's campaign \ncontributions are corrupting national environmental policy.\n  Nothing could be further from the truth. It is all false, empty \nrhetoric extremist groups use to raise money. They conveniently ignore \nthe fact that President Bush has proposed the most aggressive \nPresidential initiatives to reduce pollutants, a 70-percent reduction. \nNo President in history has proposed such a thing. They ignore the fact \nthat he introduced the landmark brownfields legislation which my friend \nfrom Vermont and I were very active in getting through. They ignore \nthat according to EPA, air quality has improved since President Bush \ntook office.\n  Let me mention a couple other things since it seems to be that we \nhave President Bush's record in front of us as opposed to Governor \nLeavitt. First, there couldn't be a better record of any President than \nthe current President Bush.\n  Greg Easterbrook, senior editor for the very liberal New Republic \nmagazine, not a Republican, writing for a liberal publication, writes \nthat ``most of the charges made against the White House are baloney,'' \nmade for ``purposes of partisan political bashing and fund-raising.'' \nHe also contends that ``Environmental lobbies raise money better in an \natmosphere of panic, and so they are exaggerating the case against \nBush.'' In his view, President Bush's new rules for diesel engines and \ndiesel fuel ``should lead to the biggest pollution reduction since the \n1991 Clean Air Act amendment.'' Air pollution, he writes, continues to \ndecline under President Bush.\n  That is not a conservative Republican talking. That is not anyone \nconnected with this administration. That is the other side that is \nnormally critical of Republicans and conservatives.\n  I am very familiar with the Clear Skies Act. I am anxious to get the \nact before the Senate and hopefully Congress will consider it, too. \nThat is a 70-percent reduction in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides \nand mercury. It represents the largest pollution reduction initiative \never proposed by any American President.\n  Clear Skies uses a cap and trade system. This limits the total amount \nof emissions from the utility industry and allows them to determine how \nto achieve these reductions. The bill thus far has been held up by \nenvironmental extremists who are playing politics with the issue of \nCO2. It is unfortunate because this bill will provide \nimmediate health benefits to the American people and reduce acid rain.\n  Air quality has improved immensely over the last 30 years and has \ncontinued since the Bush administration took\n\n[[Page S13242]]\n\noffice. Clear Skies will continue that trend.\n  Cleaner fields and engines: This administration is a consistent \nadvocate of tougher controls on harmful air pollution caused by diesel \nengines. The diesel rule, a rule requiring new heavy duty trucks and \nbuses to run cleaner, will cut harmful pollutions by 95 percent. When \nfully implemented, the controls proposed in the rule will reduce 2.6 \nmillion tons of smog-causing nitrogen oxide emissions each year, and \nsoot or particulate matter will be reduced by 110,000 tons a year.\n  Diesel retrofit is a voluntary partnership program with State, local, \nand industry to reduce mobile source emissions by retrofitting diesel \nengines. Commitments made to retrofit over 130,000 diesel engines in \ntrucks, buses, locomotives, and construction equipment will eliminate \nmore than 200,000 tons of harmful pollution from the air.\n  The Clean School Bus Act USA: This new program highlights the Bush \nadministration's commitment to reducing environmental health risks to \nkids. The program ensures that by 2010, every public school bus in \nAmerica will be cleaner by encouraging the installation of effective \nemissions control systems on buses, replacing older buses with newer \nones and eliminating unnecessary school bus idling. With community, \nindustry and school district commitments, the program would deliver \napproximately 150,000 retrofit vehicles in more than 20 school bus \nprograms.\n  Cutting emissions from nonroad, heavy-duty vehicles: This is \nconstruction, agricultural equipment, and industrial equipment. On \nApril 5 of 2003, the EPA, under President Bush, issued a proposed rule \nthat will result in dramatic pollution reductions from nonroad, heavy-\nduty diesel engines.\n  The nonroad program will prevent over 9,600 premature deaths, 8,300 \nhospitalizations, 16,000 heart attacks, 5,700 children's asthma-related \nemergency room visits, 260,000 respiratory problems in children, and \nnearly a million workdays due to illnesses.\n  Cleaner air through smart enforcement: The EPA and the Department of \nJustice recently settled environmental cases by using smart enforcement \nand compliance tools to address the most significant problems and \nachieve the best environmental results. Settlements included: Virginia \nElectric Power Company, they will spend $1.2 billion to reduce air \npollutants, along with $13.9 million to offset the impact of past \npollution activities.\n  The settlement with Archer Daniel Midland, which had quite a bit of \npublic attention, will mean installing and implementing sweeping \nenvironmental improvements at their plants nationwide, totaling an \nestimated $335 million. Also, Archer Daniel Midland will spend $6.3 \nmillion on supplemental environmental projects, including retrofitting \ndiesel school buses.\n  The ALCOA settlement commits them to installing pollution controls \nand will provide $2.5 million to fund environmental projects, including \n$1.75 million to the Trust for Public Lands.\n  Lion Oil Company will spend more than $21.5 million to install state-\nof-the-art pollution control technologies throughout its refinery. \nAdditionally, the company will pay $348,000 in civil penalties and \nspend more than $450,000 on supplemental environmental projects.\n  It goes on and on.\n  These settlements that took place under the enforcement policies of \nPresident Bush far exceed those under the Clinton administration, in \nboth numbers of settlements and the amount of money involved.\n  On the budget, the President's fiscal year 2004 budget proposal \ncontinues significant funding for cleaner air:\n  $617 million to improve air quality by meeting national ambient air \nquality standards, reducing air toxics, and acid rain--up $2 million \nfrom last year;\n  $326 million for the Coal Research Initiative on cleaner coal \ntechnologies, including $150 million for the President's clean coal \npower initiative. These funds will support public-private partnerships \nto research efficient clean coal technologies, which we need and can \nhave and must have to keep America machine ready;\n  $7 million in new EPA funding for States to conduct air toxics \nmonitoring;\n  $7.2 billion for mass transit, up $479 million from the previous \nyear.\n  They are all up from the Clinton administration. People say President \nBush doesn't have an environmental administration. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  Federal energy score cards: Agencies documented their progress in \nmeeting the various requirements on score cards submitted by the Office \nof Management and Budget in January 2002. The most relevant findings \ninclude: In fiscal year 2001, 10 agencies purchased 632 gigawatt-hours \nof electricity generated from renewable resources--that is what they \nare always talking about--which is more than 3 times the amount \nreported in fiscal year 2000.\n  In other words, the renewable resources reported by this \nadministration are 3 times the last year of the Clinton administration.\n\n  Eleven agencies implemented renewable energy projects during fiscal \nyear 2001, including 60 solar projects, 7 wind projects, and 9 \ngeothermal projects.\n  In fiscal year 2001, agencies invested more than $130 million of \ndirect expenditures in energy efficiency.\n  The President's fiscal year 2003 budget proposal continues \nsignificant funding for cleaner energy: $7.1 billion in tax incentives \nover 10 years for investments in energy-efficiency and renewable energy \nsources, including more than $3 billion for consumers to purchase \nhybrid and fuel cell vehicles.\n  A lot of criticism has come to this President, but he will push the \nfuel cell program because he has a commitment to it.\n  One hundred fifty million dollars is in the budget for a FreedomCAR \nresearch initiative, a new Department of Energy partnership with \nautomakers and researchers, with a long-term vision of hydrogen-powered \nfuel cell vehicles; $1 million for the Department of Transportation to \nimprove fuel economy standards.\n  That is $940,000 more than under the Clinton administration.\n  Cleaner water, protecting water supplies: In response to the \nterrorist acts of September 11, the Bush administration continues to \nwork with States and local communities to protect America's 168,000 \npublic drinking water systems and 16,000 public waste water systems \nfrom terrorist attacks.\n  You know, in the committee that I chair, Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, we have passed out the nuclear security bill and waste water \nsecurity, and last Thursday the Chemical Security Act. They will be \ncoming to the floor and they will become a reality.\n  Under the President's leadership, we are doing our job. We can single \nout one thing the President has done that nobody else has been able to \ndo, which is in the area of brownfields.\n  Fulfilling a campaign pledge, President Bush worked with us to enact \nhistoric, bipartisan brownfields reform legislation, which he signed on \nJanuary 11, 2002.\n  The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization \nAct enacted vital reforms that had been widely sought for years, giving \nStates and local governments greater flexibility and resources to turn \nenvironmental eyesores into productive community assets. It reformed \nimportant elements of the law that had discouraged private investment \nin cleaning up and redeveloping brownfields.\n  You have brownfields in every American city. They are in the process \nof being cleaned up now, thanks to the policy of this President.\n  This legislation will significantly increase the pace of brownfields \ncleanups. President Bush's fiscal year 2004 budget proposal provides \n$210.7 million--more than twice the level of funding prior to the \npassage of this legislation--in support of the brownfields program, \n$180 million of which is for grants for States, tribes, local \ncommunities for cleanup, site assessments, and revolving loan funds.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Trust for Public Land, and others \nendorsed the administration's brownfields proposal. In fiscal year \n2003, the brownfields program has solicited grant applications and is \nin the process of reviewing more than 1,300 responses. The agency plans \nto reward these grants by the fall of 2003.\n  Again, nothing in the previous administration--the Clinton \nadministration--even addressed brownfields. It was all done by this \nPresident.\n\n  Madam President, it goes on and on. I think the environmental \nenforcement record has been unprecedented.\n\n[[Page S13243]]\n\n  The environmental extremists tie enforcement success to the amounts \nof funds collected, legal actions initiated, and enforcement office \nstaffing positions, and cite a reduction of fines collected, a 40-\npercent drop in criminal prosecutions, a 25-percent drop in civil \ncases, and a reduction in enforcement office staff.\n  The success of the Bush environmental enforcement record can be \nmeasured in both the amounts collected in civil penalties and a number \nof criminal judgments, but also, and more importantly, in smart \nenforcement achieving actual environmental results through enforcement \nefforts focusing on significant noncompliers.\n  The fiscal year 2004 budget request includes $503 million for the EPA \nenforcement office. This is the largest amount ever requested for \nenvironment enforcement, and $21 million more funding than fiscal year \n2003.\n  The EPA's 2004 budget proposes an additional 100 positions in the \nenforcement program above the administration's 2003 request.\n  So you can see that none of these accusations are true. It reminds me \nso much of what Hitler did prior to World War II--called the big lie. \nIf you tell a lie and say it with conviction over and over again, \nsooner or later people will believe it. I think that is what has been \nhappening.\n  Smart enforcement: Overall, in the last two fiscal years, EPA and the \nDepartment of Justice enforcement has obtained $8 billion in \nenvironmental remediation, state-of-the-art controls, and safeguards \nthrough enforcement of existing laws. This is the best consecutive 2 \nyears of enforcement of any prior administration on record, including \nthe Clinton administration.\n  In fiscal 2002, the EPA Compliance Assistance Centers provided \nenvironmental technical assistance to more than 673,000 businesses and \nindividuals to help them comply with environmental laws.\n  Fiscal year 2002 saw a 26-percent increase of company self-\ndisclosures of possible environmental violations.\n  From fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2001, the EPA and the Department \nof Justice enforcement nearly doubled the amount spent by violators on \npollution controls and cleanups from $2.6 billion to $4.4 billion.\n  The POPS Program--persistent and organic pollutants--was an agreement \nthe President was able to get. There are seven key types of pollutants \nunder this program. The 12 chemicals in the POPS treaty, including DDT, \nPCBs, and dioxins, are some of the most persistent and dangerous \nchemicals ever manufactured. They are known to cause cancer, \nreproductive disorders, and immune system disruptions in both humans \nand wildlife. We nearly lost the bald eagle because of one of these \nchemicals. Because they are so mobile and accumulate in the food chain, \nabsent international action, they will continue to be a risk to all.\n  This agreement will restrict and eliminate these chemicals, including \nDDT, PCBs, and dioxins, that are some of the most persistent and \ndangerous chemicals ever manufactured.\n  Again, President Bush announced his support for the Stockholm \nConvention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, and legislation has passed \nthe committee. That was never addressed by any previous administration. \nThat is just this administration. Environmental extremists and their \nliberal friends in the press have you believe this President does not \nhave a good environmental record when he has the best record of any \nPresident in history. No President has ever been as good as George W. \nBush.\n  Again, that should not even be a discussion right now, but due to the \nfact we have the nomination of Mike Leavitt coming up and they refuse \nto talk about his record and instead talk about the President's record, \nI thought it was necessary to tell the truth about that record.\n  It is also interesting, there are six holds--so people understand \nwhat we are talking about, a Senator can put a hold on a nomination to \nkeep that person from being confirmed. Of the six holds, four of those \npeople are running for President of the United States. That ought to \ntell you something about the political motivation.\n  Madam President, may I inquire as to the time remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was going to get into another subject, but I have been \ninformed we have two or more speakers coming down who wish to use that \n15 minutes. I was going to talk about what we are going to be dealing \nwith this coming Wednesday--this hoax called global warming. I will not \ndo that now, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I would like to inquire as to our time \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I will yield our 8 minutes to the \ndistinguished junior Senator from Texas, Senator Cornyn, but when \nSenator Jeffords comes in I am going to ask if we can borrow some of \nhis time because we do have one more speaker.\n  For right now, if the Senator is prepared, I yield the remainder of \nour time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to add a few words of my own to \nthe debate about Governor Leavitt's nomination. I have here a chart \nthat I think reflects my concerns about what we have seen happen with \nregard to the nomination of this highly qualified individual to be \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. It says:\n\n       Obstruction, it's not just for judges anymore.\n\n  I have the honor of serving on a number of committees in the Senate, \none of which is the Judiciary Committee where, unfortunately, I have \nbecome somewhat accustomed to controversy and problems relating to \nunprecedented filibusters which have prevented an up-or-down vote when \na bipartisan majority of the Senate actually stands ready to confirm \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. So you can imagine my surprise and \nmy consternation when, in fact, we have seen now the same sort of \nobstructionist tactics that have become, unfortunately, all too common \nin judicial nominations leak over into the deliberations of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  Sadly, rather than working with Governor Leavitt to ensure the EPA is \ndoing all it can and should do to protect this Nation's environment, \nsome in this Chamber have chosen this as an opportunity to score \npolitical points. They have turned to another good nominee as yet \nanother proxy for personal and political battles. It is clear to me \nthey seek to attack an extremely qualified and honorable man in order \nto score political points with various special interest groups.\n  Governor Leavitt's extensive experience and impressive environmental \ngains in his home State of Utah make him eminently qualified to serve. \nIndeed, when Governor Leavitt came before the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, many of my Democratic colleagues noted his \nqualifications. They said, for example, he was ``a person of \nprinciple.'' They held him in ``very high personal regard.'' They \ncalled him ``bright,'' and a ``hard worker,'' who is ``very good at \nbuilding consensus'' and a ``man of integrity.''\n\n  Indeed, I agreed with those characterizations. But rather than \ntreating Governor Leavitt as the qualified nominee he is, some on the \nother side of this aisle have seen fit to give his nomination no \nrespect at all. The reality is obstructing Governor Leavitt's \nnomination only delays strong leadership where we need it dearly, and \nthat is at the helm of the Environmental Protection Agency. Delaying a \nvote to confirm him only delays implementation of programs those of us \nwho are in favor of a cleaner environment would like to see served. \nUnfortunately, many who claim to be pro-environment now find themselves \nin the very ironic position of being anti-environment, from the \nstandpoint of opposing making sure the EPA has the kind of strong \nleadership it needs to navigate a very difficult job.\n\n[[Page S13244]]\n\n  The truth is, political blackmail will not clean our rivers and our \nstreams. Heated rhetoric will not improve our air quality. Jockeying \nfor position during a Presidential primary at the expense of a nominee \nwith a proven record will not protect our children from future \nenvironmental threats.\n  With the exception of greenhouse gases, all air pollutants have been \ndeclining for decades. I direct my comments now to the criticism that \nreally seemed to go not so much to Governor Leavitt but at the \nadministration, at the administration of President George W. Bush. In \nall of the attempts to try to discredit the President and the current \nadministration on environmental issues, you might conclude--or someone \nwho is perhaps not well informed might well conclude--pollution is \nrunning rampant in our country. In fact, the opposite is true. The \ntruth, as I said, is, with the exception of greenhouse gases, all air \npollutants that are tracked by the Environmental Protection Agency have \ndeclined dramatically over the past decades. They have declined under \nPresident Reagan. They declined under President George Herbert Walker \nBush, and President Clinton, and they declined even more under \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  The EPA has done a study and found that thousands of monitoring \nstations across the country have shown a tremendous improvement in our \nenvironment over the last 20 years. Overall, aggregate emissions of the \nsix principal air pollutants have declined by 48 percent since 1970, \ndespite the fact that the American population has grown by 39 percent \nduring that period.\n  Most people reading the newspaper and watching television could be \nexcused if they had the impression that our environment was getting \ndirtier and dirtier, when the truth is it is getting cleaner and \ncleaner. Unfortunately, too many partisans have found it politically \nhelpful to them to mischaracterize the facts.\n  Some critics have recently targeted the President's proposed reforms \nin the New Source Review concerning aging powerplants in the Midwest. \nBut what they neglect to mention is emissions from these very same \nfacilities have been declining at a steady rate, even as electricity \nproduction has increased. Emissions have declined by 40 percent since \n1980. The old 1977 ideas behind New Source Review assume you get \ncleaner air if you impose tighter emissions regulations on newer plants \nrather than old ones. That kind of thinking might work with a car, \nbecause when cars get old, people replace them. But powerplants are \ndifferent. Many old powerplants are still operating, and I believe we \nneed to put common sense back into our environmental policies by \nreforming New Source Review rules. If your plant wants to reduce \nemissions and increase productivity, the Government should not stick \nyou in the eye. It should pat you on the back. But it is not just air \nquality that has improved. All forms of water pollution have declined \nfor decades as well.\n  In 1970, approximately one-third of lakes and rivers in the United \nStates received the Clean Water Act definition of ``safe for fishing \nand swimming.'' Today, nearly two-thirds of lakes and rivers meet that \nstandard.\n  Forested space has also been increasing in acreage--not declining--\nfor more than a decade. Our forests continue to expand under President \nBush, and trees continue to be one of our greatest and best managed \nrenewable resources.\n  Finally, there is this simple fact: No animal species in the United \nStates has fallen extinct since the full implementation of the \nEndangered Species Act in the late 1970s. Indeed, many important \nspecies are now experiencing positive population growth.\n  In the face of these facts, I find it very hard to believe the \nunfounded criticism of this President's commitment to environmental \nprotection. The condition of the environment has improved since \nPresident Bush took office, and it will continue to improve as a result \nof his innovative reforms. It will continue to improve if our \ncolleagues across the aisle will end the politics of obstruction and \nallow the confirmation of this highly qualified nominee who is a wise \nchoice. I have no doubt that he will continue the great progress which \nthis administration has made on environmental issues--seeking the goal \nof cleaner air and safer water for all of us.\n  The extremists in this debate are not seeking balance or commonsense \nsolutions or, in fact, what is best for the American people. Instead, \nthey see this as a zero sum game--a proxy for political interests, and \nthey have chosen obstruction as one of their tactics.\n  Ultimately, this results in political blackmail that just makes \nvictims of us all. Governor Leavitt's reputation falls victim to \nunwarranted and disrespectful attacks, a responsible Senate falls \nvictim to vicious political blather, and the American people fall \nvictim to politicians who are more attracted to serving special \ninterests than the public interest.\n  If the President's critics on the environment are truly committed to \nprotecting and preserving it, they should have put aside their \npolitical agenda and allowed the Senate to vote on Governor Leavitt's \nnomination. Obstruction won't clean the air, protect our rivers and \nstreams, or preserve our environment for future generations.\n  I am sad to say but it is clearly true that when it comes to \nobstruction, it is not just for judges anymore. I urge my colleagues to \nreconsider their tactics, vote to invoke cloture, and allow the \nPresident's nominees to have an up-or-down vote and ultimately confirm \nthis fine nominee, Governor Leavitt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask that the Senator from Florida be \ngiven 15 minutes of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to address the issue of \nthe question of cutting off the filibuster with the motion for cloture \nwhich we will be voting on in a couple of hours.\n  I announce that I think the debate should continue, and I want to \nstate why. I want the manager to know and to hear this directly.\n  I have just spoken to Governor Leavitt by telephone. He is in his \nhome State. I told him of my policy concerns.\n  First of all, I clearly have indicated to him I have the utmost \npersonal respect for him as a public servant, as someone who looks at \nthe best interests of his people. I think he has served with \ndistinction. I think the votes are probably here for the motion for \ncloture to prevail and for him to be confirmed.\n  But there are certain policy questions that ought to be addressed \nbefore the Senate that I think are very important. I am registering my \nfrustration with these policies that are not being enacted; and in \nparticular is the question of funding for the Superfund.\n  What is the Superfund? When I was in the House of Representatives, in \n1980, we passed the Superfund law. It was a recognition that all over \nAmerica are these toxic waste dumps. The most notorious, and one of the \nfirst, was the Love Canal.\n  Because of toxic waste invading the environment, often people are the \nvictims, people who happen to live in the area. We happen to have today \n51 of these toxic waste dumps in my State of Florida. In Florida, the \nhealth hazard and the environmental hazard is compounded because it is \na State with very low elevation and a high water table. These toxic \nwaste dumps that need to be cleaned up are allowed to continue to \nfester and invade particularly the source of drinking water in a place \nsuch as the State of Florida.\n  For example, there is a site about 10 miles west of Orlando--and this \nis a true statement--where a company used to brew DDT in a kind of \nwitches brew, the byproduct of which they used for some chemical \nreason. The problem was, when they brewed this DDT, they let it \noverflow into a natural crevice in the ground.\n  Lo and behold, what did that crevice turn out to be? It turned out to \nbe a sinkhole. And what does the sinkhole do? It goes down into the \nground. And what does that do in a State such as Florida? It goes down \ninto the Floridian aquifer.\n\n[[Page S13245]]\n\n  In addition to spilling over the sides of the sinkhole, it would flow \ndown in the natural contours of the land. And where did that go to? \nInto a little creek that then flowed into Lake Apopka.\n  We used to have an estimated 4,000 alligators in Lake Apopka.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will be happy to yield to the Senator. Let \nme finish. As you can see, I am really into this, and I want to get \nthis picture painted. I will be glad to get into the questions of the \npolicy, but let me complete my statement, if I may.\n  So it flowed down into this creek that flowed into Lake Apopka. The \nestimate of the number of alligators in Lake Apopka today is not 4,000, \nbut 400. Some of those alligators they have captured they find are \nmutated.\n  Now did that come from this witches brew? I am not sure \nscientifically we can actually say that, but it is potentially a cause \nof environmental damage. For the people who live around that toxic \nwaste dump site, there have been health problems cited for years. We \ncannot clean it up because we do not have any money. That is what we \nget back to: the money.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives, in 1980, we enacted the \nSuperfund law and we said: We are going to provide a fund for these \nhundreds of toxic waste dumps all over the country that cannot be \ncleaned up because the owner of the dump has now gone bankrupt or has \nleft town and there is no one financially responsible to clean up the \ndump.\n  The trust fund would be there so when we did not have a financially \nresponsible party that could pay for cleaning up the toxic waste site, \nwe would have a fund to which we could go. The fund has dwindled and \nthe taxpayer has to pay more and more of the costs of cleaning up \norphan Superfund sites. Congress-requested studies of the future needs \nof the program indicate that this Administration has not allocated the \nresources necessary to meet the needs of the Superfund sites and \ncommunities throughout the country. In the 1990s, the Superfund fee on \npetroleum, chemical feedstocks and corporate income lapsed. As a \nresult, the only place we have now to go to replenish the fund is the \ngeneral revenues of the U.S. Government. You realize how difficult that \nis to get the money required to address the many orphaned hazardous \nwaste sites across the country, particularly when we are running \ndeficits to the tune of a half a trillion dollars a year; that is, \npaying $500 billion more than we have coming in tax revenue so we have \nto go out and borrow the difference. Therefore, the funding of any \nprogram is more difficult.\n  It is that policy difference that I have with this administration and \nthe White House. That is why I came to the floor to register my concern \nas we debate the nomination of Governor Leavitt as the new EPA \nAdministrator. It has nothing to do with him as a person. I think he is \na very fine person. It has nothing to do with the person-to-person \nmeeting I had with him, asking him about setting forth his ideas on the \nSuperfund trust fund I have just discussed. Of course, he can't \ncontradict the White House. He cannot contradict the Vice President and \nthe President who have already set their policy that they do not want \nto fill the trust fund, that they want to do it by general revenue \nappropriations. I think that is a serious mistake.\n  I had asked Governor Leavitt about a number of other issues affecting \nmy State of Florida and I appreciate the response I received from the \nActing Administrator as directed by Gov. Leavitt: EPA is moving the \nright way on arsenic-treated wood also called CCA, chromium copper \narsenate, with regard to residential uses and playground uses.\n  I told Gov. Leavitt about two of the toxic waste sites in Pensacola. \nI told him about a concern with a phosphate plant and the health \nconditions people are reporting in East Hillsborough County. They have \nresponded to all of those. But with regard to the main concern of the \npolicy difference on the trust fund, I must register my protest.\n  Would the Senator from Oklahoma, who is my dear friend and who takes \nthe opposite side on this issue, like to engage in some conversation on \nthis? I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to ask my good friend from Florida: At the \nvery beginning of his remarks, he said the money isn't there. I wanted \nto make sure he was aware, which I think he is, that the Bush request \nfor 2004 is the second largest request since the date he mentioned \nbeing on the floor in 1980. I was not here until 1984. But right now \nhis request is $1.38 billion. I first ask if the Senator is aware of \nthat.\n  Secondly, as far as the tax is concerned, we have never left the idea \nof polluter pays. Right now, polluter pays. In 70 percent of the cases, \nif there is a polluter who can be identified, the polluter pays. The \nproblem you are coming up with, when you talk about the tax--which \nexpired in 1995 under the Clinton administration, and President Clinton \ndid not ask for its reinstatement or for a tax--is that that is not \npolluter pays. That takes care of some orphan cases, either general \nfunds or that tax.\n  Is that fair, to have businesses paying into a fund that pays for \npollution cleanup that they didn't cause? That is a bad policy to do \nthat. I wanted to be sure we were talking about the same thing.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. He is my \nfriend, and he knows I love him. We can engage in this kind of dialogue \nwith a smile on our faces because we are personal friends. But I have a \nsignificant difference of opinion with the Senator from Oklahoma. This \nAdministration has not devoted the resources necessary to clean up the \nmany orphaned sites in Florida that depend upon the now almost bankrupt \nSuperfund trust fund.\n  In each one of these cases I have indicated, two in Escambia County, \none west of Orlando--I could take you through the other orphan sites in \nthe State of Florida--the only source of revenue we will have to clean \nup these sites is the American taxpayer, unless we reimpose the fee \nthat was part of the deal that was struck in 1980 with the oil \ncompanies.\n  I would just say in response to my good friend that if the \nadministration is requesting additional general revenue, then I say \nhooray for the administration. But, that is not going to solve the \nproblem of hundreds of these sites around the country. You have to have \nthat source of revenue, particularly with the dire financial condition \nthis country is facing, where this country is going into bankruptcy by \nour deficit financing each year to the tune of a half trillion dollars. \nWe are just not going to be able to get the funds to clean up these \nsites that are so personal to the communities in which they are \nlocated.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate my friend, because he is my friend, yielding \nfurther. The point I want to get across is that according to EPA \nfigures--this was true back in the previous administration also--70 \npercent of those cleanups are paid for by the polluter. It is \ninaccurate to imply that they are not doing it. When you let a tax \nexpire, as they did in 1995--again, this is not a partisan thing \nbecause that happened during the Clinton administration--that is a tax \non businesses that has nothing to do with polluters. These are not \npolluters who are paying this tax. They could be anyone out there. But \nthe fact is that this administration is making the request for $1.38 \nbillion and the fund is there.\n  You can talk about Florida all you want. I ask my friend from Florida \nif he is aware that the most devastating Superfund site in America is \nin my State of Oklahoma. No one else is even close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Florida has \nexpired. The time yielded to the Senator from Florida has expired. Does \nthe Senator from Vermont continue to yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may continue.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I will continue to yield to my friend. I want \nto respond to him.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No one is more concerned about devastating sites than I \nam. I would say this. We are going to correct it. We are in the process \nof cleaning it up. A lot of the funding is not going to be coming from \nthe Superfund that is in place right now. Nonetheless, it is going to \nbe cleared up. The point is this. It was a tax that expired during the \nClinton administration. The Clinton administration did\n\n[[Page S13246]]\n\nnot want to renew it and never made an effort to. This administration \nhas never made an effort to renew it because it is wrong. It is bad \npublic policy to pass a tax for people to pay for pollution cleanups \nthat they didn't cause. It is as simple as that.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding for questions.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. It is my pleasure, of course.\n  This is what sharpens ideas, when you can throw ideas out and have \nthem discussed in the marketplace of public discussion. I respond to my \nfriend by saying, of course, he has heard of the sites that are known \nas orphan sites. These are toxic waste sites that do not have a \nfinancially responsible party that you can go to in order to get the \nmoney to clean it up.\n  Therefore, the whole idea of the 1980 Superfund law was to provide a \nsource of funding for these orphan sites so that you can get them \ncleaned up, so that the community as a whole can be protected from a \nhealth standpoint. I cited just one site in Florida which was west of \nOrlando. I can cite another. For example, in Pensacola we have what is \nknown as ``Mount Dioxin.'' It is a former wood-treating plant. The site \nof that old plant is so toxic that an entire neighborhood subdivision \nlocated next to it had to be evacuated. It is deserted; it is fenced \noff. Only now are we having to go back and appropriate additional \nmoneys to get to the health department as they do an outreach to try to \nfind the people who used to live in that neighborhood, to get them to \ncome in for their health checks.\n  Believe it or not, in the flatlands of Florida--in this case, \nPensacola--this turgid, infested soil called Mount Dioxin is exactly \nthat. They have it piled up to the tune of about 40 feet high, with a \ntarpaulin strung over it, trying to contain all of this toxic waste. My \ngoodness, can you imagine a major hurricane coming up the mouth of \nPensacola Bay, straight for the city of Pensacola, and start tearing up \nMount Dioxin, spreading that all over the city and Escambia County? \nThen you have another health hazard on your hands.\n  I don't want to wait, as the Acting Administrator of the EPA has done \nEPA's best in telling me next year they are going to come up with a \nplan to take down Mount Dioxin, to grade it to ground level, and try to \nfigure out how they are going to dispose of it. It is another hurricane \nseason we are going to have to go through. If we had a source of \nfunding, EPA could so quickly and so much more efficiently go on about \nthe task of cleaning up that site.\n  As you can see, I feel pretty strongly about this. I tried to \nregister this with Governor Leavitt a few minutes ago in my \nconversation with him on the telephone. I tried to register it with him \na couple months ago in my direct face-to-face conversation with him. \nBut he is shackled because of the policy requirements of the White \nHouse; that is, that they not fund this trust fund with the original \nSuperfund fee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Florida \nfor bringing the real world into our discussion here and letting the \ncountry and all of us recognize the tremendous problems that exist. His \nare some of the most astounding problems we have, but they are \nthroughout the country.\n  If we don't do something, the lives of thousands of people are going \nto be affected; they are going to end up being dead or very ill. So \nthat is what we are talking about today. It is incredibly important to \nfind a solution, and I thank the Senator for his contribution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the Senator from Illinois 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor with a genuine concern \nabout this appointment by the Bush administration. When President Bush \nfirst appointed Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey as the head \nof the EPA, many of us breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that she \nhad an extraordinarily good record as Governor of New Jersey when it \ncame to environmental issues, understanding that when she came to \nWashington, she would be up against some massive special interest \nforces who, frankly, believe that environmental law is too strong, \nwrong, and that the special interests should have a lot more say in the \ndecisionmaking.\n  I voted for Christine Todd Whitman because I had hope she would bring \nbalance to an administration that might be pushed too far toward the \nspecial interest groups. On many occasions, she lived up to that \naspiration and hope on my part. I met with her several times, discussed \nimportant issues, publicly and privately. I was encouraged by the \nthings she said.\n  But it became apparent after a while that, despite her strong \ncredentials on the environment, they were no match to the force of \nspecial interests when it came to the Bush administration on \nenvironmental policy. Time and again, the EPA came down on the wrong \nside when it came to protecting the environment. The list is extremely \nlong. I will not go through all of it in detail. But this was the first \nPresident--President Bush--to oppose polluter fees to pay for cleaning \nup toxic waste sites since Superfund became law. In Illinois and across \nAmerica, Superfund waste sites are there still, today, creating toxic \nemergencies and public health hazards across America because President \nBush doesn't want the polluting industry to pay to clean them up. That \nis a fact. That happened in the EPA with Christine Todd Whitman. It \ncould have been one of the reasons she left.\n  This President slashed the EPA enforcement staff by over 100 \nemployees. So there will be fewer men and women keeping an eye on toxic \npolluters in America. The administration also entered into arrangements \ncrafting an energy plan rich with subsidies for the oil and gas \nindustry and devoid of any fuel efficiency standards for America's cars \nand trucks. A recent GAO report found that President Bush's OMB is \nchanging environmental regulations, often without disclosing these \nactions to the public.\n  The President has refused to act on global warming despite recent \nreports that ice levels in many parts of the world are low, threatening \nthe polar bear and other species with extinction.\n  Now we have the successor of Christine Todd Whitman presented, \nMichael Leavitt of Utah. I have never met him, so I cannot say I have \nany personal knowledge of who he is or what he stands for. I can only \nlook at his record as Governor of Utah. The record is not encouraging. \nIn fact, with his administration, Utah recently tied for last place in \nClean Water Act enforcement and ranked first in the Nation for toxic \nwaste release. Imagine, the nominee for the EPA's top post is coming \nfrom a State that ranked No. 1 in the Nation for toxic waste release, \nand a State that tied for last place in the Clean Water Act \nenforcement. What does that tell you about his conscience and his \nconcern when it comes to the environment? It doesn't give me a good \nfeeling and hope that he will have any of the strength that Christine \nTodd Whitman had to stand up against the polluters and against the \nspecial interest groups and stand up for the environment in America.\n\n  That is a sad commentary on this nominee to this critically important \nposition. At this point, many colleagues on the committee and others in \nthe Senate have raised important questions, and many answers have not \nbeen given as to why the decision was made by the Republican leadership \nto move this through. Some say that timing has to do with a lawsuit on \nfile in Utah. I have no idea why we have to do this today. That, \nfrankly, is a decision made by the Republican leadership.\n  I will tell you that I think it is a sad commentary that a Republican \nParty, with distinguished and rich history leaders such as Teddy \nRoosevelt, who had the foresight to provide Federal protection to \nalmost 230 million acres of land, is considering the appointment of a \nGovernor of Utah to the EPA who has turned his back on the preservation \nof wilderness areas in his own home State. But that is a fact. That is \na matter of record.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this very carefully. If you believe \nthe Bush administration's policy on environmental protection is a good \none, vote yes for Governor Leavitt. If you believe they have moved \nforward in making America safer when it comes to clean water and less \ntoxic ways, vote for Governor Leavitt. But if you believe, as I do, \nthat this policy and this approach have been wrong--and, frankly, I \nbelieve this nominee has not presented us with evidence that he will\n\n[[Page S13247]]\n\nfight to change the Bush administration record on the environment. \nSadly, his record as Governor of Utah is pointed in the opposite \ndirection. For that reason, I am forced to oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think I probably misunderstood the Senator. Did you say \nthat the polluter pays policy has disappeared, is not in existence now?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Virtually gone.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Are you aware that 70 percent of the cleanups are paid \nfor by the polluter today?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator knows better than that I do that when you \nstop taxing the polluting industry, you stop creating a fund to clean \nup the sites. The Superfund toxic sites are, frankly, just sitting \nthere. Nothing is being done because the money is not being collected \nin the Superfund for enforcement.\n  The reason is, this administration said we are going to have a hands-\noff policy when it comes to the polluting industry. Any money going \ninto Superfund has to come from the general tax fund, and then as a \nconsequence of their budget there is no money in the fund. So this \nSuperfund approach is a dream come true for polluting industries. This \nis the first President, Democrat or Republican, to turn his back on the \nresponsibility of polluting industries to clean up toxic waste and, \nfrankly, it appears that Governor Leavitt wants to continue that \npolicy.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is the Senator aware that the tax to which he is \nreferring went out in 1995 during the Clinton administration; it was \nnot requested to be renewed at any time during the remainder of the \nClinton Presidency, nor has it since that time? Secondly, the reason is \nthat the policy that you should pass a tax on business to pay for \npollution cleanup that they had nothing to do with is not a fair \npolicy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response, and my time is probably running out, \nthere was an adequate balance in the Superfund to go forward during the \nClinton administration because of the collections from these polluting \nindustries. Now that that Superfund is virtually bankrupt and without \nfunds, what the Bush administration has said is we would not dare ask \nthe polluting industries. Instead, we ask every taxpaying family and \nbusiness in America to pay for Superfund cleanup. That is fundamentally \nunfair.\n  Why should ordinary taxpayers face the responsibility of pollution \nand toxic waste created by an industry? The Superfund, which has been \nsupported by Democratic and Republican Presidents, and rejected by this \nPresident, I think was a fair approach. Because this President will not \nfund it and because he will not come back and ask for the polluting \nindustries to pay, there is no money for the Superfund cleanup.\n  What do we have left? We have the stern policy from the \nadministration and a new administrator who says he supports it. The \nresult of it? More toxic waste sites in my State, perhaps in the \nSenator's, that are there to endanger public health. How can that \npossibly be in the best interest of America?\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senate will yield further?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The policy is what I was trying to get to. First, it is a \nfact that the tax ran out during a Democratic administration, that of \nPresident Clinton. Secondly, the policy to say let's pass a tax on any \nbusiness out there, or any industry out there, whether or not they \npollute anything, and they have to pay for whomever is polluting, when \ntoday 70 percent of the cleanup--these are the figures--are being paid \nfor by those who are polluting, it is a polluters' pay policy that is \nworking today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will reclaim my time and say to the Senator, if I am \nnot mistaken, the period of time when the tax was not reinstated was a \nperiod of time when the Republicans were in control of Congress.\n  Stepping aside from that for a moment, the Senator from Oklahoma is \ngifted in this area, understands it better than most and understands \nhow little is being done today because there is no money in the \nSuperfund to pay for the toxic cleanup. So as a consequence, this \nadministration neither puts the revenue in the budget nor reinstates \nthe tax on polluters and basically says we are going to turn a blind \neye to toxic waste sites across America, which endanger the water \nsupply of communities all across the board.\n  How can that be right for our children or the families who are \nunwittingly being exposed to this kind of pollution? That is the kind \nof policy which we need to oppose and, frankly, it is the kind of \npolicy which I am afraid Governor Leavitt supports and that is why I \ncannot support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  The Senator from Vermont controls the time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 34 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New York as \nmuch time as she may consume, up to the max.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the EPW \nCommittee, my friend and colleague, Senator Jeffords, for his \nleadership on these environmental issues that we are considering today. \nI am also very appreciative of the opportunity to speak to the \nnomination of Governor Leavitt to be the Administrator of the EPA on a \nparticular issue of grave concern to me and to my constituents.\n  On August 21, 2003, the inspector general of the EPA issued a report \nwhich raised serious questions about the EPA's response to the collapse \nof the World Trade Center buildings on September 11. In that report--I \nhave a copy here--the EPA IG concluded that the White House had \nmodified several EPA press releases regarding air quality in New York \nthat made them overly reassuring to the public.\n  Second, the IG raised a number of questions about the adequacy of the \nEPA's testing and cleanup program to address indoor air quality \nconcerns in New York.\n  These findings, as my colleagues know, were very disturbing to New \nYorkers, the people I represent, who went through so much on September \n11 and performed so magnificently, not only in the heroic responses by \nour firefighters, our police, our EMTs, and others, but also in the \nresilience and the extraordinary reactions of so many citizens--the \nconstruction workers who dropped their tools in one borough in uptown \nManhattan to rush down to help, the utility workers, the volunteers, \nthe transit workers, the people who got the stock exchange up and \ngoing. It was just an extraordinary demonstration of the spirit and \ncourage of the people of New York and America.\n  So it was troubling when New Yorkers had to ask themselves: Can we \ntrust our Government? Can we rely on the information we are given when \nit comes to matters of such critical importance as the air we breathe?\n\n  It was especially troubling because we already knew that hundreds and \nhundreds and hundreds of the first responders who came to the Towers, \nwho stayed at the pile, who worked day after day, were suffering from \nwhat was called the World Trade Center cough, which really was asthma \nor bronchial problems or pulmonary distress or RADS, which is the \nreactive air disorder syndrome.\n  Then we began hearing about people who had gone back to work and \npeople who had returned to their homes in the affected area who were \nsimilarly suffering. So it was a very troubling report. It raised a \nnumber of questions to which I and others sought answers.\n  So on August 26 I wrote to the President, along with my colleague, \nSenator\n\n[[Page S13248]]\n\nLieberman, because Senator Lieberman had been the chairman of the \nappropriate subcommittee of the environment committee that permitted us \nto hold a hearing in lower Manhattan in February of 2002 to try to \nbegin to get answers to these issues long before the inspector general \ntalked about them. Senator Lieberman and I joined together to write a \nletter to the President, asking for answers to the questions raised by \nthe IG report. In particular, we wanted more details about what was \nclaimed in the IG report to constitute interference by the White House \nwith the EPA over the public information that was made available to the \npeople of New York and the surrounding area.\n  We also wanted some reaction about the recommendations the IG made.\n  For people who are watching at home, IG stands for inspector general. \nGovernment departments have these offices. They are independent of \nwhatever political administration is in power at the time, and they are \nsupposed to look after the public interest and keep an eye on the \npeople who are in government positions.\n  So the EPA Inspector General had raised all of these questions about \nthe adequacy of the cleanup which the EPA had carried out, and, \nfrankly, recommended some additional steps be taken.\n  On September 5, I received a reply from the EPA acting administrator. \nFrankly, it did not respond to the concerns we raised. It was quite \ndefensive in tone, which I regretted because I think we are all in this \ntogether, trying to figure out how we get the best information to take \nthe most appropriate actions to protect the health of people. The \nletter on September 5 was basically a recitation of all the positive \nactions the EPA had taken, many of which I agree were positive actions. \nBut that was not what was at issue.\n  On September 5 of last month, we got that response. Then we quickly \nwrote again to the President, reiterating the demand for answers and \nactions. But still we got no response. I regretted that because I think \nthis is an issue larger than even the horrors of September 11 and the \naftermath. It really went to the heart of how we can trust the \ninformation and the reliability of the information we receive from our \nGovernment, especially in times of crisis.\n  When Governor Leavitt was nominated for the position of Administrator \nof the EPA, I made it clear to Governor Leavitt, to my colleagues on \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, and to the public I would \nput a hold on Governor Leavitt's nomination. At that moment it was the \nonly means available to a single Senator to get the attention of the \nWhite House and to demonstrate the seriousness I believed these issues \ndemanded.\n  I met privately with Governor Leavitt, whom I have known for quite \nsome time. I have a high regard for him. I have known both the Governor \nand his wife Jackie for a number of years. I knew from my conversations \nwith him that he listened very carefully and was quite sympathetic with \nthe concerns I was raising. Obviously, as a nominee he had no authority \nto commit the administration to doing anything. But I did believe he \nwas open to the arguments I was making and the findings of the \ninspector general.\n  Because of the hold I placed on Governor Leavitt, and the \nconversations I had with the Governor and the White House personnel \nassigned to shepherd his nomination through the Senate, I began \nnegotiations with the White House Council on Environmental Quality. CEQ \nit is called. CEQ is the office within the White House that tries to \nride herd over environmental policies, to advise the President on these \nissues, and to work with the EPA. We learned because of some documents \nrequested by Senator Jeffords that it was the CEQ, the White House \nCouncil on Environmental Quality, which had indeed made the \nrecommendations and issued the orders to the EPA to change their press \nreleases in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. That was the entity within \nthe White House that made those determinations.\n  I appreciate Senator Jeffords' efforts to obtain those documents \nbecause they answered my questions. I didn't get answers from the EPA \nor the White House directly, but indirectly because of the excellent \nwork of Senator Jeffords and his staff I did get my questions answered.\n\n  It is very clear there were some quite tense conversations, including \nsome real shouting matches between the CEQ White House personnel and \nthe EPA personnel over what should or shouldn't be in those press \nreleases.\n  When I met with the head of the Council on Environmental Quality, a \ngentleman by the name of Jim Connaughton, I raised my concerns about \nthe process that was underway in the aftermath of 9/11, that we needed \nto learn some lessons from that process; it didn't work; and I \nunderstand very well how there can be competing tensions between the \nWhite House and a government agency, but I think we need to learn from \nthat. I was heartened by Mr. Connaughton's openness and his willingness \nto frankly admit this was unprecedented. We didn't know how we were \ngoing to behave in the face of such a horrific attack. Thankfully, it \nnever happened again, and we hope it will never, ever again. But we \nhave to be better prepared.\n  To the first part of my inquiry about answers I wanted about who in \nthe White House did this and how it all unfolded, we were able to \nobtain quite a bit of information. Clearly the Council on Environmental \nQuality, working with the National Security Council and others in the \nWhite House, made some calls that may not have been the best judgment \ncalls. But now we can take a look at those in sort of a calmness of \nsome distance and realize we have to change that process. We should not \nbe interfering with information that goes directly to the public and \nwhich will enable members of the public to make decisions that are \nright for them. The answer part of who did what and how this all \nhappened we began to be able to piece together.\n  We also started discussions with the White House concerning the \nadditional steps that need to be taken. Here we wanted to try to get a \nprocess started that would look at the inspector general's \nrecommendations and implement them, and go even further to try to \ndetermine what we know, what we don't know, and what actions we should \ntake to get to the bottom of this very thorny question of indoor air \ncontamination. This is a new issue for most of us. We have been \nfocusing on cleaning up the air on the outside. But increasingly what I \nam hearing from so many people in New York and around the country is we \nhave to do more on indoor air.\n  What happened after 9/11 is the EPA originally said, This is not \nwithin our responsibility. We are not responsible for following up on \nindoor air. That is the city's responsibility. The city of New York \nsaid they did not know what they were supposed to do on indoor air. In \nfact, before the hearing Senator Lieberman and I held in February of \n2002, a witness appeared from the city who was very candid, and said, \nWe were given this responsibility for indoor air. We don't do indoor \nair.\n  Through a long process of negotiations, finally in June of 2002 the \nEPA took responsibility for running the testing to determine if there \nwas continuing contamination of the indoor air in residences and \nworkplaces. Unfortunately, because this had never been done before, \nthere were a lot of holes in the process. There were a lot of missteps \nin the process.\n  Again, I think that is something we should learn from. I give great \ncredit to my colleagues who represent Lower Manhattan--Congressman \nJerry Nadler, who was just absolutely focused day in and day out in \ntrying to get the EPA first to do this indoor air testing and then to \ndo it right. All along Congressman Nadler said this is not being done \nright. We are going to find out after they go home and they say they \nhave done what they are supposed to do that there are still all kinds \nof contamination that have been left and that is going to have an \nincreasing impact on people who live and work in these buildings.\n  Sure enough, the testing that went on demonstrated the cleanup was \nnot adequate and, unfortunately, because it was sort of haphazard and \nrandom, one apartment would be cleaned up but the apartment next door \nwouldn't be, or the apartments would be cleaned up in the building but \nthe heating and air conditioning wouldn't be. So it never really got \nthe attention and the standardization that it needed. That is why\n\n[[Page S13249]]\n\nthe inspector general recommended a number of additional steps to be \ntaken.\n\n  So we began this process of negotiating with the White House over \nwhat would or should be done, and I must say it was a very positive \nprocess. My staff, Senator Lieberman's staff, the White House Council \non Environmental Quality, the EPA, and others have been working \ntogether now for several weeks.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand it, the distinguished minority floor \nmanager wants to have a UC.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we need to advise Senators of what is going \nto take place at 5:30. There has been a change in the schedule to be \nannounced shortly by the Senator from Oklahoma. It is my understanding \nthat following the statement of the Senator from New York, the Senator \nfrom Utah wishes to speak for up to 5 minutes on the Leavitt matter.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, if I could have 5 minutes to speak before \nthe vote on the judge this evening.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Oklahoma go ahead with the UC?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask the distinguished Senator from New York if she \nwould finish so I would have at least 5 or 6 minutes before the vote?\n  Mr. REID. If we have to extend the vote on the judge for a couple \nminutes, we can do that.\n  Will the Senator go ahead with the UC? We will make sure everybody is \ncovered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Utah reserved the right to object. I ask if he is objecting.\n  Mr. HATCH. No, I am not objecting, with the understanding that I ask \nunanimous consent that before the vote on the judge this evening, I be \ngiven 6 minutes to speak.\n  Mr. REID. How long?\n  Mr. HATCH. Six minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York has the floor.\n  I say to the Senator from New York, we are in no way trying to speed \nup your speech. How much longer do you anticipate speaking?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I will end my remarks so that the Senator from Utah \nwill have 6 minutes prior to the 5:30 vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is acceptable. I modify my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled \ncloture vote be vitiated and, further, that at 9:30 tomorrow morning \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Leavitt nomination and there \nthen be 60 minutes equally divided between the chairman and the ranking \nmember or their designees, with 20 minutes of the minority time under \nthe control of Senator Lautenberg. I further ask consent that following \nthat debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination, with no intervening action or debate, provided that \nfollowing that vote, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that this evening at 5:30 the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the confirmation of Calendar No. 424, the \nnomination of Dale Fischer to be U.S. District Judge for the Central \nDistrict of California; further, that following that vote the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then \nresume legislative session.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure this includes Senator \nHatch's request for 6 minutes before the vote on the judge. I would \nalso ask, Mr. President, if Senator Leahy wishes to speak for up to 2 \nminutes prior to the vote on the judge, that he be allowed to do so, \nalong with 2 minutes for the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, over the last several weeks we have been in \nnegotiations with the White House over the serious matters concerning \nthe cleanup and the continuing threat of contamination in residences \nand workplaces in Lower Manhattan.\n  Today, we have reached an agreement and I have received a commitment \nto action from the White House to address these indoor air quality \nconcerns.\n  Now, this is not everything I would have wished for. It is not \nexactly what the inspector general has recommended. And I will continue \nto work with the White House and the EPA to make sure we go wherever \nthe evidence leads us and that we have independent, outside validation \nof whatever it is the EPA does. But we have reached agreement with the \nWhite House for additional testing to verify that residences that have \nbeen cleaned have not been recontaminated.\n  In addition, the White House has committed to forming an expert panel \nconsisting of both Government experts and outside experts to reevaluate \na range of issues raised by the inspector general's report.\n  I believe this is an important step forward in addressing the \nconcerns raised by New Yorkers about the safety of the air we breathe. \nIt is not enough--I want to make that absolutely clear--it is not \nenough, but it is a step forward, and I believe it will provide a venue \nin which all of our concerns can be addressed.\n  In the spirit that led us to this agreement reached by my office with \nthe White House Council on Environmental Quality, I will be voting for \nGovernor Leavitt when his nomination comes before the Senate because I \nintend to work closely with him as we implement this agreement on which \nthe White House has signed off.\n  I know there are many who will say: but it is not everything we \nshould have gotten. And I agree with that absolutely. If I could have \nwritten it myself, I would have adopted all of the inspector general's \nrecommendations. But on the other hand, we now have a process and a \nvenue in which to discuss these matters and to try to make progress \ntogether.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for working with me on this effort. I also \nthank Senator Voinovich for being very understanding and sympathetic \nabout this issue and working with me on important legislation that, \nunder our chairman, the Senator from Oklahoma, we have passed out of \nthe committee which I hope will receive favorable floor action sometime \nin the next several weeks because it will help to avoid these problems \nin the future.\n  One of our big problems was nobody was quite sure who was in charge \nof indoor air. There had been an Executive order signed a couple years \nbefore which seemed to suggest the EPA was, but that was not \nstatutorily clear. We needed to figure out where the State and the city \nfit.\n  So what Senator Voinovich and I have done is to put together, in \nlegislation, the authority for the President to make these decisions, \nand to be clear about them, so we do not end up with all of these \nconcerns about who is responsible and who have to be the front people \nand who does the testing. We should put that behind us. I hope we can \nact on the legislation Senator Voinovich and I have put forward.\n  I also thank Senator Reid, who is a long-time friend of the Leavitt \nfamily and who shares my hope that Governor Leavitt will be the kind of \nAdministrator of EPA with whom all of us on both sides of the aisle can \nwork, and that we will see the EPA once again being the agency in the \nGovernment that sets and implements environmental policy.\n  Again, I thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership and his deep \nconcern about these issues.\n  I also thank my colleague, Congressman Jerry Nadler, for his vigorous \nadvocacy on behalf of New Yorkers and on making it clear every step of \nthe way what the shortfalls and the inadequacies in the process adopted \nby the EPA turned out to be. Congressman Nadler has been a very staunch \nally in this effort to get to this point.\n  Just a few minutes before I came to the floor, I received a letter \nfrom the Executive Office of the President, Council on Environmental \nQuality, signed by James L. Connaughton. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter be printed in the Record, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S13250]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Council on \n           Environmental Quality,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 2003.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Clinton and Lieberman: I appreciate the \n     opportunity to respond to your September 9th letter, building \n     on the subsequent constructive discussions that I have had \n     with Senator Clinton and that our respective staffs have had \n     concerning your questions about lower Manhattan air quality \n     in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks and subsequent \n     efforts the government has undertaken to further assure \n     public health and safety. This letter sets out our \n     understanding following those staff discussions.\n       The tragedy of September 11th was unprecedented in its \n     scope. The complexity of the situation facing the local, \n     state and federal governments in responding to this terrorist \n     attack was immense--the work by all was heroic.\n       The Environmental Protection Agency working with the \n     Council on Environmental Quality, OSHA and the State and City \n     of New York, did their utmost to communicate the best \n     available information accurately, and in a timely fashion to \n     meet the needs of lower-Manhattan residents, workers and \n     businesses. Their safety, health and well-being were our \n     greatest concerns, and remain so today. The information was \n     communicated through a variety of methods, including press \n     releases, direct communications with residents and media \n     interviews with federal, state and local officials. We \n     continue to stand by the information distributed in press \n     releases regarding potential long-term health risks. The EPA \n     Inspector General reported that the experts her office spoke \n     to generally confirmed that EPA's draft risk evaluation \n     tended to support EPA's statements on long-term health \n     effects.\n       As we discussed, the federal government's communications in \n     September of 2001 were conveyed real-time in complex and \n     fast-moving circumstances. In all instances, we acted with \n     the best available data at the time, and updated our \n     communications and actions as new data was coming in. We all \n     learned a great deal in the aftermath of September 11th, \n     including how to improve our response and communciations \n     efforts. Given a situation with the uncertainty and emotions \n     such as followed the World Trade Center attacks, we recognize \n     that we can communicate best through a focused, civil, and \n     collaborative effort. After September 11th, EPA conducted a \n     ``lessons learned'' exercise and, in conjunction with the new \n     Department of Homeland Security, improved its emergency \n     response and crisis communications system, improvements \n     that were successfully put to test in the swift and well-\n     coordinated response to the space shuttle Columbia tragedy \n     in February.\n       In her prior letter to you, Acting Administrator Horinko \n     outlined many actions the EPA is continuing to take in \n     response to this tragedy. Ms. Horinko described the \n     substantial amount of monitoring, cleaning and re-cleaning \n     already conducted, the coordination between EPA, FEMA and \n     OSHA on indoor cleanup, OSHA's commitment to continue to \n     investigate complaints of dust exposure from workers in \n     commercial establishments, and EPA's ongoing focus on \n     residences.\n       In my meeting with Senator Clinton, we discussed at length \n     the process of coordination following the attacks, including \n     CEQ's role. We have since shared with your staffs a \n     compilation of federal air quality and related health studies \n     conducted in the vicinity of Ground Zero which the Office of \n     Science and Technology Policy completed in December 2002, as \n     well as asbestos monitoring data for workers OSHA provided to \n     the EPA. As you know, of the more than 4,100 residential \n     units in Lower Manhattan examined as part of EPA's indoor air \n     quality and cleaning program only about 1 percent were found \n     to have asbestos at levels exceeding the health-based \n     standard for long-term risk. We hope this exchange has \n     provided a clearer understanding of the interagency \n     coordination process and a greater knowledge of the breadth \n     of activities undertaken by the federal government \n     immediately following September 11th and since.\n       To provide greater collaboration in ongoing efforts to \n     monitor the situation for New York residents and workers and \n     assure them of their current safety, we will be undertaking \n     the following activities: (1) extend the health follow-up \n     associated with the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease \n     Registry's (ATSDR) registry of residents and workers; and (2) \n     convene an expert technical review panel to help guide the \n     agencies' use of the available exposure and health \n     surveillance databases and registries to characterize any \n     remaining exposures and risks, identify unmet public health \n     needs, and recommend any steps to further minimize the risks \n     associated with the aftermath of the World Trade Center \n     attacks. EPA would organize and lead this group of experts, \n     with representation from the federal agencies directly \n     involved in the air quality response and monitoring, the New \n     York City Departments of Health and Environmental Protection, \n     and outside experts. The panel would review the following:\n       Within 3-6 months:\n       Post cleaning verification sampling to be done by EPA in \n     the residential areas included in EPA's Indoor Air Cleanup to \n     verify that re-contamination has not occurred from central \n     hearing and air conditioning systems;\n       The peer reviewed ``World Trade Center Indoor Air \n     Assessment and Selection of Contaminants of Concern and \n     Setting Health-Based Benchmarks,'' which concluded asbestos \n     was an appropriate surrogate in determining risk for other \n     contaminants.\n       Within 18-24 months:\n       Identification of any areas where the health registry could \n     be enhanced to allow better tracking of post-exposure risks \n     by workers and residents.\n       Review and synthesize the ongoing work by the federal, \n     state and local governments and private entities to determine \n     the characteristics of the WTC plume and where it was \n     dispersed, including the geographic extent of EPA and other \n     entities' monitoring and testing, and recommend any \n     additional evaluations for consideration by EPA and other \n     public agencies.\n       We look forward to working with you. Clearly, we are agreed \n     that the health of New York's residents and workers is \n     paramount. By working together, we can ensure their needs are \n     met.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             James L. Connaughton.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. This letter, which does give us the basis for further \nefforts to try to get to the bottom of these issues concerning indoor \nair, is a very welcome step forward. Again, although it is not enough, \nit is not what the inspector general had in mind, it does give us that \nvenue, that process, that opportunity to keep working together to get \nthese answers.\n  The reason this is so important goes far beyond my constituents in \nlower Manhattan. It goes to the heart and soul of what we can expect \nfrom our Government, how reliable the information is, and whether we \nare prepared to look at new problems caused by unforeseen, \nunprecedented events such as what occurred on 9/11.\n  That is not the only area where we need to be focused on cleaning up \nindoor air and being conscious of continuing contamination. This \nmorning I was in Endicott, NY, outside of Binghamton, where there was \nfor many years a very large IBM plant, a very successful plant. In \n1979, there was a spill, a toxic spill, 4,100 gallons, at least, that \nwent into the aquifer and then went into the ground water. Now what we \nare finding is that this plume of toxic material in the water \nunderneath this town, 350 acres through which it has spread--that the \nfumes from this plume are now seeping up through the ground into the \nresidences of the people in Endicott, NY.\n  So this indoor air issue is not just about post-9/11 and New York \nCity. It is a new issue that we must face in this Congress because the \nvast majority of people are totally unable to figure out what to do \nabout this issue.\n  I am pleased that we have come to this point, that we have made this \nprogress with the White House. I look forward to working with Governor \nLeavitt in trying to resolve these matters. I hope this spirit of \ncooperation is an indication of a new attitude in the administration \ntoward the environment and toward working with us to try to solve the \nhealth and safety problems that affect our constituents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in accordance with the UC request, I yield \n6 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. I \nexpress my gratitude to the Democrats and, of course, our two leaders \non the committee for being willing to vitiate this cloture vote and end \nwhat some perceived was a threatened filibuster of Governor Leavitt. I \nam very appreciative that they will allow a vote up or down tomorrow \nmorning on Governor Leavitt's nomination as Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. That is what should be done.\n  Governor Leavitt is one of the finest public servants in this \ncountry. He has served our State long and well, but he has served the \nwhole country in a variety of ways which I will mention.\n  It goes without saying that this is not a job Governor Leavitt has \nasked for or aspired to. But he has accepted the President's \nnomination, first of all because the President has asked him to, and \nsecond, because it's a job of critical importance for our Nation.\n\n[[Page S13251]]\n\n  Other than our people and our values, our Nation's environment and \nnatural resources are our greatest asset. We in Utah understand that \nbetter than most.\n  And in spite of what some critics of President Bush would have us \nbelieve, our Nation has been steadily getting cleaner and safer every \nyear of his presidency. Already, President Bush has signed the \nPersistent Organic Pollutants Treaty. He has proposed and begun \nimplementing ground breaking legislation to greatly accelerate the \nclean up of our Nation's brownfield sites. He has announced his plan to \nreduce off-road diesel emissions by 90 percent.\n  Although his critics refuse to believe it, President Bush's Clear \nSkies initiative will, in fact, lead to quicker reductions in air \npollution across the board than would otherwise be accomplished. Under \nPresident Bush, powerplants will be updated and become cleaner than \never before. Under President Bush our forests and other natural \nresources will become better managed, and the threat of forest fires \nwill be reduced--something that has not been done in the past.\n  Most important, our President is accomplishing these environmental \ngoals without a dramatic increase in Federal mandates. He is doing it \nwithout pitting the environment against human needs. He is doing it \nwithout pinning the ``polluter'' label on our industry, as the past \nadministration was so apt to do. President Bush has shifted the \nenvironmental debate from one about process and control to one about \noutcomes and results.\n  Governor Leavitt has a similar record for improving the environment \nin Utah. Before Governor Leavitt came to office, Utah often failed to \nmeet national clean air standards. In large part this was because most \nUtahns live on a valley floor surrounded by mountains. Through hard \nwork and consensus building, though, Governor Leavitt helped Utah to \novercome our air quality obstacles, and our State now is in consistent \ncompliance with the EPA's air quality standards.\n  Governor Leavitt also has been a leader in finding solutions to \nregional air problems. He helped to begin the Grand Canyon Visibility \nTransport Commission and the Western Regional Air Partnership, which \nestablished a wide sweeping collaborative approach to reducing haze \nover our national parks and public lands on the Colorado Plateau.\n  When Governor Leavitt took office, about 60 percent of Utah's streams \nmet Federal water quality standards. This represented the current \nnational average for States. Under his leadership, though, 73 percent \nof Utah's streams now meet the Federal standards, which is well above \nthe national average. With his oversight, Utah developed a \ncollaborative approach to meeting the Concentrated Animal Feeding \nOperations regulations. His approach was so successful that the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture has adopted it as a model.\n  Governor Leavitt has also led initiatives in our State to preserve \nour open space, improve fisheries, upgrade sewer systems, and clean up \n5,000 underground gas storage tanks, thus preventing \ntheir contamination of Utah's water supply. Thanks to Governor \nLeavitt's careful stewardship, Utah's natural resources have not only \nsurvived a period of intense economic and population growth but have \nbeen improved across the board.\n\n  Is it any wonder that President Bush looks to Governor Leavitt to \nlead the charge on this very important front, when the Governor has so \nsuccessfully pursued a collaborative approach to improving the \nenvironment?\n  To anyone who questions Michael Leavitt's commitment, I say: Look at \nthe record; it speaks for itself. We can also look at Utah's budget \nduring his administration.\n  In his 10 years as Governor, Mike Leavitt won a 41 percent increase \nin spending on environmental protection, and that's after adjusting for \ninflation. According to the Environmental Council of States, the \naverage per capita spending on the environment is $51.80. Under Michael \nLeavitt, however, Utah surpassed that average, spending $62.31 per \ncapita on the environment. The average State spends about 1.4 percent \nof its budget on the environment. Under Governor Leavitt's leadership, \nUtah now spends 2 percent of its budget on the environment.\n  The record proves that Governor Leavitt is a champion of the \nenvironment. But the record also informs us that he is one of the \nfinest public managers in the Nation. The Governor has worked \ntirelessly for our State. Yet, he has found the time to serve as the \nchair of the Council of State Governors, the Republican Governors' \nAssociation, the Western Governors' Association, and the National \nGovernors' Association. You don't get there without being one of the \nbest, if not the best.\n  In 5 of Mike Leavitt's 10 years as Utah's chief executive, our State \nhas been ranked the best managed State. USA Today recently called Utah \nthe best fiscally managed State in the country. Even after the \nextremely tough financial times faced by our States in recent years, \nunder Governor Leavitt, Utah has maintained its Triple A bond rating.\n  How could President Bush have found a better candidate to head up the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency? The answer is he couldn't have.\n  And how does holding up Michael Leavitt's nomination help our \nenvironment or our nation? We finally concluded it doesn't. The obvious \nanswer is: it doesn't. Clearly, confirming this nominee is in the best \ninterest of our environment and our Nation.\n  Finally, let me just say that I have known Mike Leavitt and his \nwonderful wife Jackie for nearly 30 years. No one I know works harder, \nis more fair and honest, is more capable, and is more sincere than my \ngood friend, the Governor of Utah. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nconfirming Michael Leavitt to fill one of the most important jobs in \ngovernment, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  I thank all of those who are making this possible with an up-or-down \nvote tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FISCHER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                   THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending judicial \nnomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Dale S. Fischer, of \nCalifornia, to be United States District Judge for the Central District \nof California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nnomination of Dale Susan Fischer for the U.S. District Court for the \nCentral District of California.\n  Judge Fischer is a Harvard Law graduate. She was a practicing \nattorney for 17 years before her appointment to the Municipal Court of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles Judicial District, in 1997. Three years later, \nshe became a judge of the Superior Court of California, Los Angeles \nCounty, where she currently sits.\n  Judge Fischer has more than 20 years of legal experience. She will be \na fine addition to the Federal bench.\n  We are proud to support her nomination. I recommend that my \ncolleagues vote in her favor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with the judicial confirmation today, in \nless than 3 years' time, President George W. Bush has exceeded the \nnumber of judicial nominees confirmed for President Reagan in all 4 \nyears of his first term in office. Senate Democrats have cooperated so \nthat this President has now exceeded that record. Republicans \nacknowledge to be the ``all-time champ'' at appointing Federal judges. \nSince July 2001, despite the fact that the Senate majority has shifted \ntwice, a total of 167 judicial nominations have been confirmed, \nincluding 29 circuit court appointments. One hundred judges were \nconfirmed in the 17 months of the Democratic Senate majority and now 67 \nhave been confirmed during the comparative time of the Republican \nmajority.\n  One would think that the White House and the Republicans in the \nSenate would be heralding this landmark. One would think they would be \ncongratulating themselves for putting more lifetime appointed judges on \nthe Federal bench than President Reagan did in his entire first term \nand doing it in three-quarters of the time. But Republicans have a \ndifferent partisan\n\n[[Page S13252]]\n\nmessage and this truth is not consistent with their efforts to mislead \nthe American people into thinking that Democrats have obstructed \njudicial nominations.\n  Not only has President Bush been accorded more confirmations than \nPresident Reagan achieved during his entire first term, but he has also \nachieved more confirmations this year than in any of the 6 years that \nRepublicans controlled the Senate when President Clinton was in office. \nNot once was President Clinton allowed 67 confirmations in a year when \nRepublicans controlled the pace of confirmations. Despite the high \nnumbers of vacancies and availability of highly qualified nominees, \nRepublicans never cooperated with President Clinton to the extent \nSenate Democrats have. President Bush has appointed more lifetime \ncircuit and district court judges in 10 months this year than President \nClinton was allowed in 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000.\n  Last year, the Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to confirm \n72 of President Bush's judicial nominees and was savagely attacked \nnonetheless. Likewise, in 1992, the last previous full year in which a \nDemocratic Senate majority considered the nominees of a Republican \nPresident, 66 circuit and district court judges were confirmed. \nHistorically, in the last year of an administration, consideration of \nnominations slows, the ``Thurmond rule'' is invoked and vacancies are \nleft to the winner of the Presidential election. In 1992, Democrats \nproceeded to confirm 66 of President Bush's judicial nominees even \nthough it was a Presidential election year. By contrast, in 1996, when \nRepublicans controlled the pace for consideration of President \nClinton's judicial nominees, only 17 judges were confirmed and not a \nsingle one of them was to a circuit court.\n  In fact, President Bush has now already appointed more judges in his \nthird year in office than in the third year of the last five \nPresidential terms, including the most recent term when Republicans \ncontrolled the Senate and President Clinton was leading the country to \nhistoric economic achievements. That year, in 1999, Republicans allowed \nonly 34 judicial nominees of President Clinton to be confirmed all \nyear, including only 7 circuit court nominees. Those are close to the \naverage totals for the 6 years 1995-2000 when a Republican Senate \nmajority was determining how quickly to consider the judicial nominees \nof a Democratic President. By contrast, with today's confirmation, the \nSenate this year will have confirmed 67 judicial nominees, including 12 \ncircuit court nominees, almost double the totals for 1999.\n  These facts stand in stark contrast to the false partisan rhetoric \nthat demonize the Senate for having blocked all of this President's \njudicial nominations. The reality is that the Senate is proceeding at a \nrecord pace and achieving record numbers. We have worked hard to \nbalance the need to fill judicial vacancies with the imperative that \nFederal judges need to be fair. In so doing, we have reduced the number \nof judicial vacancies to 41. More than 95 percent of the Federal \njudgeships are filled. After inheriting 110 vacancies when the Senate \nJudiciary Committee reorganized under Democratic control in 2001, I \nhelped move through and confirm 100 of the President's judicial \nnominees in just 17 months. With the additional 67 confirmations this \nyear, we have reached the lowest number of vacancies in 13 years. There \nare more Federal judges on the bench today than at any time in American \nhistory.\n  The nominee we vote on today is particularly suited to being the \n167th judicial nominee confirmed, for Judge Dale Fischer was nominated \nafter recommendation from a bipartisan selection commission in \nCalifornia. When we can work together on consensus nominations, they \nmove quickly and successfully to confirmation. The nominee has the \nsupport of both home-State Senators, both Democrats, and has earned the \nunanimous support of all 19 Senators who are members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, both Republicans and Democrats. She has significant judicial \nexperience and received the highest peer review rating available. I am \nhappy to support this nomination and congratulate the nominee and her \nfamily on her confirmation. I also comment Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Boxer on maintaining a bipartisan selection process.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support for the \nnominee for the Central District Court of California--Judge Dale Susan \nFischer. Judge Fischer is well regarded by those who know her work.\n  I want to emphasize the excellent process that we have in place to \nselect District Court nominees in California.\n  In a truly bipartisan fashion, the White House Counsel, Senator \nFeinstein, and I worked together to create four judicial advisory \ncommittees for the State of California, one in each Federal judicial \ndistrict in the State.\n  Each committee has a membership of six individuals--three appointed \nby the White House and three appointed jointly by Senator Feinstein and \nme. Each member's vote counts equally, and a majority is necessary for \nrecommendation of a candidate.\n  This nominee was reviewed by the Central District Committee and \nstrongly recommended for this position. I continue to support this \nbipartisan selection process and the high quality nominees it has \nproduced.\n  Judge Fischer has an impressive background and has served the people \nof California with distinction for several years. She is a graduate of \nHarvard Law School and the University of South Florida. She had \nextensive civil experience as a private attorney before she was \nappointed to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1997. She currently \nsits on the Los Angeles Superior Court where she is well regarded for \nher knowledge of bail issues. She also serves as Chair of the Los \nAngeles Superior Court's Temporary Judge Committee, training and \nmonitoring approximately 1000 temporary judges in Los Angeles County.\n  The Central District will benefit greatly from the exemplary service \nof Judge Fischer, and I fully support confirmation of this nominee.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today with great anxiety about what \nis happening in my State. You can see here behind me the view of one of \nthe fires that is burning from the vantage point of a fireman. These \nfires have become the worst wildfires Californians have seen in \ndecades. In less than 1 week they burned nearly twice as many acres as \nare burned statewide in the average fire year.\n  The numbers in my statement today may already be obsolete. Things are \nmoving that fast in terms of property damage, homes destroyed, and so \non. The wildfires range from as far south as the Mexican border to as \nfar north as Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. They have consumed a \ntotal of more than 400,000 acres or 625 square miles. To put that in \nperspective, that is three times the size of Chicago. The fires are \ndevouring businesses and homes and sometimes entire neighborhoods. More \nthan 900 homes have already been destroyed and perhaps 30,000 more are \nin danger. I know people are without electricity in areas throughout \nthe State. Many are escaping with only the clothes on their backs, and \nfamilies have had no time to gather anything other than their loved \nones as they flee from an inferno that engulfs everything it touches.\n  More than 50,000 people have been evacuated and the numbers continue \nto climb. Thirty-six evacuation centers have already been set up in the \nfive county areas. I spent pretty much all of yesterday speaking to \nmayors and council members and county supervisors and to Governor \nDavis. I talked three times to the head of FEMA, and I spoke with \nAndrew Card, the President's chief of staff, who was most helpful. The \nmessage I had for the President, through Mr. Card, was: Please, move \nquickly, as quickly as you can, to declare a national disaster because \nwithout that, we simply cannot get these fires under control. It has \ntaken a while, but in the last couple of hours we had our declaration.\n  This is very important because it means the Forest Service can now go \nbeyond its budget, because its budget is limited, and contract with \ndepartments all over the country to bring in the help we need.\n  I have been through a lot of disasters in my State. I served on the \nboard of supervisors of Marin County. I have seen fires and floods and \nearthquakes, and then, as a 10-year Congresswoman, I have seen all \nthis. I have not seen anything to this degree where we still don't have \nour arms wrapped around this problem. We don't have the problem \ncontained, whereas usually when we have these disasters, we are up here \nsaying we need to set up the FEMA agencies where we can now go and have \npeople get repaid and get loans for their businesses and homes, and we \nwill do that in time. That is very important. But right now we need to \nput out the fires.\n  I thank Nevada and Arizona. They have helped. They have sent between \n25 and 50 firetrucks with personnel to our State.\n  I will give you another look at San Diego. This is the harbor. You \ncan see it just has the eeriest look to it. You can see the flames in \nthe background.\n  We also want to say that we have received 50 tanker trucks, and 12 \nair tankers are coming tomorrow. This is all good news for the people \nof San Diego. Supervisor Jacob was at her wit's end yesterday because \nshe was not getting enough help. The other areas, the mutual aid, seem \nto be working better, but San Diego came along afterwards, and I have \nbeen very worried about them.\n\n  The crown jewels of California's beautiful landscape, our beautiful \nforests, have been hurt. We are going to have legislation that will in \nfact allow us to do fuel reduction close to communities. It is very \nimportant, when we have a bill that relates to our forests, that we put \nthe money where it is needed, which is near the communities, and that \nwe make sure that what we do will in fact help the communities.\n  The bill we are talking about is the Forestry and Community \nAssistance Act, written by Senator Leahy and myself. There are other \nproposals. I hope we can come to an agreement that the time is now to \nhelp our communities and to provide the resources to help them, not the \nbig logging people, because that is the fight we are always waging.\n  Air traffic across the Nation has been disrupted by these fires. \nHundreds of flights in and out of southern California have been \ncanceled or suspended. Our brave firefighters, more than 7,000, are \nfrantically working in conjunction with the California Department of \nForestry, the U.S. Forest Service, California Highway Patrol, the Red \nCross, and now, happily, FEMA, which are very much involved to contain \nthese fires.\n  Many are still raging out of control. I want to be back here as soon \nas I can to talk about how we can rebuild our communities. But today we \nare talking about fires that are raging out of control.\n  I thank White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card. I thank FEMA Director \nMichael Brown. I did try to call Tom Ridge. Unfortunately, he was out \nof the country, but I spoke with his people and again with many of the \nlocal people.\n  In closing, let me say that my heart is with the people of San \nBernardino County where two major fires are burning: The Old fire--by \nthe way, we think arson was to blame for that fire. I have written to \nthe Attorney General and will call him in the hope that he will invite \nin the FBI to get to the bottom of who would do such a deed. The other \nfire in San Bernardino is the Old Fire, 24,000 acres. The Grand Prix is \n52,000 acres. In San Diego, there were three major fires. Everyone is \nstruggling to make sure they don't merge.\n  We do have 48,000 customers without power in San Diego. In Otay, \n35,000 acres are burning. The Cedar Fire in San Diego has been the \ndeadliest one: 9 deaths, 300 homes destroyed, 150 in Scripps Ranch. The \nParadise Fire in San Diego: 160 structures were destroyed, 75 cars, 2 \ndeaths, and so far not contained. In Los Angeles County, it is the \nVerdale Fire, 9,000 acres. In Ventura, there are two major fires, Simi \nValley and Piru. We are very worried about those. And at Riverside, \nthere is one major fire. The Governor has not yet asked for an \nemergency declaration in Riverside, but it may come to that. If it \ndoes, I am very hopeful that the President will act on that request as \nwell because we have lost six homes in Riverside, and the size of the \nfire there is 11,000 acres.\n  This declaration by the President is welcome news for us.\n  We need to put aside all politics now. We have an outgoing Governor. \nWe have an incoming Governor. We all have to just join hands in this \nbecause our people are scared. They are filled with anxiety. They want \nthis over. They want to go on and rebuild their lives. I join with my \ncolleague in expressing my condolences to those who\n\n[[Page S13254]]\n\nhave lost family. My deep hope is that we will contain these fires. We \nwill save additional lives, we will shelter those who have been \ndisplaced, and we will rebuild.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Senator \nBoxer, with some remarks about the fire. This fire is actually far more \nserious than any fire I have seen, and I have spent some time now \nbecoming familiar with forestry practices and fires.\n  Before a fire is under control, it has to be contained, and virtually \nno aspect of these 10 fires are contained tonight. As my colleague \nsaid, they have taken 13 lives; they have destroyed 1,100 homes; they \nhave burned over 400,000 acres, and that is two-thirds the size of \nRhode Island. Virtually no fire is contained and firefighters must \nconduct an evacuation to move people out.\n  Senator Boxer gave you the latest figures on some of these fires. But \nthere is one fire I wish to point out and that is the fire heading \ntoward San Diego. Mayor Murphy of San Diego said to me last night that \nthe fire is pointed like a spear into the heart of San Diego. It is \nrunning through housing projects, crossing freeways, and it is \nextremely dangerous. These fires are virtually all over--from Los \nAngeles down to the Mexican border. I will soon print in the Record the \nspecific statistics about each one.\n  Like my colleague, I spoke four times with Mike Brown. He was in \nAlbuquerque. I am pleased that he is headed to southern California. He \nhas cut redtape, brought in 22 additional engines, 3 strike teams, \nfirefighters from northern California are headed to the south, and \nteams coming in from surrounding States. We are very grateful for that.\n  I am also grateful to the President for declaring a Federal state of \nemergency for San Bernardino, San Diego, Ventura, and Los Angeles \nCounties.\n  The State declaration has also been called by Governor Davis, and \nFederal disaster assistance will now include aid to individuals and \nhouseholds, aid to public agencies for emergency services, and repair \nor replacement of disaster-damaged public facilities, and funding for \nmeasures designed to reduce losses to property. The Federal Government \nhas already provided fire management assistance grants for at least \neight wildfires in southern California. These grants reimburse the \nState for 75 percent of the cost of fighting the fire.\n  My sadness and concern about these wildfires are not confined to \nthose who lost their lives and their properties, but it is also the \nreality that they were entirely predictable, and new ones will also \nburn across my State.\n  I believe we must take steps now to reduce the harm of forest fires. \nThese conditions are all familiar to us--drought, densely packed \nforests, unhealthily crowded with little trees. For decades, we have \nput out the ground fires that would otherwise clear out the brush. The \nresult is huge fuel loads of small trees and brush, which is perfect \nkindling for a catastrophic fire. In areas such as San Diego County, \nwhere there is more brush than forests, fire suppression has likewise \ncreated such a tangle of brush that fires often cannot be stopped.\n  The Santa Ana winds are another factor. These hot, dry winds blow \noften in the fall, and they don't just occur in southern California. \nThe 1991 fire in Oakland and Berkley was fanned by similar devastating \nwinds. They come every year. We know they are coming, yet we have not \nadjusted our forest practices to deal with them.\n  Hundreds of thousands of dead and dying trees from infestation, such \nas the bark beetle, remain untreated, trees unremoved, with as many as \n90,000 people living in bark beetle-infested forests in San Bernardino \nCounty, with only one-leg roads to get them out in case of catastrophe.\n  With all these conditions for disaster in place, I have feared for \nsome time now that California could face a devastating season of \nwildfires, and that seems to be just what is happening right now. So I \nbelieve we need to take action now, not just to correct our \nmismanagement of the forests and the brush but for a more basic reason.\n  We need to act in advance because of the terrible fact that most of \nthe deaths that occurred in these fires did so because people had too \nlittle time to escape. At least seven people, so far, have died as they \ntried to escape the cedar fire in the narrow Wildcat Canyon area near \nthe Barona Ranch Indian Reservation in San Diego County. People died on \nfoot, people died in their cars, people died still trapped in their \nhomes. At least two children died while trying to escape with their \nparents.\n  The fires travel just too quickly, and hillside roads are too narrow \nand too winding to count on people being able to get out.\n  Let me give you one story. Violet Ingrum lived in San Diego's Scripps \nRanch neighborhood. She went to bed Saturday night worried mainly about \nher daughter, who lives in Hollywood, and the danger of potential \nwildfires to her daughter's home. Only a few hours later, she woke up \nto a howling wind and the horrifying sight of flames beyond her back \nfence and debris falling into her swimming pool. She only had time to \ngrab her two cats and two photo albums, and one of her cats jumped out \nof the car before she could get away. But she was a lucky one. So I \nbelieve very deeply that we need to act now to reduce the threat from \nthese wildfires and to give our firefighters a better chance to defend \nour communities.\n  We were able to get Congress to approve $30 million last month in \nfiscal 2003 funds to help battle the bark beetle, and I am urging the \nForest Service to put those funds to work immediately. That is an \nimportant step forward, but we need broader measures to reduce the \nthreat from our forests.\n  I am delighted that the chairman of the Agriculture Committee is on \nthe floor tonight, Senator Thad Cochran, because we have worked with \nhim to produce a compromise bill that I hope will be on the floor of \nthe Senate soon. I hope it will be passed because this bill, which can \nget 60 votes, is the only chance that this Congress has an opportunity \nto pass a hazard fuels mitigation program this year.\n  The fact is, there are 57 million acres of Federal land at the \nhighest risk of catastrophic fire, including 8.5 million acres in \nCalifornia alone. In the past 5 years, wildfires like the ones going on \ntoday have raged through 26.9 million acres, including over 2 million \nacres in California.\n  In response to these threats, an agreement has been reached by a \nbipartisan group of 10 Senators to protect our forests from \ncatastrophic fire by expediting the thinning of hazardous fuels and, at \nthe same time, provide the first legal protection for old-growth trees \nin our Nation's history. Those who have participated, along with \nmyself, in the lengthy negotiations--2 years now--leading up to this \nagreement include Senators Thad Cochran, Ron Wyden, Larry Craig, Mike \nCrapo, Pete Domenici, Jon Kyl, Blanche Lincoln, John McCain, and Max \nBaucus.\n  Legislation implementing the agreement as a proposed substitute \namendment to title I of H.R. 1904, the House-passed Healthy Forest \nbill, was filed by Senator Cochran, chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee, on October 2. Yet there have been objections raised to \nproceeding with this bipartisan substitute amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues in the strongest possible terms to support this \nlegislation so we can defend our communities and protect our forests.\n  I wish to take a few moments because if ever there is a time to look \nat this kind of legislation it is now. I wish to spend a few moments \nand describe exactly what the legislation would do.\n  It would establish an expedited process so the Forest Service and the \nDepartment of Interior can get to work on brush-clearing projects to \nminimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire. Up to 20 million acres of \nlands near communities, municipal watersheds, and other high-risk areas \nare included in our project. This includes lands that have suffered \nfrom serious wind damage or insect infestations, such as the bark \nbeetle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent for another 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. A total of $760 million is authorized. That is a $340 \nmillion increase over current funding. At least 50 percent of the funds \nwould be\n\n[[Page S13255]]\n\nused for fuels reduction near communities. That is what we do not have \nin this catastrophic wildfire that is taking place right now.\n  The legislation also requires that large fire-resilient old-growth \ntrees be protected from logging immediately. It mandates that forest \nplans that are more than 10 years old and most in need of updating be \nupdated with old-growth protection consistent with the national \nstandard within 2 to 3 years. Without this provision in the amendment, \nwe would have to wait a decade or more to see improved old-growth \nprotection. Even then, there would be no guarantee that this protection \nagainst the threat of both logging and catastrophic fire would be very \nstrong.\n  In California, the amendment to the Sierra Nevada framework that is \ncurrently in progress will have to comply with the new national \nstandard for old-growth protection. We have also tried to expedite, \nshorten, and improve the administrative review process to make it more \ncollaborative and less confrontational.\n  It is critical that the Forest Service spend its scarce dollars by \ndoing work on the ground rather than being mired in endless paperwork. \nThe legislation we submitted preserves multiple opportunities for \nmeaningful public involvement. People can attend a public meeting on \nevery project. They can submit comments during both the preparation of \nthe environmental impact statement and during the administrative review \nprocess. I guarantee that the public will have a meaningful say in \nthese projects.\n  It does change the environmental review process so that the Forest \nService still considers the effects of a project in detail but can \nfocus its analysis on the proposal, one reasonable alternative that \nmeets the project goals and the alternative of not doing the project, \ninstead of the five or nine alternatives that are now often required.\n\n  This is not the siting of a freeway where one may want five or nine \nalternative projects. We know where the project is going to take place. \nThe question is, Should it be mechanical? Should it be by burning? What \nare the problems with the area? Is there a better way of doing it?\n  So this legislation replaces the current Forest Service \nadministrative appeals with a review process that will occur after the \nForest Service finishes its environmental review of a project but \nbefore it reaches its decision. This new approach is similar to a \nprocess adopted by the Clinton administration in 2000 for a review of \nforest plans and amendments to those plans. The process will be \nspeedier and less confrontational than the current administrative \nappeal process.\n  There is a great deal of misconception both about the appeals process \nand the judicial review process. I will quickly take a minute and tell \nmy colleagues what we have recommended with respect to judicial review. \nFirst, parties can sue in Federal court only on issues raised in the \nadministrative review process. This is common sense that allows \nagencies the opportunity to correct their own mistakes before \neverything gets litigated. Lawsuits must be filed in the same \njurisdiction as the proposed project. This also makes common sense. \nCourts are encouraged to resolve the case as soon as possible, and \npreliminary injunctions are limited to 60 days. They can be extended, \nbut the individuals making the claim have to go back to court and \njustify why they need another preliminary injunction.\n  The court must weigh the environmental benefit of performing a given \nproject against its environmental risk as it reviews the case. This is \nthe balance-of-harms language.\n  I deeply believe this amendment is much preferable to the House bill \nwhich has passed. There are many ways in which we improve on the House-\npassed bill. First, we focus on the highest priority lands, where we \nneed to undertake brush-clearing projects to restore forest health and \nprevent forest fire. These include the wildland urban interface as \ndefined by the communities needing protection. It includes lands where \nfires would threaten municipal water supplies and lands significantly \nharmed by insects.\n  Secondly, we have protected both old-growth stands and large trees \nacross the landscape. The projects expedited by this act will restore \nforest health.\n  Finally, the Senate agreement removed a provision of the House-passed \nbill that could have threatened the fair and impartial judicial review \nof Forest Service actions. This provision would have tilted the playing \nfield in forestry litigation by requiring a court to defer to the \nFederal Agency's views in deciding whether to issue an injunction. So \nwe have seriously improved the House bill.\n  In closing, I say to my colleagues that if ever there is a case in \npoint as to why we have to spend more time on the ground with forest \nactions rather than debating them here, it is the 10 fires that are now \ntaking place in California. They are catastrophic. In fact, they are \nwreaking human devastation and degradation on a level seldom seen. It \nis time for this body and this Congress to act.\n  Both Senator Wyden and I, and Senator Cochran as well, have asked the \nadministration for a statement of administrative policy that they will, \nin effect, support this legislation in conference. This is critical to \nour agreement. I have written to the White House. We have called the \nWhite House. We have not had a response.\n  So the action and the ball is really in the White House's court at \nthis time. We need to hear from them. We need to know whether, in fact, \nthis bill, which we believe can garner 60 votes in the Senate, will, in \nfact, have strong White House and administration support when it goes \nto conference, because if it does not, and if the vehicle is not this \nbill, there will not be a bill. I think that is the truth as many find \nit.\n  So to all of those in California who have suffered such grievous \nloss, I join my colleague in sending our deepest condolences. I have \nasked all my staff to go to southern California to be available to \nreceive calls from people to try to hook them up with whatever help or \naid they need. FEMA will shortly be making announcements as to what \nnumbers to call, where to go to fill out the applications, and we will \ndo everything we can to help facilitate that process.\n  This is truly one of the great tragedies of human life. Can my \ncolleagues imagine children and parents being burned fleeing from this \nkind of a fire and over 1,000 families losing everything they have \nworked a lifetime to build?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 1 minute \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from California, for her active involvement and \neffective work in reaching this agreement that has been reported out of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, the Healthy Forest Restoration Act. \nIt is the vehicle that we can use to truly bring relief to the citizens \nof America from disasters like this one that has befallen the citizens \nof California.\n  I must say I have been worried, as has she and others in the Senate, \nthat this kind of tragedy could happen. It could happen in many other \nStates. It is time for the Senate to act now. The only thing I disagree \nwith about the remarks of the Senator is she says the ball is in the \nWhite House's court.\n\n  The ball is in the Senate's court. This bill is pending here in the \nSenate. We have asked unanimous consent to go to the bill and that \namendments be limited to those that are relevant to the bill and that \namendments to the amendments be relevant to those amendments to which \nthey are offered. That is the only condition under which the Senate has \nasked to proceed to consideration of this bill, and objections have \nbeen raised on the Democratic side of the aisle to proceeding.\n  It is time for those who are obstructing the consideration of this \nbill to reconsider their position, particularly in light of the \ndestruction in California. It is unconscionable that the Senate will \nnot take action on this matter and pass the bill. Let's go to \nconference with the House. Let's try to prevail in conference. Then it \nis the turn of the White House to sign or veto the bill. I predict the \nWhite House would sign the bill and we will get a good bill in \nconference that the White House can sign.\n\n[[Page S13256]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield to my friend if I have any time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for those comments. I have just \nbeen told we are clear on our side. We can go to the bill. Obviously, \nthere is a request to have amendments and I think we should hear the \namendments out and vote on them. I think those of us who participated \nin this are really dedicated to get this bill passed. We worked for 2 \nyears with your help----\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me reclaim the time. I asked \nunanimous consent on this floor to do just that and there was an \nobjection by the acting leader for the Democratic side, Mr. Harry Reid. \nIf there has been a change in position, that ought to be communicated \nto the leader. That would be good to know.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. As a point of clarification, Senator, if I may, I am \ntold there is no objection to going to the bill. There was an objection \non the limitation of amendments.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, there was no limitation of amendments. \nThe provision in the unanimous consent request was that any amendment \noffered to the bill would be relevant to the bill and any amendment to \nan amendment be relevant to the amendment to which it was offered. \nThere was no limitation requested in that unanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may say, through the Chair, for just a moment to \nthe Senator, then I believe we can move to the bill. Because, as I \nunderstand it, what you have just stated is exactly the position of \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13256-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13256-S13258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AIDS IN AFRICA\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Foreign \nOperations bill, we are considering President Bush's proposal to spend \n$15 billion to deal with the crisis of AIDS in Africa. It is something \nI believe is a necessary thing. I supported the President on this. It \nis a tremendous amount of money, but it is a tremendous problem.\n  There are many aspects of the problem. Not everybody agrees on every \nsingle part of it. I would just say I have done some work on it and I \nhave looked at a number of the issues. I believe strongly that there \nare some things we can do. If we do them correctly and promptly and \neffectively, we can dramatically impact the transmission of AIDS in \nAfrica and prevent people from becoming infected and thereby serve a \ngreat and noble purpose.\n  I think this: We know thousands of people are infected in Africa \nevery year. According to conservative numbers generated by the World \nHealth Organization, 250,000 to 450,000 Africans each year contract \nAIDS, a death sentence ultimately, through healthcare routes. They \ncontract that not from dangerous activities, but from seeking to \nimprove their own health by going to a hospital, a doctor's office, a \nclinic, and getting a shot or receiving a transfusion. One thousand a \nday at a minimum are infected by these procedures. It is totally \npreventable. It goes beyond just policy, and it is in my view a moral \nimperative. There is no doubt we can reduce this problem in Africa. We \ncan do it by good policy and strong leadership and I believe we need to \nspeak as a Congress on this issue.\n  In March of this year I had occasion to read a newspaper article that \nwas in the Washington Times. It quoted a published article in the \nInternational Journal of STD and AIDS, a publication of the British \nRoyal Society of Medicine, that presented evidence that the reuse of \nneedles and syringes has played a major role in the HIV/AIDS epidemic \nin Africa.\n  At the time, the article challenged conventional wisdom and the \nbelief in the international public health community that heterosexual \nsexual contact was the primary route of transmission for HIV in Africa \nand that medical transmission of the disease did not require the \nforemost attention of health care specialists.\n  Dr. David Gisselquist pointed to a number of pieces of evidence \nsupporting his conclusion that medical exposures account for a large \nproportion of HIV transmissions. He conducted an extensive review of \nrefereed journal articles on the epidemiology--that is the history of \nthe transmission, the people who get it--in the African HIV epidemic. A \ncareful analysis of the data behind these studies enabled him to \nidentify the following trends:\n  No. 1, multiple studies he reviewed found HIV-infected children whose \nmothers test negative for the virus. Many of these children are far too \nyoung to have contracted the HIV virus through sexual practices or drug \nuse, leaving their infections unexplained by conventional assumptions \nabout the spread of the disease. It was found, however, that these \nchildren bearing the HIV virus had, on average, received nearly twice \nas many injections of vaccines and medicines than their uninfected \npeers, leading researchers to conclude that there was a strong \ncorrelation between the number of injections a child received and that \nchild's chances of contracting HIV.\n  As we looked at the issue, we found it was not a newly discussed \nmatter but in fact had been out in the field for some time, \nunfortunately not receiving the kind of attention it should, in my \nview, have received from the people who were required and authorized to \nparticipate in the treatment and prevention of the disease.\n  Let me just show this article, a blowup from the San Francisco \nChronicle dated Tuesday, October 27, 1998, 5 years ago this date. The \ntitle of it is ``Fast Track To Global Disaster.''\n  The subheadline under the top is ``Deadly Needles.'' This is what the \nsubheadline said:\n\n       For decades, researchers have warned that contaminated \n     syringes could transmit deadly viruses with cruel efficiency, \n     but efforts to defuse the crisis failed, and today, it has \n     become an insidious global epidemic, destroying millions of \n     lives every year.\n\n  You ask why, perhaps, did we not deal with that back in 1998 when \nthese matters were being raised. Apparently, there was a debate and a \nconcern that panic would ensue and maybe people wouldn't seek medical \ncare, or that it would deflect attention from WHO's primary view that \nsexual transmission was the way AIDS was transmitted.\n  I note this statement by Mike Zaffran of the World Health \nOrganization. You can tell they were wrestling with it, although they \ndid not take action. The subject quote is:\n\n       We want to avoid creating a panic. But maybe there is a \n     need to create that panic to solve this problem.\n\n  According to WHO, 10 percent of the AIDS transmissions in Africa come \nfrom reused needles or contaminated transfusions, both of which are \ntotally preventable, as I will discuss shortly. But I just want to say \nright now that there is evidence to suggest that the true figure is far \nlarger than 10 percent. Remember, people who contract AIDS and who have \nno reason to believe they have AIDS are then in a position to \nunwittingly transmit that disease to their spouses and to others with \nwhom they come in contact. Those who ultimately pass the disease by \nthose contacts may not have done so had they known they had been \nexposed. I think it has a multiplier effect on the crisis in Africa, \nclearly affecting and involving the infection of millions of Africans.\n  I have hosted two hearings in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee on this issue. We have had witnesses from the World \nHealth Organization, from USAID, and from private groups such as \nPhysicians for Human Rights. They have presented evidence. At the \nconclusion of that testimony, I am even more concerned that the numbers \nthe WHO has acted on or not acted on are low, that more than 10 percent \nof these HIV cases are being transmitted through unsafe healthcare. \nCertainly, that is the conclusion Dr. Gisselquist reached after \nextensive study.\n  Let me talk about a couple of things: The good news and the bad news.\n  Injection safety is a critical issue in America. Our health care \ncommunity has long recognized the risks associated with unsafe \ninjections.\n  At the outset of the HIV epidemic in America, one of the top \npriorities in this country was to quickly ensure that patients and \nhealth care workers were educated about these risks and that steps were \ntaken to provide ample supplies of single-use syringes--syringes that \ncould not be used again--with safety features to ensure that\n\n[[Page S13257]]\n\nboth patients and providers were protected.\n  In fact, one thing we dealt with in this Congress was the Ryan White \nAct that was passed in response to the infection of young Ryan White as \nthe result of a tainted blood products that he received to treat his \nhemophilia. In fact, long before the HIV virus emerged as a significant \nepidemic in the United States, health care workers and policymakers \nwere well aware that unsafe injection practices could spread many \ndangerous diseases and posed a public health hazard. There was ample \nevidence that unsafe practices can kill.\n  From the 1950s through 1982, the Egyptian Government carried out an \nambitious program to eliminate schistosomiasis, a serious parasitic \ndisease. Infected Egyptians received multiple injections to kill this \nparasite--up to 16 injections over 3 months. The needles used in these \ncampaigns were rarely sterilized sufficiently to kill viruses such as \nhepatitis C.\n  By the 1980s, it became clear that Egypt was in the grip of a \ntremendous epidemic of hepatitis C, a disease that frequently leads to \nliver failure, cancer, and death. In a country of 67 million people, it \nwas estimated that 20 percent of the population had been exposed to \nhepatitis C. Neighboring Sudan, in comparison, had a rate of less than \n5 percent.\n  This is still thought to represent ``the world's largest iatrogenic \ntransmission event.'' The World Health Organization's data suggests \nthat unclean needles contributed to an appalling 18.9 percent \nprevalence rate of the deadly hepatitis C virus in the Egyptian \npopulation. Altogether, over 12 million people were exposed to this \nvirus and 7.2 million infected. Those are stunning numbers, and they \nare the result of using dirty needles.\n  One of the University of Maryland researchers who chronicled this \ndisaster stated emphatically that the practice of reusing inadequately \nsterilized or unsterilized syringes ``before the danger of exposure to \nblood was so well known, and before the availability of disposable \nneedles and syringes provided a very potent means for the transmission \nof blood-borne infections.''\n  That is something we don't doubt in America today. Unfortunately, \nhowever, the same conditions that permitted this tragedy to occur \ncontinue to exist in Africa and other areas of the world, and these \nunsafe practices spread not only hepatitis but also the HIV virus, \nleading to AIDS and leading to death.\n  Health care workers around the world continue to devote time and \nresources to treating medically transmitted infections, many of which \nremain incurable even by the best medical science.\n  Since the recognition that unsafe injections pose an unacceptable \nrisk in vaccination campaigns, international vaccination programs now \nalmost universally include adequate injection safety training and \nsupplies. These limited efforts are commendable but much more needs to \nbe done.\n  To understand the proportion of the problem that remains to be \naddressed, one must note the distinction between injections given for \nvaccination and therapeutic injections, or injections given for the \npurpose of treating infections or other diseases.\n  It has been estimated that worldwide, therapeutic injections \noutnumber vaccinations by 9 to 1, totaling approximately 12 billion \ninjections administered each year in the developing world, including \nthe African nations of the Global AIDS Initiative.\n  Despite this fact and the demonstrated risks associated with unsafe \ninjections, researchers and leaders in the field of HIV prevention have \nwarned that ``little attention has been paid to the systematic \ncorrection of widespread unsafe practices resulting in disease \ntransmission through therapeutic injections''--the very problem \nreferenced in this chart where, at the beginning, it says ``Deadly \nNeedles''--dated October 27, 1998--5 years ago today.\n  At the outset of the AIDS epidemic in the United States, our \nGovernment and the public declared that blood supplies must be \nabsolutely safe. The Federal Government and the public health community \nmoved rapidly to ensure that every single unit of blood donated in this \ncountry is tested for the HIV virus before it is given to any person.\n  It is estimated--get this number--that 25 percent of the blood \ndonated in Africa is never tested for HIV--75 percent is but 25 percent \nis not--and that up to 80 percent of the blood is not tested for \nhepatitis. It is estimated by the respected group, Safe Blood For \nAfrica--their name indicates their concern about this problem--that as \na consequence of this breakdown, approximately 15 percent of the sub-\nSaharan African blood supply is infected with HIV and 20 percent with \nhepatitis. Fifteen percent of the blood supply in sub-Saharan Africa is \ninfected with HIV, a deadly disease. People go there and they get \ntransfusions on a regular basis. The World Health Organization \nestimates that up to 10 percent of new HIV cases in Africa are due to \ncontaminated blood transfusions.\n  Once again, it is clear that transfusions of contaminated blood \nrepresent yet another hidden source of transmission of this disease, \nfueling the epidemic.\n  Seventy percent of the recipients of these high-risk transfusions are \nwomen and children, making blood safety a critical component of our \nlarger effort to fight HIV/AIDS and to protect the mothers and \nchildren. I will repeat that: 70 percent of the recipients of these \nhigh-risk transfusions--15 percent of which is contaminated with HIV--\nare women and children.\n  So what does that mean? That means that 15 out of every 100 women who \ngo to get a transfusion in Africa--and many of them get transfusions \nbecause malaria leads to a lot of transfusions, really more than is \nneeded to be performed but they are performed--and from those \ntransfusions, thousands come home with AIDS. Instead of being healed \nand cured, they are infected with a deadly disease.\n  It is important to recognize, too, that in the treatment of anemia, \nwhich is related to problems such as malaria, best medical practices \nwould dictate that many of these transfusions are not necessary. So the \ncombination of reducing the number of transfusions is the first step, \nalong with making sure every blood unit that is utilized in Africa is \ntested for AIDS before being used in a blood transfusion.\n  We have an HIV rate in the United States of less than 1 percent, and \nwe test our blood supply. In some countries in Africa, the HIV \nprevalence rate is as high as 40 percent. Every blood donation in the \nworld, and particularly in Africa, should be tested before we do \ntransfusions. This is one more example of the potential ways in which \nwe can reduce the risk of this deadly disease.\n  I would also like to share some thoughts about why I think this is \nnot just a public policy issue for discussion but why it is a moral \nimperative.\n  We will be spending $15 billion over 5 years, on average $3 billion a \nyear. I know there is debate whether we should have the full $3 billion \nthis first year. I have my doubts the money can be assimilated, but we \nare going to be spending that over 5 years.\n  Let me talk to you about the cost of completely fixing the medical \ntransmission problem. One of the most startling facts and best news \nabout health care transmissions of HIV in Africa is the fact that \ninjection safety and blood safety have been specifically singled out by \nresearchers as the most cost-effective means of preventing the spread \nof HIV.\n  A study by the World Health Organization, in 1999--a year after the \nSan Francisco Chronicle article--suggested that addressing the problem \nof unsafe injections might well result in actual savings for the \ngovernments and organizations financing the fight against AIDS. It can \nactually save them money. These savings would be generated both by a \nreduction in the number of unnecessary injections and transfusions, \nwhich, amazingly, may account for a majority of the therapeutic \ninjections actually given--and a majority of the therapeutic injections \nin Africa are probably not necessary and could be handled without any \nshots or with a pill--and by avoiding the tremendous financial drain \nthat occurs as a result of these infections, including hepatitis.\n  In testimony before the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee at a hearing which I chaired in July, one of the leading \nWorld Health Organization researchers confirmed both his own conclusion \nthat ending unsafe injection practices would be eminently\n\n[[Page S13258]]\n\ncost effective and his projection that blood safety efforts would prove \nto be similarly cost effective.\n  In fact, on a day when we are discussing $15 billion for Global AIDS, \nthe benefits of an additional $1 billion here or $289 million there--I \nthink you would all be stunned at the numbers involved in solving this \nproblem. These estimates I am going to give you were provided by the \nWorld Health Organization.\n  Clean, new needles and syringes for every injection, given by medical \npersonnel educated in the proper use of injections in Africa would cost \n$24 million for all 12 nations included in the Global AIDS initiative. \nJust $24 million would provide safe and clean needles for every \nnecessary injection in Africa.\n  Clean, safe blood transfusions, administered by medical personnel \ntrained in the proper indications for transfusions--$46 million for all \n12 nations. So for $46 million, we can completely eliminate the problem \nof transfusions, which WHO admits could be 10 percent of the problem of \nall the problem of AIDS in Africa.\n\n  There are so many tragic aspects to this problem.\n  Hard-working frontline doctors and nurses inadvertently contribute to \nthe spread of the very diseases they are struggling to prevent.\n  At the HELP Committee hearing, it was very encouraging to hear the \ntestimony of Dr. John Ssemakula, a physician from Uganda, who was able \nto describe the great strides his country has made in cleaning up \ninjection practices.\n  Dr. Ssemakula was also able to convey the plea of the dedicated men \nand women on the frontlines of health care in Uganda, that they be \nprovided with the equipment they need to provide safe injections.\n  These are intelligent, educated, well-intentioned people, and they \nsimply want enough syringes to provide patients with safe health care.\n  The health care system in developing nations frequently does not \nprovide either necessary education in proper injection procedures or, \nfor those providers who are striving to follow model practices, the \nrelatively inexpensive supplies necessary to succeed.\n  We are dealing with, frankly, with our health care providers \nworldwide, a double standard that is indefensible. You are tempted to \nsay, it is an immoral double standard. Let me tell you about this \ntroubling aspect of the problem. In developed nations, the general \npublic has been made aware of the risk associated with unsafe medical \ncare. We know in America you want safe health care. We insist on it. We \nspend what it takes to do it. We have needles that are safe to protect \nnurses and doctors from accidental pricks, much less the patient who \ngoes to get a shot.\n  When the use of contaminated blood and blood products results in the \nspread of HIV here, we act. The health community, the Federal and State \nregulators, and the American public immediately demand guaranteed \nsafety, and very quickly we see that they get this. The safety of blood \nand blood products is now something Americans take for granted.\n  Every unit of blood in this country is screened for HIV, hepatitis B, \nand hepatitis C. When it became clear that the reuse of contaminated \nneedles put patients at risk, we acted. It is clear that many \ndeveloping nations, including those in Africa within the President's \nGlobal AIDS initiative, have not yet been able to achieve similar \nresults.\n  This is where a disturbing double standard arises. The World Health \nOrganization, the U.S. Government's Centers for Disease Control, and \nother organizations with employees in the developing nations openly \ncaution their travelers to these areas, including their own workers, \nthat blood is likely unscreened and needles likely reused. This is \ndescribed as posing a risk of infection of hepatitis B, C, and HIV.\n  Numerous workers, including our own embassy employees and AIDS \nworkers in Africa, can tell of being instructed to ask for plasma \nexpanders rather than dangerous blood transfusions or being cautioned \nto purchase and provide their own new, clean syringes when they go to \nthe doctor.\n  When formulating public statements and policy for these very same \nAfrican nations, however, many of these organizations continue to \nmaintain that contaminated blood and reused needles are not significant \nproblems and do not pose substantial health risks to African patients.\n  We have made some progress. We have had a number of hearings on this \nsubject. I have become more convinced than I was when we started that \nthis is an unacceptable practice. It is an unacceptable situation in \nAfrica and one that can be fixed for less than $100 million a year. We \ncan provide tested, safe blood for every transfusion in Africa, and we \ncan provide clean, unused needles for every injection at a cost of less \nthan $100 million a year. That is tremendous news. We are on the road \nto making some progress.\n  I have talked to top officials in the World Health Organization and \nthe U.S. Government. We believe that with Director Tobias' new position \nin the State Department as sort of an American global AIDS czar that he \nis attuning himself to this issue, that the CDC, at my request, is \nconducting research to develop a plan to attack this problem. Health \nand Human Services is conducting a study which we expect to receive \nback in a matter of weeks that will review independently all the other \nexisting studies of AIDS transmission in Africa to attempt to determine \njust how big a problem this really is. And now we are at a point where \nwe are putting this new money into the program.\n  I urge my colleagues to act now to ensure that a certain amount of \nthis money--it would be less than 5 percent, probably closer to 2 \npercent--be dedicated to dealing with the medical transmission problem. \nWe need to do that. Sure, they can spend more than that if they want \nto, but this is the minimum amount that virtually guarantees tremendous \nsuccess against medical transmissions.\n  Let's do that as part of our legislation. We can go home and know \nthat we made a difference.\n  Some say: Well, Jeff, we are picking up on this issue. We really \ndon't need any direction on how to spend our money. Just give it to us, \nand we will spend it like we want. I generally am sympathetic to \nagencies not being micromanaged. But with the resistance we continue to \nsee from the World Health Organization and American organizations that \ndeal with this issue, we need to ensure that this much money gets \nspent.\n  There was a conference in September in Africa. Thousands of people \nattended who deal with the AIDS epidemic. The WHO entity issued a press \nrelease after that meeting--again just a matter of weeks ago--WHO \nissued a news release dismissing the significance of medical \ntransmission. This caused a group of scientists who were at the meeting \nto issue a statement of their own contracting it. They said in effect, \nWHO continues to reject evidence that stopping HIV transmission through \nunsterile health care could slow the spread of disease.\n  So we have a continuing problem, continuing to stick with numbers \nthat do not appear to be justified and policies that need to be \nchanged. It is time for us to take a step to save lives. The very \nthought that we could knock down maybe in 18 months' time, instead of \n1,000 people being infected a day by the health care transmission of \nHIV in Africa, why it could be down to 200; and then in 2 or 3 years \ndown to virtually zero? That is possible. Which would we rather do? \nPrevent the contraction of a deadly disease or try to deal with the \nconsequences of the disease once a person is infected?\n  This is the right step.

Mr. President, 13 years ago, Habitat for Humanity \nInternational, HFHI, decided to expand its services to include projects \nin my State. Today, I would like to congratulate HFHI's 14 South Dakota \naffiliates\n\n[[Page S13259]]\n\non the occasion of the 200th Habitat home constructed in South Dakota \nsince 1990. I believe I speak for all South Dakotans when I say that \ntheir services have been invaluable to many families in our State.\n  The lack of affordable housing for the lowest income households is a \nserious problem across the country. According to the 2003 State of the \nNation's Housing report issued by the Joint Center for Housing Studies \nof Harvard University, three in 10 U.S. households have housing \naffordability problems. More than 14 million households spend more than \nhalf of their income for housing, and 75 percent of them are in the \nbottom 20 percent of the population by income.\n  Having to pay a disproportionate share of income for housing \nfrequently leads to other problems and tensions for many families. Too \noften, the available housing is substandard, and overcrowded. Many of \nthese families live on the edge, financially, and live in fear of \neviction or foreclosure. Families may have to sacrifice spending for \nother basics, including food and utilities. Children in these families \nalso tend to pay a price. They suffer when their parents have to work \ntwo or more jobs, or odd hours, sacrificing family time. Unstable \nhousing arrangements and frequent moves can also interfere with a \nchild's ability to succeed in school.\n  Habitat for Humanity recognizes that when communities come together, \nthey can help solve this problem, one family at a time. Their \naccomplishments would not be possible without the thousands of \nvolunteers who help support a struggling family, and provide them with \nthe opportunity to turn a Habitat house into their very own home. \nVolunteers from across South Dakota have donated thousands of hours of \nhard labor to give 200 families a shot at the American dream.\n  I would like to take a moment to thank Pat Helgeland, the Executive \nDirector of Habitat for Humanity in South Dakota, and everyone \nassociated with South Dakota's affiliates for their solid commitment \nand hard work. They are truly making an important difference in the \nlives of their partner families.\n  Every time I visit with Habitat volunteers, I am impressed by their \nenergy and spirit as they raise funds, select a site, select a partner \nfamily, and build the house. I was pleased to sponsor a house in \nBrookings, SD, that will now become a home for a mother and her three \nchildren.\n  I am also encouraged to know that Habitat for Humanity is engaged in \na similar effort at the international level. From Thailand to Zimbabwe \nto Peru, its services provide exciting opportunities for home \nownership. We should be proud, for example, that HFHI played a key role \nin providing tools and materials needed to rebuild or repair family \nhomes damaged by years of conflict in Afghanistan.\n  So today I wish to extend my congratulations and thanks to all those \nwho helped build 200 new houses in South Dakota, as well as those who \nare involved in bringing this important model to communities across the \nglobe. Their efforts are truly inspirational.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13259-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING PAUL WELLSTONE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart. It was one \nyear ago on October 25 that I lost my friend, and this body lost a \ngreat Senator. We all have our own memories of Paul Wellstone.\n  We remember the passion of his beliefs. He was an uncompromising \nidealist who stuck to his principles and never wavered. When he fought \nfor an issue like mental health parity, you knew he would never give \nup.\n  We remember Paul Wellstone for his bravery, because even when his \ncause was unpopular, he followed his heart. He used to say, ``We should \nnever separate the lives we live from the words we speak,'' and he \nfollowed that path.\n  We remember what an inspiring speaker Paul could be. The first time I \nheard him was in the Capitol Rotunda at a ceremony for new Senators, \nand I was immediately impressed. Later, he came to Las Vegas and spoke \nto a convention of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. I have never seen a \ngroup so fired up.\n  We remember his physical strength and stamina, even in the last year \nof his life when he was in so much pain. He worked out at the Capitol \nPolice gym, and he still holds the record there for doing the most \nchin-ups.\n  We remember Paul for his unassuming nature. He waged his first \ncampaign in an old green school bus. There is no telling how many \nmechanics across the State of Minnesota worked on that vehicle to keep \nit running.\n  We remember Paul Wellstone for all these reasons. Most of all, we \nwill always remember how easily he made friends and how deeply he \ntouched people.\n  In this Chamber he had good friends on both sides of the aisle. But \nPaul Wellstone also befriended working people, like the janitors who \ncleaned his Senate office. One night, Paul waited until midnight so he \ncould meet them in person and tell them thanks. And in Minnesota, the \naffection for Paul Wellstone cut across all segments of the population.\n  A few days before he lost his life, Paul was riding around the State \nwith Peg McGlinch, a member of my staff who is a Minnesota native, and \nher father. They were running behind schedule, as is often the case on \nthose hectic campaign trips, but when they spotted some union workers \non a picket line, there was no question that they would stop and offer \nsupport. As Paul hopped out of the nondescript car, people seemed \nshocked to see him, until one woman ran over, gave him a big hug, and \ndeclared, ``You're my hero.''\n  Paul Wellstone was a hero to a lot of people. I went to Minnesota \nafter his death, and I was amazed at the spontaneous memorial that \nsprang up all around his campaign headquarters. I saw thousands of \nflowers and candles. I read handwritten notes thanking Paul for work he \nhad done to help people, and looked at pictures of him with people \nwhose lives he had affected.\n  And one thing I will never forget was a crayon drawing of a train \nchugging up into the sky, with a child's simple scrawl that read, \n``Paul Wellstone, the Little Engine that Could.''\n  Paul Wellstone clearly had a special relationship with the people of \nMinnesota. His relationship with his beloved wife, Sheila, was also \nextraordinary. And their lovely daughter Marcia, who also perished in \nthe tragic accident, was so much like both of them. She was an amalgam \nof all their best qualities.\n  Today, as we remember how much Paul Wellstone meant to so many \npeople, our hearts go out to his family--his sons Mark and David, his \ngrandchildren, and other family members. Also to the families of Paul's \nstaff members who were lost with him: Mary McEvoy, Will McLaughlin, and \nTom Lapic.\n  I said my heart was heavy today, and that is true. Paul Wellstone was \nmy friend and I miss him. But I also feel grateful today that I had the \nopportunity to know this remarkable man, and I am grateful for my \nmemories of him, which will never die.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13259-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13259-S13260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATOR PAUL WELLSTONE MENTAL HEALTH EQUITABLE TREATMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in memory of the anniversary over the \nweekend of the death of our friend Paul Wellstone, I rise to reiterate \nmy support for the mental health parity legislation on which he worked \ntirelessly. I am a proud original cosponsor of S. 486. The Senator Paul \nWellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of 2003, which was \nreintroduced this year by Senators Domenici and Kennedy in honor of \nSenator Paul Wellstone. This important legislation will provide people \nwith a mental illness more access to treatment.\n  Specifically, S. 846 prohibits a group health plan that offers mental \nhealth benefits from placing discriminatory caps, access limitations, \nfinancial requirements or other restrictions on treatment that are \ndifferent from other medical and surgical benefits. In other words, S. \n486 treats physical and mental health equally. This bill is modeled \nafter the mental health benefits provided through the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Plan, but provides a special exemption for small \nemployers from such requirements.\n  I have long advocated on behalf of our Nation's rural health care \ndelivery system and mental health parity is a key step to increasing \naccess to mental health services in rural areas. The Domenici-Kennedy \nbill is crucial to\n\n[[Page S13260]]\n\nrural America because suicide rates among rural residents are twice the \nrate of urban areas, and 75 percent of the 518 nationally designated \nMental Health Professional Shortage Areas are located in rural areas.\n  The Senator Paul Wellstone Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act of \n2003 must be passed by Congress as soon as possible, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to work toward its enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13260-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13260-S13261]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             AIR POLLUTION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today the Bush Administration took \ndirect aim against the health of all Americans, but particularly those \nwho are the most vulnerable to air pollution--the elderly, the \nchildren, and the poor. As a result of this frenzy to gut the Clean Air \nAct, millions more of our citizens will now be staring down the barrel \nof a smokestack.\n  The administration's new rule on New Source Review adds to all the \nwoes and worries that people must face everyday. These new threats \ninclude more illness, lung disease, and heart attacks.\n  This Bush administration's EPA is not his father's EPA. At almost \nevery turn, this President Bush is seeking to undo the positive \nenvironmental legacy of his father, with a particular focus on tearing \napart the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.\n  From the beginning, the first President Bush was the motivating force \nbehind passage of that complex, politically balanced and protective \nact. In fact, it was his acid rain proposal that broke the legislative \nlogjam just before passage. His participation during Senate \nconsideration helped ensure passage from this body, and the technical \nassistance of his Federal agencies was critical throughout the process.\n  I was proud to work with the first President Bush and his team. But I \nam not proud of what the current President Bush has done on the \nenvironment. He and his team came to Washington claiming a desire and \nability to work across the aisle. But that hasn't turned out to be the \ncase.\n  This President Bush and his team have intervened in environmental \npolicy throughout the administration on behalf of polluters, not for \nthe health and welfare of the American public and a sustainable \nenvironment. This is a huge contrast with the first President Bush who \ncared about these matters and cooperatively worked with Congress to \naddress environmental problems.\n  We did not solve all the problems related to air pollution in the \n1990 amendments. But, through bipartisan cooperation, we built a strong \nlegal construct and a renewed commitment to gradual and continual \nreductions in harmful emissions. It has survived legal challenges and \nuntil 2001 was working quite effectively from a health and an economic \nperspective.\n  That is when the new Bush administration came to town. They have \nembarked on a comprehensive program to dismantle or slow walk the Clean \nAir Act, starting with the New Source Review program and extending to \nthe ozone and fine particulate matter standards.\n  Their Clear Skies proposal is weaker and slower than the existing \nClean Air Act, if it were fully and faithfully implemented on schedule. \nThe Bush proposal delays the achievement of air quality standards \nbeyond the act or my bill, the Clean Power Act. In the name of \n``flexibility,'' their proposal does away with vital programs designed \nto protect local and regional air quality, some of which have been \nparticularly important to the Northeast.\n  Based on the scientific evidence before us, we know that the 1990 \namendments did not go far enough in specifically controlling pollutants \nthat cause acid rain, global warming and toxic contamination. However, \nthey did provide the Administrator with ample authority to take action \nto address these matters. Instead, this administration has chosen the \npath of delay, non-enforcement, or deregulation.\n  Government regulation must protect the public's health. But, the \nadministration changed the New Source Review rules while Americans \nenjoyed the last of their summer vacations to allow greater levels of \npollution than currently emitted. Some analyses suggest that as many as \n20,000 more premature deaths may occur annually as a result--20,000 \ndeaths. The administration released this terrible news when they \nthought no one would pay attention.\n  I have seen charts showing deaths per hundred thousand people who die \nprematurely from ``grandfathered'' powerplant pollution. These are the \npowerplants that haven't put on modern controls. These are the same \npowerplants that will Never be required to clean up to modern standards \nunder the Bush administration's new NSR rule. Never. And it is not just \npowerplants.\n  Adding insult to that injury, the administration's new rule is \nplainly illegal. So I will be joining with other colleagues in \nCongress, the States, public health and environmental organizations, \nand other members of the public in litigation to stop this newest \nassault on our air quality. The States and attorneys general are filing \ntoday.\n  The Clean Air Act says, and I quote: `` . . . any physical change in, \nor change in the method of operation of, a stationary source which \nincreases the amount of any air pollutant emitted by such source'' \ntriggers New Source Review, NSR. That means if a change or modification \nincreases emissions of air pollutants, then the law requires sources to \nput on modern pollution control technology. It is that simple.\n  This doesn't mean letting polluters reach back 10 years to pick the \nhighest possible emissions baseline from which EPA would then judge the \nincrease. Common sense and case law says that the regulators must use \nrecent actual emissions levels.\n  EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air, Jeff Holmstead, admitted the \nrule will ``in some cases'' allow increases in pollution. That is why \nit is illegal.\n  Mr. Holmstead defends this indefensible rule by suggesting that its \nharm will be limited because sources will not be allowed to exceed \ntheir permitted levels while making these modifications. Sadly, that is \nwrong and its disingenuous. Harm will not be limited, it will be spread \ndownwind of 17,000 plants.\n  Permitted levels for many sources are substantially above their \nrecent average emissions levels. So sources can now increase their \npollution above levels that would have been allowed prior to this rule. \nThat means millions of additional tons of pollutants.\n  The new rule lets emissions increase at facilities without review. \nThat contradicts the Clean Air Act's statutory language and Congress' \nintent. Government officials who issue such illegal rules betray the \npublic's trust and commit malfeasance in my book.\n  Mr. Holmstead told Fox News that, ``We can say categorically that \npollution will not increase as a result of this rule.'' The next day on \nthe PBS ``Newshour,'' he agreed that the rule would allow emissions \nincreases in some cases. Which is true?\n  Mr. Holmstead also had similar trouble giving clear and direct \nanswers to questions during our July 16, 2002, joint hearing between \nthe Judiciary Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  He said he was advised by Agency and DOJ enforcment personnel that \nthe proposed NSR changes wouldn't affect the ongoing enforcement \nactions. The General Accounting Office report and the statements of \nformer Agency enforcement personnel say otherwise. Which is true? We \nhave asked the EPA Inspector General to investigate.\n  NSR was not designed to encourage emissions increases. Instead, \nCongress created it to help continually reduce air emissions as sources \nupgraded their facilities. As they make those improvements, they are \nsupposed to put on modern pollution controls, not be exempt from that \nduty.\n  I am afraid that this rule is part of an administration agenda to \nlock in air pollution increases for a long time to come.\n  The timing of the rule takes advantage of the gap in the permit \nprocess for these plants in the period between the new and old ozone \nstandards.\n  The permitted levels that Mr. Holmstead mentioned are part of the \nStates' plans to achieve attainment with air quality standards, \nincluding the 1-hour ozone standard. That standard will soon be \nreplaced by a more stringent one known as the 8-hour standard. That \nstandard is more protective of public health.\n  As Mr. Holmstead knows, polluters ``permitted levels'' are closely \ntied to States' plans to achieve the old 1-hour standard. They are not \nyet tied to the\n\n[[Page S13261]]\n\nnew, more stringent 8-hour standard or the new fine particulate \nstandard. The States will revise those plans for the new standards, \nincluding adjusting ``permitted'' levels, but that will be done in \n2007-2008.\n  In the meantime, the powerplants and industrial sources exempted by \nthis rule can make huge modifications that increase emissions. These \npollution increases will be locked in for many, many years and make it \nharder to achieve the new air quality standards.\n  I am not opposed to making the New Source Review program work better \nthrough constructive changes. But it is important to know the costs and \nbenefits related to a program before doing radical surgery. An EPA memo \nestimated that just a small portion of the NSR program may have health \nbenefits worth more than $1.8 billion annually. We can ill afford to \nthrow away all the lives represented by that number.\n  Beginning in May 2001, I have repeatedly sought, and most often been \ndenied, full information on the public health and environmental impacts \nof the administration's agenda on New Source Review.\n  I agreed not to subpoena this information, while chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, in exchange for promises that \nmost of it would be forthcoming. Those promises have been broken and I \nam still waiting.\n  And Congress is still waiting for EPA to comply with the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2004 passed in February. That Act \ndirected EPA to fund a study by the National Academy of Sciences to \nlook at the effects on public health of the other NSR changes made on \nNew Year's Eve last year. After 6 months of delay, EPA authorized the \nAcademy to start.\n  A recent General Accounting Office report, which I requested, \ndemonstrates that the administration does not collect and has not \ncollected valid, credible information on the New Source Review program.\n  The Agency has no factual basis to determine that their regulation \nchanges will be beneficial, as they have claimed. Indeed, GAO said that \nEPA and an electric utility industry group think that post-rule \nmodifications may increase efficiency at some facilities, but will also \nencourage greater emissions at those same facilities due to expanded \nproduction.\n  The hypocrisy of the Bush administration is stunning. They want to \nexempt thousands of major sources of pollution from using modern \ncontrol technology. This is based on flimsy and unsubstantiated \nanecdotes.\n  At the same time, they pretend to support ``sound science'' and hide \nbehind the Data Quality Act when choosing not to regulate in the face \nof abundant proof of potential environmental harm.\n  This new NSR rule has been a time-consuming waste of taxpayer's \ndollars. EPA's resources would have been better spent in saving lives \nby taking some kind of regulatory action, any kind of action, over the \nlast 2\\1/2\\ years to halt powerplant pollution.\n  There is real and legitimate authority under the Clean Air Act to do \nthat now. There is even real and legitimate authority to make the New \nSource Review program work better and more efficiently. But the \nadministration has failed to use that authority correctly and \nsquandered their opportunities.\n  Using his father's model, this President Bush could have worked with \nme and my staff and Democrats in Congress to develop a strong \ntripartisan, multi-pollutant bill to control emissions of sulfur \ndioxides, nitrogen oxides, mercury, and carbon dioxide. But they have \nrefused requests for technical assistance, evaded legitimate oversight, \npoliticized every possible matter, and avoided any real policy \ndiscussions.\n  They have spent their time ignoring the people's representatives in \nCongress, pandering to polluters and wishing away the abundant evidence \nthat increasing air pollution causes increases in death, disease and \nillness.\n  Pollution is an indiscriminate weapon. It should be emitted only as a \nlast resort. Instead, this Bush administration brandishes it, boasting \nabout flexibility and ``sound science'' while more people die \nprematurely and the Earth warms. If we were dealing with the first \nadministration, I would breathe easier about the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13261-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13261-S13262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         OKLAHOMA LOSS IN IRAQ\n\n   Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in the time since major combat in Iraq \nhas ended and peacekeeping and transitional operations have begun, the \nUnited States, our allies and the Iraqi people have accomplished much.\n   The men and women of our armed forces in particular deserve much \npraise for their diligence and bravery. They have been given the goal \nof establishing democracy in Iraq, and their success in this endeavor \nis directly linked to the freedom and security we enjoy in the \nhomeland. A free and democratic Iraq will stand as a beacon of hope \namidst one of the world's most troubled regions.\n   Fortunately we are now seeing many of the fruits of their labor.\n   Nearly 760,000 metric tons of food items have been dispatched into \nIraq in just one months' time. Health care centers are receiving \nshipments of health care kits, refrigerators and furniture. Shipments \nof office supplies including furniture, computers and printers have \nbeen received in Iraq and will be used to equip seven essential \ngovernment ministries.\n   The Iraqi people are stepping up to provide leadership for their \nnewly liberated country. Crops are being successfully planted in areas \nthat have not produced for years. Iraqis are volunteering for the new \nIraqi Army. The Iraqi Nurses Association has initiated a 2-day \nconference to lay the ground work for adequate nursing services in Iraq \nover the next ten years and close to 30,000 Iraqis have undergone \ntraining to be members of Iraq's new police force.\n   More importantly, representative democracy in Iraq has taken shape. \nThe Iraqi Governing Council has been formed and brings together 25 \npolitical leaders from across Iraq. The council will name Iraqi \nministers, represent the new country internationally, and draft a \nconstitution that will pave the way for national elections leading to a \nfully sovereign Iraqi government.\n   Recently, we have confirmed that Saddam Hussein's sons, Uday and \nQusay have been killed in a firefight in Mosul. This development has \nled to an increase in tips from the Iraqi people, one of which led us \nto the capture of 660 surface to air missiles, as well as an increasing \nconfidence among the Iraqi people.\n   With two thirds of the Hussein regime gone, one has reason to hope \nthat the final piece of the puzzle will soon follow.\n   And this good news that we are witnessing in Iraq is a direct result \nof the hard work and dedication of our troops. Were it not for their \ncourage and perseverance, our presence in Iraq would be in vain.\n  Our military men and women will surely face more difficult days in \nIraq, and the Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that \ncome with freedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and \noutside forces with goals of their own continue to cause problems, stir \nup trouble and initiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so \nthan in a country that has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n  But today I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one \ncan make for his country.\n  On August 27, Specialist Rafael L. Navea, of Pittsburgh, PA was \nkilled in Fallujah when an improvised explosive device struck his \nvehicle.\n  Specialist Navea was stationed at Fort Sill and therefore an adopted \nOklahoman. He was assigned to C Battery, 2nd Battalion, 5th Field \nArtillery Regiment, a Paladin unit in 212th Field Artillery Brigade. \nThe unit deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom on April 12.\n  Specialist Navea served his country well. Fort Sill and Oklahoma \nmourn his tragic death and now our prayers are with his family and \nfriends. He is survived by his wife and children who reside in Lawton \nand his mother in Florida.\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  Specialist Navea did not die in vain. He died so that many others \nwould live\n\n[[Page S13262]]\n\nfreely. And for that sacrifice, we are forever indebted. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with him and his family today and with the troops who \nare putting their lives on the line in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13262-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe such a crime committed on July 30, 2001. In \nSanta Ana, CA, a 22-year-old man stabbed his 17-year-old Asian \nneighbor, Kenneth Chiu, as the victim was returning from a date. Before \ndying, Mr. Chiu identified his attacker who later confessed that he \ntargeted Mr. Chiu because of his identity.

Mr. President, today I bring to your attention a \ntruly remarkable program. In America, at this point in our history, \nmost people are so far removed from their agrarian roots, they have \nlost all understanding of true ties to the land. This is one of the \nmany problems that agricultural producers face in their battle for \nsurvival.\n  There is a sheep producer in Montana who is working to correct this \nproblem. Pachy Burns is a true Western woman. There is nothing that she \nis not willing to face and, if need be, challenge. Pachy has created a \nprogram called Jam to Lamb. It is an all-women's lambing party that \ninvolves women from all over the United States. Women from every walk \nof life experience the true meaning of ranching by learning through \ndoing.\n  Women who visit Pachy learn about delivering lambs, branding lambs, \nnursing bums, and all of the other necessities of daily ranch life. \nThey learn the truth about issues impacting agriculture such as Federal \nlands and predators.\n  I ask that you all join me in recognition of Pachy Burns, a woman who \nis trying to open not only the eyes but also the hearts of people, who \nshould have a better understanding of where their food comes from. \nPachy is accomplishing this through leadership and friendship the true \nmark of a Westerner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13262-4", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following joint resolution was read the second time, and placed \non the calendar:\n\n       S.J.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change.\n       (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n     has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that \n     most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is \n     attributable to human activities'' and that the average \n     temperature on Earth can be expected to rise between 2.5 and \n     10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings \n     of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPCC's conclusion that most \n     of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to \n     have been due to the increase of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of \n     the scientific community on this issue'' and that ``there is \n     general agreement that the observed warming is real and \n     particularly strong within the past twenty years''. The \n     National Academy of Sciences also noted that ``because there \n     is considerable uncertainty in current understanding of how \n     the climate system varies naturally and reacts to emissions \n     of greenhouse gases and aerosols, current estimates of the \n     magnitude of future warming should be regarded as tentative \n     and subject to future adjustments upward or downward''.\n       (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years the \n     global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has \n     increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, \n     which threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and \n     coastal regions throughout the world.\n       (5) In October 2000, a United States Government report \n     found that global climate change may harm the United States \n     by altering crop yields, accelerating sea-level rise, and \n     increasing the spread of tropical infectious diseases.\n       (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the ultimate \n     objective of which is the ``stabilization of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would \n     prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate \n     system. Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame \n     sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate \n     change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and \n     to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable \n     manner''.\n       (7) The UNFCCC stated in part that the Parties to the \n     Convention are to implement policies ``with the aim of \n     returning . . . to their 1990 levels anthropogenic emissions \n     of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases'' under the \n     principle that ``policies and measures . . . should be \n     appropriate for the specific conditions of each Party and \n     should be integrated with national development programmes, \n     taking into account that economic development is essential \n     for adopting measures to address climate change''.\n       (8) There is a shared international responsibility to \n     address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest \n     historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases, and \n     developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in \n     the future.\n       (9) The UNFCCC further stated that ``developed country \n     Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and \n     the adverse effects thereof'', as these nations are the \n     largest historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases. \n     The UNFCCC also stated that ``steps required to understand \n     and address climate change will be environmentally, socially \n     and economically most effective if they are based on relevant \n     scientific, technical and economic considerations and \n     continually re-evaluated in the light of new findings in \n     these areas''.\n       (10) Senate Resolution 98 of the One Hundred Fifth \n     Congress, which expressed that developing nations must also \n     be included in any future, binding climate change treaty and \n     such a treaty must not result in serious harm to the United \n     States economy, should not cause the United States to abandon \n     its shared responsibility to help reduce the risks of climate \n     change and its impacts. Future international efforts in this \n     regard should focus on recognizing the equitable \n     responsibilities for addressing climate change by all \n     nations, including commitments by the largest developing \n     country emitters in a future, binding climate change treaty.\n       (11) While the United States has elected not to become a \n     party to the Kyoto Protocol at this time, it is the position \n     of the United States that it will not interfere with the \n     plans of any nation that chooses to ratify and implement the \n     Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC.\n       (12) American businesses need to know how governments \n     worldwide will address the risks of climate change.\n       (13) The United States benefits from investments in the \n     research, development, and deployment of a range of clean \n     energy and efficiency technologies that can reduce the risks \n     of climate change and its impacts and that can make the \n     United States economy more productive, bolster energy \n     security, create jobs, and protect the environment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should demonstrate international leadership \n     and responsibility in reducing the health, environmental, and \n     economic risks posed by climate change by--\n       (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and \n     meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from \n     all sectors;\n       (2) creating flexible international and domestic \n     mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology \n     deployment, tradable credits for emissions reductions and \n     carbon sequestration projects that will reduce, avoid, and \n     sequester greenhouse gas emissions;\n       (3) participating in international negotiations, including \n     putting forth a proposal to the Conference of the Parties, \n     with the objective of securing United States participation in \n     a future binding climate change Treaty in a manner that is \n     consistent with the environmental objectives of the UNFCCC, \n     that protects the economic interests of the United States, \n     and that recognizes the shared international responsibility \n     for addressing climate change, including developing country \n     participation; and\n       (4) establishing a bipartisan Senate observer group \n     designated by the chairman and ranking member of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, to monitor any \n     international negotiations on climate change, to ensure that \n     the advice and consent function of the Senate is exercised in \n     a manner so as to facilitate timely consideration of any new \n     treaty submitted to the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 1814. EXTENSION OF AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATION FOR \n                   THE UNITED STATES COMMISSION ON INTERNATIONAL \n                   RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.\n\n       Section 207(a) of the International Religious Freedom Act \n     of 1998 (22 U.S.C. 6435(a))\n\n[[Page S13275]]\n\n     is amended by striking ``2003'' and inserting ``2004''.\n\n     SEC. 1815. JUSTICE FOR UNITED STATES MARINES ACT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Justice for United States Marines Act''.\n       (b) Amendment.--Section 1404C(a)(3) of the Victims of Crime \n     Act of 1984 (42 U.S.C. 10603c(a)(3)) is amended by striking \n     ``December 21, 1988, with respect to which an investigation \n     or'' and inserting ``October 23, 1983, with respect to which \n     an investigation or civil or criminal''.\n\n     SEC. 1816. TREATMENT OF NATIONALS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S \n                   REPUBLIC OF KOREA.\n\n       For purposes of eligibility for refugee status under \n     section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1157), or for asylum under section 208 of such Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1158), a national of the Democratic People's Republic of \n     Korea shall not be considered a national of the Republic of \n     Korea.\n\n     SEC. 1817. GLOBAL DEMOCRACY PROMOTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is a fundamental principle of American medical \n     ethics and practice that health care providers should, at all \n     times, deal honestly and openly with patients. Any attempt to \n     subvert the private and sensitive physician-patient \n     relationship would be intolerable in the United States and is \n     an unjustifiable intrusion into the practices of health care \n     providers when attempted in other countries.\n       (2) Freedom of speech is a fundamental American value. The \n     ability to exercise the right to free speech, which includes \n     the ``right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \n     petition the government for a redress of grievances'' is \n     essential to a thriving democracy and is protected under the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (3) The promotion of democracy is a principal goal of \n     United States foreign policy and critical to achieving \n     sustainable development. It is enhanced through the \n     encouragement of democratic institutions and the promotion of \n     an independent and politically active civil society in \n     developing countries.\n       (4) Limiting eligibility for United States development and \n     humanitarian assistance upon the willingness of a foreign \n     nongovernmental organization to forgo its right to use its \n     own funds to address, within the democratic process, a \n     particular issue affecting the citizens of its own country \n     directly undermines a key goal of United States foreign \n     policy and would violate the United States Constitution if \n     applied to United States-based organizations.\n       (5) Similarly, limiting the eligibility for United States \n     assistance on a foreign nongovernmental organization's \n     willingness to forgo its right to provide, with its own \n     funds, medical services that are legal in its own country and \n     would be legal if provided in the United States constitutes \n     unjustifiable interference with the ability of independent \n     organizations to serve the critical health needs of their \n     fellow citizens and demonstrates a disregard and disrespect \n     for the laws of sovereign nations as well as for the laws of \n     the United States.\n       (b) Assistance for Foreign Nongovernmental Organizations \n     Under Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or \n     policy, in determining eligibility for assistance authorized \n     under part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2151 et seq.), foreign nongovernmental organizations--\n       (1) shall not be ineligible for such assistance solely on \n     the basis of health or medical services including counseling \n     and referral services, provided by such organizations with \n     non-United States Government funds if such services do not \n     violate the laws of the country in which they are being \n     provided and would not violate United States Federal law if \n     provided in the United States; and\n       (2) shall not be subject to requirements relating to the \n     use of non-United States Government funds for advocacy and \n     lobbying activities other than those that apply to United \n     States nongovernmental organizations receiving assistance \n     under part I of such Act.\n\n     SEC. 1818. SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY REFORM IN IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Iran is neither free nor democratic. Men and women are \n     not treated equally in Iran, women are legally deprived of \n     internationally recognized human rights, and religious \n     freedom is not respected under the laws of Iran. Undemocratic \n     institutions, such as the Guardians Council, thwart the \n     decisions of elected leaders.\n       (2) The April 2003 report of the Department of State states \n     that Iran remained the most active state sponsor of terrorism \n     in 2002.\n       (3) That report also states that Iran continues to provide \n     funding, safe-haven, training, and weapons to known terrorist \n     groups, notably Hizballah, HAMAS, the Palestine Islamic \n     Jihad, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that--\n       (1) currently, there is not a free and fully democratic \n     government in Iran;\n       (2) the United States supports transparent, full democracy \n     in Iran;\n       (3) the United States supports the rights of the Iranian \n     people to choose their system of government; and\n       (4) the United States condemns the brutal treatment, \n     imprisonment, and torture of Iranian civilians expressing \n     political dissent.\n\n     SEC. 1819. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO VIOLENCE AGAINST \n                   WOMEN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Article 4 of the Declaration on the Elimination of \n     Violence Against Women adopted by the United Nations General \n     Assembly in Resolution 48/104 on December 20, 1993, proclaims \n     that ``States should condemn violence against women and \n     should not invoke any custom, tradition or religious \n     consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its \n     elimination.''.\n       (2) Paragraph 124 of chapter IV of the Platform for Action, \n     which was adopted along with the Beijing Declaration by the \n     Fourth World Conference on Women on September 15, 1995, \n     states that actions to be taken by governments include \n     condemning violence against women and refraining from \n     invoking any custom, tradition, or religious consideration as \n     a means to avoid the obligations of such governments with \n     respect to the elimination of violence against women as such \n     obligations are referred to in the Declaration on the \n     Elimination of Violence against Women.\n       (3) The United States has supported the Declaration on the \n     Elimination of Violence Against Women and the Beijing \n     Declaration and Platform for Action.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should continue to condemn violence against \n     women and should urge states to refrain from invoking any \n     custom, tradition, or practices in the name of religion or \n     culture as a means to avoid obligations regarding the \n     elimination of violence against women as referred to in \n     Article 4 of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence \n     Against Women.\n\n     SEC. 1820.

Con. Res. 95, 108th Congress, 1st \n     session).\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Act.--The term ``Act'' means the United States \n     Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of \n     2003 (Public Law 108-25; 22 U.S.C. 7601 et seq.).\n       (2) Global fund.--The term ``Global Fund'' means the \n     public-private partnership known as the Global Fund to Fight \n     AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria established pursuant to \n     Article 80 of the Swiss Civil Code.\n\n     SEC. 1827.

SENSE OF SENATE ON EXECUTIVE BRANCH COOPERATION \n                   WITH THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TERRORIST \n                   ATTACKS UPON THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On November 15, 2002, Congress passed legislation by a \n     wide bipartisan margin to establish the National Commission \n     on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States to determine the \n     facts surrounding the attacks of September 11, 2001, and to \n     help the Nation prevent any future terrorist attacks. On \n     November 27, 2002, President Bush signed the legislation into \n     law as title VI of the Intelligence Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-306; 116 Stat. 2408; 6 \n     U.S.C. 101 note).\n       (2) There was broad bipartisan consensus that the work of \n     the Commission was of national importance and of particular \n     significance to the families of the victims of the attacks of \n     September 11, 2001.\n       (3) The work of the Commission is essential to discovering \n     what weaknesses and vulnerabilities were exploited to \n     successfully perpetrate the deadly attacks of September 11, \n     2001.\n       (4) The Commission is required to ``ascertain, evaluate, \n     and report on the evidence developed by all relevant \n     governmental agencies regarding the facts and circumstances \n     surrounding the attacks'' and to complete its work by May, \n     2004.\n       (5) Both the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Commission \n     have recently announced that many of the relevant agencies--\n     most\n\n[[Page S13277]]\n\n     notably the Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, \n     the Department of Homeland Security, and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency--have failed to provide the bulk of the \n     documents the Commission has requested and some of those \n     agencies have prevented the Commission from conducting \n     independent interviews with officials who may have important \n     information about the tragic events of September 11, 2001.\n       (6) Members of the Commission have also acknowledged that \n     if this cooperation is not forthcoming in the next several \n     weeks, the Commission will not be able to meet the May 2004 \n     statutory deadline to conclude its investigation and report \n     its findings to Congress and the President.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) President Bush should immediately and publicly require \n     all executive branch agencies, especially the Department of \n     Defense, the Department of Justice, the Department of \n     Homeland Security, and the Central Intelligence Agency, to \n     provide their fullest and most timely cooperation to the \n     Commission, and permit the Commission unfettered access to \n     agency officials for interviews, so that the Commission can \n     complete its mission in the time allotted by law;\n       (2) The Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, \n     the Department of Homeland Security, and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency should submit to Congress by August 15, \n     2003, and quarterly thereafter for the life of the \n     Commission, a report on the actions taken by each such \n     department or agency to comply with the requests of the \n     Commission; and\n       (3) the Commission should submit to Congress and the \n     President, by August 15, 2003, and quarterly thereafter, a \n     report assessing the compliance of each department and agency \n     referred to in paragraph (2) with the requests of the \n     Commission.\n\n     SEC. 1832. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AN INVESTIGATION INTO \n                   ASSERTIONS THAT IRAQ ATTEMPTED TO OBTAIN \n                   URANIUM FROM AFRICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the State of the Union address in January 2003, the \n     President asserted that ``[t]he British government has \n     learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant \n     quantities of uranium from Africa''.\n       (2) It has been determined that the claim regarding the \n     efforts of Iraq to obtain uranium from Africa cannot be \n     substantiated.\n       (3) In May 2003, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate requested that \n     the Inspector General of the Department and the Inspector \n     General of the Central Intelligence Agency work jointly to \n     investigate the handling and characterization of the \n     underlying documents behind the assertions regarding the \n     efforts of Iraq to obtain uranium from Africa.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Congress supports the thorough and expeditious joint \n     investigation by the Inspector General of the Department and \n     the Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency into \n     the documents or other materials that the President relied on \n     to conclude that Iraq had attempted to obtain uranium from \n     Africa;\n       (2) the findings and conclusions of the joint investigation \n     should be completed not later than September 12, 2003;\n       (3) such findings and conclusions should be unclassified to \n     the maximum extent possible, while fully protecting any \n     intelligence sources or methods; and\n       (4) such findings and conclusions should be sent to the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, the Permanent \n     Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives, and the appropriate congressional \n     committees.\n\n     SEC. 1833. REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL COFFEE CRISIS.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development and the Secretary of the Treasury, shall submit a \n     report to the appropriate congressional committees describing \n     the progress the United States is making towards meeting the \n     objectives set forth in paragraph (1) of Senate Resolution \n     368, 107th Congress, agreed to November 20, 2002, and in \n     paragraph (1) of House Resolution 604, 107th Congress, agreed \n     to November 15, 2002, including adopting a global strategy to \n     deal with the international coffee crisis and measures to \n     support and complement multilateral efforts to respond to the \n     international coffee crisis.\n\n          TITLE XIX--PEACE CORPS CHARTER FOR THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n     SEC. 1901. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for \n     the 21st Century Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1902. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n     world peace and friendship through the service of United \n     States volunteers abroad.\n       (2) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n     follows:\n       (A) To help people in developing nations meet basic needs.\n       (B) To promote understanding of America's values and ideals \n     abroad.\n       (C) To promote an understanding of other peoples by \n     Americans.\n       (3) The three goals, which are codified in the Peace Corps \n     Act, have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the \n     years, and worked in concert to promote global acceptance of \n     the principles of international peace and nonviolent \n     coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \n     government.\n       (4) Since its establishment, approximately 165,000 Peace \n     Corps volunteers have served in 135 countries.\n       (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n     remains the world's premier international service \n     organization dedicated to promoting grassroots development.\n       (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n     trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n     promote peace, friendship, and international understanding.\n       (7) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n     budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (8) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore \n     no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should be used to \n     accomplish any goal other than the goals established by the \n     Peace Corps Act.\n       (9) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n     harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n     volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n     extent the talent pool of returned Peace Corps volunteers.\n       (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n     about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n     particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n     greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n     greater understanding and tolerance.\n       (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n     expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n     of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service.\n       (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps must not jeopardize \n     the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n     therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n     in field and headquarters support staff.\n       (14) In order to ensure that proposed expansion of the \n     Peace Corps preserves the integrity of the program and the \n     security of volunteers, the integrated Planning and Budget \n     System supported by the Office of Planning and Policy \n     Analysis should continue its focus on strategic planning.\n       (15) A streamlined, bipartisan National Peace Corps \n     Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace \n     Corps volunteers and other individuals, with diverse \n     backgrounds and expertise, can be a source of ideas and \n     suggestions that may be useful to the Director of the Peace \n     Corps in discharging the Director's duties and \n     responsibilities.\n\n     SEC. 1903. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Peace Corps.\n       (2) Peace corps volunteer.--The term ``Peace Corps \n     volunteer'' means a volunteer or a volunteer leader under the \n     Peace Corps Act.\n       (3) Returned peace corps volunteer.--The term ``returned \n     Peace Corps volunteer'' means a person who has been certified \n     by the Director as having served satisfactorily as a Peace \n     Corps volunteer.\n\n     SEC. 1904.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Global Pathogen \n     Surveillance Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2402. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Bioterrorism poses a grave national security threat to \n     the United States. The insidious nature of the threat, the \n     likely delayed recognition in the event of an attack, and the \n     underpreparedness of the domestic public health \n     infrastructure may produce catastrophic consequences \n     following a biological weapons attack upon the United States.\n       (2) A contagious pathogen engineered as a biological weapon \n     and developed, tested, produced, or released in another \n     country can quickly spread to the United States. Given the \n     realities of international travel, trade, and migration \n     patterns, a dangerous pathogen released anywhere in the world \n     can spread to United States territory in a matter of days, \n     before any effective quarantine or isolation measures can be \n     implemented.\n\n[[Page S13290]]\n\n       (3) To effectively combat bioterrorism and ensure that the \n     United States is fully prepared to prevent, diagnose, and \n     contain a biological weapons attack, measures to strengthen \n     the domestic public health infrastructure and improve \n     domestic surveillance and monitoring, while absolutely \n     essential, are not sufficient.\n       (4) The United States should enhance cooperation with the \n     World Health Organization, regional health organizations, and \n     individual countries, including data sharing with appropriate \n     United States departments and agencies, to help detect and \n     quickly contain infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorism \n     agents before they can spread.\n       (5) The World Health Organization (WHO) has done an \n     impressive job in monitoring infectious disease outbreaks \n     around the world, including the recent emergence of the \n     Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic, \n     particularly with the establishment in April 2000 of the \n     Global Outbreak Alert and Response network.\n       (6) The capabilities of the World Health Organization are \n     inherently limited by the quality of the data and information \n     it receives from member countries, the narrow range of \n     diseases (plague, cholera, and yellow fever) upon which its \n     disease surveillance and monitoring is based, and the \n     consensus process it uses to add new diseases to the list. \n     Developing countries in particular often cannot devote the \n     necessary resources to build and maintain public health \n     infrastructures.\n       (7) In particular, developing countries could benefit \n     from--\n       (A) better trained public health professionals and \n     epidemiologists to recognize disease patterns;\n       (B) appropriate laboratory equipment for diagnosis of \n     pathogens;\n       (C) disease reporting based on symptoms and signs (known as \n     ``syndrome surveillance''), affording the earliest possible \n     opportunity to conduct an effective response;\n       (D) a narrowing of the existing technology gap in syndrome \n     surveillance capabilities and real-time information \n     dissemination to public health officials; and\n       (E) appropriate communications equipment and information \n     technology to efficiently transmit information and data \n     within national and regional health networks, including \n     inexpensive, Internet-based Geographic Information Systems \n     (GIS) and relevant telephone-based systems for early \n     recognition and diagnosis of diseases.\n       (8) An effective international capability to monitor and \n     quickly diagnose infectious disease outbreaks will offer \n     dividends not only in the event of biological weapons \n     development, testing, production, and attack, but also in the \n     more likely cases of naturally occurring infectious disease \n     outbreaks that could threaten the United States.

It largely was ineffective as a \n     deterrent to human rights abuses or as a corrective force.''\n       (4) The Department of State's 2002 Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices in Rwanda states that ``there were credible \n     reports that Rwandan Defense Force units operating in the \n     [Democratic Republic of the Congo] committed deliberate \n     unlawful killings and other serious abuses, and impunity \n     remained a problem,'' and that ``the Government continued to \n     conduct genocide trials at a slow pace.''\n       (5) The Department of State's 2002 Country Report on Human \n     Rights Practices in Uganda states that ``security forces used \n     excessive force, at times resulting in death, and committed \n     or failed to prevent extrajudicial killings of suspected \n     rebels and civilians. The Government enacted measures to \n     improve the discipline and training of security forces and \n     punished some security force officials who were guilty of \n     abuses; however, abuses by the security forces remained a \n     problem.''\n       (6) Ongoing human rights abuses in the Democratic Republic \n     of the Congo, including ethnically-based conflict in Ituri \n     province, threaten the integrity and viability of the \n     Congolese peace process.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United \n     States Government to support--\n       (1) efforts aimed at accounting for the grave human rights \n     abuses and crimes against humanity that have taken place \n     throughout the central African region since 1993;\n       (2) programs to encourage reconciliation in communities \n     affected by such crimes; and\n       (3) efforts aimed at preventing such crimes in the future.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report on the \n     actions taken by the United States Government to implement \n     the policy set out in subsection (b).\n       (d) Authorization.--Of the amounts made available under \n     chapter 4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.), up to $12,000,000 may be made \n     available for fiscal year 2004 to support the development of \n     responsible justice and reconciliation mechanisms in the \n     Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, and \n     Uganda, including programs to increase awareness of gender-\n     based violence and to improve local capacity to prevent and \n     respond to such violence.\n       (e) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and \n     the Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 2516.

Since then, the \n     United States has provided over $3,000,000,000 in support of \n     Plan Colombia.\n       (2) During this period, the Government of Colombia, with \n     United States support, has made progress in the eradication \n     and seizure of illegal drugs.\n       (3) According to reports--\n       (A) the total area of coca cultivation in Colombia has \n     declined 59.9 percent from 163,289 hectares in 2000 to \n     102,071 at the end of 2002, with a further additional 65,000 \n     hectares to be sprayed with herbicides in 2003;\n       (B) 3,300 hectares of poppy crop have been sprayed with \n     herbicides in 2002, and an additional 1,658 hectares to be \n     sprayed in 2003; and\n       (C) between January 2002 and May 2003, 100 tons of pure \n     cocaine and 850 kilos of heroin have been seized with a \n     street value of approximately $3,000,000,000.\n       (4) The armed forces of Colombia have 60 percent more \n     combat-ready troops than in 1999, including three United \n     States-trained counterdrug brigades and five riverine \n     brigades.\n       (5) The armed forces of Colombia are taking steps against \n     the drug traffickers and terrorists in Colombia, as \n     demonstrated by the capture, as of July 2003, of some 3,553 \n     guerrillas and 1,336 members of paramilitaries and the \n     surrender of an additional 1,138 members of illegal groups, \n     the destruction of more than 1,000 coca laboratories, the \n     confiscation of solid and liquid chemicals used for \n     manufacturing cocaine, and the seizure of weapons from \n     guerrillas and drug traffickers.\n       (6) In the past several years, the Government of Colombia \n     has extradited 78 persons to the United States to face trial \n     on narcotics and terrorism charges.\n       (7) The Government of Colombia is working to establish law \n     and order in Colombia--\n       (A) homicides have reportedly declined in Colombia during \n     the first months of 2003, as compared to the same period in \n     2002; and\n       (B) kidnappings have reportedly declined during the first \n     months of 2003, as compared to the same period in 2002.\n       (8) The Government of Colombia is training and equipping \n     during 2003, thousands of new police officers who will be \n     stationed in hundreds of rural towns where there is little or \n     no police presence.\n       (9) The Government of Colombia plans to increase defense \n     spending from 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product in \n     2002 to 5.8 percent of its gross domestic product by 2006, \n     and to enlarge its armed forces by 126,000 troops.\n       (10) It is in the national interests of the United States \n     to continue to support the efforts of President Alvaro Uribe \n     Velez of Colombia, and the Government and people of Colombia, \n     to stop narcotics trafficking, end terrorism, strengthen \n     democracy, and protect human rights.\n       (b) Commendation.--The Senate--\n       (1) commends President Alvaro Uribe Velez of Colombia and \n     the Government and the people of Colombia on the third \n     anniversary of Plan Colombia and for their efforts in \n     fighting illegal drugs and terrorism; and\n       (2) supports and encourages the efforts of President Uribe \n     and the Government and people of Colombia to preserve and \n     strengthen democracy, protect human rights, and provide \n     economic opportunity in Colombia.\n\n     SEC. 2524. IN APPRECIATION OF OUR ARMED FORCES AND REGARDING \n                   RESTORING STABILITY AND SECURITY IN IRAQ.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Armed Forces, with the support of \n     forces from Great Britain and other countries, historically \n     and courageously liberated Iraq in 3 weeks.\n       (2) Conditions on the ground in parts of Iraq continue to \n     pose a grave threat to American troops, thereby complicating \n     efforts to restore law and order and essential public \n     services for Iraqis and these efforts are further complicated \n     by the absence of effective communication with the Iraqi \n     people.\n       (3) Ultimately, maintaining law and order in Iraq and \n     preserving its territorial integrity will require the \n     creation of a professionally trained Iraqi police force and a \n     reformed Iraqi military but that will take a significant \n     amount of time and in the meantime international armed forces \n     and police must assume these responsibilities.\n       (4) Approximately 145,000 United States troops are \n     currently deployed in Iraq, meaning that American troops \n     comprise roughly 90 percent of Coalition forces, and even if, \n     as the Department of Defense has stated, an additional 10,000 \n     international troops join the Coalition effort in Iraq by \n     September, Americans will still comprise roughly 85 percent \n     of Coalition forces.\n       (5) Maintaining the existing force level in Iraq currently \n     requires $3,900,000,000 each month.\n       (6) The Department of Defense has stated that it will \n     require 1 year to train a new Iraqi Army of 12,000 soldiers \n     and 3 years to train 40,000 soldiers.\n       (7) The Coalition Provisional Authority has stated that it \n     will require at least 1 year to recruit and train a police \n     force of 40,000 officers capable of assuming minimal police \n     functions in Iraq, that it will require 5 years to recruit \n     and train a full force of 75,000 officers, and that at least \n     5,500 additional international police are needed to train, \n     assist, and jointly patrol with the existing Iraqi police \n     force.\n       (8) President Bush has noted that ``The rise of Iraq, as an \n     example of moderation and democracy and prosperity, is a \n     massive and long-term undertaking'', and it is clear that \n     increasing the number of troops and police from countries \n     other than the United States will reduce risks to American \n     soldiers and the financial cost to the United States.\n       (9) Secretary Rumsfeld testified that ``We certainly want \n     assistance from NATO and from NATO countries'' and it is \n     clear that involving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     as is being done in Afghanistan and has been done in Kosovo \n     and Bosnia, allows the Coalition to maintain a robust \n     military presence while decreasing the exposure and risk to \n     American troops.\n       (10) Rebuilding Iraq's neglected infrastructure and economy \n     and administering Iraq--including providing basic services \n     and paying public sector salaries--is likely to require tens \n     of billions of dollars over several years and projected Iraqi \n     oil revenues will be insufficient to meet these costs.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) it is in the national security interests of the United \n     States to remain engaged in Iraq in order to ensure a \n     peaceful, stable, unified Iraq with a representative \n     government;\n       (2) the President should consider requesting formally and \n     expeditiously that NATO raise a force for deployment in post-\n     war Iraq similar to what it has done in Afghanistan, Bosnia, \n     and Kosovo and Congress urges NATO allies and other nations \n     to provide troops and police to Coalition efforts in Iraq; \n     and\n       (3) the President should consider calling on the United \n     Nations to urge its member states to provide military forces \n     and civilian police to promote stability and security in Iraq \n     and resources to help rebuild and administer Iraq.\n\n              DIVISION D--MILLENNIUM CHALLENGE ASSISTANCE\n\n     SEC. 3001. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Millennium Challenge \n     Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 3002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On March 14, 2002, President George W. Bush stated that \n     ``America supports the international development goals in the \n     U.N. Millennium Declaration, and believes that the goals are \n     a shared responsibility of developed and developing \n     countries.'' The President also called for a ``new compact \n     for global development, defined by new accountability for \n     both rich and poor nations'' and pledged support for \n     increased assistance from the United States through the \n     establishment of a Millennium Challenge Account for countries \n     that govern justly, invest in their own people, and encourage \n     economic freedom.\n       (2) The elimination of extreme poverty and the achievement \n     of the other international development goals of the United \n     Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the United Nations \n     General Assembly on September 8, 2000, are important \n     objectives and\n\n[[Page S13295]]\n\n     it is appropriate for the United States to make development \n     assistance available in a manner that will assist in \n     achieving such goals.\n       (3) The availability of financial assistance through a \n     Millennium Challenge Account, linked to performance by \n     developing countries, can contribute significantly to the \n     achievement of the international development goals of the \n     United Nations Millennium Declaration.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are--\n       (1) to provide United States assistance for global \n     development through the Millennium Challenge Corporation, as \n     described in section 3102; and\n       (2) to provide such assistance in a manner that promotes \n     economic growth and the elimination of extreme poverty and \n     strengthens good governance, economic freedom, and \n     investments in people.\n\n     SEC. 3003.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 \n     percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and \n     prisons have a mental illness.\n       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in \n     the juvenile justice system have serious mental health \n     problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental \n     health and substance abuse disorders.\n       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious \n     mental illness will come into contact with the American \n     criminal justice system at some point in their lives.\n       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into \n     contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the \n     diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional \n     disorder.\n       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious \n     mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice \n     system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and \n     many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor, \n     nonviolent offenses.\n       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or \n     emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or \n     juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and \n     psychological interventions that integrate treatment, \n     rehabilitation, and support services.\n       (7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance \n     abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure \n     the provision of services for those with mental illness or \n     co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can \n     reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile \n     corrections facilities, while providing improved public \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 250\n\n       Whereas, in 1995, Romania joined with the United States and \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to provide \n     assistance to the Stabilization Force (SFOR) deployed to \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina to support peace, security, and \n     freedom in the western Balkans;\n       Whereas, in 1999, Romania joined with the United States and \n     NATO member countries to provide assistance for Operation \n     Allied Force to use military force in order to halt the \n     genocide, known as ethnic cleansing, that was taking place in \n     Kosovo;\n       Whereas, after the conclusion of Operation Allied Force, \n     Romania provided support to democracy activists from the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in their successful efforts to \n     end the rule of Yugoslav dictator Slobodan Milosevic, and \n     also provided support to NATO stabilization forces deployed \n     in Kosovo Force (KFOR);\n       Whereas, following the terrorist attacks upon the United \n     States in September 2001, the Government of Romania \n     immediately expressed its sympathy for Americans and others \n     killed in the attacks and pledged its full support in \n     fighting the war on terror;\n       Whereas, on September 19, 2001, the Romanian Parliament \n     voted to open Romanian territory and airspace to United \n     States Armed Forces involved in Operation Enduring Freedom in \n     Afghanistan;\n       Whereas thousands of American aircraft flew through \n     Romanian airspace during the combat phase of Operation \n     Enduring Freedom, and continue to do so as part of peace-\n     building efforts;\n       Whereas, beginning on June 2002, Romanian aircraft flew \n     Romanian soldiers to serve in Afghanistan as part of the \n     forces involved in Operation Enduring Freedom and the \n     International Security Assistance Force, and over 500 elite \n     Romanian soldiers are currently stationed in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas Romania stood with the United States as a vital \n     member of the international coalition in Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom by offering diplomatic, political, and military \n     support;\n       Whereas, in a January 31, 2003, letter to President George \n     W. Bush, President Ion Iliescu of Romania stated that \n     ``Romania can understand that aggressive dictators cannot be \n     appeased or ignored, but always be opposed. Romanians indeed \n     know the value of freedom and living in peace. They have seen \n     the face of evil embodied in communism and deeply share your \n     conviction, expressed in the State of the Union address, that \n     `free people will set the course of history' '';\n       Whereas, on February 12, 2003, the Romanian Parliament \n     voted to open Romanian territory and airspace to United \n     States Armed Forces carrying out Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       Whereas hundreds of American aircraft flew through Romanian \n     airspace and landed\n\n[[Page S13323]]\n\n     at Romanian airfields during the combat phase of Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom from May to July 2003;\n       Whereas thousands of United States soldiers were stationed \n     and transported into the Iraq theatre of operations from \n     Mihail Kogalniceanu Air Base, and the neighboring Black Sea \n     port of Constantza was also used in the fall of 2002 and \n     spring of 2003 for rotating United States Armed Forces and \n     equipment in and out of the Balkans;\n       Whereas, beginning on March 12, 2003, Romania began \n     deploying military forces to Iraq to assist in building \n     security, peace, and democracy, and over 750 Romanian \n     soldiers are currently stationed in Iraq;\n       Whereas the Government of Romania has spent more than \n     $160,000,000 during the past two years to fund its \n     participation in SFOR, KFOR, Operation Enduring Freedom, the \n     International Security Assistance Force, and Operation Iraqi \n     Freedom;\n       Whereas, together with Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, Romania successfully \n     achieved the military, economic, and political reforms \n     necessary to be invited, at the November 2002 summit meeting \n     in Prague of the North Atlantic Council, to join the NATO \n     alliance;\n       Whereas, in his historic address at Piata Revolutiei on \n     November 23, 2002, President Bush told the Romanian people \n     that ``Romania has made a historic journey. Instead of \n     hatred, you have chosen tolerance. Instead of destructive \n     rivalry with your neighbors, you have chosen reconciliation. \n     Instead of state control, you have chosen free markets and \n     the rule of law. And instead of dictatorship, you have built \n     a proud and working democracy.''; and\n       Whereas, on May 8, 2003, the Senate voted 96 to 0 to \n     approve the resolution of advice and consent to the Protocols \n     to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession of \n     Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and \n     Slovenia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) appreciates the support expressed by the people of \n     Romania for strong and vibrant relations between the United \n     States and Romania;\n       (2) recognizes the steps the Government of Romania has \n     taken and continues to take in economic, political, and \n     social reforms, including reforms to improve protections of \n     the rights of minorities and to promote awareness and \n     understanding of the Holocaust;\n       (3) commends Romania for its leadership and commitment in \n     promoting regional peace and security in the Balkan and Black \n     Sea regions;\n       (4) values the participation of a significant number of \n     Romanian troops and civilian experts in Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, the permission granted \n     by the Government of Romania for the United States to use \n     Romanian airspace and territory, and the deployment of \n     Romanian military forces in support of Operation Enduring \n     Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, all of which have been \n     important contributions to the global war on terror and serve \n     as a tangible and ongoing demonstration of Romania's \n     commitment as an ally of the United States;\n       (5) supports further cooperation between the United States \n     and Romania in the process of stabilizing and reconstructing \n     Iraq, including the utilization of Romania's experience \n     emerging from a Communist dictatorship and creating a \n     functioning democracy and free market economy; and\n       (6) welcomes Romanian President Ion Iliescu to the United \n     States and looks forward to expanded political, diplomatic, \n     economic, and military cooperation between Romania and the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13323-1", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S.J.

The clerk will read \nthe title of the joint resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 21) expressing the sense of \n     Congress that the number of years during which the death tax \n     under subtitle B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     repealed should be extended, pending the permanent repeal of \n     the death tax.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object to further proceedings on the measure at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13323-2", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2003\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m., \nTuesday, October 28. I further ask that following the prayer and the \npledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings \nbe approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their \nuse later in the day, and the Senate then proceed to executive session \nto consider the Leavitt nomination as provided under the previous \norder; provided that following the disposition of the nomination, the \nSenate return to legislative session and resume consideration of H.R. \n2800, the foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  I further ask consent that the Senate recess tomorrow from 12:30 to \n2:15 for the weekly party lunches.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I have had the opportunity today \nto speak to the distinguished Senator from Kentucky on a number of \nissues. One of the things that I did not speak to him about--and I have \nhad a number of inquiries on this side--is if we are unable to adjourn \nby next Friday, November 7, the date that the distinguished majority \nleader has suggested, a real question arises as to what we are going to \ndo the Monday and Tuesday of the following week. We need to have a \ndecision made on that real soon because it is Veterans Day and there \nare some parades around the country in which people want to be \ninvolved. So I say to the distinguished majority whip that if the \nleader could make a decision on that as quickly as possible, \nmany people would appreciate that.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appreciate that. I know the majority \nleader's thinking at the moment is that Monday would be a workday. We \nhave a lot of work to do if we plan to finish up this session, \ncertainly before Thanksgiving, if not sooner, which I think would be \nthe preference of most of the Members. I think it is his current \nintention, which I am sure he will address in the next few days, that \nthe Monday before Veterans Day, which falls on a Tuesday, would be a \nworkday.\n  Mr. REID. I would simply say to my friend from Kentucky that I \nbelieve that is a wise decision. We have a lot to do and every day that \nwe are not here means that much longer we have to go into Thanksgiving \nand, perish the thought, thinking about Christmas.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Nevada is absolutely right. If we take \noff Monday and then Tuesday, people will start coming in on Wednesday, \nand pretty soon it is Wednesday night and we have squandered the whole \nweek. So I am sure the majority leader will address that in the next \nday or two. I know it is his current intention that the Monday before \nVeterans Day, which falls on Tuesday, would be a workday.\n  Mr. REID. If I could just say one more thing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I know my veterans in Nevada would understand because a lot \nof the work we are doing is directly related to them anyway.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/10/27/senate-section/article/S13323-3", "month": "10", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13323-S13324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. For the information of all Senators, tomorrow the \nSenate will resume consideration of the Leavitt nomination to be \nAdministrator of EPA. Under the previous order, there will be 1 hour of \ndebate prior to the vote on the nomination. The vote on the Leavitt \nnomination, therefore, will occur at around 10:30 a.m. tomorrow. That \nvote will be the first vote of the day.\n  Following the disposition of the Leavitt nomination, the Senate will \nresume debate on the foreign operations appropriations bill. There are \nseveral amendments pending that have been laid aside. As the chairman \nof that subcommittee, the manager of that bill, it is our hope and \nexpectation--and I know I speak for Senator Leahy when I say this--that \nwe will wrap up the foreign operations bill sometime tomorrow night. \nThere is really not a flood of amendments on either side, and there is \nno reason we should not be able to march on through that bill tomorrow \nand finish it up tomorrow night.\n  Therefore, Senators obviously should expect rollcall votes throughout \nthe day tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S13324]]\n\n    \n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
