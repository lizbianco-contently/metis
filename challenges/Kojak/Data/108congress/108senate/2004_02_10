Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the highway bill. There are several amendments pending \nto the legislation and it is hoped that we can consider and dispose of \nthose amendments during today's session. Although it appears as though \nwe have not made as much progress on the floor as most of us would \nlike, the chairman and ranking member have been working with a number \nof Senators on their amendments--as we said, working through the \nweekend and through yesterday. Thus, work continues on that front. And, \nagain, on behalf of the managers, I encourage Senators to come forward \nand offer their amendments and discuss those amendments with the \nmanagers.\n  Rollcall votes are possible today as we continue to look for ways to \nmake progress on the bill. I have been talking to the chairman about \nthe continued desire to finish the bill this week. Although last week \nwas a challenge in the Senate, the bill has been pending since that \ntime, and we had hoped to have considered more floor amendments under \nthe regular order.\n  We have now been on the bill 7 days. Again, there has been a lot of \ndiscussion, but I do ask our colleagues to accelerate the process of \nthe consideration of amendments. And they must be brought forward now.\n  I will continue with discussions with the managers to look for an \nappropriate avenue for completing this bill this week. I will notify \nall Senators as we proceed as to when rollcall votes can be expected.\n  I thank everybody for their attention.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. President, I say, through you to the majority leader, one of the \nthings we have appreciated on this side during the tenure of the \nSenator from Tennessee as majority leader is that you have been very \ngood to us, with rare exception, in allowing us to offer amendments. \nYou have given us ample time to offer relevant amendments and \nnonrelevant amendments prior to doing something procedurally to stop \nthe debate.\n  I recognize, as does Senator Inhofe, that it is not the Republican \nleadership that has thrown the roadblocks up to the amendment process \non this bill. We acknowledge that. There are a number of Senators, for \nvarious reasons, who have prevented this bill from moving forward.\n  Speaking only for this Senator, I do not hold the Republican \nleadership responsible for these dilatory activities. I think the \nmajority leader, in conjunction with the minority leader, the \nDemocratic leader, has to assess how best to proceed in the immediate \nfuture.\n  This, as the majority leader has said, is an important piece of \nlegislation. As Senator Lott said yesterday, this could be the most \nimportant piece of legislation we will handle this year. Whether that \nis right or not, I do not know, but I know it is a very important piece \nof legislation. I hope there is a way we can move forward on this bill.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I do stress the importance to leadership \non both sides of the aisle--we have been in constant communication--\nthat people have the opportunity to express themselves and to have that \nappropriate debate on the floor. Again, we were on the bill all last \nweek. Yes, we had some interruptions last week with extraneous \ncircumstances, but resilience came through and we had the opportunity \nwith the floor open, as it will be all this week.\n  At the end of the day, our obligation is to have that opportunity to \ndebate, have our ideas reflected, and then give people an opportunity \nto choose. That is, again, my goal over the course of the debate during \nthis 2-week period.\n  With that, I would like very much to finish the bill this week and \ngive each of our colleagues the opportunity to choose and reflect their \nopinions on this bill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S760-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S760]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S760]]\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we had a number of presentations made \nyesterday. There is a great deal of confusion as to what this bill is \nall about. I would like to go over a couple points.\n  First, I invite all Members with amendments to bring them to the \nfloor and discuss them. We are rapidly approaching the point where we \nare going to be considering amendments. I am very proud of the staff, \nDemocrats and Republicans, who staffed an office over the weekend to \nget information from Members who had amendments to offer.\n  For those who have not had a chance to become familiar with what we \nare doing, an injustice has been done to some of the members of the \nFinance Committee, particularly the chairman and the ranking member. \nThey have worked long and hard. They have come up with something that \nmeets the criteria originally put forward by the administration, such \nas not including a gas tax. It does not include going into the general \nfund. I do believe there are some areas where we have rectified \nproblems with treatments that had been taken previously to the highway \ntrust fund. Of course, I consider that something that should have been \ndone anyway.\n  We are now in position to consider the bill. It is going to be a huge \njobs bill. It is going to accomplish great work for the country.\n  A lot of people do not understand the formula aspect. One Member came \ndown yesterday and talked about how one State is doing better under the \nformula. There are a lot of considerations to the formula, \nconsiderations such as the total lane miles of interstate, the vehicle \nmiles traveled, the annual contributions to the highway trust fund \nattributed to commercial vehicles, the diesel fuel used on highways, \nrelative share of total cost of repair and replacement of deficient \nhighway bridges--I can identify with that, as in Oklahoma we have the \nworst bridges in the country--weighted nonattainment in maintenance \nareas, rate of return of donor States. That is one of the problems \npeople have failed to understand, that we are getting all donor States \nup to 95 percent.\n  To do this, there have to be some who have been actually in a better \nposition than they should have been by any formula because let's keep \nin mind that in TEA-21, 6 years ago, we had the minimum guarantee. The \nminimum guarantee was a political document. Let's look at who was in \ncharge at that time. We had quite a disproportionate number of leaders \nfrom the Northeast. We had Senator Moynihan, Congressman Shuster over \nin the House who was driving the boat, Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus \nfrom Montana. As a result, there are some States that got up to a \nlarger share than they would have achieved under any type of formula.\n  What they did was start with the same formula, using the factors I \njust outlined, and then, halfway through the process, went to the \nminimum guarantee. The minimum guarantee is the easy way out. All you \nhave to do is count up 60 people, give them what they want, and you \nhave 60 votes. That is not the right way to do it. We are doing it the \nright way.\n  I haven't seen anyone who really understands the formula, and \neverything that went into the last year we spent working on it, who is \nnot supportive. They may not like how their State fared. Their State \nmay have been in a position where they were getting more than they were \nentitled to for a period of time. That might be rectified by this. But \nwe have the best intentions of going ahead. I am quite sure, in the \nfinal analysis, we will have a bill that is far greater and better and \nmore equitable than ISTEA was--I was here during the ISTEA debate--and \nTEA-21 in 1998. I believe we have done a good job.\n\n  I refer again to the cooperation we have had on both sides of the \naisle. We have had an opportunity to work with the leadership, and \nSenators Jeffords and Reid have been great to work with. They have set \npartisanship aside. Historically, this has been a nonpartisan bill. It \nshould be that way. A lot of the actions of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee are nonpartisan. Certainly at the top of that list is \nthis bill. I don't think anyone would accuse us of being at all \npartisan in this legislation.\n  There are winners and losers--no question about that--when compared \nto TEA-21. But let's go back to see what happened in TEA-21 before we \nare critical of where we are today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nOklahoma has to be gone from the floor this morning. We have our \ncaucuses at 12:30. There are a number of people on our side who have \nrequested time for morning business. I am wondering if it would be \nappropriate, in that we are in kind of a procedural tangle anyway, that \nwe have time for debate only until the caucuses.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I propound that as a unanimous consent \nrequest, that we have debate only until after the conclusion of our \nconferences.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. What is the request?\n  Mr. REID. The request is that we remain on the bill, but for debate \nonly, until 12:30.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the EPW Committee has been working this \nbill for the past 2 years. Senators Inhofe, Bond, and Reid and I have \nbeen very involved in this process. From the beginning, we wanted to \naccomplish a few important national goals: First, improve roads and \nbridges; second, move freight; third, address congestion; and fourth, \nimprove safety.\n  Congestion is a growing concern all across America. Each day, \nAmericans spend more time in their cars as they pursue routine \nactivities, such as going to work, taking the kids to school, or \npicking up some groceries. As our Nation's population grows, travel \ndemands grow as well.\n  The number of miles traveled annually on our Nation's roads is \nincreasing at a substantial rate.\n  Many roads are at or approaching their physical capacity. In many \nareas of the country, it is both impractical and financially infeasible \nto add lanes to existing roadways.\n  However, we can increase capacity by actively managing the \ntransportation network.\n  Intelligent transportation systems provide State and local \ngovernments the data and tools necessary to undertake time saving \nactivities like incident management, ramp metering, traveler advisory \nsystems, and variable pricing.\n  Over the past 10 years, some areas of the country have begun to \nimplement these techniques, and they have realized numerous benefits.\n\n[[Page S761]]\n\n  Areas that employ transportation management techniques enjoy improved \ntravel times, more timely incident management, and improved \ncommunication with the traveling public.\n  Crafting this reauthorization bill, we recognized the importance of \nenhancing State and local governments' ability to manage their \ninfrastructure now and in the future.\n  S. 1072 expands Surface Transportation Program eligibility to ensure \nthat States may use Federal highway dollars to manage their network.\n  The bill shifts Intelligent Transportation Systems out of the \nresearch realm and into the mainstream program. States may use core \nhighway program dollars to fund ITS projects.\n  S. 1072 directs the Secretary to implement a nationwide real-time \ntravel data network. Additionally, States are directed to develop \nstatewide incident reporting systems.\n  Implementation of these systems will assist travelers and provide \nState and local transportation agencies the information they need to \nmanage our current infrastructure and to plan for future improvements.\n  Finally, S. 1072 provides resources to examine future management \ntechnologies. The research title of the bill includes provisions to \ndevelop the next generation of intelligent transportation systems and \nmanagement tools.\n  The research title also provides resources to train the engineers who \nwill design, build, and manage our future transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I think it is clear that S. 1072 addresses congestion \nin a proactive manner by providing policy changes and financial \nresources to promote the efficient use of our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  As I have said before, passage of this bill is critical. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this effort to provide much-needed resources to \nour States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        The Cost of Health Care\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use my leader time for the day. I \nwant to talk about health care today for a few minutes. Health \nexpenditures in this country are at the highest levels now that they \nhave been in our Nation's history. Not only are they at the highest \nlevels in our history, they exceed, by some magnitude, the health \nexpenditures in other countries.\n  The World Health Organization, in its most recent calculation of what \nwe spend, lists the United States at $4,500 in total expenditures per \ncapita; Canada, $2,058; United Kingdom, $1,774; Japan, $2,009; France, \n$2,335; and Sweden, $2,097. So we spend more than twice what other \ncountries are currently spending for health care.\n  One would hope that if we spent twice as much, we would get twice the \nresult. But just the opposite is true. We have the lowest life \nexpectancy of any of the countries I have listed. Our life expectancy \nis 77 years. That is over 4 years less than Japan. I would hope that at \nleast when it comes to infant mortality, we would get twice the result. \nBut, again, it is just the opposite. We have the highest rate of child \nmortality of any country I have mentioned--eight deaths per thousand. \nIn Sweden, it is three and a half per thousand. So one could only \nconclude from these numbers that we are not getting what we are paying \nfor; that we are not getting a bang for the buck.\n  We will not have the opportunity to address infant mortality, life \nexpectancy, and all of the other challenges we face in our health care \nsystem without making some fundamental changes in the system itself.\n  There are those who have argued it is now impossible for us to \nachieve universal insurance coverage. Some have even suggested that we \nwould go bankrupt if we were to do that. What I find ironic is that \nthese countries I have listed all have guaranteed health care. That has \nbeen the essence of their success, the secret to their success--this \nability to cover everybody and, in so doing, reduce child mortality, \nincrease life expectancy, and find ways in which to keep people healthy \nthroughout their lives.\n  So we are paying more and not only do we have unacceptable results--\nat least measured by child mortality and life expectancy--we also have \nunacceptable levels of health coverage. Mr. President, 43.6 million \nAmericans last year had no coverage. That is an increase of 2 million \npeople over the year before. About 75,000--12 percent--of the people in \nmy State have no health insurance. But statistics don't speak to the \nanguish that is felt by so many people in our country regarding an \nissue as personal as their health care.\n  Last summer, I spent a good deal of time on the road, dedicating \nvirtually the entire month of August to talking with people as to how \nthey feel about health care. The anguish, the stories of financial \nruin, the extraordinary dilemmas and life-threatening circumstances \nthat so many of these people face are still indelibly printed in my \nmind.\n\n  Yet there are those who say it is impossible to get everybody \ncovered; it is impossible to get to 100 percent. It may be impossible \nto get to 100 percent, but I am told virtually every country I have \nlisted--and I will list them again: Canada, Britain, Japan, France, and \nSweden--virtually every industrialized country has guaranteed coverage \ntoday, near 100-percent coverage.\n  The Bush administration's chief architect on health issues, Health \nand Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, was quoted that he does \nnot think that administratively or legislatively it is feasible to \ncover everyone. I find this a remarkable statement because we have \nalways prided ourselves as Americans on having a can-do spirit. We have \nalways said if we can go to the Moon, if we can set out challenges for \nour Nation, we will achieve them because of good leadership, and \nbecause of our values, and because of our attitude.\n  What does it say about our leadership, our values, and our attitude \nif we say we can't do what every other industrialized country has done? \nWhat does it say about our commitment? What does it say about this \nspirit of America about which we hear so much? We can't? Or we won't? I \ndon't think it is impossible to ensure coverage for all Americans. I \nthink it is imperative we do it.\n  The United States, as I have said, is the only industrialized country \nthat has not. In each of these countries, one does not need to be a \nbrain surgeon to see the connection between universal coverage and \nbetter life expectancy; universal coverage and higher rates of infant \nsurvivability, lower infant mortality. That is the key, that is the \nessence of our need, of our success, and of finding a way to do what we \nhave said from the very beginning: We will always attempt to do our \nvery best.\n  If we say we can't, if we think we can't, we are right. If we say we \ncan, if we think we can, we are right. It is up to us. It is a question \nof our leadership, our commitment, our willingness to excite and ignite \nan interest and a commitment and an enthusiasm about this issue as we \nhave done on so many other issues.\n  Last month, the Institute for Medicine called for universal health \ncoverage by 2010. They think we can do it.\n  Bob Dole, the former Republican leader, could have spoken for all of \nus when he said: The bottom line is, I think we have what it takes to \nget it done. I think we have what it takes.\n  I think we have what it takes as well, but we have to demonstrate \nwhat it takes is a commitment, not an ``I can't.'' What it takes is \nbipartisan support for a goal shared by millions of Americans today. \nLet's provide universal coverage. Let's begin to address this \nembarrassment for our country. Let's recognize if Britain, Canada, \nJapan, France, and Sweden can do it, so can we, and we can do it \nbetter. Let's accept the fact that $4,500 for every man, woman, and \nchild with less results in infant mortality and life expectancy than \nother countries is unacceptable in this country. We can, and we must. I \nhope it starts this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S762]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Jobs and the Annual Economic Report\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to comment about \nthe report that was just released yesterday, the White House Annual \nEconomic Report of the President, because I was stunned to see the \nstatements regarding the economic report to the country as it relates \nto jobs.\n  I invite any member of the group who put this report together or \nanyone from the administration to visit us in Michigan and see \nliterally every day now the headlines in the papers. It doesn't matter \nif you are in Detroit or Grand Rapids or in northern Michigan or \nsouthern Michigan; we have headlines about jobs that are leaving this \ncountry and going overseas, good-paying jobs, white-collar jobs, blue-\ncollar jobs, service jobs, and manufacturing jobs.\n  When we look at the report of economic advisers and we hear them \nsaying, ``President Bush's top economist yesterday said the outsourcing \nof U.S. service jobs to workers overseas is good for the Nation's \neconomy,'' I wonder what nation are they talking about. Whose economy \nare they talking about? It is certainly not good for our economy when \npeople are losing their jobs.\n  Let me go on to some of the other statements that are quoted in \ntoday's Washington Post:\n\n       Shipping jobs to low cost countries is the latest \n     manifestation of the gains from trade.\n\n  These were not the gains from trade I was hearing about. I was \nhearing that we were going to actually be creating more markets to \nproduce more goods and services that would be increasing jobs, not \nlosing jobs.\n  It says:\n\n       Just as U.S. consumers have enjoyed lower prices from \n     foreign manufacturers, so, too, should they benefit from \n     services being offered by overseas companies that have lower \n     labor costs.\n\n  It is stunning to me that we would not be concerned about the \noutsourcing of jobs, good-wage jobs to other countries. I commend any \nof my colleagues to watch, as I do nightly, Lou Dobbs on CNN with the \ncontinuing critique of what is happening to our country, including \nservice jobs.\n  I have friends and constituents in Michigan who have been in good-\npaying service jobs who are now unemployed and have lost their \ninsurance, many of them struggling to see whether they will lose their \nhomes as a result of having lost their job. They would not agree with \nthis report. What we are seeing is the assumption that somehow moving \nout of this country to lower cost labor countries, whether it is goods \nor services, is ultimately better for the United States. Now think \nabout this for a moment. They are embracing a race to the bottom that \nwill only eliminate middle-class America.\n\n  We had a recent situation occur in Greenville, MI, a small community \nof 9,000 people. There are 2,700 people who work at the local \nrefrigeration plant, manufacturing refrigerators, Electrolux. They \nadded a third shift. They have been productive. They make money. But \nthe company came in this fall and said even though they make money, \nthey make a profit in Greenville, MI, and people are productive, they \ncould make more money if they went to Mexico and paid $2.50 an hour \nwith no health benefits.\n  Well, I am sure that is true. I am sure any business could make more \nmoney if they paid $2.50 an hour with no health benefits. I am sure \nthey could make more money if they paid $1 an hour or 50 cents an hour \nwith no health benefits. My question to the management was: Who will be \nable to afford to buy your refrigerator? Who will be able to afford to \nbuy our automobiles? Who will be able to afford a middle-class standard \nof living in this country if this is only about a race to the bottom?\n  When we look at what is happening in our country today, not only in \nmanufacturing but in the service industry, we see a race to leave the \ncountry because instead of having trade policies that encourage a \nmiddle class in Mexico, in China, in India, and other places around the \nworld so they bring up their standard of living, so they can have good \nwages and buy our products, we see instead pressure on our businesses \nand our workers to lower our standard of living, to lower our costs, \nand there is a race to the bottom.\n  This race ultimately will cost us our way of life and our middle \nclass. But that is how we are different and strong. That is why we are \nthe greatest country in the world--because we have a strong middle \nclass.\n  I am extremely concerned when I see these kinds of statements. In \nfact, also quoted in this article from the Washington Post is a \nstatement by Franklin J. Fargo, vice president of International \nEconomic Affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers:\n\n       It is kind of a flip thing to say when people are losing \n     their jobs.\n\n  I would agree with that. It is more than flip; it is outrageous to \nsay we as a country somehow benefit by the outsourcing and the \nelimination of jobs.\n  In recent years, companies have shipped out software engineering \njobs, data entry, customer service, hospital jobs, as well as \nmanufacturing. We know when we pick up the phone--in fact, I picked up \nthe phone one time to talk to a credit card representative and asked \nwhere they were. They said: A facility near you. Well, I knew it was \nnot a facility near me in Michigan, where I was calling from, but it \nwas a facility overseas.\n  I think often of a friend of mine who goes to my church in Lansing, \nMI. He is a trained engineer, a very competent individual who has lost \nhis job. He told me he is now working for $19 an hour with no health \nbenefits, that he is now struggling with whether he will be able to \nkeep their home with kids in college. That is very real.\n  I urge those making statements that losing jobs to other countries is \na good idea to talk to somebody who has in fact lost their job and may \nlose their home, and may not be able to send their kids to college, may \nnot be able to buy that new car or keep the house, the cottage up \nnorth, be able to do those things that spend dollars in our economy, \nbuy that new refrigerator. How in the world have we gotten to a point \nwhere we do not understand the basic economics of people being able to \nhave a good wage so they can purchase goods and services and care for \ntheir families and be successful in this country? We know there are \nserious issues.\n\n  Looking at something else in this report, it says: Indeed, \noutsourcing health care jobs to lower wage countries could help control \nthe upward spiral of health care costs. When a good or service is \nproduced more cheaply abroad, it makes more sense to import it than to \nmake it here.\n  First, as someone who has worked on health care issues and helped to \nlead efforts to try to move us to lower health care costs, health care \nprices, the idea of saying the way we are going to lower health care \nprices is by losing jobs rather than tackling the big issues of \nlowering prescription drug prices, rather than allowing Medicare to \nnegotiate group discounts under the new Medicare bill, which we did not \ndo because the prescription drug company wants to be able to stop us \nfrom lowering prices--instead of addressing those things that will \nbring costs for businesses down, the suggestion is we should export \nhealth care jobs. So maybe if all of our nurses, doctors, and health \ncare workers were all in another country where they were making less, \nwe would be lowering our health care costs.\n  I find this report and the comments in it and the public comments in \nthe paper extraordinarily out of touch with what is happening to the \npeople of our country and what is good for our country.\n  I argue instead that in fact we do need to tackle health care costs. \nIt is a major issue for businesses, large and small. In a global \neconomy, it is a major issue for them to be able to compete. It is a \nmajor issue for our families and workers who are being asked to pay \nmore, take a pay cut, pay more in a premium or copays. We should tackle \nthat by addressing what is actually causing the health care costs to go \nup--the lack of competition, an explosion in prescription drug pricing. \nIf we want to lower prescription drug prices and lower health care \ncosts, rather than having the jobs go to Canada, let us open the border \nand bring the prescription drugs back from Canada at a cost of 50 \npercent less. We could do that tomorrow if the administration\n\n[[Page S763]]\n\nwould look at what is best for our families instead of what is best for \nthe pharmaceutical lobby.\n  We do not have to export jobs. We can import safe prescription drugs \nthat are actually made here, which we help to produce, that taxpayer \ndollars subsidize, that are then allowed to be sold in other countries \naround the world for half the price.\n  I agree, health care costs are a huge issue for our businesses, and \nwe need to tackle it in a way that brings down prices, that maintains \nour quality and does not say the way we are going to cut costs is to \nexport our jobs.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I also ask all of us to rethink what we are \ndoing on trade. We must trade in a global economy, obviously. But our \ntrade laws need to focus on incentives and on policies that will \nincrease the standard of living in other countries, not decrease ours.\n\n  I also would ask the administration to work with us on issues to \nlevel the playing field. We know China, Japan, and others manipulate \ntheir currency. What does that mean? It means it costs us more to sell \ninto China. Our businesses can pay up to a 40 percent tax, essentially, \nfor selling something into China because they want us to move the plant \nthere. It costs us more to sell to them. It costs them less to bring in \ngoods.\n  If the Treasury Secretary will simply certify that this is going on, \nwe have, then, the authority to begin to do something about it; we have \nlegislation that will give us an opportunity to do something about it. \nI am proud to be a cosponsor, with Senator Schumer, in that effort.\n  There are actions we can take to level the playing field. There is no \ndoubt in my mind that if we give American businesses and American \nworkers a fair shot, a level playing field, we will win every time. We \ncan compete when the rules are fair. But instead of addressing those \nthings, we have a report coming before us that says outsourcing of U.S. \njobs to overseas workers is good for our Nation's economy. With all due \nrespect, I think they should go back to the drawing board and try this \nagain.\n  I would just say one other thing. The Annual Economic Report \npredicted 2.6 million new payroll jobs by the end of the year. \nCertainly we would all greatly love to see that be the case. But last \nyear they reported 1.7 million jobs would be created and the year \nbefore they said 3 million jobs would be created. Instead, the Nation \nlost 53,000 payroll jobs last year, according to the Labor Department.\n  Instead of proposing, and suggesting, and proclaiming millions of new \njobs without the right policies to actually make it happen, I hope we \nwill place on our agendas the loss of jobs--manufacturing jobs, service \njobs, professional jobs--happening in this country, all across our \nNation, and certainly in my State of Michigan, where we have paid \ndearly for policies that have not worked. I hope we make this our top \npriority and that we focus on those things that will stop the exodus \nfrom the United States and the exporting of American jobs around the \nworld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from \nMichigan as she was commenting about this report about how sending jobs \nout of the United States is going to help with the cost of health care \nhere in the United States, that is as ridiculous as the old medical \npractice, 200 years ago, of curing the patient of his disease by \nbleeding him.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. What we need to do about the cost of health \ncare is get to the cost of health care. The cost of health care is \ngoing up. Technology has brought us miraculous new medicines and \nprocedures. All of that is going up. But where do you have an \nopportunity to bring down the cost of health care? You do it by having \nbest business practices that allow you to have the economies of scale, \nergo health insurance, the largest possible pool of people. You use the \nprinciple of insurance to work for you, which is take the health risk \nand spread it over the largest possible group so you bring down the per \nunit cost.\n  But we are not approaching it that way. We divide up the population \nin these little narrow categories and then, when that category gets \nsick and it gets older, what happens to the costs of that health care? \nIt goes up to the point they cannot afford it.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Or what about what we did in the Medicare bill \nhere, the prescription drug bill, for which the Senator from Michigan \nand the Senator from Florida certainly didn't vote.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. What it was billed as was a $400 billion bill \nfor prescription drugs. We now find it is $525 billion over 10 years. \nAnd where did it go mostly? As a bailout to the pharmaceutical \ncompanies and as a bailout to the insurance companies.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is right.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Not in a way of providing a direct benefit. \nWhen the senior citizens in the State of Florida find out how meager \nthis benefit is, when it kicks in in 2005, I predict senior citizens \nare going to be somewhat upset.\n  I thank the Senator from Michigan for her comments.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might ask a question of my friend from Florida, as \na former insurance commissioner, he certainly understands the insurance \nside of this. I think, first of all, he is absolutely right. I think \nthe two major drivers for health care now are the explosion of \nprescription drug prices and the fact that every time a person loses \nhis or her insurance and that person walks into an emergency room to \nget care and is sicker than they otherwise would be, and so on, people \nwith insurance end up seeing their rates go up because there is a \nsmaller and smaller group of people who actually have insurance, and \nthey pay more and more. Wouldn't that be the philosophy?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is correct. There are 40 million people \nin this country who do not have health insurance. But they get health \ncare. They often get it, as the Senator suggests, at the time of the \nemergency. Where do they get it? They get it in the most expensive \nplace, the emergency room. Instead of treating the sniffles, they wait \nuntil it becomes pneumonia, so the care becomes so much greater.\n  So you have to get that much larger a group and ensure that larger \ngroup. Do it in the private sector. That is the way it ought to be \ndone. Let there be competition to get your most efficient health \ninsurance product, and then give the consumers, also, a choice of plan. \nSo if they want a Cadillac plan, they can take that. If they want a \nChevrolet plan, they can take that.\n  But mix all of those elements into it. That is how we are going to \nget health insurance and health reform. But we are not going to until \nwe get to such a crisis because there are so many players who have so \nmuch at stake and there is so much money to be made.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I might ask my friend another question, wouldn't he \nshare my amazement that, in this new economic report, the proposal is \nthat the way we lower health care costs is to export the jobs? Export \nthe nurses, export the doctors, radiological assistants, whoever it \nis--that is how we should bring down health care costs? Lose our jobs \nto other countries? Does that make sense?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. That is exactly the opposite of what ought to \nbe done. What was that report the Senator cited again?\n  Ms. STABENOW. This report actually is the new report from the \neconomic advisers to the President on the state of the economy and \njobs, where they are saying outsourcing to other countries is, in fact, \na good thing and, in fact, outsourcing health care jobs will actually \nbring health care costs down.\n  I was stunned at what I was reading. Certainly, it is not something I \nknow the people in Michigan are going to be very happy to hear about.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. What has happened to our world today? It is \nalmost, if one person says it is white, another person says it is \nblack; if a person says it is up, another person says it is down. Where \nis common sense? Where is reconciliation? Where is consensus building? \nWhere is bipartisanship?\n  Take another issue. As I continue to have this dialog with the \nSenator from Michigan, take another issue, take the issue of the so-\ncalled independent commission that has just been appointed to\n\n[[Page S764]]\n\nfind out what went wrong with intelligence. How can a commission be \nindependent when it is just appointed by one authority, i.e., the \nPresident, who is going to be part of the subject of the investigation \nof the commission? That is not independence. What we need is a \ncommission that is truly independent, that is appointed by the Congress \nand the President.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Both parties. That is not a commentary on the \npeople on the commission because these people seem to be--several of \nthem are personal friends of mine--enormously accomplished people. It \nis the question of setting up the commission.\n  If I have been informed correctly, it is hard for my ears to believe \nwhat I have heard, which is that in setting up this commission to \nexamine the intelligence that was faulty in Iraq, they are not giving \nthis commission subpoena power.\n  Then how are they going to get the documents? How are they going to \ncompel the witnesses? Is it all going to be voluntary? Our very \nexistence is on the line in order to have adequate, timely, and \naccurate intelligence to protect ourselves in this era of terrorism in \nwhich we find ourselves.\n  Where is common sense in this country?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I am happy to yield to the distinguished \nranking member of this committee, as we consider this transportation \nbill, even though we are talking about other very timely topics.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Is my understanding correct that the Senator said there \nwill be no authority to be able to get documents or be able to subpoena \ninformation?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. This is what I was informed this morning by \nthe leadership of this, that this commission is not going to have the \nability to subpoena. If that commission that has just been announced \nover the weekend doesn't have the ability to subpoena people--witnesses \nand documents--then how can we get at the truth?\n  What we want to do is get at the truth. We were told there were \nweapons of mass destruction and we were told there were unmanned aerial \nvehicles, pilotless drones, and we were told there was even a potential \nplan to put those drones on ships off the Atlantic coast to drop those \nchemical and biological weapons over eastern seaboard American cities, \nand all of that turned out not to be true.\n  We were told that was the gospel truth when, in fact, as the \nWashington Post reported a week ago, there was a huge dispute in the \nintelligence community, including Air Force intelligence which knows \nbest about unmanned aerial vehicles, and, as reported by the Post, that \nthose UAVs did not exist to drop biological and chemical weapons.\n  So why were we not told that there was a dispute in the intelligence \ncommunity? It was presented to us before we voted on that resolution in \nOctober of 2002 as if it were the gospel truth.\n  The long and short of it is the whole point of a commission is to get \nto the truth so we don't make these mistakes in the future. If the \ncommission--a so-called independent commission--is not given the power \nto subpoena, how in the world are you going to get to the truth?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Being one of those who never believed there was a \nthreat of any kind and a sufficient level to warrant the war, it shocks \nme to find out the route being set up to verify what I believed to be \nthe truth will have no power to find the truth. This is very disturbing \nfor me.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The distinguished 9/11 commission composed of \nwell-respected and very accomplished people, headed by former Governor \nof New Jersey Kean and so many other distinguished citizens on that \npanel questioning the intelligence and trying to find out what went \nwrong on the September 11 attack, has been frustrated over and over \nagain by delays and a lack of willingness to come forth with the \ninformation. If they have had that experience in the last year and a \nhalf, why are we to think this next so-called independent commission is \ngoing to have any different experience? I think, since what is at stake \nis the security of our homeland, raw election year politics is getting \nin the way much to the frustration of those members of the panel and \ncertainly to the frustration of this Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Florida for enlightening me on \nthis very disturbing news. I will do whatever I can, working with him \nand with others, to make sure we get the kind of resolution for finding \nthe information which should be ours to be able to make judgments. I \nthank the Senator very much for his statement.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Intelligence Community Assessments\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the controversy \nsurrounding the intelligence community's assessments of Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction programs and capabilities in the months leading up \nto the military action in Iraq.\n  It has been suggested that the intelligence community failed \npolicymakers by presenting a picture of Iraq's WMD capacities that \nappears to have been far more advanced than the reality on the ground. \nIt has been suggested that, as we have all heard, certain pieces of \ninformation were presented as certainties when, in reality, the \naccuracy of the information was very much in dispute among experts \nwithin the intelligence community.\n  I made a concerted effort to go to every briefing that was offered, \nand I think I largely succeeded, or maybe had entirely succeeded. I \nwent to briefings for all Members, and I also went, of course, to the \nspecial briefings that were held for members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I am not a member of the Intelligence Committee and perhaps \nthat committee had access to information dramatically different from \nwhat was put before the rest of us.\n  What I recall is that the CIA representatives who briefed us were \ncareful and their statements were qualified. As CIA Director George \nTenet recently indicated, it was made clear disagreements existed about \nhow to interpret some pieces of information.\n  What I remember about the CIA is that they played it straight. I wish \nI could say the same about the political rhetoric that some in the \nadministration used to characterize the content of those briefings.\n  Of course, I am certainly not saying the CIA is perfect or that the \nU.S. intelligence community is perfect. No one who reviewed the joint \nIntelligence Committee's report on 9/11 would make such a claim. And I \nam not asserting that all of the CIA's information and analysis \npresented in the lead-up to the Iraq war was correct. But what I am \nsaying is, in the many briefings I attended I simply saw no evidence--\nno evidence--to support the accusations that the CIA was trying to spin \nthe facts or that they were trying to lead us in one direction or \nanother.\n  My sense was that they were professionals, and I remember being very \ngrateful for their thorough and candid presentations. In fact, in those \nbriefings, they didn't give us easy answers, and that made our \ndecisions tougher. But the people expect us to make tough decisions.\n  Time and again, I came away from the briefing room concerned about \nthe unanswered questions related to Iraq's chemical and biological \nweapons capacities. But I also came away each time with the conclusion \nthat we had no evidence of any imminent threat. Indeed, Director Tenet \nacknowledged that the CIA never characterized Iraq's WMD programs as an \nimminent threat when Mr. Tenet made his remarks last week.\n  When the President of the United States called Iraq ``a threat of \nunique urgency,'' that sure sounded a lot like imminent to many ears. \nWhen senior officials, speaking about Iraq, told us they did not want \nthe smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud, that sure sounded like an \nimminent threat of nuclear attack to most Americans.\n  Yet just last week, CIA Director Tenet reminded the country the \nagency made two judgments that are too often overlooked today. They \nsaid:\n\n\n[[Page S765]]\n\n\n       Saddam did not have a nuclear weapon and probably would \n     have been unable to make one until 2007 to 2009.\n\n  Of course, that is a serious issue certainly but not an imminent \nthreat.\n  The fact that the briefings we received did not present a picture of \nan imminent threat certainly did not mean there was no cause for \nconcern or that the right course of action would have been to do \nnothing. Those who claim the only choices before us were rushing to war \nor being utterly complacent are quite simply misleading the American \npeople.\n  I had long supported regime change in Iraq, and I am pleased that \nSaddam Hussein's regime has fallen. But the facts did not suggest that \nwe had to invade Iraq in March of 2003. That means we could have had \nmore time to build a solid international coalition, to combat some of \nthe most damaging misperceptions of American motives and intentions, \nand more time to put in place a plan of action that would address our \nsecurity interests without leaving American troops and American \ntaxpayers holding the bag at the end of the day, bogged down in a risky \noccupation and mortgaging our children's future to pay for it.\n  Director Tenet said last week: To understand a difficult topic like \nIraq takes patience and care. He is right. The same is true of \nunderstanding this debate and this controversy. That is why it is so \nimportant to discuss these issues carefully and responsibly. It is \nimportant because the stakes are so very high and because the public, \nespecially our men and women in uniform and their families, who take \ntremendous risks and make tremendous sacrifices to serve this country, \nhas every right to know what happened, what the facts were, what we got \nright and what we got wrong.\n  One of the difficulties for those of us who attend classified \nbriefings, of course, is that we have an obligation to protect the \ncontent of those briefings. So we are limited in what we can say \npublicly. We are left to generalize and we run the risk of \ncharacterizing the same briefings in very different ways, leading us to \ndebates about one person's interpretation versus another's. For this \nreason, an independent commission is desperately needed.\n  I am glad the President has agreed to establish a commission to \nexamine our prewar intelligence. But I am concerned about the specifics \nof the commission's mandate. It is charged with examining the \nintelligence community's capacity to collect, process, analyze, \nproduce, and disseminate information concerning the capabilities, \nintentions, and activities of foreign powers relating to the design, \ndevelopment, manufacture and acquisition, possession, proliferation, \ntransfer, testing, potential or threatened use or use of WMD, related \nmeans of delivery, and other related threats of the 21st century. All \nof this, of course, is useful.\n  In the wake of the horror of September 11, 2001, we must make every \neffort to ensure that America's intelligence services are as reliable \nand effective and accountable as they possibly can be. As I have \nindicated, I believe a large part of our problem in the runup to the \nwar in Iraq was a problem of how intelligence was used, how it was \ninvoked, sometimes out of context, and how in some cases it was used in \npowerful and often frightening rhetoric aimed at painting a much more \nconclusive picture than the actual intelligence revealed.\n  Intelligence, as all data, can be manipulated. I am concerned about \nthe appearance of a concerted effort to interpret information to \njustify a seemingly predetermined course of action and to too easily \ndisregard information that could not be used for this purpose. I think \nsuch an approach serves no one. I think it actually diminishes American \npower. I think it risks making this country far less secure.\n  So we must investigate matters such as the activities of the Office \nof Special Plans at the Pentagon, which seems to have been charged with \nsifting through information to assemble only those pieces that \nbolstered the case for going to war.\n  We must also address the way that intelligence was alluded to in \npublic settings, in ways that painted a much more decisive picture than \nactually existed. Obviously, not all Americans could be in the briefing \nroom, but all Americans hear the public debate.\n  Those of us who receive and act on classified briefings have a \nvitally important responsibility to ensure that we never abuse their \ntrust. I believe we need to make sure that in our efforts to review \nintelligence-gathering capacities and analysis capacities we do not \nfail to take a hard look at how policymakers employ intelligence in \npublic remarks. Our words and our characterizations matter. The context \nthat it is or is not provided matters. Even now some would insist that \nIraq was a threat to America because even if Saddam Hussein did not \nhave WMD, he had the capacity to make a weapon. But chemical or \nbiological weapons could be produced in dual-use facilities in almost \nevery country that has any significant domestic, pharmaceutical, or \nchemical manufacturing capacity.\n\n  This is a serious issue to be sure, but it does not make the case for \nthe threat of unique urgency a good case. It does not make for a threat \nof unique urgency directed at the American people.\n  Finally, I propose that we need to take a look at how people \nresponded and prepared for things we were warned about in briefings \nabout Iraq, some of which then became public knowledge. Given what we \nall heard in the briefing room about the possibility that Iraq \ncontinued to possess biological and chemical weapons stockpiles and \ngiven the administration's clear belief that such stockpiles existed, \nwhy was there no better policy planning and execution when it came to \nrounding up these things?\n  Former chief weapons inspector David Kay has suggested that we may \njust all have to live with, as he called it, an unresolved ambiguity \nabout what happened, that he traces to the failure on April 9 to \nestablish immediate physical security in Iraq.\n  The looting that ensued has introduced a host of alarming unknowns \ninto our consideration of what might have happened to the materiel that \nmay or may not have existed in the first place and, quite frankly, any \nassertion that the United States would not have anticipated this \nlooting has no credibility whatsoever. From think tanks to military \nplanners to nongovernmental organizations, there were multiple, \nconsistent, and high-level warnings about the risks of chaos and \nlooting in the wake of the regime's fall.\n  There were plenty of questions about this issue which were never \nsatisfactorily answered in the lead-up to war. In fact, I spent over 6 \nmonths, primarily in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, repeatedly \nasking whatever administration witness I could the same important \nquestions. For example, I remember asking Secretary Powell in 2002: Are \nyou aware of any significant planning for securing weapons of mass \ndestruction sites in Iraq in the event of a military invasion if the \nGovernment would be toppled and some degree of chaos were to rein for \nsome period? Is there not a very real risk that WMD and the means to \nmake them will be taken out of the country or sold off to exactly the \nkind of nonstate actors that the United States is worried about? Do we \nknow enough about where WMD sites are to be confident in our ability to \nsecure them, I asked the Secretary of State?\n  Secretary Powell could provide no details. He simply assured me that \nour military planners were making this issue their highest priority. \nThose military planners never provided any details, either.\n  In the end, we are left with video footage of the unchecked looting \nof the country, with unanswered questions, with David Kay's unresolved \nambiguity. So we have a case of inadequate follow-up on a vitally \nimportant issue presented to us by the intelligence community and that, \ntoo, is something we need to review and address in the interest \nof national security.\n\n  We have a lot of work to do. Some of that certainly does involve \nreforms of the intelligence community. I believe our biggest problems \ndid not come in the briefing room. In the interest of our national \nsecurity, in the interest of protecting the public's trust in \nGovernment, in the interest of this country's global prestige and power \nto persuade, we have to avoid scapegoating tactics. We have to face \nsome hard truths about the process and the rhetoric that led this \ncountry into Iraq in March 2003.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n[[Page S766]]\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I came to the Chamber to speak about the \nhighway bill, and obviously we hope to be talking about that later on \ntoday, but having taken the responsibility of serving on the \nIntelligence Committee, I thought I might add a few comments to the \ndiscussions begun by my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  Let's be clear; the Senate Intelligence Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis has launched a massive effort to determine whether our \nintelligence was accurate, where it had holes in it, where are our \nassessments and our estimates.\n  In intelligence, they are all estimates. The only time there is \nabsolute confirmation that something has happened is when the World \nTrade Center comes down or when the Pentagon is hit. Then one knows \nthat terrorists have planned something and have executed it.\n  We were dealing with an intelligence system that provided estimates \nthroughout the 1990s and no action was taken. The intelligence service \nprovided estimates about the danger of Osama bin Laden. We considered \nall kinds of actions, and then September 11 happens.\n  Now, the September 11 commission goes in to try to determine why we \ndid not act on the intelligence we had. The big charge there is that \nsomething should have been done about Osama bin Laden. Well, there are \nnow published reports on the intelligence, and I would refer my \ncolleagues to Richard Miniter's book ``Losing bin Laden.'' There were \nmany instances where it was clear that Osama bin Laden was planning to \nattack the United States. In several instances, it appeared that in the \n1990s we might have had an opportunity to deal with Osama bin Laden in \none way or another and we chose not to do it. So right after September \n11 we are looking backwards and saying, Why did we not act? Now my \ncolleagues, primarily on the other side of the aisle, are saying, Why \ndid we act in Iraq?\n\n  Let's be perfectly clear. When people start talking about imminent \nthreat, seeming to imply that the President said there was an imminent \nthreat, I distinctly remember the State of the Union message in which \nthe President said: We cannot wait until there is an imminent threat. \nIn essence, he was saying we cannot wait until we see the second \nairplane heading for the second tower of the World Trade Center.\n  Why were we suspicious of Saddam Hussein? The same reason President \nClinton, Secretary Albright, Secretary Cohen, Security Council Chief \nSandy Berger had? They said Saddam Hussein was a real and great threat. \nHe was in flagrant violation of all the U.N. resolutions which followed \non the cease-fire in the first gulf war.\n  He kicked the inspectors out in 1998. We know he was the only despot \nalive, the only tyrant ruling a country, who used weapons of mass \ndestruction, and he kicked the inspectors out without ever saying what \nhe had done with them.\n  Sure, there will be things we can find out about what we should have \ndone differently in intelligence. There has already been public \ndiscussion about the lack of human intelligence resources. We may find \nthat. We may find other things when we complete our work in the \nIntelligence Committee and submit a report to be fully declassified and \ndiscussed.\n  We need to make our intelligence system better. I think we have gone \na long way. The PATRIOT Act broke down the walls between the CIA and \nthe FBI, which legislatively prohibited them sharing information. That \nwas a mistake. We have changed that.\n  Some of my colleagues say we ought to look at the use, look at what \npeople said about that. You don't need to have a commission to do that. \nYou have a Lexis-Nexis search to find out what people said. Are some \npeople making charges? Yes, everybody has a right to make their \ncomments about whether they believed the intelligence. A lot of that \nintelligence has been laid out in the public.\n  I was astounded at the degree to which Secretary Powell's discussion \nbefore the United Nations in February of 2003 went into so much of the \nintelligence we had at the time. That was out on the table. That was \nthe best intelligence Secretary Powell had. Published reports indicate \nhe went through that intelligence himself and asked questions and only \nused those things about which he was personally satisfied the \nintelligence estimates were accurate.\n  So, yes, use--we did use it. We did act. Saddam Hussein is no longer \nruling a country, murdering hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of \npeople. We pulled him out of a spider hole. He said he was a great \nruler of the Iraqi people. He wanted to negotiate. Well, he is in jail.\n  You know something, Muammar Qadhafi in Libya took a look at what \nhappened to Saddam Hussein and said: ``Oh, I don't think I want to wind \nup like Saddam Hussein did.'' That is what he told Italian President \nBerlesconi. ``I don't want to see happen to me what happened to Saddam \nHussein.'' So he is coming clean based on the information we had \ngathered about his weaponry, his participation with Dr. Kahn of \nPakistan. We knew he had weapons and was working on a weapons program \nand he came clean. I think that makes a great deal of sense.\n\n  There has been a tremendous change in the Middle East. There has been \na change because Saddam Hussein no longer rules. It is a tragedy when \nwe lose American lives. It is a tragedy when Iraqi lives are lost. But \nthe Iraqis are slowly but steadily taking back control of their \ncountry.\n  Let's talk about what David Kay found. David Kay said when all the \nfacts are known, it will appear, I believe, that Saddam Hussein was a \nfar greater danger than our intelligence even knew. Our intelligence \nwas not adequate before the first gulf war. We didn't know how far \nalong he was at that time with his nuclear program. We did not know, \napparently, according to Dr. Kay, how far along he was with his long-\nrange missile program. It was a country, Dr. Kay said, which was \nattracting terrorists like ants to honey, to come to a country busily \nengaged in pursuing means of getting at the infidels. That means \nanybody who doesn't agree with them.\n  It is clear Ansar al-Islam had a ricin factory manufacturing that \npotent chemical, attempting to weaponize it, in northeast Iraq. It was \nunder the direction of al Zarqawi. Ansar al-Islam is part of the \nbrotherhood with al-Qaida.\n  By the way, you probably read in the New York Times about what we \nlearned about the memo, from al Zarqawi. He was totally frustrated \nbecause he thinks the infidel, i.e., the coalition, our coalition, \nseems to be winning. We are making progress. We are turning Iraq back \nto the Iraqis and we have not cut and run. Their effort to conduct \njihad is getting more and more difficult as we get more and more Iraqis \nengaged as police, as soldiers.\n  Danger still exists, but the danger that Saddam Hussein or the \nterrorist groups operating out of Iraq will be able to do so with \nimpunity and continue to pursue their weapons of mass destruction \nprograms is much less now that Saddam Hussein is in captivity.\n  You can talk about what the President said, what the President did, \nbut I believe what we are seeing in the Middle East, what we have heard \npublicly from Dr. Kay, indicates we have taken a major step toward \nlessening the likelihood of terrorist attacks on the United States and \ntoward stabilizing the Middle East so it will no longer be a hotbed and \na haven for terrorists.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis remarks. Perhaps they were intended as response to my remarks or \nperhaps they were general remarks, but my remarks have to do with the \nfact there is a perception in this country that somehow the briefings \nthe CIA gave us with regard to Iraq were distorted or inappropriate or \noversold the case for the war.\n  My purpose here was to indicate that is not the way I saw it. I was \nin those briefings. As I have indicated, I felt the CIA was very \nmeasured and careful in its presentation.\n  The Senator from Missouri can talk as much as he wants about whether \nIraq worked or not, and what the consequences are. But there are real \nconsequences when Members of both parties decide to tell the public the \nmisinformation or the problems were the fault of the CIA.\n  I think that is dangerous for the CIA. I think it is dangerous for \nour country.\n\n[[Page S767]]\n\nI think it is dangerous for how we are perceived in the world.\n  Some of the members of the other party--including the administration, \nfrankly--and some of the members of my own party are pointing their \nfingers at what we heard in the briefings. I want everyone to know that \nI went to the briefings. I did not hear a compelling case for the war \nto be conducted at that time.\n  Regardless of what has happened since, I would be happy to debate at \nany point whether it was the right thing to do and whether how we did \nit was the right thing to do. Regardless of all that, the point is, as \none Senator who went to those briefings and did not hear the case made, \nI give the CIA credit for being measured and careful. And we should \nthank Mr. Tenet for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a truly bad idea \nthat has been proposed on this floor. I believe an amendment was \ndiscussed yesterday when I was not here--I didn't have an opportunity \nto hear it--to provide stiff sanctions on States which do not have \nprimary seatbelt laws. The goal is to move every State up to 90 percent \nseatbelt use. It specifically says States would be sanctioned if they \ndid not meet one of the following two conditions within 3 years of the \nenactment of this bill: Either have a primary seatbelt law which would \nallow law enforcement to pull over a driver if that officer sees the \ndriver is not wearing a seatbelt without having to arrest them for any \nother infraction, or the State does not get up to a 90 percent seatbelt \nuse rate.\n  In other words, it would require a State to achieve a 90 percent \nseatbelt use, and it left it up to the individual States on how to get \nthere.\n  The objective of getting to 90 percent seatbelt use is a worthwhile \none. As Governor of Missouri, I talked often about the need for \nseatbelts.\n  When I was young, the primary entertainment when we weren't listening \nto Cardinal baseball was to crawl under the fence and go out and watch \nthe stock car races. I watched stock car races every Friday night. \nSometimes I paid to get in but not often. There were horrendous wrecks \nevery night. Yet the drivers wore harnesses and seatbelts. I saw one \ndriver taken off. He had severe alcohol poisoning because of fuel he \nhad taken internally. But I never saw anybody hurt.\n  I have been in two serious crashes in my life. Both times I had on a \nseatbelt. I was shaken up and scared. In the first one, the other \ndriver was taken to the hospital unconscious. I did not find out until \nthe next day whether he had survived.\n  I am a believer in seatbelt use. I have sponsored and pushed for \nseatbelts and for safety seats for infants. I tried to get them on \nairplanes. But I don't believe taking money away from the 36 States \nthat don't have primary seatbelt laws is a way to get there.\n  If the State fails to meet either of the conditions--either the 90-\npercent seatbelt use rate or enactment of a primary seatbelt law--the \nState would lose 2 percent of its general highway safety funds, and the \nsanction increases to 4 percent for each successive year. The sanctions \napproach would decrease the amount of funding available to make the \nnecessary investment in safety for their transportation system.\n  States that do not enact a primary seatbelt law or do not achieve a \n90-percent use rate will get less funding and fall behind other States \nin safety. That is not the way to encourage States to increase safety. \nThat is a way to make some States fall further behind.\n  I know more lives can be saved with seatbelts. Good friends of mine \nwho are troopers have said they have never unbuckled a dead driver from \na seatbelt, although they have taken a lot of dead people out of cars \nin car accidents. I do not believe, however, the Federal Government \nshould sanction States, trying to get people to use seatbelts. The \nFederal Government would force enactment of primary seatbelt laws. This \napproach is essentially Federal blackmail by Congress. It is telling \nthe States we are not going to return the money you pay into the \nFederal highway trust fund because some of us in Washington, DC, think \nyour State legislature and your Governor need to enact this law. Well, \nthat is the purpose of the folks we elect at the State level to \nrepresent us in our general assemblies and to represent us in our \nGovernors' offices.\n  I held the office of Governor at one point. I spent an awful lot of \ntime looking at federally imposed mandates, many of which did not make \nany sense. They told us, for example, we had to use our clean water \nfunds to clean up water from our major cities going back into the \nMissouri and Mississippi Rivers, putting in water that was higher \nquality than was already in the river. We wanted to use it on the \npristine Ozark streams where small communities and septic tanks were \nseriously downgrading streams which had been fishable, swimmable, and \ndrinkable. The priority did not make sense for Missouri.\n  I came up here to try to work with the States, not to tell States \nthat we are not going to send back money you send to Washington unless \nyou adopt our idea.\n  Only 20 States have decided to enact a primary seatbelt law. Other \nStates have decided a primary seatbelt law is not the way to increase \nseatbelt usage.\n  Missouri has made great strides in seatbelt use, and this has been \ndone without a primary seatbelt law. As you can see on this chart, the \nStates which have primary seatbelt laws have the bold numbers. You \nstart out with Alabama, California, Connecticut, the District of \nColumbia--everybody in the District of Columbia knows you get pulled \nover if you are not wearing a seatbelt--Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, \nLouisiana, Maryland, and Michigan, to name the lefthand side.\n  You can see what progress they have made. Alabama has a primary \nseatbelt law. In 2002, they had 79 percent usage, and it fell back to \n77 percent in 2003. They went down. Other States are nowhere near that. \nVirginia, for example, has no primary seatbelt law, apparently, \naccording to this chart. In 2003 it only had 75 percent seatbelt usage. \nThe good news is, reduction in non-use, from 30 percent to 25 percent, \nwas a 17-percent reduction.\n  The State of Missouri has gone from 31-percent non-use to 27-percent \nnon-use without the seatbelt law. Why should this body say we are going \nto take money away from the State of Missouri because we don't like the \nway you are reducing non-usage of seatbelts?\n  I think public statements--and I certainly have made them, and will \ncontinue to make them--educational campaigns and incentives are the way \nto go to improve usage.\n  When you look at this chart, you see a lot of States with seatbelt \nusage that is definitely below 90 percent. For most of them, the usage \nis 70 and 80 percent. We are making progress. We ought to continue to \ndo that with incentives. If you give States incentives, they have the \nflexibility to use their own solutions to increase seatbelt use. That \nflexibility would be lost. States would be limited in their ability to \neducate the public with regard to the importance of highway safety. \nThey would lose safety money. That makes no sense.\n  The enforcement of primary seatbelt laws costs the State a lot of \nmoney, from increased law enforcement personnel, hours of work for \nclerical representation, and prosecutions. Is that the best way to use \ntheir law enforcement people? I think that is something that is better \nleft to the authorities in the individual States.\n  We have to stop this sanctions approach and, I believe, use \nincentives. Under title I, under the Commerce Committee report, NHTSA \nwould be authorized to use over $3.5 billion in grant funding and \napproximately $800 million for vehicle safety-related rules. The NHTSA \nprograms would pay strong attention to driver safety and seatbelt use.\n  Under the National Highway Safety Program, section 104 grants would \nbe administered by NHTSA in three high-visibility areas of safety: to \nreduce alcohol-impaired driving, drug-impaired driving, and increase \nseatbelt usage. I\n\n[[Page S768]]\n\nbelieve that is the appropriate way to go.\n  The amendment that was described yesterday represents a double \npenalty for States that do not enact primary seatbelt laws. In fiscal \nyear 2005 and thereafter, 10 percent of section 148 funds--those are \nfunds for highway safety improvement--would be transferred to the \nsection 402 program unless the State has a primary safety belt law or \nhas achieved at least a 90-percent safety belt use rate.\n  Beginning in 2007, 2 percent of the interstate maintenance, surface \ntransportation, and bridge programs would be withheld from States that \ndo not have a primary seatbelt law or a 90-percent usage rate. The \npercentage withheld would rise to 4 percent in fiscal year 2008 and \nthereafter. If Congress enacts these sanctions, we are not likely to \nauthorize incentives. The States have used section 157 safety belt \nincentive grant funding to support national safety belt mobilization \nand other safety belt enforcement activities. Without the incentives, \nthe States would have drastically reduced resources for those purposes.\n  I believe enactment of a primary safety belt penalty mandate, forced \nupon the States, is premature and unwarranted. There has never been a \nsufficient program to convince the States to enact primary seatbelt \nlaws or to find other means of increasing usage and decreasing nonusage \nof seatbelts.\n  Under the Senate Commerce bill, the new safety belt incentive grant \nprogram would provide the States with a grant of five times their \napportionment if they enact a primary seatbelt law. We need to see if \nthis program works and see if it is effective.\n\n  Many Governors and State legislatures oppose penalties and sanctions. \nThere are currently 18 penalties and sanctions, 7 of which are highway \nsafety related. Increasingly, Congress has relied on punishing the \nStates if they do not meet safety performance objectives. As a result, \nI think there is an understandable revolt and reaction growing to this \napproach. The ``Mother May I'' coming to Washington is bad enough, but \nwhen ``Mama Federal Government'' tells us: ``You have to do it this way \nor you don't get your supper,'' particularly when your voters, your \nconstituents, your taxpayers have been the ones who have paid for that \nsupper, that is, I think, a real problem. Typically, State legislatures \nbeing forced to do this are going to rebel, and I think it is very \ninappropriate.\n  We have a letter from the executive director of the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials; the \nexecutive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association; the \npresident and chief executive officer of the American Highway Users \nAlliance; the executive director of the International Association of \nChiefs of Police; the executive director of the Commercial Vehicle \nSafety Alliance; the chief executive officer of the Associated General \nContractors of America; the executive director of the American Traffic \nSafety Services Association; the executive director of the National \nConference of State Legislatures; the executive director of the \nAmerican Road & Transportation Builders Association; the president of \nthe American Council of Engineering Companies; the vice president of \nPublic Affairs of AAA, and the executive director of the National \nGovernors Association, all saying:\n\n     . . . we oppose the use of penalties and sanctions.\n       Our organization supports the underlying safety goals. We \n     believe the use of sanctions and penalties reflect an all-or-\n     nothing approach that forces absolute and unconditional \n     compliance with Federal safety requirements or goals while \n     stifling innovation and redirecting funds from highway \n     construction and maintenance projects with tangible safety \n     benefits.\n\n  That makes the case very well.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print this letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 30, 2004.\n     Hon. Senator Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The organization listed below represent \n     a broad array of national, state and local elected leaders, \n     policymakers and transportation and highway safety interests. \n     Our organizations oppose the use of sanctions and penalties. \n     We believe the use of sanctions and penalties reflect an all-\n     or-nothing approach that forces absolute and unconditional \n     compliance with federal safety requirements or goals while \n     stifling innovation and redirecting funds from highway \n     construction and maintenance projects with tangible safety \n     benefits.\n       Currently states face eight highway safety-related \n     sanctions and penalties that are designed to force compliance \n     with various federal highway safety mandates or goals \n     including enactment, by specified deadlines, of various types \n     of state safety legislation. While our organizations support \n     the underlying safety goals, we oppose the use of penalties \n     and sanctions. In fact, many of our organizations have \n     adopted the new United States Department of Transportation's \n     safety goal of 1.0 fatalities per hundred million vehicle \n     miles of overall highway travel by 2008--a one-third \n     reduction in today's rate. Sanctions and penalties decrease \n     the amount of funding available to the states to make \n     necessary investments to the highway system, compromising the \n     construction, rehabilitation, operation and maintenance of a \n     safe highway system. Fewer resources to invest means delays \n     in roadway and intersection improvements, fewer dollars for \n     upgrading highway signage and markings, and less funding \n     available for investment in safety research.\n       We urge you to employ incentives and positive strategies to \n     encourage states to accomplish both public safety and \n     transportation-related objectives rather than adopting a \n     negative sanctions approach. Incentives from an increased \n     overall multiyear funding program give states the flexibility \n     and resources to find creative solutions to safety problems \n     that fit their needs while ensuring stable funding for \n     improving, constructing, operating and maintaining safe \n     highways.\n       As you consider reauthorization of the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21), we urge you to \n     reject any changes to current law that would impose new \n     sanctions or penalties on the states for failure to comply \n     with federal highway safety mandates and goals.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Horsley, Executive Director, American Association of \n           State Highway and Transportation Officials; Barbara L. \n           Harsha, Executive Director, Governors Highway Safety \n           Association; Diane Steed, President and Chief Executive \n           Officer, The American Highway Users Alliance; David \n           Rosenblatt, Executive Director, International \n           Association of Chiefs of Police; Stephen Campbell, \n           Executive Director, Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance; \n           Stephen Sandherr, Chief Executive Officer, Associated \n           General Contractors of America.\n         Roger Wentz, Executive Director, American Traffic Safety \n           Services Association; William T. Pound, Executive \n           Director, National Conference of State Legislatures; \n           Peter Ruane, Executive Director, American Road & \n           Transportation Builders Association; David A. Raymond, \n           President, American Council of Engineering Companies; \n           Susan Pikrallidas, Vice President, Public Affairs, AAA; \n           Ray Scheppach, Executive Director, National Governors \n           Association.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I urge my colleagues to oppose any effort to mandate \nprimary laws or arbitrary usage of seatbelts on the States.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to continue my discussion \nabout key provisions of S. 1072. In particular, I would like to discuss \nsome of the bicycle and pedestrian provisions. According to the \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 5,600 pedestrians and \nbicyclists were killed in traffic accidents in 2001. Tens of thousands \nmore were injured in traffic accidents.\n  In that same year, more than one-fifth of the bikers killed in \ntraffic crashes were between the ages of 5 and 15, our Nation's \nchildren. Pedestrian and bicyclist fatality numbers have been slowly \ndecreasing over the years, but one death is too many. We must improve \nour record.\n  S. 1072 provides resources to help States address this safety \nproblem. Our bill reauthorizes the bicycle/pedestrian provisions found \nin TEA-21. We recognize the importance of these provisions. More people \nwalking and bicycling means fewer people in cars. It means healthier \ncommunities and a cleaner environment. We should promote it. Under our \nproposal, States may continue to use core program dollars to fund \nimprovements for bicyclists and pedestrians.\n\n  However, if we really want to encourage people to walk and bicycle \naround\n\n[[Page S769]]\n\nour communities, we must make these activities safer. Mr. President, \n5,600 fatalities is an unacceptable number.\n  In addition to reauthorizing current programs, our bill directs the \nSecretary of Transportation to make safety grants to fund an \ninformation clearinghouse and educational programs to promote bicycle \nand pedestrian safety. These provisions will support existing efforts \nto improve bicycle and pedestrian access to transportation facilities \nand to enhance safety for all transportation users.\n  I believe that these provisions in the bill, if taken into use by our \nStates and communities, will do a great deal to protect the children \npresently in our system and in the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  I rise today because I could not believe my eyes when I saw this \nheadline in the Los Angeles Times today: ``Bush Supports Shift of Jobs \nOverseas.'' If one reads this article, it is clear the concern I feel \non behalf of my constituents, who are finding their jobs going to other \ncountries, is not shared in the White House. In fact, Gregory Mankiw, \nthe President's Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, has this to \nsay:\n\n       Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international trade. \n     More things are tradable than were tradable in the past. And \n     that's a good thing.\n\n  I do not think outsourcing American jobs is a new kind of trade. I do \nnot think we should be thinking of our people as commodities, and I \ncertainly do not believe it is a good thing. If the other end of \nPennsylvania believes it is a good thing to have companies shift jobs \nfrom America to the rest of the world, then maybe they do not have a \nclue about what it is going to take to bring jobs back to this country \nand create the kind of economic prosperity that will put our people \nback to work again.\n  Of course, this goes hand in hand with the budget the President sent \nup, which cuts investments and workforce training of dislocated \nworkers, which underscores the failure to push for stricter standards \nor real enforcement of labor and environmental standards in our trade \nagreements, has no plans to address rising health care costs or legacy \nhealth and pension costs that are strangling American manufacturing \ncompanies, and apparently does not care we are now outsourcing \nradiologists and engineers, people we told to go get a good education, \nget that college degree, get that advanced degree; there will always be \na place for you in the American economy. If this is what the opinion is \non the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue--``Bush Supports Shift of Jobs \nOverseas''--I certainly hope this body will join to pass a resolution \nrepudiating this strategy. This is a strategy for decline. This is a \nstrategy for the destruction of the American job market.\n\n  We will be presenting a resolution, a sense of Senate, to stand \nagainst this philosophy in the White House that turns a blind eye to \nthe damage that is being done to the American economy: The loss of \njobs, the loss of income, the loss of self-confidence and prestige that \nis now sweeping our land.\n  I hope both sides of the aisle, Democrats and Republicans, will join \nin a sense-of-the-Senate resolution saying: We don't know what they are \ndrinking up there in the White House, we don't know what the Council of \nEconomic Advisers is reading, but we in the Senate do not believe \nshifting jobs overseas is a good economic strategy and we want, once \nand for all, to not only repudiate that but to come together with real \nplans and policies that will keep our jobs here and make it possible \nfor us to promise the American workforce that this economy will be \ncreating opportunities for them and they will not be watching the \nAmerican dream be outsourced as well.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for his kindness in \nletting me express and vent my frustration about this headline and the \nwords coming out of the White House at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will allow the manager to explain what \nwent on so our colleagues will fully understand, but I wish to make a \nstatement. I encourage colleagues who are interested in bringing \namendments to the floor to do that and continue to work in that vein. \nAgain, my whole purpose over the last week and a half we have been on \nthis bill has been to make sure people could come to the floor to \ndiscuss the bill, and if there are amendments people feel strongly, we \nare going to continue to move forward.\n  The objective of the leadership on both sides of the aisle is to \ncomplete this bill this week. I encourage people to come to the floor \nif they have amendments and to talk to the managers this afternoon.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Since this process started, we have been encouraging \npeople to come to discuss their amendments. We are now in a position \nwhere they can actually offer their amendments. We had quite a few \nMembers who worked over the weekend, who also had their staff working. \nThey brought amendments down, and I thank all of those Members.\n  We visited with them. As the managers, we accepted some. I think now \nwe are at the point where we do encourage our Members to bring their \namendments. While we are in this stage right now, let me share a couple \nof points that I think are very significant.\n  There has been a lot of discussion that the formulas are unfair to \nsome States. I suggest that in almost every case where there is a donee \nState that becomes a donor State, it is by a very small amount. On the \naverage, the disparity between donee and donor is far less.\n  In approaching this, we actually took the average donor and put 4 \ncents on it and then from the donee took 4 cents off. I think it is a \nvery fair way of doing it. But when people talk about the formulas, \nlet's keep in mind the formulas are real. They have not been real in \nthe past. They were not real in TEA-21. They tried to do it but they \nended up with a minimum guarantee, which is a political document.\n  The formulas include such things as total lane miles on the \ninterstate, on principal arterial routes; vehicle miles traveled; \nannual contributions to the highway trust fund attributed to commercial \nvehicles; diesel fuel used on highways; relative share of total cost to \nrepair or replace deficient highway bridges. That is one I am \nparticularly interested in since, as I have said many times, my State \nof Oklahoma is dead last in terms of the conditions of bridges; \nweighted nonattainment and maintenance areas; rate of return of donor \nStates. All of those are in the formula.\n  This is the first time, since we started this process--at least since \nI have been here in 1991 when ISTEA came out--that we actually are \nusing the formula and staying with it. It has not been easy, because \npeople who do not like the way their State was treated come down and \nsay all kinds of detrimental things about the formula, about our \nmotives, about the bill in general.\n  The bottom line is, we have been honest with the Senate and honest \nwith all of the States.\n  I do not think it will shock anyone to hear that there were political \nconsiderations in the past. We know that from the other body. The House \nMember from Pennsylvania was always very aggressive in getting the most \nhe could for his State. I think a lot of them are like that, and we \nhave corrected a lot of those.\n  I would say this: Of all of the ones who are the big players in TEA-\n21, and that was 1998, there was Senator Moynihan, whom we loved so \nmuch. His State was 1.25. We had Pennsylvania, which was Congressman \nShuster, 1.21; Rhode Island, of course, Chairman Chafee, 2.17; the \nSenator from Montana was not only the ranking on the committee but also \non the subcommittee, 2.18. At the same time all of that happened, my \nState was .9050, so we are way down there.\n  With SAFETEA, our percentages really do not change that much. We do \nultimately bring everybody up to 95 percent and that is what this will \ndo. Some are dissatisfied because they do not get up to 95 percent \nuntil the sixth year. It is unfortunate we could not come up with any \nother way, but it would cost so much money that if we did that, the \nones who would be paying for it would be the donee States, and that \nwould not be fair to them.\n  So I feel very good about where we are today. I think we have a fair \nbill. Very few people in this Chamber know the hours, the months, and \nthe years that have been involved in this bill. Certainly the managers \nof the bill do because we have been working on this bill for such a \nlong period of time.\n  Now that we have cloture filed, after it expires, it is our intention \nto go ahead and have a vote on cloture and get the bill completed. I \nbelieve it can be done this week.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for up to 7 minutes as if in morning business and then we \nreturn immediately to the bill, S. 1072.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2286 To Amendment No. 2285\n\n(Purpose: To provide a highway safety improvement program that includes \n        incentives to States to enact primary safety belt laws)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mr. DeWine, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2286.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is an amendment I submitted the other \nday on behalf of myself, Senator Clinton, and Senator DeWine of Ohio. \nIt is an amendment to increase our national seatbelt use rate to 90 \npercent, a concept that is well known to the Members of the Senate. \nThis amendment is identical to the legislation I introduced last year, \nS. 1993.\n  As my colleagues examine the highway bill and what it means to each \nof our States, our foremost responsibility, in my judgment, and the \njudgment of many, as well as the judgment of the President of the \nUnited States, must be to improve highway safety for the driving \npublic.\n  I commend the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee because he has a section in the bill on improving \nhighway safety. But I fear that somehow the President's proposal--\nactually the proposal the President sent up to the Congress regarding \nthe use of seatbelts--was not included in the final markup. It is for \nthat reason I rise to include in this bill a provision that was sought \nby the President.\n  Simply by increasing the number of Americans who will buckle up is \nthe most effective--I repeat, the most effective--step that can be \ntaken to save their lives and the lives of others. That is the single \nmost important step.\n  I am privileged to serve on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee,\n\n[[Page S771]]\n\nwhich has the primary responsibility for reauthorizing TEA-21. The bill \naddresses, as it should, highway safety measures such as how to build \nsafer roads and how to use new technologies to improve safety.\n  But statistics show that the greatest measure of safety, again, to \ndrivers, passengers, and possibly third parties not connected with the \nvehicle, is through the use of a seatbelt. It is remarkable the lives \nthat have been saved through the use of this simple device. America has \nabout a 79-percent use rate of seatbelts. Now, that is quite a \ncommendation to the drivers all across this country. Seventy-nine \npercent of Americans, according to reliable statistics, use their \nseatbelts. That has been translated into the saving of tens of \nthousands of lives and injuries in automobile accidents. But I believe, \nas do many in this Chamber, we can do better.\n  Those are the facts. Are we just going to have a standstill or are we \ngoing to move forward? Senator Clinton, Senator DeWine, and I think we \nshould move forward with a firmer approach with achievable goals and \nfunding.\n  We have debated the benefits of seatbelt use on many occasions in \nthis body and elsewhere across America. And whether it is in the town \nforums we conduct, town meetings, or here on the floor of the Senate, \nthere is always that individual who comes back: Don't tell me what I \nhave to do. What does it matter to you, John Warner--or to any other \ncolleague with whom I am privileged to serve--what does it matter to \nyou whether I buckle up?\n\n  Well, let's take a look. No one disputes that the absence of wearing \na seatbelt causes more loss of life and serious injury. The statistics \nshow that the impact associated with the crash, to the extent the \ndriver can maintain control of the vehicle in those fatal seconds, the \nseverity of the crash, and perhaps the loss of life can be reduced by \nthe use of a safety belt--simply said.\n  Accidents involving unbelted drivers result in a significant cost to \nyour wallet. Many people are rushed from the accident scene to various \nemergency facilities. All of that has the initial cost of the law \nenforcement that responds, the rescue squads that respond, and \neventually the costs to the emergency room or whatever medical facility \nyou might have the good fortune to be taken to, to hopefully save your \nlife. That isn't free. There is a cost. Regrettably, a number of \npersons who suffer these types of injuries in automobile accidents are \nuninsured. Again, the cost often devolves down on the good old hard-\nworking taxpayers--in most instances, the taxpayers who buckle up.\n\n  When an accident happens on our roads and highways across this great \nNation, we are all impacted. Accidents cause significant congestion, \nwhich results in lost time and productivity as we try to get to our \nwork or to our home along the highway where they are engaged in trying \nto remove the accident.\n  More often than not, the accident, with the combined slowdown of \nthose passing the accident, causes significant congestion for some \nconsiderable portion of time. Either the lane in which we are traveling \nmoves very slowly because of the accident or, indeed, we come to a \nstandstill, as often is the case when a lane is closed to clear an \naccident. That standstill frequently is necessitated because of the \nseverity of the injuries experienced in that accident. It takes the \nresponse team longer to get to the accident. It takes the response team \nlonger in their carefully trained steps to extricate the injured \nperson. All of that requires needed time.\n  To give the initial treatment and then to carefully transport that \nindividual, if necessary, to a medical facility takes time. That costs \nmoney. The road becomes backed up. That is lost time for your mission \non the road, be it for business, family, or pleasure. That is lost time \nand productivity. Behind you often are trucks and other vehicles \ninvolved in commerce. That is lost time and delay due to the \nseriousness occasioned by injuries and accidents where there has been \nthe lack of use of seatbelts. It is as simple is that. Those are the \nfacts. Then, of course, there is the cost to the community for caring \nfor the injured person who, regrettably, frequently doesn't have the \ninsurance to pay for his or her costs. The local people in your \ncommunities end up paying the bill.\n  The legislation we are proposing today will take an important step \nforward for the States to adopt either a primary safety belt law or \ntake steps of their own devising to meet a 90-percent seatbelt rate--\nnot the Warner amendment or the legislative measure put forth by the \nadministration upon which we draw our concept for certain portions. The \nStates can decide for themselves how they achieve a 90-percent goal of \nthe use of seatbelts in their respective States. That is the purpose of \nthis legislation--to move every State to a 90-percent use rate for \nsafety belts.\n  In a letter dated November 12, 2003, to Chairman Inhofe of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, on which I am privileged to \nserve, Secretary Mineta stated:\n\n       President Bush and I believe that increasing safety belt \n     usage rates is the single most effective means to decrease \n     highway fatalities and injuries.\n\n  That is explicit and clear. The Secretary goes on to say:\n\n       The surest way for a State to increase safety belt usage is \n     through the passage of a primary safety belt law.\n\n  I have had this debate with Governors and former Governors, even in \nthis Chamber with former Governors. I think they would tell you that a \nprimary safety belt law is a tough piece of legislation for the State \nlegislature to pass solely on its own. I mean that. Frankly, it needs \nthe impetus of those of us here in the Congress, of the combined \nefforts of the executive and the legislative branches of the Federal \nGovernment because it is just one of those things that State \nlegislatures have extraordinary difficulty grappling with.\n  Regrettably, in my own State this law has come down to a single vote \ndefeating it in two consecutive attempts. Stop to think, one vote in \nthe distinguished General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia has \nstopped our State from adopting this type of law.\n  I believe the impetus here will make it possible for our State and \nmany others to adopt this statute.\n  As provided in our amendment, States can increase seatbelt use either \nby enacting, as I said, a primary seatbelt law. Everybody knows what a \nprimary seatbelt law is and how it works. It means a law enforcement \nofficer can literally stop a vehicle if they observe that the \nindividual is not wearing his or her seatbelt. It is as simple as that. \nBut a State, if they decide not to enact a primary safety belt law, \ncan, by implementing their own strategies, whatever they may be--and \nthere is a lot of innovation out in the States--that would result in a \n90-percent safety belt use rate. So that is a challenge to the States.\n  The current national belt use, as I said, is 79 percent. But many \nStates--those that have the primary law--are sometimes at 90, or even \nabove 90, but those that do not have the primary seatblet law are down \nsometimes in the 60 percentile. It is the weight of the primary States \nthat carries the percentile and brings it up to 79 from those States \nthat don't have an effective law. States with their primary safety belt \nlaw have the greatest success for drivers wearing seatbelts.\n  On an average, States with the primary seatbelt law have a 10- to 15-\npercent higher seatbelt use compared to those with a secondary system. \nThis demonstrates that secondary seatbelt laws are far more limited in \ntheir effectiveness than a primary law.\n  Essentially, the secondary laws say that if a law enforcement officer \nhas cause other than a perceived or actual seatbelt violation--namely, \nthe driver didn't have it buckled--if they have cause to stop that car, \nfor example, for a speeding offense or a reckless driving offense or \nindeed an accident and they observed there has been no use of the \nseatbelt, then in the course of proceeding to enforce the several laws \nof the State as regards speeding or reckless driving, or whatever the \ncase may be, they can add a second penalty to address the absence of \nthe use of the seatbelt in that State.\n  Drivers are gamblers. They say: Oh, well, don't worry, I will not \nbuckle up. State law doesn't require it. Unless they stop me--and they \nare not going to stop me today. It is that gambling\n\n[[Page S772]]\n\nattitude that, more often than not, will cause an accident. Then it is \ntoo late.\n  So we come forward today to build on our national programs. We are \nbuilding on what we did in TEA-21. I was privileged to be on the \ncommittee. I was chairman of the subcommittee 6 years ago. I worked \nwith Senator Chafee, who was chairman of the full committee, and we \ndrove hard to make progress with the seatbelt laws, and we did it. We \nbasically put aside a very considerable sum of money to encourage \nStates--again, using their own devices--to increase uses. As a direct \nconsequence of what we did in TEA-21, there has been an 11-percent \nincrease in these 6 years in the use of seatbelts.\n  Sadly, traffic deaths in 2002 rose to the highest level in over a \ndecade. It is astonishing. Of the nearly 43,000 people killed on our \nhighways, over half were not wearing their seatbelts. That is according \nto the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And 9,200 of \nthese deaths might have been prevented if the safety belt had been \nused.\n  Those are alarming statistics. Automobile crashes are the leading \ncause of death for Americans age 2 to 34. Stop to think of that: Age 2, \nthat means a child; that means a parent neglected to buckle up a child. \nAutomobile crashes as the leading cause of death for Americans age 2 to \n34. That is our Nation's youth. Do we have a higher calling in the \nCongress of the United States than to do everything we can to foster \nthe dreams and ambitions and the productivity of our Nation's youth? I \nthink not. And this is one of the ways.\n  Last year, 6 out of 10 children who died in car crashes did not have \nthe belt on--6 out of 10; that is over half. I plead with colleagues to \njoin with me, join with the President who has taken this initiative.\n  My primary responsibility in the Senate--and this is one of the \nreasons I got interested in this subject--is the welfare of the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces. I say to colleagues, again, the statistics \nare tragic. Traffic fatalities are the leading noncombat cause of death \nfor our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. They are in that high-\nrisk age category, 18 to 35.\n  Someone even took a look at the statistics, the total of the \nfatalities least year, and said that represents in deaths approximately \nthe size of the average U.S. Army battalion. That is several companies \nand maybe a reinforced element. Just think, that is the magnitude in \none category of those who serve our United States, the men and women in \nthe Armed Forces.\n  I cannot think of any reason why we all cannot join behind this \neffort. That alone is a driving impetus for this Senator.\n  The time is long overdue for a national policy to strengthen seatbelt \nuse rates. I said a national policy, and that is what this bill \nrepresents, either through States enacting a primary seatbelt law or \ngiving far greater attention to public awareness programs that result \nin more drivers and passengers wearing safety belts. Our goal is 90 \npercent--90 percent.\n  I have been privileged to serve on this committee 17 years, and I, \ntogether with many others, notably my dear friend and late chairman, \nSenator Chafee, addressed this issue. Our committee is rich in the \nhistory of focusing revenue from the highway trust fund on effective \nsafety programs. It goes back through many chairmen and members of the \ncommittee.\n  With jurisdiction over the largest share of the highway trust fund, \nour committee has had the vision to tackle important national safety \nproblems. The legislation before us does provide more funding to help \nbuild safer roads--that is a step forward--but it does not have, in my \njudgment, that provision which represents a step up from what we did in \nTEA-21, that provision that would represent a recognition of the \nPresident's initiative.\n  The President has taken a decidedly strong initiative to increase the \nuse of seatbelts. It is absent from the bill, and this is why we need a \nprovision to strengthen and to move forward the position of the \nCongress on the issue of increased use of safety belts. That is the \npurpose of this amendment.\n  It is just unfortunate, but those with reckless intent quickly \ndisregard responsible behavior and drive unbelted at excessive speeds \nand many times with the use of alcohol. So no increased dollars for \nimproved road engineering, which is in this bill, can defy in many \ninstances the type of personal conduct that results in reckless \nbehavior. It is as simple as that.\n  Our automobiles now come equipped with crash avoidance technologies \nand are more crashworthy than ever before, but these advances are only \npart of the solution.\n  In repeated testimony before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, from the administration, our States, safety groups, and the \nhighway industry, we are told that three main causes of traffic deaths \nand injuries are unbelted drivers, speed, and alcohol.\n  The formula we have devised in this legislation does have a reduction \nin the amount a State receives under this proposed bill that we will \nconsider next year when they fail to achieve the 90 percent safety belt \nuse rate. It is as simple as that. But the formula is patterned \ndirectly after the law that is on the books now with respect to the .08 \nlegal blood alcohol content level.\n  The net effect of this legislation is simply to recognize we are \nasking that the same type of sanction policy with regard to one of the \nthree major causes of death--alcohol--be equated to a second cause of \ndeath and injury, and that is absence of the use of seatbelts, bringing \ninto parallel two of the three principal causes of death and injury on \ntoday's highways.\n  The administration put forward an innovative safety belt program, as \nI said, under the leadership of the President that was a major \ncomponent of their new core transportation program, the Highway Safety \nImprovement Program. Our amendment incorporates the administration's \nbill and includes additional incentives for states to increase seat \nbelt use rates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of \ndocuments that show widespread support for this legislation, from the \nVirginia Association of Chiefs of Police, the American Medical \nAssociation, and the letter to Senator Inhofe from the Secretary of \nTransportation. One hundred thirty-five organizations across the United \nStates are in support of this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 American Medical Association,\n\n                                                 February 9, 2004.\n\n  AMA Applauds Legislation To Promote Seat Belt Enforcement and Safety\n\n\n    AMA Speaks at Congressional Press Conference to Urge Seat Belt \n                           Amendment Passage\n\n       On behalf of the American Medical Association, I'm proud to \n     stand here with Senator Warner in support of enforcing seat \n     belt use. Preventing deaths and injuries on our nation's \n     roadways has been a priority of the AMA for many years. In \n     fact, over the last seven years the AMA has distributed more \n     than 16 million brochures on protecting children in motor \n     vehicles, and just last year we released a physicians' guide \n     to assess and counsel older drivers. Requiring all states to \n     enact a primary enforcement seat belt law or achieve a seat \n     belt use rate of at least 90 percent will help protect \n     Americans on the road.\n       We know the wearing seat belts saves lives. Over half of \n     the 43,000 people killed on America's highways in 2002 were \n     not wearing seat belts. Tragically, six out of 10 children \n     who died that year in motor-vehicle collisions were also not \n     wearing seat belts. Just taking one moment to buckle-up could \n     make a life-or-death difference to the thousands who \n     needlessly die on our roadways every year.\n       For those lucky enough to survive a devastating auto crash, \n     the health care costs can be staggering. On average, \n     hospitalization costs for unbelted traffic crash victims are \n     50 percent higher than for those who buckled-up. The needless \n     deaths and injuries that result from not wearing seat belts \n     cost society an estimated $26 billion annually in medical \n     care, lost productivity and other injury-related costs.\n       There deplorable statistics are reversible. We can \n     significantly reduce deaths and serious injuries from motor-\n     vehicle crashes by enforcing seat belt use nationwide through \n     a primary enforcement law like the one Senator Warner is now \n     proposing.\n       In my home state of Michigan, a primary enforcement law has \n     been in effect for three years. In that time, nearly 200 \n     lives have been saved, and over 1,000 serious collisions have \n     been averted because of this change in the law.\n       As a physician, it is a rare blessing to be in a situation \n     where we can easily identify the solution to a public health \n     threat. Passage of the primary enforcement seat belt law will \n     saves lives.

In those 913 fatality \n     crashes, 9,912 injuries were sustained by unbuckled \n     occupants.\n       Under our current secondary enforcement law, Virginia's \n     front seat safety belt use is 74.6%, which includes drivers \n     and front seat passengers. Research tells us that front seat \n     occupants of vehicles involved in potentially fatal crashes \n     in states with primary safety belt laws have a 15 percentage \n     point higher belt use than persons in states without primary \n     laws.\n       The VACP supports the passage of primary safety belt laws \n     as a proven tool to increase safety belt usage and reduce \n     serious injuries and fatalities in the event of a traffic \n     crash. Public education and enhanced traffic enforcement \n     efforts have failed to increase Virginia's safety belt usage \n     rate much beyond 75%. States with primary safety belt laws \n     consistently experience safety belt usage rates up to 90%. \n     The VACP believes that the passage of a primary safety belt \n     law in Virginia will increase belt usage and save the lives \n     of countless Virginians.\n\n                                               Dana G. Schrad,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              The Secretary of Transportation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 12, 2003.\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: With almost 43,000 people dying every \n     year on our nation's highways, it is imperative that we do \n     everything in our power to promote a safer transportation \n     system. The Bush Administration's proposal to reauthorize \n     surface transportation programs, the Safe, Accountable, \n     Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2003 \n     (SAFETEA), offers several bold and innovative approaches to \n     address this crisis.\n       President Bush and I believe that increasing safety belt \n     usage rates is the single most effective means to decrease \n     highway fatalities and injuries. As a result, SAFETEA's new \n     core highway safety program provides States with powerful \n     funding incentives to increase the percentage of Americans \n     who buckle up every time they get in an automobile. Every \n     percentage point increase in the national safety belt usage \n     rate saves hundreds of lives and millions of dollars in lost \n     productivity.\n       Empirical evidence shows that the surest way for a State to \n     increase safety belt usage is through the passage of a \n     primary safety belt law. States with primary belt laws have \n     safety belt usage rates that are on average eight percentage \n     points higher than States with secondary laws. Recognizing \n     that States may have other innovative methods to achieve \n     higher rates of belt use, SAFETEA also rewards States that \n     achieve 90% safety belt usage rates even if a primary safety \n     belt law is not enacted. I urge you to consider these \n     approaches as your Committee marks up reauthorization \n     legislation.\n       While safety belts are obviously critical to reducing \n     highway fatalities, so too is a data driven approach to \n     providing safety. Every State faces its own unique safety \n     challenges, and every State must be given broad funding \n     flexibility to solve those challenges. This is a central \n     theme of SAFETEA, which aims to provide States the ability to \n     use scarce resources to meet their own highest priority \n     needs. Such flexibility is essential for States to maximize \n     their resources, including the funds available under a new \n     core highway safety program.\n       I look forward to working with you on these critically \n     important safety issues as development of a surface \n     transportation reauthorization bill progresses.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                 Norman Y. Mineta.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer. I see other hands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is appropriate that the occupant of the \nChair at the present time is the Senator from Rhode Island because the \namendment being offered by the Senator from Virginia is one that was a \nfavorite of one of my favorite people, his father. I can remember many \ntimes he would be talking about this amendment. In fact, I can recall \nsome disagreements.\n  I would say: John, your son is a mayor of a significant city. I am \nsure if you call him up he will tell you, if there is one thing they \ndon't want, it is unfunded mandates. I was the mayor of a city for four \nterms. The biggest, greatest plague we had was unfunded mandates.\n  I will reluctantly oppose the Warner-Clinton-DeWine-Murray seatbelt \nsanction amendment at the appropriate time. This amendment makes a \nsignificant and damaging change to the core safety program established \nin the highway reauthorization bill.\n  The amendment imposes a new sanction on States that fail to achieve a \n90-percent seatbelt rate or enact a primary seatbelt law. Currently, \nonly 20 of the 50 States meet the requirements of this proposed new \nFederal mandate. As a result, if this amendment were to pass, 30 States \nwould be immediately thrust into a status of noncompliance with this \nmandate and the clock would start ticking against them, threatening a \nsignificant penalty through the loss of funding. My State of Oklahoma \nis already in compliance. Actually it wouldn't affect us. We are in \ncompliance with the requirements proposed by this new sanction. But I \nfundamentally oppose imposition of new sanctions on the States.\n  While most agree that seatbelts represent the single greatest factor \nin saving lives on our Nation's highways, the decision to pass a \nprimary seatbelt law is best made at the State level.\n  The penalties proposed by Senator Warner's seatbelt sanction are \ntwofold. The first penalty takes effect in calculating apportionments \nfor fiscal year 2005. This is especially disconcerting because that \ngives States who do not already have primary seatbelt laws on the books \nonly 8 months from now to enact a primary law. It doesn't affect me. \nOur State of Oklahoma already has them. This first penalty would \nrequire States in noncompliance to spend 10 percent of the funds \napportioned to them under the new core safety programs on safety \nbehavioral projects. Under section 405 of title 23, any funds subject \nto this transfer cannot be recovered in future years by a State's \nsubsequent compliance with the seatbelt sanction.\n  A second penalty would be imposed if States had still not enacted a \nprimary seatbelt law or brought their seatbelt rate up to 90 percent by \nthe beginning of fiscal year 2007. States still in noncompliance by \nthis time would lose up to 4 percent of their apportionments under each \nof the National Highway System programs: The Surface Transportation \nProgram, Interstate Maintenance Program, and the Highway Bridge \nReplacement and Rehabilitation Program. That one is significant to me. \nThese funds would be completely lost to the States in noncompliance and \nredistributed among other States.\n  You could argue that my position in Oklahoma could be enhanced by the \npassage of this amendment because we know there will be some States \nthat are not in compliance. Certainly our bridges in Oklahoma need as \nmuch help as they can get.\n  The amendment proposes instituting a huge penalty for States without \na primary seatbelt law. Although I support the increased use of \nseatbelts across the United States and would encourage States to enact \nprimary seatbelt laws to reach this objective, I believe threatening \nStates with the loss of needed Federal dollars for surface \ntransportation is not the right approach.\n  I admire so much the Senator from Virginia and his dedication. I \nnever appreciated what he had to go through 6 years ago as chairman of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee during the last \nreauthorization until I became the chairman and am going through it. I \nam sure he did a far better job than I. But I disagree with this \nparticular amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. He is always so courteous about matters such as this, and \nparticularly with reference to our dear friend, John Chafee, who felt \nvery strongly about this legislation. It is more than a technicality, \nbut this is not a sanction in the sense that we simply say each State \nshould achieve 90 percent. Now, there may be ways by which States can \nachieve that other than following this path which, as the Senator \ncorrectly points out, has a certain sequence of penalties. They would \nmeet the law and completely avoid the other path, where there are \npenalties.\n\n[[Page S774]]\n\n  My question is this: When America was faced with the problems of \nalcohol, which is still prevalent on the roads in our Nation, we, the \nCongress, enacted what we call the famous .08 law; am I correct?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Didn't we have an identical series of steps in that law \nthat I have put into this law?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I know there are similar steps. If you say they are \nidentical, I am sure they are.\n  Mr. WARNER. I assure the Senator it is almost identical. You can come \ndown to where it has worked in the case of alcohol, and now 47 States \nout of the 50 have adopted the alcohol legislation. I think, quite \nfrankly, that we can see a similar number of States quickly adopt this \nlegislation--a primary seatbelt law to avoid the penalties. So it is \nnot without precedent, and it also gives the State the alternative of \ndoing it by some other means than going down the path I have outlined.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I agree with the Senator from Virginia. I only say, if \nyour State were to devise a way to get to the 90-percent mark that they \nhave to get to to keep from being penalized, it would have to take some \nreasonable period of time. They would have to establish some criteria \nand then try to get there.\n  I cannot imagine it could be done within 8 months, and these people \nwould already be subjected to the penalties imposed in the year 2005. \nThat would be a concern.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague that \nwe selected that time period because of the language the Secretary of \nTransportation forwarded to the Congress. If there could be a means, if \nyou would be willing to help me devise a formula by which you think a \ngreater degree of fairness can be achieved, I am open to that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I look forward to working with the Senator \nfrom Virginia, as I always do. I think many of us who came to serve in \nthe Senate who were either Governors or mayors in major cities somehow \nhave this obstacle or obstruction in our minds on any kind of mandates. \nI plead guilty to that. I think other Members might oppose the \namendment, such as the Senator from Missouri who was a Governor. That \nis primarily the reason.\n\n  I would be happy to work with the Senator from Virginia, and I think \nhe has an excellent point. I know his heart is right and he is trying \nto save lives. That is why we all love him so much.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, I will take into consideration the \nviews of my distinguished chairman and see what we might do to make \nthat accommodation. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, while we are waiting for people to come \nwith their amendments, I will make a few comments relative to \nstatements that were made on the Senate floor yesterday concerning the \nbill.\n  Comments were made by one Senator who said he would just suggest that \nwe swap formulas between Oklahoma and Arizona. That was the senior \nSenator from Arizona, a very distinguished Senator. I only say that \nArizona and Oklahoma and all other 48 States have exactly the same \nformula. You don't have to swap formulas. They are the same.\n  I also suggest in the case of Arizona, it gets more money than \nOklahoma does under this bill--by about $60 million. So if a swap were \ntaking place, I think I would go along with that.\n  I am concerned a little about the statements made that more States \nwill become donor States. That is true under this bill. Right now, the \ndisparity between donor and donee is far greater than it will be after \nthis bill is passed. So if you have a State that goes from a $1.01 down \nto 99 cents, that is a small amount, but because it goes below the \nthreshold of a dollar, then it is now in donor status. So the way we \ntry to accomplish this is, if you take the average, the average donor \nState increased by 4 cents; the average donee State decreased by 4 \ncents. I don't see that anything could be more fair than that.\n  Third, I think if you look at the individuals who were driving this \nlegislation 6 years ago--TEA-21--you found that there were some parts \nof the State that were perhaps treated better than other parts. \nCertainly, we had three of the most powerful people from the \nnortheastern seaboard--Senators Moynihan, Congressman Shuster, and \nSenator Chafee. When you look at the amounts that they, under TEA-21, \nachieved, New York was $1.25; Pennsylvania, $1.21; Rhode Island, $1.26; \nand Oklahoma, 90.5 cents, which was the minimum. A critic of this bill \nsaid we should do what we did 6 years ago and immediately go to 90.5 \ncents as a floor instead of waiting until the sixth year.\n  The problem with that is there is not enough money. And if we did \nthat, that would have to come out of the donee State. The other problem \nis we are actually much more ambitious in this bill in reaching that \npoint.\n  If you look at this State by State--and several times on this Senate \nfloor we have been challenged by Members from States who felt their \nState was not getting a fair shake--keep in mind that every State is \ngoing to increase by at least 10 percent under this bill, and every \nState is going to have a donor status of nothing less than 95 percent \nat the conclusion of this bill, at the sixth year.\n  Mr. REID. Will the chairman of the committee yield for a question?\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the issue now before the Senate, \npropounded by the senior Senator from Virginia, a unique situation has \narisen in Nevada. In Nevada, the State legislature, last session, had a \ndebate on whether or not they would have primary seatbelt requirements \nfor the people of Nevada. They did something interesting. The State now \nhas a law that requires seatbelts for children but not for adults. I \nthink this is pretty compromising.\n  The Senator from Virginia is not on the Senate floor, but I could go \nfor something like that--that there could be a requirement that States \nhave a mandate that children have to wear seatbelts. The State of \nNevada debated this and, as far as adults, it failed. So I ask you and \nthe Senator from Virginia to consider amending the matter now before \nthe Senate to have a requirement for children. I think that is \nsomething that would be accepted. I think the debate would be very \nshort and to the point.\n  I think if he proceeds on his requirement to have seatbelts mandated \nfor everyone, States that are individualistic, such as Nevada--the \nState of Nevada doesn't like to be told what to do. They believe they \nare a sovereign State and the legislature meets and debates these \nissues. On this issue about primary seatbelts, that was brought before \nthe legislature just last session. I think it would be very difficult \nfor this Senator to say that I know more than the Nevada State \nLegislature, which not only held hearings on this issue but had a long \ndebate and turned down this mandate. While I personally may disagree \nwith that, the point is that the people of the State of Nevada, through \nits elected legislature, have spoken.\n\n  I hope--I repeat for the third time--that the Senator from Virginia \nwould consider modifying the amendment now before the Senate and have \nthis apply just to children.\n  The question is, through the Chair to the Senator from Oklahoma, how \nhe feels about this. Before he answers, I wish to compliment the Chair \nand his wonderful father who was one of my role models in this body. It \nis true he brought this amendment up on a number of occasions, but it \nnever passed. We are now in the same situation as in years previous.\n  It seems to me we would be well off if we made incremental \nimprovement, and I think that improvement would be to make sure this \ncovers all children.\n  I again ask the question of my friend from Oklahoma, does he think \nthat is a reasonable compromise?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, the \nargument I recall against the amendment was that the driver himself or \nherself would be in a position where they could lose control of a \nvehicle by not having a seatbelt on and, obviously, the children would \nbe safer than if nobody had on a seatbelt.\n  The Senator makes a very good point. It is one at which I would \ncertainly like to look.\n  I can assure the Senator from Nevada, I learned the hard way what our \nlaw was in Oklahoma when we started cranking out grandbabies. We have \n11 of them now. I did not realize the seriousness of this bill and I \ndid not have\n\n[[Page S775]]\n\none of the young ones in a seatbelt, and I had to pay the penalties. I \nlearned the hard way they really meant business.\n  Our law has teeth. I would certainly like to look and see what kind \nof results the State of Nevada has had.\n  Mr. REID. If I could, Mr. President, I try very rarely to boast on \nthe floor of the Senate, but this is an opportunity I can do so because \nI noted a sense of pride with the Senator from Oklahoma talking about \nhis 11 grandchildren. A week ago last Sunday, I had born into my family \nmy 14th grandchild. So is it OK if I am a little boastful about that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mr. REID. Eleven is OK, but the Senator from Oklahoma still has a way \nto go.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We haven't quit.\n  Mr. REID. What is that?\n  Mr. INHOFE. We haven't quit.\n  Mr. REID. Neither have we. In fact, we have just begun to propagate.\n  Mr. INHOFE. In terms of population of the State of Nevada and the \npercentage my grandchildren constitute in my State, the Senator from \nNevada is way ahead of me.\n  Mr. President, there are other points about which I could be talking \nthat were brought up, but I don't think it serves any useful purpose. \nWe made great progress on this bill. People have said nothing happened \nlast week. Something did happen last week. We had a chance to bring up \nthe bill, go over the bill, talk to people, and line up votes, quite \nfrankly.\n  We have the vast majority of people believing this is the right bill. \nI only regret there are those who try to say it is not fair for one \nreason or another. There is no question, if you take this and the last \ntwo 6-year reauthorizations, that this bill is far more fair than any \nother authorization we have done.\n\n  All these points were kept in mind as to donee States and donor \nStates. Now that we get up to 95 percent, we are going to forget about \nwhat it was like to be a 70-percent donor State, but I can remember. \nThis will be an issue that will go away because you figure you are high \nenough. This bill got us there.\n  At the same time, we have donee States, States that have done very \nwell in the past. I mentioned a minute ago, partially because the \nformer chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Congressman Bud \nShuster--and I served with him for 8 years in the House on that \ncommittee--perhaps his State got a little higher than it should have \nthrough his anxious approach. However, when you compare that to the \nState of Oklahoma--this is an interesting comparison--you can look at a \nchart and see you are not getting as much as last year and, therefore, \nit is unfair.\n  That is just not true. My State has roughly the same road miles as \nthe State of Pennsylvania. If you look at the next 6 years, the State \nof Pennsylvania is getting three times as much money as we are getting \nin our State of Oklahoma. It doesn't sound like I did a very good job \nfor Oklahoma.\n  There are other factors involved. It was called to my attention by \none of the Senators from that State that it is a pass-through State. \nEveryone goes through Pennsylvania to get someplace. How do you put \nthat into an equation? How do you put down how many people stop to buy \nproducts or services in your State? Some of these factors can't be \ndone.\n  I will say this: The old bill turned out to be a minimum guarantee. \nThat was wrong. That was a political document that merely said we will \nmake 60 percent of the people in this Chamber happy, and we don't care \nwhat happens to the other 40 percent. That was not an appropriate way \nto approach that bill.\n  With the factors of donee, donor, total lane miles, vehicle miles \ntraveled, annual contributions to the highway trust fund from \ncommercial vehicles, diesel fuel just on highways, relative share of \nthe total cost of repair and replacement of deficient highways and \nbridges, weighted nonattainment in maintenance areas, and rate of \nreturn for donor States, this formula has worked, and I am very proud \nof it.\n  We have gone through the last 2 weeks complimenting each other and \nthe leadership. I certainly compliment my friend from Vermont, the \nranking member, Senator Jeffords, as well as Senator Reid, the ranking \nmember on the subcommittee, and, of course, Kit Bond, the chairman of \nthe subcommittee under my committee. But I also compliment the staff.\n  I can promise you, Mr. President, that the staff worked many more \nhours than we did. They were down there all this last weekend. All I \nwas doing was sitting on the phone calling for votes. It was a lot of \nhard work, a lot of dedication. I want all the staff members of the \nmajority and the minority to know how much I personally appreciate \nthem.\n  I think it is necessary to have this bill. I can't think of anything \nworse than going on these short extensions and no one can plan in \nadvance. With the bill we have today, we have it set up so we can plan \nin advance.\n  The IPAM part of this bill will allow those projects which are ready \nto go to start working, to start those projects going, to hire the \npeople.\n  We had a chart a while ago as to the number of people this bill puts \nto work. We are talking about almost 3 million people, 3 million jobs \nthat will be filled as a result of having this bill pass.\n  I look forward to talking about the amendments, working toward \ncloture, and getting this bill passed in the Senate and sent to \nconference so we can all go to work in conference and come up with a \ngood solution to our Nation's highways, roads, and infrastructure \nproblems, as well as jobs in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I, first, commend my good friend from \nOklahoma, and then I will give my synopsis of some of the areas of this \nbill. I have just never worked with someone who has been more \ncooperative--and our staffs--to bring about a consensus in a very \ndifficult bill. A little change here and a little change there will \nchange millions of dollars and who it goes to and will bring about a \nconsensus that will at least make enough people happy to vote for the \nbill, which is the ultimate goal.\n  We have made great progress. I think we are now in a position where \nwe are going to be able to move forward.\n  TEA-21 provided record funding levels for transportation, which \nallowed States and local governments to make greater investments in our \ntransportation systems than ever before. S. 1072 will continue that \ntrend.\n  In crafting this bill, Chairman Inhofe, Senator Bond, Senator Reid, \nand I wanted to ensure the resources available under this bill would be \nspent wisely and responsibly.\n  During our hearings, we learned of challenges facing communities and \ntransportation agencies trying to manage a full load of increasingly \ncomplex transportation projects. In response, we crafted a bill that \nwill improve the delivery and stewardship of the Federal aid highway \nprogram.\n  First, we have expanded the scope of a program called ``value \nengineering.'' Value engineering provides States and local governments \nan additional approach to examining transportation projects before they \nare finalized. It promotes improved design, construction, and funding \nof transportation projects.\n  Second, we have included provisions to address issues that arise when \nState and local governments develop large-scale projects, so-called \nmega projects that cost over $1 billion.\n  To ensure these projects are developed and managed efficiently, S. \n1072 requires project management and financial plans.\n  Finally, to ensure that money received by the States is properly \naccounted for, we direct the Secretary to annually review States' \nfinancial management systems.\n  As my colleagues can see, S. 1072 provides record levels of funding \nfor transportation investment and the provisions to ensure we are good \nstewards of the public funds.\n  I look forward to going into the amendment process and making sure we \nwork, hopefully, efficiently and effectively and quickly to get this \nbill before us in final form before too long.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S776]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the transportation planning process is a \ncritical component of any surface transportation program or project. \nPoor planning may lead to cost overruns, project delays, and even \nproject cancellations. An early and comprehensive planning process can \nhelp stakeholders and project sponsors to identify and overcome \npotential problems so transportation projects proceed smoothly.\n  Our bill includes several provisions to encourage better planning \npractices at both the State and metropolitan levels. We make some \nadditions to current law to encourage transportation planning agencies \nto consider our environmental, natural resource, and community health \nissues early in the planning process.\n  The bill directs transportation planners to consult with relevant \nresource agencies when developing long-range transportation plans.\n  Improved coordination will promote long-range plans and project \nproposals that adequately consider and address the diverse implications \nof transportation projects. Improved interagency consultation and \ncoordination is only one component of a successful plan.\n  As I have said before, transportation investment is about people and \ncommunities. It is about making life better for our citizens by \nproviding an efficient, safe, and comprehensive transportation system.\n  A successful transportation program is one that considers the needs \nand the wishes of the people it serves. Our bill will enhance public \nparticipation in the planning process, encouraging projects that meet \nour infrastructure needs without sacrificing the environment or quality \nof life.\n  Finally, our bill emphasizes the role of new and emerging \ntechnologies in transportation planning. Geospatial mapping \ntechnologies have inspired innovative and successful planning processes \nin many States around the country. We encourage States to continue to \ndevelop and implement those technologies and to integrate them into the \ntransportation planning process.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have a couple of issues I will address \nas in morning business. I ask consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        A Premature BSE Decision\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, yesterday the Bush administration called \nto end the short-term investigation into the recent mad cow scare. \nWhile many of us believe Secretary Veneman and her staff have done a \ngood job on many fronts, the decision to suspend the investigation is \nextremely premature. Despite the high safety standards met by cattle \nproducers, consumers still have questions about the safety of America's \nmeat supply. By curtailing its investigation, the Bush administration \nhas chosen not to do all it can to settle the questions raised by the \ndiscovery of a single Canadian-born cow infected with BSE.\n  In 2001, a herd of 81 cattle came into the United States from Canada. \nOne of those animals turned out to have BSE. USDA, through its \ninvestigation, has managed to locate 28 of the remaining 80 Canadian-\nborn animals. We are grateful for these efforts, but there is a lot \nmore work to do. Twenty-eight is not 80.\n  Last year, USDA Chief Veterinarian Ron DeHaven said:\n\n       We feel confident that we are going to be able to determine \n     the whereabouts of most if not all of these animals within \n     the next several days.\n\n  Six weeks later, those early hopes have been disappointed. Consumers \nhave a right to know why those other cattle were not found and what \nmore, if anything, can be done.\n  If we assume the Canadian index herd were all fed the same bovine \nbyproduct known to cause BSE, it is possible the other animals \ncurrently in the United States may also have the disease.\n  An international panel convened by USDA announced last week they \nbelieve some cattle in the U.S. may actually have BSE. While the \nlikelihood an American consumer would come into contact with the meat \nfrom one of the infected cows is low, Government has the responsibility \nto do all it can to instill consumer confidence in the safety and \nquality of our food system and the food we feed our families.\n  That work has not been completed because the investigation has not \nbeen adequately ended. While the risk to human health may be remote, \nthe Bush administration is doing a disservice to consumers by short-\ncircuiting the good work USDA has done to locate the Canadian-born \nanimals in question.\n  In the face of so many doubts and questions, it makes no sense to cut \nthis investigation short. Some suggest pressure from the hugely \nconcentrated meatpacking industry is responsible. A small handful of \nmeatpackers controls 80 percent of the beef in the United States. In \nfact, this is such a significant problem that the Senate approved \nlegislation as part of its last farm bill to address problematic \nconcentration in the meatpacking industry. Unfortunately, that \nprovision was stripped during the conference and was not included in \nthe final farm bill.\n  Along with this growing concentration comes greater influence within \nthe administration itself. I am not suggesting the packers did \nsomething unlawful, but the fact remains they wanted to end this \ninvestigation because it cast a cloud over their products. Evidently, \nthese are the interests the Bush administration has chosen to advance \nabove others.\n  Others have suggested the Bush administration took this step in its \nzeal for a single American trading continent--no borders with the \nCanadians or the Mexicans whatsoever. In fact, after the farm bill was \npassed, the Secretary suggested we should have a continent-of-origin \nlabel for certain agricultural products. If that had been pursued, we \nwould never be able to differentiate between our highest quality \nproducts and those from Canada and Mexico. As it is, Americans today, \nstill, do not have the option of knowing where our food comes from.\n  This is particularly important with regard to beef in light of the \nBSE scare. American consumers are simply asking for a label with basic \ninformation about the food they eat. In fact, 80 percent of Americans \nhave said they would like to know where their meat comes from. That is \nwhy Senators on both sides of the aisle fought for and won approval of \nthe country-of-origin labeling law. It is why many of us have charged \nthose opposed to COOL with acting irresponsibly. In a backroom deal \nbefore the BSE scare, Republicans met in private and delayed the COOL \nlaw for 2 years.\n\n  The Senate has shown time and time again that we support this \nimportant consumer law and that we want to see it back in law, to \nensure implementation this fall. In fact, the law still requires USDA \nto develop the regulations by this fall. So, when we change the date of \nimplementation back to September of this year, there should be no delay \nwhatsoever in USDA implementing it on time as the law originally \nrequired. But we should not even have to wait for that. USDA has the \nauthority to immediately provide this information to consumers, to tell \nthem where their food and, in particular, where their meat originated. \nIf we have that, consumers can stay away from Canadian-born cattle, at \nleast until the animals in question that have not been located in the \nUnited States are actually found.\n  But to date the administration will have none of it. They will not \nhelp inform U.S. consumers, even though our major export markets have \nrequested we certify that our exports are born and raised and processed \nin our country. I don't understand why the administration will not \nprovide U.S. consumers the information they want and our foreign \ntrading partners the information they now demand.\n  The only answer that keeps coming back to many of us is while COOL is \ngood for average Americans, it is inconvenient for the large \nmeatpacking cartel since they would be required to affix a simple label \nto their products and track the meat from the stockyard to the store \nshelf. So, despite the support of 167 consumer groups representing over \n50 million Americans,\n\n[[Page S777]]\n\nthe administration denies Americans this basic information.\n  USDA should reopen the investigation and try to locate all of the \ncattle from the Canadian index herd. They should also assist American \nconsumers and American farmers and ranchers by immediately implementing \na ``Product of the USA'' labeling program under emergency regulations. \nInstead of bowing to pressure and cutting short a valuable \ninvestigation, the administration should take a step back and rethink \nits priorities. The BSE scare is now hurting all of our ranchers, as \nover 40 countries have banned imports from the United States. The \nAmerican livestock industry is being tarnished and ranchers are \nsuffering because of one Canadian cow. The industry should not be \nfurther tarnished by inappropriate Government action. The \nadministration should reopen the investigation, drop its opposition to \nlabeling, and implement COOL immediately.\n  For the sake of America's farmers and ranchers, for consumer \nconfidence in the safety of our food supply, the administration needs \nto do the right thing. Though it might upset a few special interests, \nthe American people will overwhelmingly support such an action because \nit is in their interest. I, for one, will commend the President for his \nthoughtful reversal of this misplaced policy priority.\n\n\n    White House Says Exporting U.S. Jobs Is ``Good for the Economy''\n\n  Mr. President, the other issue I wanted to discuss briefly is a new \nposition taken by the administration, reflected in this newspaper. The \narticle appeared this morning in the Los Angeles Times. The headline \nreads, ``Bush Supports Shift of Jobs Overseas.''\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Feb. 10, 2004]\n\n                  Bush Supports Shift of Jobs Overseas\n\n                    (By Warren Vieth and Edwin Chen)\n\n       Washington.--The movement of American factory jobs and \n     white-collar work to other countries is part of a positive \n     transformation that will enrich the U.S. economy over time, \n     even if it causes short-term pain and dislocation, the Bush \n     administration said Monday.\n       The embrace of foreign out-sourcing, an accelerating trend \n     that has contributed to U.S. job losses in recent years and \n     has become an issue in the 2004 elections, is contained in \n     the president's annual report to Congress on the health of \n     the economy.\n       ``Outsourcing is just a new way of doing international \n     trade,'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of Bush's Council \n     of Economic Advisors, which prepared the report. ``More \n     things are tradable than were tradable in the past. And \n     that's good thing.''\n       The report, which predicts that the nation will reverse a \n     three-year employment slide by creating 2.6 million jobs in \n     2004, is part of a weeklong effort by the administration to \n     highlight signs that the recovery is picking up speed. Bush's \n     economic stewardship has become a central issue in the \n     presidential campaign, and the White House is eager to \n     demonstrate that his policies are producing results.\n       In his message to Congress on Monday, Bush said the economy \n     `` is strong and getting stronger,'' thanks in part to his \n     tax cuts and other economic programs. He said the nation had \n     survived a stock market meltdown, recession, terrorist \n     attacks, corporate scandals and war in Afghanistan and Iraq, \n     and was finally beginning to enjoy ``a mounting prosperity \n     that will reach every corner of America.''\n       The president repeated that message during an afternoon \n     discussion about the economy at SRC Automotive, an engine-\n     rebuilding plant in Springfield, Mo., where he lashed out at \n     lawmakers who oppose making his tax cuts permanent.\n       ``When they say, `We're going to repeal Bush's tax cuts,' \n     that means they're going to raise you taxes, and that's \n     wrong. And that's bad economics,'' he said.\n       Democrats who want Bush's job were quick to challenge his \n     claims.\n       Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, the front-runner for \n     the Democratic presidential nomination, supports a rollback \n     of Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and backs the \n     creation of tax incentives for companies that keep jobs in \n     the United States--although he supported the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement, which many union members say is \n     responsible for the migration of U.S. jobs, particularly in \n     the auto industry, to Mexico.\n       Campaigning Monday in Roanoke, Va., Kerry questioned the \n     credibility of the administration's job-creation forecast.\n       ``I've got a feeling this report was prepared by the same \n     people who brought us the intelligence on Iraq,'' Kerry said. \n     ``I don't think we need a new report about jobs in America. I \n     think we need a new president who's going to create jobs in \n     America and put Americans back to work.''\n       In an evening appearance at George Mason University in \n     Fairfax, Va., Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina mocked the \n     Bush administration's economic report.\n       Edwards, who also supports repealing tax cuts for the \n     richest Americans and offering incentives to corporation that \n     create new jobs in the United States, said it would come as a \n     ``news bulletin'' to the American people that the economy was \n     improving and that the outsourcing of jobs was good for \n     America.\n       ``These people,'' he said of the Bush administration, \n     ``what planet do they live on? They are so out of touch.''\n       The president's 411-page report contains a detailed \n     diagnosis of the forces the White House says are contributing \n     to America's economic slowdown and a wide-ranging defense of \n     the policies Bush has pursued to combat it.\n       It asserts that the last recession actually began in late \n     2000, before the president took office, instead of March \n     2001, as certified by the official recession-dating panel of \n     the National Bureau of Economic Research.\n       Much of the report repeats the administration's previous \n     economic prescriptions.\n       For instance, it says the Bush tax cuts must be made \n     permanent to have their full effect on the economy.\n       Social Security also must be restructured to let workers \n     put part of their retirement funds in private accounts, the \n     report argues. Doing so could add nearly $5 trillion to the \n     national debt by 2036, the president's advisors note, but the \n     additional borrowing would be repaid 20 years later and the \n     program's longterm health would be more secure.\n       The report devotes an entire chapter to an issue that \n     has become increasingly troublesome for the \n     administration: the loss of 2.8 million manufacturing jobs \n     since Bush took office, and critics' claims that his trade \n     policies are partly to blame.\n       His advisors acknowledge that international trade and \n     foreign outsourcing have contributed to the job slump. But \n     the report argues that technological progress and rising \n     productivity--the ability to produce more goods with fewer \n     workers--have played a bigger role than the flight of \n     production to China and other low-wage countries.\n       Although trade expansion inevitably hurts some domestic \n     workers, the benefits eventually will outweigh the costs as \n     Americans are able to buy cheaper goods and services and as \n     new jobs are created in growing sectors of the economy, the \n     report said.\n       The president's report endorses the relatively new \n     phenomenon of outsourcing high-end, white-collar work to \n     India and other countries, a trend that has stirred concern \n     within such affected occupations as computer programming and \n     medical diagnostics.\n       ``Maybe we will outsource a few radiologists,'' Mankiw told \n     reporters. ``What does that mean? Well, maybe the next \n     generation of doctors will train fewer radiologists and will \n     train more general practitioners or surgeons. . . .  Maybe \n     we've learned that we don't have a comparative advantage in \n     radiologist.''\n       Government should try to salve the short-term disruption by \n     helping displaced workers obtain the training they need to \n     enter new fields, such as healthcare, Mankiw said, not by \n     erecting protectionist barriers on behalf of vulnerable \n     industries or professions. ``The market is the best \n     determinant of where the jobs should be,'' he said.\n       Bush's quick visit to Missouri--his 15th to a state \n     considered a critical election battleground--was the first of \n     several events this week intended to underscore recent \n     economic gains. Although U.S. job creation remains relatively \n     sluggish, the nation's unemployment rate fell from 6.4% in \n     June to 5.6% in January, and the economy grew at the fastest \n     pace in 20 years during the last half of 2003.\n       The format of his visit to SRC Automotive--one that he \n     particularly likes--involved several employees and local \n     business owners sharing the stage with the president to \n     discuss their perspectives on the economy, with Bush \n     elaborating on their stories to emphasize particular aspects \n     of his economic program.\n       Today, Bush is scheduled to meet with economic leaders at \n     the White House. On Thursday, he goes to Pennsylvania's \n     capital, Harrisburg--in another swing state that he has \n     already visited more than two dozen times since becoming \n     president.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. When I saw the headline, I had to read it twice.\n  I actually could not believe what I was reading. Again the quote is \nfrom the headline, ``Bush Supports Shift of Jobs Overseas.''\n  Our economy has already lost 2.6 million jobs in the last 3 years. We \nhave 9 million Americans who are unemployed. Long-term unemployment is \nat a 20-year high, and 80,000 workers are exhausting their unemployment \nbenefits every week because our Republican colleagues refuse to extend \ntemporary Federal unemployment benefits.\n  What does the White House say? The President's top economic advisers \ntell us not to worry. They say shipping American jobs to China, India, \nand other countries is actually good for the economy. Those comments \nare actually in this article. It is a direct quote, that these American \njobs shipped abroad are good for the economy. They say exporting \ncomputer programming jobs and\n\n[[Page S778]]\n\nother white-collar jobs is actually good for the economy.\n  The White House acknowledges some workers will be hurt. But then they \nsay the ``benefits'' of exporting American jobs ``eventually will \noutweigh the costs as Americans are able to buy cheaper goods and \nservices and new jobs are created in growing sectors of the economy.''\n  How are people without jobs supposed to buy all of these goods and \nservices? How do you keep a consumer economy going when you export the \njobs? What are they thinking?\n  The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, the \noffice that wrote the report, says the ``government should try to salve \nthe short-term disruption by helping displaced workers obtain the \ntraining they need to enter new fields, such as health care.'' That \nsounds like a cruel joke.\n  The President's proposed budget for next year cuts money for Federal \njob training.\n  You have on the one hand the President's council arguing we ought to \ntrain displaced workers but then have the budget presented to Congress \nas one which actually cuts the very training the administration is \nadvocating.\n  How do people know what fields to train for? How do they know the \njobs they are training for won't be the next jobs targeted to be \nshipped overseas with the encouragement of the White House?\n  Maybe exporting American jobs sounds like a good idea if you are \nsitting in some think tank, or behind a desk at the White House, or \nhere on the Hill. But out in the real world, it is creating real \nhardship and anxiety.\n  I have seen what happens when plants ship their jobs overseas. It \nhappened in my hometown 2 years ago. Midcom, Incorporated makes \nelectronic transformers for high-tech companies. They used to employ \n200 people in Aberdeen. One Tuesday morning in March of 2001, those \nworkers showed up for work and were told their jobs were going to be \ngone in 3 months, many of them to Mexico and China.\n  I have met with many of those workers. A lot of them are women in \ntheir 40s and 50s, and their families depended on their incomes to make \nends meet. They don't see how exporting their jobs was a good idea for \nthe economy, and neither do most Americans.\n  The chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers is \nquoted as saying, ``Out-sourcing is just a new way of doing \ninternational trade.'' ``More things are tradable than were tradable in \nthe past. ``\n  Not everything is tradable. The dignity that comes from earning an \nhonest dollar and providing for your family is not tradable. The \nsecurity that comes from knowing you can pay the bills and you are not \ngoing to lose your home is not tradable. The sense of patriotism and \ncommunity that says we are all in this together is not a tradable \ncommodity.\n  The White House report predicts a miraculous economic recovery this \nyear. They say we could see the creation of 3.8 million jobs. The White \nHouse has said the economy will create millions of jobs every year now \nfor the last 3 years. And they have been wrong. They are wrong now when \nthey say exporting American jobs is good for the economy. The White \nHouse has lost more jobs on President Bush's watch than the last 11 \nadministrations put together. They have cut job training in education. \nThey are blocking Federal unemployment benefits. And now, incredibly, \nthey are saying that exporting middle-class, white-collar jobs is good \nfor the economy.\n  Instead of policies that reward companies for shifting jobs overseas, \ninstead of letting companies open a post office box in some island \nnation and call it their corporate headquarters so they skip out on \npaying taxes, America needs a real plan to keep the good jobs we have \nhere and create many more of them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand there is an amendment of the \nSenator from Virginia and the Senator from New York pending. Is that \nthe pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I spoke about this amendment this morning. \nFor those who may not have been fortunate enough to hear it, let me \nreiterate just a few of the important points.\n  This is a mandate. This is very clearly a mandate with a very severe \npenalty on any State that doesn't either have 90-percent usage of \nseatbelts or a primary seatbelt law.\n  I came to this body as a former Governor who has seen so much of the \nbig brother influence telling State Governors and State legislators \nwhat they have to do, and I said we need to find a better way of doing \nthings. I also said I happen to be a strong believer in seatbelts. I \nhave been in a couple of serious accidents. Because I had a seatbelt on \nand the shoulder harness, I came away with only a good fright, and, \nfortunately, with no serious injuries. I have seen many other people \nwho were not so fortunate. I believe in encouraging seatbelt usage. I \nbelieve the proper way to do it is through incentives and \nencouragement.\n  Under this proposed amendment, in fiscal year 2005 and thereafter, 10 \npercent of the funds under the Highway Safety Improvement Program would \nbe transferred to the section 402 program, and beginning in 2007, 2 \npercent of the Interstate Maintenance, Surface Transportation and \nBridge Programs would be withheld from States that didn't have a \nprimary seatbelt law or achieve at least a 90-percent safety belt use \nrate. The percentage withheld would rise to 4 percent in fiscal year \n2008 and thereafter.\n  Why do I object to that? That is telling the people who pay the money \ninto the Federal highway trust fund through their taxes on the fuel \nthey buy that their legislature has to do what we say they should or we \nare going to withhold the money from them. I believe we cannot continue \nto usurp the activities and the roles of State legislatures and State \nchief executive officers.\n  I introduced a letter from a number of organizations saying:\n\n       Currently States face 8 highway safety-related sanctions \n     and penalties that are designed to force compliance with \n     various Federal highway safety mandates or goals, including \n     enactment, by specified deadlines, of various types of State \n     safety legislation. While our organizations support the \n     underlying safety goals, we oppose the use of penalties and \n     sanctions.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       Fewer resources to invest means delays in roadway and \n     intersection improvements, fewer dollars for upgrading \n     signage and markings, and less funding available for \n     investment and safety research.\n\n  Also signing this letter are the executive director of the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the \nexecutive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, the \npresident and chief executive officer of the American Highway Users \nAlliance, the executive director of the International Association of \nChiefs of Police, the executive director of the Commercial Vehicle \nSafety Alliance, the executive director of the National Conference of \nState Legislators, the president of the American Council of Engineering \nCompanies, and the vice president of Public Affairs of the AAA, as \nwell, I might say not surprisingly, as the executive director of the \nNational Governors Association.\n  I hope we may be able to have a vote on that very shortly. But I \nwould defer to the principal sponsor of the amendment to speak in \nopposition to the arguments I have made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his courtesy, and \nthat of the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator Inhofe.\n  I say to my dear friends: What price do you put on life? No one \ndisputes this legislation will save lives. I don't know of anyone in \nthis Chamber who wouldn't put the highest possible priority on saving \nlives.\n  This legislation follows, in many respects, what this Chamber did not \ntoo many years ago when it was faced with the problem of trying to \nreduce the actions and loss of life or injury occasioned by the abuse \nof alcohol and then driving the automobile.\n\n  As a consequence of that, 47 States now have complied with that \nstatute. It is a success in terms of the limited goals that could be \nset realistically by the .08 drinking level. It achieved the goals in \n47 States.\n  We are asking the average American, about 79 percent of our \nconstituents in\n\n[[Page S779]]\n\nthe 50 States--it varies from State to State but overall average, \nnationally, 79 percent--who use the seatbelt, we are just trying to \ntake it from 79 percent up to 90 percent.\n  That is the purpose, to save lives, very often innocent lives. It is \na well-known, documented fact that in a collision, those who have \nsafety belts on have a higher degree of physical control over the \nvehicle with the hope of trying to reduce the consequences of the \ninevitable accident. Without a seatbelt, the driver is often jostled in \nsuch a way that he or she loses total control of the car and often an \ninnocent individual is injured.\n  It is the youth of this Nation who will be the principal \nbeneficiaries of this legislation because, regrettably, it is the young \npeople who are so often involved in these frightful accidents. For \nwhatever reason, macho or otherwise, they do not wear their seatbelts.\n  This law would simply say that law enforcement in the several States, \nwhen they observe a car passing and the driver does not utilize their \nsafety belt, can pull that driver over. In my State today, that driver \ncannot be pulled over unless he or she is committing an offense other \nthan not wearing their safety belt. Law enforcement can then pull that \ndriver over if he or she is not wearing their safety belt and levy \nwhatever penalties are appropriate. But it is that fear of being pulled \nover, particularly among those young people, who always seem to be \nfighting accumulated points for driving infractions, who will be the \nprincipal beneficiaries.\n  The men and women of the Armed Forces, regrettably--so many of them, \nagain, ages 18 to 30--are involved in these accidents. So we are \nhelping our military because they will comply with this law of the \nseveral States if there is a mandatory seatbelt law.\n  When my colleagues cast their vote momentarily, stop to think, what \nprice do you put on a life? I bet if you go back--perhaps I can \nresurrect how you voted on the .08 legislation for alcohol; this is a \ndirect parallel in almost every way.\n  This is not mandated because the State, on its own initiative, can \ndevise a program to go to 90 percent. It does not have to follow this \ntrack. Go ahead, there might be a better idea in your State to reach 90 \npercent. Then there is no problem under this law; you have met the \ncriteria.\n  As that bell rings and you approach the Chamber, just ask yourself \nthe question, What price do I put on a life? Because no one in this \nChamber can stand up and say this law would not save lives, would not \nsave injuries, would not save money now expended by your local \ncommunity to care for those in an accident, many of whom do not have \ninsurance. And the bill stops at your local hospital, unpaid. We did it \nfor .08; we can do it for this.\n  I thank my colleagues for patiently listening to me. My distinguished \ncolleagues from Missouri read off a list of endorsements and I have 135 \ngroups here. The American Medical Association--I listened very \ncarefully yesterday at a press conference when this was addressed by \ntheir representative--is strongly in favor of this. My colleague from \nMissouri mentioned the chiefs of police. I am proud to say my State, \nthe Virginia Chiefs, endorse this statute. As I say, the President, \nthrough his Secretary of Transportation, while not directly addressing \nthis specific piece of legislation, said:\n\n       I believe that increasing safety belt usage rates is the \n     single most effective means to decrease highway fatalities \n     and injuries.\n\n  I have two cosponsors on this bill. I wonder if the distinguished \nmanager would enable me just to contact them?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. In fairness to the Senator's cosponsors and in fairness \nto others who may not be easily retrievable at this time, I believe it \nwould be a good idea to defer the vote. I will move to table and ask \nfor the yeas and nays but ask the leadership to maybe put it tomorrow \nmorning sometime. That will give the Senator ample time and provide \ntime for them to be heard on the bill. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a reasonable request. I think the distinguished \nSenator from New York, Mrs. Clinton, would require, say, 10 minutes and \nthe distinguished Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and the distinguished \nSenator from Washington, 10; I will take 5 more minutes; maybe 40 \nminutes on this side prior to the vote.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do not have a problem with that and 40 minutes on this \nside at all. Why not plan to do that?\n  Now I have been told we cannot lock in time agreements on a tabling \nmotion, so I will withhold.\n  Let me be sure we all understand: In my State of Oklahoma, it perhaps \nmakes no difference. We are one of the 20 States that has mandatory \nseatbelt laws. In fact, it could be argued we could be benefited by \nthis because if other States do not comply and are punished, then that \namount of money could go to the States that already comply. So I could \nactually benefit.\n  My problem has always been, as the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia knows, it is a mandate. I would prefer not to do it this way.\n  I know the Senator's heart is right. I know there is another great \nperson who served in here by the name of John Chafee who felt as \nstrongly about this as the distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Also, Mr. President, we discussed the possibility that I \ncould amend this because I think the distinguished chairman pointed out \nthat 8 months is a short time. So if we could have a gentlemen's \nunderstanding that perhaps I could amend it in such a way to take that \nclause and revise it to enable States to have more time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are accommodating the desires of the \nmanagers of this bill. Certainly as the chief proponents of this \namendment, as long as my cosponsors have an opportunity to speak to it, \nthis matter will be handled fairly.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           motorcycle safety\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics \ntells us that almost 5 million motorcycles are registered to operate on \nAmerica's roadways, covering almost 17 million miles per year. Many \nmore are used off-road, and some estimates put the actual number of \nriders at up to 20 million.\n  All these Americans choose to ride motorcycles either for recreation \nor for their primary means of transportation, and every year the number \nof Americans on motorcycles increases. As that number increases, so \ndoes the number of accidents, including fata accidents. Yet we are \nfalling tragically behind in training these individuals to ride safely.\n  The single best way to avoid injuries, fatalities, high insurance \ncosts, lawsuits, medical costs and all the other factors that come into \nplay is by avoiding the accidents in the first place.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in its Motorcycle \nSafety Program issued in January 2003, said: ``Crash prevention . . . \noffers the greatest potential safety benefit for motorcyclists.''\n  And the single best way to avoid accidents is to provide safety \ntraining.\n  Training works.\n  Untrained riders have accidents, and trained riders do not. It is \nreally as simple as that.\n  A study of the California Motorcyclist Safety Program designed by Dr. \nJohn Billheimer and completed in 1996 found that rider training \ndramatically reduces accidents, and thus eliminates injuries and \nfatalities. Specifically, the study stated, ``Analyses of statewide \naccident trends show that total motorcycle accidents have dropped 67 \npercent since the introduction of the California Motorcyclist Safety \nProgram, with a drop of 88 percent among the under-18 riders. . . . If \naccident trends in California had paralleled those in the rest of the \nU.S. over this period, the State would have experienced an additional \n124 fatalities per year. By any measure, the California Motorcyclist \nSafety Program is a cost-effective program that pays for itself many \ntimes over in saved lives and reduced accident rates.''\n  Even more recent statistics from the Commonwealth of Virginia are \nequally telling. Virginia has approximately 110,000 registered \nmotorcycle. Since 1998, there have been 7,099 motorcycle crashes in \nVirginia and 222 of those crashes have been fatal. Yet out of all those \naccidents, the number involving riders with formal training is less \nthan 4 percent of the total, and the number\n\n[[Page S780]]\n\nof fatal accidents involving trained riders is just 1.8 percent. The \nvast majority of all accidents--over 96 percent--are riders \nwithout training.\n  The most far-reaching document yet completed on motorcyclist safety \nis the ``National Agenda for Motorcycle Safety,'' a cooperative effort \nby the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Motorcycle \nSafety Foundation, the National Association of State Motorcycle Safety \nAdministrators, and a host of others representing the insurance \nindustry, law enforcement, riders, traffic safety experts and others.\n  The National Agenda identified a number of steps needed to reduce the \ntragic rate of motorcycle accidents. Uppermost among them is the need \nfor better training.\n  Where does motorcyclist training come from? Who does it? How is it \nfunded?\n  The truth is, training, and funding for training, is a mixed bag. And \nthat, is exactly the problem. Most States provide at least moral \nsupport, but there is no uniform process for ensuring that training is \nprovided, or that the facilities and funding is made available.\n  In most cases, training is funded almost entirely by the students \nthemselves, who pay up to $300 per person for the privilege. Many \nStates also collect money--often a nominal charge of $5.00 for a \nmotorcycle operator's license. Both these efforts to raise funds are \nstrongly supported by and promoted by the motorcycling community--but \nthey want to ensure that the funds are actually used for things that \nenhance motorcyclist safety.\n  As for the curriculum itself, far and away the most frequent choice \nis the material created by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation (MSF), a \ngroup supported by the major motorcycle manufacturers.\n  The MSF course material for beginning motorcyclists is extremely \ncomprehensive. It focuses on teaching the skills and knowledge needed \nfor safe riding--beginning with the use of proper equipment such as \ngloves, boots and helmets, goes on to teach students how to predict and \navoid hazardous situations, and graduates to teaching the physical \nskills needed for crash avoidance. This is precisely the course \nmaterial that has produced such outstanding results in California, \nVirginia and many other States.\n  You may well ask, ``If training is so successful, why do we still \nhave so many accidents? The answer is as simple as can be: training \navailability lags far behind the demand.\n  Throughout the country, the waiting list to join a training class \nranges from several weeks to several months.\n  In California, which has one of the oldest and strongest programs, it \nmay take as long as 3 months.\n  In Wisconsin, one of the States where training dollars were totally \neliminated, motorcyclist groups have stepped up to the plate to self-\nfund training, but the waiting list may be as large as 7,000 people.\n  Illinois trained 8,500 people in 2000, but had to turn away nearly \n3,000 more for lack of space. Course capacity increased in 2001 and \n2002, but the number of people turned away increased faster. In 2003, \nalmost 11,000 students completed training, but almost 4,000 were told \n``Sorry, there's no room for you.''\n  And that's the story in State after State.\n  Unfortunately, what that means is that untrained riders are \nincreasing in number all the time. If you can pass your State's test, \nyou can ride. And if you just spent thousands of dollars on a new \nmotorcycle, the chances are you won't be letting that new motorcycle \nlicense go to waste. But a licensed rider isn't necessarily a trained \nrider, nor is he or she necessarily a safe rider. It takes training--or \nyears of experience--to make a safe rider. The statistics from \nCalifornia and Virginia confirm that for all to see.\n  At the appropriate time, it is my intention to seek action to \nencourage the State to provide more and better support for these vital \ntraining efforts.\n  Now, let me turn to another concern of the motorcycling community. A \nlarge part of the training needed to produce safe riders consists of \nteaching them how to avoid road hazards that simply should not exist in \nthe first place. In many cases, highway engineering practices focus on \nfour wheels, not two.\n  The average driver cruises past such things as bridge expansion \njoints, loose manhole covers, the slick sealants used to fill cracks in \nasphalt pavement, rough asphalt patches, rumble strips and lane-\ndividing buttons that keep drivers awake, and the steel or steel cable \nbarriers along the side of the road. Yet any or all of these things may \nbe hazardous to a rider.\n  The motorcycling community has long sought ways to let engineers and \ndesigners know about those hazards, and work with them to design better \nsystems. I have seriously contemplated offering an amendment that would \naddress this issue, but I am happy to report that such an amendment may \nnot be needed.\n  That concludes my statement for the movement, but at this time I \nwould like to engage in a colloquy with the chairman of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee on this matter.\n  I have been working in several areas to address the issue of \nmotorcyclist safety. As part of this effort, I have been working to \nestablish an Advisory Council to assist the Secretary of Transportation \nin developing the appropriate safety specifications for highways and \nmotorcycles. Fatalities among motorcyclists have gone up dramatically, \nrising from 2,112 in 1997 to 3,244 in 2002. Because motorcyclists have \nspecial needs and concerns, I have long been concerned that the \nDepartment of Transportation has not had adequate input from either \nriders or experts outside the Department itself. Thus, I proposed \nestablishing a council of riders and experts to advise the Secretary on \ntheir unique safety needs.\n  Chairman Inhofe has been very helpful in trying to find the most \nappropriate way to get this accomplished. He suggested and I agreed to \nwork with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials--AASHTO, which is the organization that actually develops \nguidelines for highway safety engineering.\n  I recently received from AASHTO a letter describing a task force it \nhas developed to identify strategies that can be used to reduce \nmotorcycle fatalities and injuries. I believe this task force may be \nable to accomplish my goal of elevating the unique safety needs of \nmotorcyclists to greater attention by including both riders and outside \nexperts in its deliberations. As a result, I have decided not to offer \nan amendment to establish an advisory council at this time.\n  I believe that Chairman Inhofe has had an opportunity to look over \nthe AASHTO letter and I am wondering if he agrees with me that this \nwill accomplish what we have been working towards.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have read the AASHTO letter to Senator Murkowski and \nagree with her that the task force proposed by AASHTO will indeed \naccomplish what she seeks to achieve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from AASHTO \ndated February 3, 2004 to Senator Murkowski be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n           Officials,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2004.\n     Hon. Lisa A. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: It has been brought to our \n     attention that motorcycle safety issues are of great concern \n     to you and your constituents. As you know, motorcycle \n     fatalities have gone up dramatically in the past several \n     years, rising from 2,112 fatalities in 1997 to 3,244 in 2002. \n     The State transportation agencies share your commitment to \n     addressing this public safety problem.\n       Motorcycle riding has special needs and concerns. \n     Currently, the American Association of State Highway and \n     Transportation Officials (AASHTO), through the National \n     Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP), is developing \n     guidance for the State transportation departments on \n     motorcycle issues as part of the implementation of our \n     Strategic Highway Safety Plan. Part of this multi-million-\n     dollar research effort is focused on improving motorcycle \n     safety and increasing motorcycle awareness. Targeted areas in \n     which I understand you may share a strong interest include:\n       Increasing the awareness of motorcycles on the road through \n     a ``share-the-road with motorcycles'' campaign and stressing \n     the importance of motorcycle awareness information in driver \n     training courses, driver handbooks or manuals, and licensing \n     tests;\n\n[[Page S781]]\n\n       Expanding comprehensive motorcycle rider education and \n     skill testing in all States for novice riders; and\n       Reducing drinking and driving by motorcyclists through \n     alcohol awareness messages and targeted enforcement.\n       As part of this effort, a workshop is being planned for \n     June 2004 to identify strategies that can be used to reduce \n     motorcycle fatalities and injuries. You and/or your \n     constituents are welcome to participate in, and contribute \n     to, this workshop. The result of this research project will \n     be the development of a guide for highway officials on \n     practices than can improve safety for motorcyclists \n     throughout the transportation system.\n       Also as part of the implementation of our Strategic Highway \n     Safety Plan, ASSHTO has committed to the creation of a joint \n     task force to identify hazards/areas of concern to \n     motorcyclists, as well as highway practices that can help \n     minimize these concerns. Examples include the longitudinal \n     expansion joints on bridges, the slickness of material used \n     to fill asphalt pavement cracks, and the safety of various \n     types of guardrail including traditional steel W-beam \n     guardrail and the newer cable barriers. This joint task force \n     will consist of members from the State transportation \n     departments, the American Motorcyclist Association, the \n     Motorcycle Riders Foundation, the National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration, and the Federal Highway \n     Administration. Additional input may also be sought from \n     other noted experts in the areas of motorcycle and highway \n     safety both here and abroad. The information developed by \n     this special committee will be used as input into the \n     revision and update of the various AASHTO manuals and guides.\n       We are very pleased that you have an interest in this area \n     and we are committed to working with you over the next year \n     to ensure that these issues are addressed and that the \n     resulting recommendations are successfully implemented. \n     Please contact my office at (202) 624-5800 if you have any \n     questions regarding this information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John C. Horsley,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand that the Senator has also proposed creating \na new program to encourage improvements in the States' motorcycle \nsafety programs. I believe this amendment would be very valuable. I \nalso believe it would be most appropriate offered as part of the \nCommerce Committee title, and would like to be added as an original \ncosponsor of the amendment when that happens.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chairman for his assistance and will add \nhim as an original cosponsor when that amendment is offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

James\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a \nbrave young American who gave his life defending our Nation. I went to \nthe ceremony out at Arlington this morning for this young man. It was \none of the most moving experiences I have ever had. This man felt a \ncall to serve his country, to be a part of something bigger than \nhimself. For that call, he paid the highest price.\n  2LT Luke James of Hooker, OK, was a platoon leader in the 82nd \nAirborne's B Company, 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, \nstationed at Fort Bragg, NC. He is survived by his wife Molly and their \nlittle son Bradley who was born just 6 months ago. His parents Brad and \nArleen James live in Hooker, OK, where Luke played football at Hooker \nHigh School and graduated near the top of his class. Luke later \nattended and graduated from Oklahoma State University where he \nparticipated in the ROTC program and earned a degree in animal science.\n  While on a dismounted patrol, Luke was killed by a roadside bomb \nduring an ambush on January 27. He gave his life for the freedom of \nmillions of Americans and for the peace and future of the Iraqi people.\n  Lieutenant James had long imagined a life of service in the Army. He \nwas going to be career. These aspirations were realized culminating \nwith his commissioning into the airborne infantry on December of 2002. \nHis parents have described how Luke embodied the selfless attitude \ntoward service to country that is so evident in all of our military men \nand women.\n  On February 10, I had the opportunity to attend Lieutenant James' \nfuneral at Arlington National Cemetery. The ceremony honored Luke, and \ndeservedly so. In the words of Lieutenant James's mother, speaking of \nher son, she said:\n\n       We are very proud as his parents that he had the attitude \n     he had, and wanted to serve. . . . It wouldn't have been this \n     mother's choice, but you have to have young men and women \n     willing to preserve the freedom we have. We are glad he was \n     willing.\n\n  He was willing. We as a nation are grateful. The loss of 2LT Luke S. \nJames is grievous to all of us. Our thoughts are with his wife and son, \nas well as his family in Oklahoma.\n  Today we recognize his valor and commitment. It is for men like Luke \nJames I am proud to be a part of this great Nation. He was a special \nsoldier, a real Oklahoman, and a true American.\n  As we tour over there, and see these young warriors and their \nattitude and commitment and patriotism, it is so heartwarming. I am \nsure at one time or another I saw Luke, but I don't remember when that \nwas. But he is certainly typical, and his family, recognizing that he \nmade the supreme sacrifice, but he made it for us. He knew that risk \nwas there when he took on the position he held.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S781-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S781-S785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CASE OF MAHER ARAR\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very troubling case \nof rendition and alleged torture that became public last fall. This is \nthe case of Maher Arar, a Canadian and Syrian citizen, who was deported \nfrom the United States to Syria last year, who was held and \ninterrogated for months by the Syrians at the Bush administration's \nrequest, and who claims to have suffered torture while in custody \nthere.\n  Mr. Arar was stopped by immigration officers at John F. Kennedy \nInternational Airport in September 2002 as he attempted to change \nplanes on his way home to Canada from Tunisia. He claims that he was \ninterrogated by an FBI agent and a New York City police officer, and \nthat he was denied access to a lawyer. He further claims that he \nrepeatedly told U.S. officials that he feared he would be tortured if \ndeported to Syria. After being held for nearly two weeks in a federal \ndetention center in New York, Mr. Arar was transferred by U.S. \nauthorities to Syria. Arar claims that he was physically tortured \nduring the first two weeks of his detention in Syria, and that he was \nsubjected to severe psychological abuse over the following ten months, \nincluding being held in a grave-like cell and being forced to undergo \ninterrogation while hearing the screams of other prisoners.\n  Syria has a well-documented history of state-sponsored torture. In \nfact, President Bush stated on November 7, 2003, that Syria has left \n``a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and ruin'' to its people. \nStories like Mr. Arar's are appalling and, if true, seriously\n\n[[Page S782]]\n\ndamage our credibility as a responsible member of the international \ncommunity.\n  When unrelated allegations of rendition and possible breaches of the \nConvention Against Torture (``Torture Convention'') surfaced in the \nsummer of 2003, I wrote to administration officials asking for \nguarantees that the United States is complying with its obligations \nunder this Convention. I received a response from the General Counsel \nof the Department of Defense, William J. Haynes. His letter contained a \nwelcome commitment by the administration that it is the policy of the \nUnited States to comply with all of its legal obligations under the \nTorture Convention. I wrote to Mr. Haynes again for clarification on a \nnumber of points, such as how the administration reconciled this \nstatement of policy with reported acts of rendition and accusations of \nthe use of interrogation techniques rising to or near the level of \ntorture. After 2 months with no response, another letter, this one not \nfrom Haynes himself but from a subordinate, was delivered late at night \non the eve of Mr. Haynes' November 19, 2003 confirmation hearing for a \nseat on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. That letter was totally \nunresponsive to my questions.\n  Because Mr. Arar claims that he was interrogated by an FBI agent, I \nwrote to FBI Director Mueller on November 17, 2003 for more information \non the case. Later that week, when press accounts indicated that the \ndeportation of Mr. Arar was approved by the Department of Justice \n(``DOJ''), I wrote to Attorney General Ashcroft to ask a number of \nadditional questions. Neither of these letters has been answered.\n  Administration officials claim that the CIA received assurances from \nSyria that it would not torture Mr. Arar, and yet, spokesmen for DOJ \nhave not explained why they believed the Syrian assurances to be \ncredible. Nor have they explained inconsistencies in statements coming \nfrom officials at different agencies. Although the administration has \nofficially welcomed statements by the Syrian government that Mr. Arar \nwas not tortured, other unnamed officials have been quoted in the press \nas saying that, while in captivity in Syria, Mr. Arar confessed under \ntorture that he had gone to Afghanistan for terrorist training. I have \nasked DOJ to address that shocking contradiction and also to explain \nwhether the United States has investigated Syria's alleged non-\ncompliance with any assurances it provided to the U.S. government.\n  Whether or not Mr. Arar had ties to terrorist organizations, as is \nalleged by U.S. officials, or whether his confession was a false one \nproduced by coercion, as he claims, he was subject to the legal \nprotections provided by the Torture Convention, which the United States \nhas ratified.\n  Recently, the Canadian government announced a full inquiry into the \ndeportation of Mr. Arar to Syria and his alleged torture there. This \ninquiry will also examine the role played by Canadian officials in the \ncase to determine whether the Canadian government was complicit in the \nrendition of Mr. Arar. And just weeks ago, a non-profit organization, \nthe Center for Constitutional Rights, filed a constitutional and human \nrights case on behalf of Mr. Arar with the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of New York challenging the decision by federal \nofficials to deport him to Syria. As the Washington Post editorialized \non February 2, 2004, ``The government should be obliged to spell out \nhow this decision came to be made and why.''\n  I urge my colleagues to follow this Federal court case the Canadian \ninquiry closely. If the allegations by Mr. Arar are true, then our \ngovernment has much to answer for. The case has already damaged our \nstanding with foreign governments, many of which we have criticized in \nthe past for relying on torture in interrogations. If the U.S. is \n``subcontracting'' interrogation of terrorism suspects to nations that \nbend the rules on torture, it undermines our reputation as a Nation of \nlaws, it hurts our credibility in seeking to uphold human rights, and \nit invites others to use the same tactics.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letters I mentioned and the \nWashington Post editorial in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Post, February 2, 2004]\n\n                           Mr. Arar's Lawsuit\n\n       The Federal lawsuit filed last week by Maher Arar--the \n     Syrian-born Canadian whom the federal government deported to \n     Syria--offers a good opportunity to shed some light on one of \n     the more peculiar civil liberties cases to arise during the \n     war on terrorism. Mr. Arar and the U.S. government agree on \n     the barest outlines of his story: He was flying home from \n     Tunisia to Canada in the fall of 2002 on a path that took him \n     through New York. He had, however, been placed on the \n     terrorist watch list. When he presented his Canadian \n     passport, he was detained for more than a week and--despite \n     his pleas to be sent to Canada--was sent to Syria. There he \n     was held for 10 months until intervention by the Canadian \n     government secured his release.\n       That is where agreement ends. Mr. Arar denies any \n     connection to al Qaeda. He claims to have been savagely \n     tortured in his country of birth. And he alleges that he was \n     sent to Syria, rather than to Canada, precisely so that he \n     would be tortured--to be precise, ``so that Syrian \n     authorities would interrogate him in ways that [American \n     officials] believed themselves unable to do directly.'' All \n     of which, if true, would violate this country's international \n     treaty obligations, which prohibit turning someone over to a \n     government likely to mistreat that person. In Canada, Mr. \n     Arar's case has become a cause, cited as an example of \n     American arrogance and contempt for Canada's interests and \n     citizens.\n       The American government firmly--if vaguely--denies any \n     wrongdoing. It still claims that its information on Mr. Arar \n     was solid, though it refuses to release any of what it terms \n     ``sensitive national security information.'' Mr. Arar is a \n     member of al Qaeda, the Justice Department alleged in a \n     recent statement. Anonymous officials have been quoted in \n     press accounts saying that he was carrying a list of al Qaeda \n     operatives and that then-Deputy Attorney General Larry D. \n     Thompson signed an order certifying that returning Mr. Arar \n     to Canada would be ``prejudicial to the interests of the \n     United States.'' The department says that Mr. Arar's \n     deportation to Syria was ``fully within the law and \n     applicable international treaties and conventions.'' Far from \n     intending that Syria would torture him, in fact, the \n     department claims that it was ``provided with reliable \n     assurances that Mr. Arar would be treated humanely.''\n       There are two questions that we hope this litigation would \n     shed light upon. The first is whether Mr. Arar was, in fact, \n     a would-be-terrorist. The second is why he was sent to a \n     country known for abusing human rights, instead of being sent \n     to Canada or detained here as an enemy combatant. What was \n     the goal, if not to delegate to the Syrians torture that \n     American authorities cannot engage in? At the least, the \n     government should be obliged to spell out how this decision \n     came to be made and why.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2003.\n     Hon. Condoleezza Rice,\n     National Security Adviser, The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Dr. Rice: Over the past several months, unnamed \n     Administration officials have suggested in several press \n     accounts that detainees held by the United States in the war \n     on terrorism have been subjected to ``stress and duress'' \n     interrogation techniques, including beatings, lengthy sleep \n     and food deprivation, and being shackled in painful positions \n     for extended periods of time. Our understanding is that these \n     statements pertain in particular to interrogations conducted \n     by the Central Intelligence Agency in Afghanistan and other \n     locations outside the United States. Officials have also \n     stated that detainees have been transferred for interrogation \n     to governments that routinely torture prisoners.\n       These assertions have been reported extensively in the \n     international media in ways that could undermine the \n     credibility of American efforts to combat torture and promote \n     the rule of law, particularly in the Islamic world.\n       I appreciate President Bush's statement, during his recent \n     meeting with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Sergio \n     De Mello, that the United States does not, as a matter of \n     policy, practice torture. I also commend the Administration \n     for its willingness to meet with and respond to the concerns \n     of leading human rights organizations about reports of \n     mistreatment of detainees. At the same time, I believe the \n     Administration's response thus far, including in a recent \n     letter to Human Rights Watch from Department of Defense \n     General Counsel William Haynes, while helpful, leaves \n     important questions unanswered.\n       The Administration understandably does not wish to \n     catalogue the interrogation techniques used by U.S. personnel \n     in fighting international terrorism. But it should affirm \n     with clarity that America upholds in practice the laws that \n     prohibit the specific forms of mistreatment reported in \n     recent months. The need for a clear and thorough response \n     from the Administration is all the greater because reports of \n     mistreatment initially arose not from outside complaints, but \n     from statements made by administration officials themselves.\n       With that in mind, I would appreciate your answers to the \n     following questions:\n\n[[Page S783]]\n\n       First, Mr. Haynes' letter states that when questioning \n     enemy combatants, U.S. personnel are required to follow \n     ``applicable laws prohibiting torture.'' What are those laws? \n     Given that the United States has ratified the Convention \n     Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), is this Convention \n     one of those laws, and does it bind U.S. personnel both \n     inside and outside the United States?\n       Second, does the Administration accept that the United \n     States has a specific obligation under the CAT not to engage \n     in cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment?\n       Third, when the United States ratified the CAT, it entered \n     a reservation regarding its prohibition on cruel, inhuman and \n     degrading treatment, stating that it interprets this term to \n     mean ``the cruel, unusual and inhumane treatment or \n     punishment prohibited by the 5th, 8th, and/or 14th amendments \n     to the Constitution.'' Are all U.S. interrogations of enemy \n     combatants conducted in a manner consistent with this \n     reservation?\n       Fourth, in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights \n     Practices, the State Department has repeatedly condemned many \n     of the same ``stress and duress'' interrogation techniques \n     that U.S. personnel are alleged to have used in Afghanistan. \n     Can you confirm that the United States is not employing the \n     specific methods of interrogation that the State Department \n     has condemned in countries such as Egypt, Iran, Eritrea, \n     Libya, Jordan and Burma?\n       Fifth, the Defense Department acknowledged in March that it \n     was investigating the deaths from blunt force injury of two \n     detainees who were held at a Bagram air base in Afghanistan. \n     What is the status of that investigation and when do you \n     expect it to be completed? Has the Defense Department or the \n     CIA investigated any other allegations of torture or \n     mistreatment of detainees, and if so, with what result? What \n     steps would be taken if any U.S. personnel were found to have \n     engaged in unlawful conduct?\n       Finally, Mr. Haynes' letter offers a welcome clarification \n     that when detainees are transferred to other countries, \n     ``U.S. Government instructions are to seek and obtain \n     appropriate assurances that such enemy combatants are not \n     tortured.'' How does the administration follow up to \n     determine if these pledges of humane treatment are honored in \n     practice, particularly when the governments in question are \n     known to practice torture?\n       I believe these questions can be answered without revealing \n     sensitive information or in any way undermining the fight \n     against international terrorism. Defeating terrorism is a \n     national security priority, and no one questions the \n     imperative of subjecting captured terrorists to thorough and \n     aggressive interrogations consistent with the law.\n       The challenge is to carry on this fight while upholding the \n     values and laws that distinguish us from the enemy we are \n     fighting. As President Bush has said, America is not merely \n     struggling to defeat a terrible evil, but to uphold ``the \n     permanent rights and the hopes of mankind.'' I hope you agree \n     that clarity on this fundamental question of human rights and \n     human dignity is vital to that larger struggle.\n       Thank you for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            General Counsel of the\n\n\n                                        Department of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am writing in response to your June \n     2, 2003, letter to Dr. Rice raising a number of legal \n     questions regarding the treatment of detainees held by the \n     United States in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks \n     on the United States and in this Nation's war on terrorists \n     of global reach. We appreciate and fully share your concern \n     for ensuring that in the conduct of this war against a \n     ruthless and unprincipled foe, the United States does not \n     compromise its commitment to human rights in accordance with \n     the law.\n       In response to your specific inquiries, we can assure you \n     that it is the policy of the United States to comply with all \n     of its legal obligations in its treatment of detainees, and \n     in particular with legal obligations prohibiting torture. Its \n     obligations include conducting interrogations in a manner \n     that is consistent with the Convention Against Torture and \n     Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n     (``CAT'') as ratified by the United States in 1994. And it \n     includes compliance with the Federal anti-torture statute, 18 \n     U.S.C.. Sec. Sec. 2340-2340A, which Congress enacted to \n     fulfill U.S. obligations under the CAT. The United States \n     does not permit, tolerate or condone any such torture by its \n     employees under any circumstances.\n       Under Article 16 of the CAT, the United States also has an \n     obligation to ``undertake . . . to prevent other acts of \n     cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment which do \n     not amount to torture.'' As you noted, because the terms in \n     Article 16 are not defined, the United States ratified the \n     CAT with a reservation to this provision. This reservation \n     supplies an important definition for the term ``cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment.'' \n     Specifically, this reservation provides that ``the United \n     States considers itself bound by the obligation under article \n     16 to prevent, `cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \n     punishment' only in so far as the term `cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment or punishment' means the cruel, unusual \n     and inhumane treatment or punishment prohibited by the Fifth, \n     Eighth, and/or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of \n     the United States.'' United States policy is to treat all \n     detainees and conduct all interrogations, wherever they may \n     occur, in a manner consistent with this commitment.\n       As your letter stated, it would not be appropriate to \n     catalogue the interrogation techniques used by U.S. personnel \n     in fighting international terrorism, and thus we cannot \n     comment on specific cases or practices. We can assure you, \n     however, that credible allegations of illegal conduct by U.S. \n     personnel will be investigated and, as appropriate, reported \n     to proper authorities. In this connection, the Department of \n     Defense investigation into the deaths at Bagram, Afghanistan, \n     is still in progress. Should any investigation indicate that \n     illegal conduct has occurred, the appropriate authorities \n     would have a duty to take action to ensure that any \n     individuals responsible are held accountable in accordance \n     with the law.\n       With respect to Article 3 of the CAT, the United States \n     does not ``expel, return (`refouler') or extradite'' \n     individuals to other countries where the U.S. believes it is \n     ``more likely than not'' that they will be tortured. Should \n     an individual be transferred to another country to be held on \n     behalf of the United States, or should we otherwise deem it \n     appropriate, United States policy is to obtain specific \n     assurances from the receiving country that it will not \n     torture the individual being transferred to that country. We \n     can assure you that the United States would take steps to \n     investigate credible allegations of torture and take \n     appropriate action if there were reason to believe that those \n     assurances were not being honored.\n       In closing, I want to express my appreciation for your \n     thoughtful questions. We are committed to protecting the \n     people of this Nation as well as to upholding its fundamental \n     values under the law.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Haynes II.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2003.\n     William J. Haynes II,\n     General Counsel, Department of Defense,\n     Defense Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Haynes: Thank you for your June 25, 2003, letter \n     concerning U.S. policy with regard to the treatment of \n     detainees held by the United States.\n        I very much appreciate your clear statement that it is the \n     policy of the United States to comply with all of its legal \n     obligations under the Convention Against Torture and Other \n     Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). I \n     also welcome your statement that it is United States policy \n     to treat all detainees and conduct all interrogations, \n     wherever they may occur, in a manner consistent with our \n     government's obligation, under Article 16 of the CAT, ``to \n     prevent other acts of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment \n     or punishment'' as prohibited under the Fifth, Eighth, and \n     Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\n        This statement of policy rules out the use of many of the \n     ``stress and duress'' interrogation techniques that have been \n     alleged in press reports over the last several months, \n     including beatings, lengthy sleep and food deprivation, and \n     shackling detainees in painful positions for extended periods \n     of time. It should also go a long way towards answering \n     concerns that have been expressed by our friends overseas \n     about the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody. It should \n     strengthen our nation's ability to lead by example in the \n     protection of human rights around the world, and our ability \n     to protect Americans, including our service members, should \n     they be detained abroad.\n        At the same time, the ultimate credibility of this policy \n     will depend on its implementation by U.S. personnel around \n     the world. In that spirit, I would appreciate it if you could \n     clarify how the administration's policy to comply with the \n     CAT is communicated to those personnel directly involved in \n     detention and interrogation? As you note in your letter, the \n     U.S. obligation under Article 16 of the CAT is to ``undertake \n     . . . to prevent'' cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \n     punishment. What is the administration doing to prevent \n     violations? Have any recent directives regulations or general \n     orders been issued to implement the policy your June 25 \n     letter describes? If so, I would appreciate receiving a copy.\n       I understand that interrogations conducted by the U.S. \n     military are governed at least in part by Field Manual 34-52, \n     which prohibits ``the use of force, mental torture, threats, \n     insults, or exposure to unpleasant and inhumane treatment of \n     any kind.'' This field manual rightly stresses that ``the use \n     of force is a poor technique, as it yields unreliable \n     results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can \n     induce the source to say whatever he thinks the interrogator \n     wants to hear.'' Are there further guidelines that in any way \n     add to, define, or limit the prohibitions contained in this \n     field manual? What mechanisms exist for ensuring compliance \n     with these guidelines?\n        Most important, I hope you can assure me that \n     interrogators working for other agencies, including the CIA, \n     operate from the same guidelines as the Department of \n     Defense. If CIA or other interrogation guidelines in use by \n     any person working for or on behalf of the U.S. government \n     differ, could you clarify how, and why?\n\n[[Page S784]]\n\n        I am pleased that before handing over detainees for \n     interrogation to third countries, the United States obtains \n     specific assurances that they will not be tortured. I remain \n     concerned, however, that mere assurances from countries that \n     are known to practice torture systematically are not \n     sufficient. While you state that the United States would \n     follow up on any credible information that such detainees \n     have been mistreated, how would such information emerge if no \n     outsiders have access to these detainees? Has the \n     administration considered seeking assurances that an \n     organization such as the International Committee for the Red \n     Cross have access to detainees after they have been turned \n     over? If not, I urge you to do so.\n        Finally, has the administration followed up on specific \n     allegations reported in the press that such detainees may \n     have been tortured, including claims regarding a German \n     citizen sent to Syria in 2001, and statements by former CIA \n     official Vincent Cannistrano concerning an al-Qaeda detainee \n     sent from Guantanamo to Egypt (see enclosed articles)?\n        Thank you again for your response to my last letter.\n           With best regards,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                    Office of General Counsel,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2003.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: I am responding to your September 9, \n     2003 letter, which follows up on the June 25, 2003 letter \n     from Mr. Haynes concerning U.S. policy on the treatment of \n     detainees held by the United States in the war on terrorism. \n     The earlier letter to you and an April 2, 2003 letter to the \n     Executive Director of Human Rights Watch (enclosed) contain \n     precise statements of U.S. policy. As statements of U.S. \n     policy, they reflect the policy applicable to the Executive \n     Branch.\n       Your letter inquired about Department of Defense (DoD) \n     implementation of the policy described in the June 25 letter. \n     The Department takes its compliance with U.S. obligations \n     very seriously. For that reason, the Department has a Law of \n     War Program, which is governed by DoD directive 5100.77 \n     (December 9, 1998), a copy of which is enclosed. That \n     Directive, among other things, provides that it is DoD policy \n     to ensure that DoD components observe the law of war \n     obligations of the United States, and that those components \n     implement an effective program to prevent violations of the \n     law of war. Through the Law of War Program, the Department \n     seeks to prevent law of war violations through training and \n     by instructing DoD personnel about U.S. obligations, and \n     ensuring that qualified legal advisers are available at all \n     levels of command to provide advice on compliance with the \n     law of war.\n       Moreover, DoD personnel are instructed to report \n     allegations of mistreatment of or injuries to detained enemy \n     combatants through normal command channels for ultimate \n     transmission to appropriate authorities. Individual military \n     personnel bear a responsibility to ensure their compliance. \n     Commanding officers carry the additional responsibility to be \n     aware of and to direct the conduct of the men and women under \n     their command in order to, among other things, ensure their \n     compliance with U.S. obligations in matters such as the \n     treatment of those detained in an armed conflict. Although \n     our principal institutional focus is, as it should be, on \n     compliance with the law of war and avoiding and preventing \n     violations of it, DoD also has an effective military criminal \n     justice system for detecting, investigating, prosecuting, and \n     punishing misconduct by military personnel should it occur.\n       Your letter also asked whether follow-up had occurred \n     regarding allegations appearing in stories in the Washington \n     Post on January 31, 2003, in Newsday on February 6, 2003, and \n     in the Los Angeles Times on March 3, 2003. With respect to \n     the first story, it does not allege unlawful activity by any \n     U.S. official because participation in questioning abroad and \n     knowledge of transfers to third countries, without more, do \n     not contravene the law. With respect to the second story, the \n     allegations of improper treatment it contains are by an \n     individual who has not been a Central Intelligence Agency \n     employee since well before 2001. With respect to the final \n     story, the unnamed sources are quoted as saying that they did \n     not know details, but they nevertheless then speculated about \n     what was happening. To the extent that it might be possible \n     to construe the latter two stories as containing allegations \n     about the treatment of individuals while outside military \n     control, I understand that the Office of the Director of \n     Central Intelligence (DCI) has copies of these articles and \n     is responsible for appropriate action.\n       Please allow me to emphasize that press stories often \n     contain allegations that are untrue, and that my mention of \n     the office of the DCI indicates nothing concerning the merits \n     of those allegations and it does not express a view \n     concerning what action might be appropriate.\n       I appreciate very much the opportunity to address your \n     concerns. The Administration is committed to carrying out the \n     law as we continue our dedicated efforts to protect Americans \n     from terrorism.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Daniel J. Dell'Orto,\n     Principal Deputy General Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2003.\n     Hon. Robert S. Mueller,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Mueller: I am writing to inquire about the \n     role the FBI may have played in the extraordinary rendition \n     of Maher Arar, a Canadian and Syrian citizen, from the United \n     States to Syria last year.\n       Press reports indicate that Mr. Arar was stopped by \n     immigration officers at John F. Kennedy International Airport \n     as he attempted to change planes on his way home to Canada \n     from Tunisia. Mr. Arar claims that he was then interrogated \n     by an FBI agent and a New York City police officer. He \n     further claims that, ``They told me I had no right to a \n     lawyer because I was not an American citizen,'' and that he \n     repeatedly told U.S. officials that he feared he would be \n     tortured if returned to Syria. ``Deported Terror Suspect \n     Details Torture in Syria,'' Washington Post, November 5, \n     2003. After being held for nearly two weeks in a federal \n     detention center, Mr. Arar alleges that he was then handed \n     over to U.S. intelligence officials who flew him to Jordan \n     and turned him over to Jordanian authorities, who beat him. \n     He was then taken to Syria, where he was detained and \n     allegedly tortured over a period of ten months.\n       While the Bush administration officially denies engaging in \n     extraordinary renditions of this sort, numerous unnamed \n     intelligence officials have admitted to the press that \n     renditions have occurred, purportedly under a ``secret \n     rendition policy.'' Id. This policy was described as ``a \n     secret presidential `finding' authorizing the CIA to place \n     suspects in foreign hands without due process.'' Id.\n       I find Mr. Arar's claims and the underlying rendition \n     policy deeply troubling and would like information on the \n     role of the FBI, if any, in this case.\n       1. Under what specific authority was Mr. Arar detained, \n     first at the airport and then at the federal detention center \n     in Brooklyn?\n       2. Is it true that one or more FBI agents interrogated Mr. \n     Arar after he was detained by immigration officers at JFK \n     airport?\n       3. If so, is it true that Mr. Arar was denied access to \n     counsel?\n       4. Did the FBI participate in any manner in the transfer of \n     Mr. Arar to Washington, D.C., Jordan, Syria, or to any other \n     location?\n       5. An intelligence official is quoted in the Washington \n     Post story as saying, ``The Justice Department did not have \n     enough evidence to detain him when he landed in the United \n     States.'' If this is true and if, as has also been reported \n     in the press, U.S. officials were in contact with Canadian \n     authorities, why did the FBI and/or other officials choose \n     not to turn Arar over to Canadian authorities?\n       6. In a June 25, 2003, letter to me on the subject of \n     rendition and other matters, the U.S. Defense Department \n     General Counsel, William Haynes, stated that the ``United \n     States policy is to obtain specific assurances from the \n     receiving country that it will not torture the individual \n     being transferred to that country.'' Did the United States \n     seek assurances from Jordan and/or Syria that Mr. Arar would \n     not be subject to torture, or to cruel, or inhuman, or \n     degrading treatment or punishment while in the custody of \n     either nation? If so, what steps did the United States take \n     after his rendition to assess compliance with such assurances \n     in this case? Were the assurances provided in writing? If so, \n     please provide a copy to the Committee. If such a document is \n     classified, please arrange for cleared staff to view it. If \n     no assurances were obtained, please explain why not.\n       7. Under U.S. law, non-citizens who express concerns about \n     torture if removed are entitled to an evaluation of their \n     claim before being removed. Under the specific regulations \n     that were likely applied to Mr. Arar's removal, there is an \n     explicit prohibition against returning someone to a country \n     where there are substantial grounds for believing he would be \n     subjected to torture. What process was used, if any, to \n     evaluate the likelihood that Mr. Arar would be subjected to \n     torture before removing him to Syria?\n       8.

John Ashcroft,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: I am writing to inquire \n     about the rendition of Maher Arar, a Canadian and Syrian \n     citizen, from the United States to Syria last year.\n       I wrote to FBI Director Robert Mueller about this case on \n     Monday, November 17. (See attached). Since that time, \n     additional\n\n[[Page S785]]\n\n     information on this case has been provided to the press, \n     mainly in statements by unnamed administration officials, but \n     also by Department of Justice (DOJ) spokespersons.\n       Washington Post articles indicate that the deportation of \n     Mr. Arar was approved on October 7, 2002, by then-Deputy \n     Attorney General Larry Thompson, who signed the order in his \n     capacity as Acting Attorney General. ``Man Was Deported After \n     Syrian Assurances,'' Washington Post, November 20, 2003 \n     [hereinafter Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2003]; ``Top Justice \n     Aide Approved Sending Suspect to Syria,'' Washington Post, \n     November 19, 2003. The same story states that U.S. officials \n     ``decided to send [Arar] to Syria last year only after the \n     CIA received assurances from Syria that it would not torture \n     the man.'' Washington Post, Nov. 20, 2003. And yet, \n     ``spokesmen at the Department of Justice declined to comment \n     on why they believed the Syrian assurances to be credible.'' \n     Id.\n       Mr. Arar claims that he was, in fact, tortured while in \n     Syrian custody. The Syrian government has denied that Arar \n     was subjected to torture, but statements from U.S. officials \n     contradict that assertion. In a November 15 New York Times \n     article, ``American officials who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity,'' were quoted as saying that Arar ``confessed \n     under torture in Syria that he had gone to Afghanistan for \n     terrorist training, named his instructors and gave other \n     intimate details.'' ``Qaeda Pawn, U.S. Calls Him. Victim, He \n     Calls Himself,'' New York Times, November 15, 2003 (emphasis \n     added). I find this statement to be shocking in light of the \n     administration's assertions that it acted within the scope of \n     its international treaty obligations.\n       Mr. Arar claims to have stated repeatedly to his U.S. \n     interrogators that he feared torture at the hands of the \n     Syrian government. Whether or not Mr. Arar had ties to \n     terrorist organizations, as is alleged by U.S. officials, or \n     whether his confession was a false one produced by coercion, \n     as he claims, he was subject to the legal protections \n     provided by the Convention Against Torture, which the United \n     States has ratified.\n       The statements by Mr. Arar and the unnamed sources in the \n     New York Times article cited above beg the question of \n     whether the United States has investigated Syria's alleged \n     non-compliance with any assurances it provided to the U.S. \n     government. This question is especially critical in light of \n     President Bush's statement on November 7, 2003, that Syria \n     has left ``a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and \n     ruin'' to its people.\n       In light of the above facts and assertions, I request that \n     you provide detailed answers to the following questions:\n       1. Under what specific authority was Mr. Arar detained, \n     first at John F. Kennedy Airport and then at the federal \n     detention center in Brooklyn, New York?\n       2. Is it true that Mr. Arar was denied access to counsel, \n     as he claims?\n       3. An intelligence official is quoted in a November 5 \n     Washington Post story as saying, ``The Justice Department did \n     not have enough evidence to detain him when he landed in the \n     United States.'' ``Deported Terror Suspect Details Torture in \n     Syria,'' Washington Post, November 5, 2003. It has also been \n     reported that U.S. officials were in contact with Canadian \n     authorities regarding this case. Given that Mr. Arar, a \n     Canadian citizen, resides in Canada and was traveling home to \n     Canada when he was detained at the airport, why did the \n     officials choose not to turn Arar over to Canadian \n     authorities?\n       4. Did you become aware of Mr. Arar's case at any point \n     between his detention on September 26, 2002, and October 7, \n     2002, the date the deportation order was signed by Mr. \n     Thompson? Did Mr. Thompson, who was serving as Acting \n     Attorney General when he signed the order, consult with you \n     before signing the order? Did you approve this action?\n       5. In a June 25, 2003, letter to me on the subject of \n     rendition and other matters, the U.S. Defense Department \n     General Counsel, William Haynes, stated that the ``United \n     States policy is to obtain specific assurances from the \n     receiving country that it will not torture the individual \n     being transferred to that country.'' The November 20 \n     Washington Post article cited above confirms that assurances \n     were obtained from Syria. What was the scope of such \n     assurances? Were they provided to the U.S. government in \n     writing? If so, please provide a copy to the Committee. If \n     such a document is classified, please arrange for cleared \n     staff to view it. If the assurances were not provided in \n     writing, please explain why written assurances were not \n     sought or provided.\n       6. What steps did the United States after Arar's rendition \n     to assess compliance with the assurances provided by Syria in \n     this case?\n       7. Is the statement of an unnamed official above that Arar \n     ``confessed under torture'' accurate? If so, then Syria's \n     actions violated the assurances provided to the U.S. before \n     Arar's rendition. What has the U.S. done (a) to investigate \n     such non-compliance and (b) to hold Syria accountable for \n     such violations.\n       8. Under U.S. law, non-citizens who express concerns about \n     torture if removed are entitled to an evaluation of their \n     claim before being removed. Under the specific regulations \n     that were likely applied to Mr. Arar's removal, there is an \n     explicit prohibition against returning someone to a country \n     where there are substantial grounds for believing he would be \n     subject to torture. What process was used, if any, to \n     evaluate the likelihood that Mr. Arar would be subjected to \n     torture before removing him to Syria?\n       9. According to the November 5 Washington Post article \n     cited in question 3, numerous unnamed intelligence officials \n     have admitted to the press that renditions have occurred, \n     purportedly under a ``secret rendition policy.'' This policy \n     was described as ``a secret presidential `finding' \n     authorizing the CIA to place suspects in foreign hands \n     without due process.'' Are you aware of a ``secret \n     presidential `finding' authorizing the CIA to place suspects \n     in foreign hands without due process''? If so, please provide \n     a copy to the Committee. If such a document is classified, \n     please arrange for cleared staff to view it.\n       10. Has the FBI or DOJ authorized or participated in any \n     other alleged renditions, including interviewing and then \n     handing suspects over to intelligence officers for transfer \n     to another country?\n       11. In its effort to fight terrorism, the administration \n     has focused on individuals who have connections to Al Qaeda \n     that need to be further explored, and has argued that it has \n     the right to detain and interrogate prisoners in Guantanamo \n     Bay, perhaps as unlawful combatants or enemy combatants, as \n     long ``as it is necessary to help win the war against the Al \n     Qaeda network and its allies.'' Washington Post, ```High \n     Court Will Hear Appeals From Guantanamo Prisoners,'' November \n     11, 2003. Notwithstanding my concerns about the legal status \n     of those detained at Guantanamo, and the administration's \n     treatment of enemy combatants in general, it would seem that \n     Mr. Arar fit the classic administration profile for someone \n     who should be detained in Guantanamo. Presumably, Mr. Arar \n     would have been safer in detention at Guantanamo Bay than in \n     Syria.\n       a. Was the option to detain Arar as an enemy combatant in \n     Guantanamo Bay considered and rejected in favor of rendition \n     to Syria? If so, on what basis was the decision made to send \n     him to Syria?\n       b. Where there is more than one destination country to \n     which detainees may be rendered, do you believe there should \n     be a policy to render detainees to the country where torture \n     is least likely (e.g., a country that does not have a history \n     of documented humanitarian abuses)?\n       c. What is the standard applied by the administration in \n     determining whether to deport an individual, transfer the \n     individual to custody at Guantanamo Bay, or to charge the \n     individual with a crime?\n       Thank you for your prompt answers to these questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S785-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, a bill that would \nadd new categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  One such crime occurred in Passaic, NJ, in August, 1999. Kareem \nWashington, a gay man who sometimes dressed in women's clothing, was \nstabbed multiple times and left to die in an industrial area in \nPassaic. Police were unsure of the motive for the murder, however, the \nvictim's wallet was found on his body. The victim was wearing a skirt, \nhigh-heeled shoes and stockings at the time he was killed.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S785-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S785-S786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR LOUIE B. NUNN\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nremember Gov. Louie B. Nunn of Versailles, KY, who passed away \nThursday, February 5, 2004. Louie was elected Governor of Kentucky in \n1967 and was a pillar of strength in the Republican Party for half a \ncentury.\n  Looking back through the history of the Commonwealth, I can say that \nhe was truly the education Governor. Louie was a champion of the \neducation system in Kentucky. He raised the standards of education for \nall, but focused his efforts on those people who too often fell through \nthe cracks in the system.\n  He also was an advocate for mental health issues. People used to put \nanyone with a mental health problem in a shoebox and write them off, \nbut Louie\n\n[[Page S786]]\n\nsaw that was wrong and got in there to fix the problem. He made it a \npriority and he cleaned it up.\n  He earned the title of Governor with a quick wit, a sharp political \neye, and a gift for speaking. Louie could tell these fantastic stories \nand everyone would love them, captured by his words.\n  I have always admired his love of politics and that he always stayed \ncommitted to the Republican Party. I know he was proud to see the \nRepublican Party win back the governorship, ending the 32-year drought \nsince he held office in 1971. But I remember Louie for supporting his \nparty in Kentucky through its successes and through its failures. Even \nwhen there was no one around to join him, he carried the Republican \nbanner proudly.\n  And through his perseverance, he left a lasting legacy in Kentucky \npolitics. More than any other person, he taught the people in Kentucky \nhow to win elections and with that, he taught Republicans how to win \nstatewide. He used to tell the story about his father, who was a \nprecinct captain in Kentucky. Every election, his father would work as \nhard as he could and talk with voters one by one. And every election, \nthey would win his precinct. Louie taught us that is how you won an \nelection, one precinct at a time.\n  Gov. Louie Nunn was respected by his friends and colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle. All in the Commonwealth of Kentucky will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S786-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FREE TRADE AGREEMENT STRATEGY SHOULD PRIORITIZE JOBS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about our \ninternational trade policy--specifically this administration's \nselection of free trade agreements.\n  A year-and-a-half ago, many of us stood on this floor arguing that we \nshould grant the President trade negotiating authority, or fast track. \nWe did so because we believe that good trade agreements can create jobs \nfor American workers and farmers.\n  I still believe that. And I believe we must move ahead with an \naggressive trade agenda--even in an election year.\n  So what does that mean? Of course, our first priorities should be \nmoving ahead with negotiations in the World Trade Organization and \ncompleting the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Those agreements \nprovide--by far--the best opportunities for American workers and \nfarmers.\n  Unfortunately, both of those agreements are languishing. WTO \nnegotiations broke down last fall in Cancun. And the FTAA has been \nwatered down so much that many are starting to question its value.\n  The administration, rightly, has chosen not to put all of its eggs in \none basket. They have, over the last several years, initiated a number \nof new free trade agreements.\n  Now generally, I support this approach. We cannot allow the \nintransigence of some countries to hold us back from seeking new \nmarkets.\n  But the process by which we select new FTAs is deeply flawed. \nInitially, there was no process at all. There was no consultation with \nCongress, no public process, no criteria. To be fair, there's been some \nimprovement--but not much, and only after serious criticism from \nCongress and the business community.\n  Mr. President, as a way to try to understand the administration's \ntrade policy, Congressman Cal Dooley and I asked the General Accounting \nOffice to assess the criteria and processes that drive the selection of \nour free trade agreement partners.\n  Today, GAO is releasing their report, and its findings confirm a \nnumber of serious concerns.\n  First, the criteria themselves are so broad I question whether they \nare meaningful. GAO finds that the criteria used within the \nadministration to justify the selection of FTA partners have been a \nmoving target. Different sets of criteria were used, for example, when \ndeciding to go forward with the Central American and Australian FTAs \nthan were used for some of the most recently announced FTAs, such as \nThailand, the Andeans, and Panama.\n  Whatever the criteria considered, they are not weighted by \nimportance. Moreover, the criteria are so broad--and their \nconsideration so open-ended--it is hard to imagine any country in the \nworld that couldn't meet them.\n  Second, to the extent that the existing criteria and review process \nset priorities, I question whether they are the right ones. GAO finds \nthat strategic and foreign policy goals dominate the FTA selection \nprocess.\n  In my view, this takes our trade policy down the wrong path. I have \nlong believed that trade agreements should be pursued on their own \nmerits--because they create commercial opportunities for our farmers \nand businesses, and most critically, because they hold out the prospect \nof more and better-paying jobs for American workers.\n  These paramount concerns seem largely lost in the selection process, \nwhich looks like more of a throw-back to the Cold War--when trade \npolicy was treated primarily as an instrument of foreign policy.\n  Third, the entire selection process is woefully lacking in \ntransparency and public participation. GAO finds that, at the time this \nreport was requested, there was virtually no formal process at all for \nselecting FTAs.\n  The attention focused on this situation by this investigation has \nclearly contributed to the development of a more formal interagency \nprocess for considering potential FTAs. But the process is still a \nclosed one.\n  There is no notice of countries under consideration for future FTAs \nuntil the choice has already been made. There is no formal process for \nsoliciting the views of Congress, the business community, or the \ngeneral public. There is no formal public discussion of how to \nprioritize negotiating resources.\n  To my surprise, in fact, the administration has insisted until \nrecently that the selection criteria themselves are classified. \nImportant trade policy decisions like these should not be made in \nsecret based on secret criteria.\n  Mr. President, at a time when manufacturing and other jobs are \nincreasingly moving offshore, we need a trade policy that helps U.S. \ncompanies create and keep good jobs in this country. We need to bring \nthe focus of our trade agenda back to commercial benefits and, most \nimportantly, to jobs. We need to have a public dialogue on how choices \nare made and how resources are allocated. I urge the administration to \nengage with Congress to address the issues raised by this report.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S786-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S786-S787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RECOGNITION OF ANNIE LEE COONEY ON HER 100TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today with the distinct \nprivilege of recognizing one of St. Louis's most outstanding citizens, \nMrs. Annie Lee Cooney on the occasion of her 100th birthday February \n25, 2004.\n  Mrs. Cooney was born in Indianola, MS, as the third youngest of seven \ngirls and two brothers. As the granddaughter of slaves and the daughter \nof active participants in the African-American community, Annie Lee was \ninstilled at an early age with values and character that remain strong \nto this day. Her parents, Indiana and Oliver Jarman were active in the \nAfrican-American community in her home town. Her father, Oliver Jarman, \nwas a high ranking official in the Prince Hall Masons in Mississippi \nand was also instrumental in founding a Penny Bank in Greenville, MS.\n  In 1922, after attending the Tuskeegee Institute, in Tuskeegee, AL, \nAnnie Lee moved to St. Louis to live with her sister and helped with \nher new baby. But it was in St. Louis where Annie Lee's life changed \nwhen she met and fell in love with Roy Cooney. The young couple were \nmarried in 1924 and Roy and Annie Lee Cooney soon became the loving \nparents to thirteen children--seven girls and six boys, all of whom \nwent on to attend college.\n  Mrs. Cooney has been very active in the Black Catholic Community in \nSt. Louis since the early 1930s. Some of Mrs. Cooney's professional \nachievements include being named President of the Sisters of the \nBlessed Sacrament alumni in the 1960s and Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority \nMother of the Year in 1980. Mrs. Cooney has been an active member of \nthe National Council of Negro Women, the Council of Catholic Women, the \nLegion of Mary, the Catholic Knights of America, the Cairo Social Club, \ncharitable works and scholarships to Black youth, and the Seminarians \nClub, spiritual and financial\n\n[[Page S787]]\n\naid to Black Catholic Seminarians. She was also a member of the Cook \nAvenue Block Unit Association, and a strong force in her neighborhood--\nwith her home often serving as a gathering place for youth and young \nadults. Perhaps Mrs. Cooney's greatest display of goodwill was in her \nfrequent visits to Homer G. Phillips Hospital with the Helpers of the \nHoly Souls. For over forty years Mrs. Cooney visited the sick and \nhospitalized and would provide them with candy, toiletries, and prayer.\n  Mrs. Cooney has traveled the world extensively, and has brought \ngoodwill to wherever she has been. She has remained true to her motto: \n``If I can help somebody as I travel on, then my living will not be in \nvain.'' On behalf of the people of St. Louis and the State of Missouri, \nI extend my most sincere gratitude to Mrs. Annie Lee Cooney for her \nyears of dedicated community service and the goodwill. I wish her all \nthe best on this most important occasion, her one-hundredth \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S787-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                REMEMBERING ELROY ``CRAZY LEGS'' HIRSCH\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I honor an incredible \nathlete and a hero of University of Wisconsin athletics, Elroy ``Crazy \nLegs'' Hirsch.\n  Not many Wisconsin Badger fans can forget the 1942 football season, \nthe only season ``Crazy Legs'' spent playing for the University of \nWisconsin football team. By running, passing, and catching for over \n1,400 yards, the Wausau-born Hirsch led the Badgers to a second-place \nfinish in the Big Ten with an 8-1-1 record and a No. 3 ranking in the \nfinal Associated Press poll.\n  Hirsch's football career at Wisconsin was cut short when he joined \nthe Marines and was ordered to Michigan for basic training in 1943. \nHirsch continued his illustrious career at the University of Michigan \nand then professionally with the Chicago Rockets of the All-American \nFootball Conference and then the Los Angeles Rams of the NFL. Hirsch \nwas instrumental in the Rams' 1951 championship season by leading the \nleague in catches, receiving yards and receiving touchdowns. Hirsch was \ninducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in 1968.\n  Hirsch's on-field legacy will forever be remembered, as his number 40 \nis one of only 4 numbers that has been retired by the Badgers. But his \nlegacy off the field at the University of Wisconsin was just as \nimportant. He served as athletic director from 1969 to 1987. His tenure \nsaw a rise in football attendance and a hockey program that reached \nnational prominence.\n  The University of Wisconsin and fans from all over the State will be \nforever grateful for Elroy's devotion to UW athletics. My thoughts go \nout to his wife Ruth and his family. ``Crazy Legs'' was a tremendous \nasset to the University of Wisconsin, both on and off the field, and he \nwill be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S787-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ELLEN KAY YORK, U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the exemplary \ncareer of Ellen Kay York, who retired in January after 28 years of \npublic service and returning to her home in St. Robert, MO.\n  Since November 2000, Ellen has served as the executive secretary to \nthe Army's Chief of Engineers and Commander of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers. As the senior office manager for the Executive Office, Ellen \nhas been a valuable member of the Corps' team. In addition to her \noutstanding management of the Chief of Engineers' schedule, \ncorrespondence, and daily office operations, Ellen responded to a \nvariety of requests for information from the public and the Congress, \nproviding answers and information on behalf of the Chief of Engineers. \nHer skill and sensitivity have gained the respect, gratitude, and \nconfidence of the senior leaders throughout the worldwide, 36,000-\nperson organization.\n  Throughout her tenure with the Corps, Ellen Kay York has been a \nmentor to junior employees, spending countless hours and personal time \nto advise and counsel them. She has been active as well with \nToastmasters International, as the Area 13 governor and as the \npresident of the Corps' chapter, the Castle Toastmasters.\n  I know that the team at the Corps will miss her, particularly the so-\ncalled superior officers.

KING\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncommend a remarkable Iowan. COL Robert C. King retired from his duties \nas Public Affairs Officer for the Iowa National Guard in December 2003 \nand will retire from the National Guard at the end of the year. Colonel \nKing has been a member of the Iowa National Guard since 1968 and has \nworked tirelessly to break new ground in the area of communication \nbetween the Iowa National Guard and outside media outlets. It goes \nwithout saying, his service is appreciated beyond words.\n  In his job as Public Affairs Officer, Colonel King cultivated a media \nrelationship with the National Guard when none existed before. He \nserved during some of the highest profile activities since World War II \nincluding the crash of United Flight 232, Operations Desert Shield and \nDesert Storm, the floods of 1993, as well as Operation Enduring Freedom \nand Operation Iraqi Freedom. Colonel King has represented the Iowa \nNational Guard and its thousands of members at a variety of functions \nthroughout the State. He has held several command-directed assignments \nand served as the commander of the State Area Readiness Command in \naddition to his role as Public Affairs Officer. He handled this dual \nassignment with remarkable ease and showed his dedication through his \nwillingness to take on such a committed role. While under his command, \nthe Iowa National Guard Headquarters received Superior Unit Awards \nevery year. Colonel King served as the 34th Rear Area Operations Center \ntraining administrator and executive officer. Colonel King also served \nas the administrative-supply technician for the 186th Military Police \nCompany. He has been a valuable connection for me personally, providing \ninformation for me to stay abreast of what is going on with the Iowa \nNational Guard. I am proud of Colonel King and the contributions he has \nmade to Iowa. He tapped previously underutilized or noticeably absent \navenues within the media relations field for the Iowa National Guard. \nHis devotion to the soldier, the National Guard, Iowa and this country \nis beyond reproach.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate Colonel King on his retirement as \nPublic Affairs Officer for the Iowa National Guard. He has proven to be \na remarkable officer and I thank him for his inexhaustible dedication \nto Iowa and to America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S787-4", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S787-S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING SANDPOINT, IDAHO AS A SUNSET MAGAZINE ``BEST SMALL TOWN''\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, Idaho is known as the Gem State. I \nrise today to recognize a diamond among our community gems that has \ngained the attention of Sunset magazine. Every year, Sunset selects a \ngroup of neighborhoods, cities, and towns which readers have nominated \nas ``best places to live.'' I am proud to say that Sandpoint, ID, a \nsmall community in the panhandle has earned the distinction of ``Best \nSmall Town'' in January 2004.\n  Sandpoint sits tucked away in the Selkirk Mountain Range, \napproximately 50 miles south of the Canadian border. It borders Lake \nPend Oreille, the largest freshwater lake in Idaho, and is 9 miles from \nthe well-known ski resort, Schweitzer Basin. Sandpoint is a diverse \ncommunity of about 7,500 people who have occupations ranging from \nretail businessperson, logger, doctor, attorney, vintner, millworker, \nherbalist, teacher, and builder. Tourism, timber, and a thriving arts \ncommunity call attention to the complexity and wonderful character of \nSandpoint.\n  This honor bestowed by the readers of Sunset magazine indicates the \nefforts Sandpoint residents have made to work together to create a \nwarm, inviting community which upholds values of\n\n[[Page S788]]\n\nfamily and prioritizes preservation of the incredible natural beauty \nthat surrounds this precious gem of Idaho. I commend the community and \nits leaders for their continuing commitment to making Sandpoint ``the \nbest.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S788-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNIZING LAKE CASCADE, IDAHO AS A WASHINGTON POST 2004 TRAVEL ``HOT \n                                 SPOT''\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an up-and-\ncoming resort community in my home State of Idaho. The Washington Post \nTravel Section recently chose the Top Ten domestic travel ``Hot Spots'' \nfor 2004. Lake Cascade, ID was one of the destinations selected. With \nthe construction of the first ski, golf, and lake resort in the Nation \nin over 20 years, the Tamarack, Lake Cascade is poised to join the \nranks of Idaho's nationally renowned resort communities.\n   Lake Cascade will gain valuable jobs, nationwide notoriety, and \nwelcome economic growth from the Tamarack. I commend the business and \ncommunity leaders for their commitment to rural development. Lake \nCascade is the gateway to the Frank Church Wilderness Area, a place of \nstunning beauty, largely undisturbed by man. The town has a wonderful \nhistory as a playground for outdoor enthusiasts of all types, and draws \nvisitors from many places. I look forward to watching this burgeoning \nIdaho community as it embarks on a new chapter in its history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S788-2", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN MEMORIAM OF JOHN ``JACK'' BURRIS\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a moment \nto reflect on the life of Mr. John ``Jack'' Burris upon his passing \nlate last month. Jack was a good friend and a man who made remarkable \ncontributions to our State. He was a truly selfless man with a kind \nheart, diverse interests, great abilities and boundless energy.\n  Jack was born in Lincoln City, now part of Milford, DE, to the late \nJohn W. and Edna Vaughn Burris. After graduating from the Peddie School \nin Hightstown, NJ in 1938, he went on to study at the University of \nPennsylvania in 1942.\n  After serving his country in World War II as a member of the United \nStates Marine Corps, Jack returned to Delaware and began farming for \nseveral years. He then founded the Burris Poultry Business, which \noperated from 1948 until it was sold in 1971, at which time he founded \nBurris Logistics, a frozen-food warehousing and distribution company, \nwhich he ran until last year.\n  Jack was an uncommonly active member of his community, serving on \ncountless boards and committees. He was a member of the Executive \nCommittee of the Wilmington Trust Co. and was chairman of its Kent \nCounty Advisory Board. For 19 years, Jack was director of the \nBrandywine Fund. He contributed generously of his time and energies to \ncommunity, educational and service organizations.\n  For 35 years, he served on the Milford Memorial Hospital Board. \nDuring a portion of that time, he was the board's chairman. More \nrecently, Jack was a member of the Bayhealth Foundation board. Annually \nfor 37 years, he and his family cooked the chicken dinners for the \nMilford Hospital Fair to help support the community's hospital. For 19 \nyears, he served as chairman of the State Integrity Commission and in \n2000, he co-chaired--at my request--the committee that raised funds to \nremodel the State Archives Building and transform in into a state-of-\nthe-art facility.\n  One of Jack's greatest joys, however, was supporting the efforts of \nthe United Way in our State. For more than 20 years, he actively \nparticipated in Kent and Sussex Counties' United Way campaigns, serving \nas chairman for many years. Jack and his wife, Lillian, were honored as \nexceptional volunteers, receiving the United Way's Alexis de \nTocqueville Society Award. He was also a charter member of the Milford \nLions Club.\n  From 1976 to 1992, Jack was a trustee of the University of Delaware \nand co-chair of the search committee that recommended Dr. David Roselle \nas president. In 1992, he received a Doctor of Humane Letters from the \nUniversity of Delaware and also served that same year on the \nAgriculture Advisory Committee of the University of Delaware Board of \nTrustees, as well as a trustees emeritus.\n  For more than 30 years, he was an active member of the Avenue United \nMethodist Church in Milford, where he served on the administrative \nboard and was the Pastor-Parish Committee chairman for 18 years.\n  In 1998, Jack was inducted into the National Frozen Food Industries \nHall of Fame. The Baltimore and Washington Frozen Food Association in \n1993 and 1994 honored him as Man of the Year. He was inducted into the \nDelaware Business Leaders Hall of Fame and twice, with his wife, \nLillian Marshall Burris, was named as Outstanding Citizen of the Year \nby the Milford Chamber of Commerce. One of his greatest honors was \nreceiving the Josiah Marvel Cup award from the Delaware State Chamber \nof Commerce in 1993.\n  Jack Burris also has received many prestigious awards for his \ndedication and service. Among them are the Dover Colonial Rotary's Paul \nHarris Service Award, the Lions International Melvin Jones Award for \nDedicated Humanitarian Services, the Delmarva Poultry Citizen of the \nYear and Del-Mar-Va Boy Scout Council's Citizen of the Year.\n  Jack leaves behind his wife of 61 years Lillian, a remarkable woman \nin her own right, as well as four children, twelve grandchildren, three \nstep-grandchildren, and twelve great-grandchildren. He also leaves \nbehind a legion of friends, colleagues and several generations of \nDelawareans who are living more fulfilling, satisfying lives today \nbecause of Jack's extraordinary contributions.\n  Jack Burris' legacy will live on in the lives of those he helped to \nshape and in the hearts of those who were lucky enough to call him \ntheir friend. I rise today to commemorate Jack's life, to celebrate his \nlife, and to offer his family our heartfelt thanks for sharing this \nremarkable human being with all of us. Jack embodied the best of \nDelaware. He was one of a kind. He will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S788-3", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 2061.

Scott \n     Speicher, United States Navy, MIA-Captured. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this memorial be dispatched to the \n     President of the United States, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, and to each member of the Florida \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-342. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the Fair \n     Credit Reporting Act; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \n     and Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 183\n\n        Whereas, while the advantages of technology have brought \n     consumers and businesses numerous benefits, our information \n     age has also greatly increased the threat of identity theft. \n     Although this issue is clearly not a new concern, the extent \n     to which people are vulnerable to this crime has multiplied \n     in recent years; and\n        Whereas, in many ways, protections for consumers have not \n     kept pace. Public and private institutions have taken strong \n     actions to try to safeguard their customers, but identity \n     theft continues to increase. Identity theft is widely \n     acknowledged to be one of the country's fastest-growing types \n     of crime; and\n        Whereas, in November 2001, the United States Supreme Court \n     rules that the two-year statute of limitations during which \n     an identity theft victim could take action against a credit \n     reporting agency under the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act \n     is based on when the identity theft took place; and\n        Whereas, given the unique nature of identity theft, which \n     can easily take place without the victim's knowledge and \n     which often takes a long time to unravel, the Fair Credit \n     Reporting Act needs to be amended. This legislation must \n     ensure that a victim of identity theft can take legal action \n     based on when the fraud is discovered.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to enacting \n     legislation to prohibit the use of a person's Social Security \n     number as an identification beyond its original purpose; to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 186\n\n       Whereas, Social Security numbers are unique to each \n     individual and are invaluable for administering and policing \n     the safety net for millions of Americans who qualify for the \n     benefit programs administered by the Social Security \n     Administration. Over the decades since Social Security was \n     enacted, government agencies increasingly based their \n     personal records on the Social Security number. This number \n     began to assume the status of a virtual national \n     identification number; and\n       Whereas, concerns over the proliferation of uses for the \n     Social Security number outside of the Social Security \n     Administration led to the enactment by Congress of the \n     Privacy Act in 1974. This act was intended to limit further \n     government use of the Social Security number. Nonetheless, \n     congressional actions in the following years allowed the use \n     of the Social Security number for additional non-Social \n     Security purposes; and\n       Whereas, despite the federal Privacy Act, numerous \n     governmental and even private organizations use the unique \n     Social Security number as a basis for identifying \n     individuals. With so many public and private organizations \n     using a single identification number for an individual, it is \n     possible to gather enormous amounts of information about a \n     single person; and\n       Whereas, the Internet has made this explosion of \n     information a danger to our people. Identity theft is now \n     easy. The enormous financial and personal damage that \n     identity theft inflicts on innocent people and the difficulty \n     of correcting that damage is well documented. Congress must \n     take stronger actions to prevent Social Security numbers from \n     being used as general personal identification numbers: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to enact legislation to prohibit the use of a \n     person's Social Security number as an identification number \n     beyond its original purpose; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-344.

The \n     advantages of instant communications and extensive records, \n     which are facilitated by the technology of the digital age, \n     have also brought misuses of these tools for criminal \n     purposes. With frightening speed and ease, an innocent person \n     can face great problems or even financial ruin through \n     identity theft; and\n       Whereas, much stronger protections need to be created to \n     deal with identity theft. In addition to the steps of \n     increasing penalties and trying to prevent this crime from \n     occurring, there are legislative measures that should be \n     enacted to try to make sure that people who are victims of \n     this crime can recover with a minimum of time, cost, and \n     disruption to their lives; and\n       Whereas, Michigan is taking numerous steps to fight \n     identity theft, but federal actions are clearly vital to the \n     ultimate success of this initiative. Specific measures that \n     should be enacted into federal law include restricting the \n     commercial use of Social Security numbers as identification \n     numbers and allowing consumers to freeze their credit reports \n     to minimize losses. Clearly, stronger protections against \n     identity theft are long overdue: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact legislation to provide greater \n     protections against identity theft. We urge that measures be \n     enacted to restrict the commercial use of Social Security \n     numbers as identification numbers and to allow consumers to \n     freeze their credit reports to minimize losses; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-345.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to developing economic incentives and other programs \n     to aid in the recovery and stabilization of the manufacturing \n     industry in the United States; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 165\n\n        Whereas, historically, manufacturing has been a base \n     industry for the national economy, steadily comprising \n     approximately 17 percent of the Gross Domestic Product since \n     1947; and\n        Whereas, the manufacturing industry has experienced a \n     rapid decline and economic losses over the last three years. \n     After a peak in July 2000 of 17.3 million people employed by \n     the manufacturing sector, employment declined by more than \n     2.7 million jobs over the next 38 consecutive months; and\n        Whereas, lowered demand due to troubled economic \n     conditions, coupled with unfair foreign competition, has \n     greatly hindered the economic prosperity of the manufacturing \n     industry. There is substantial concern over the continuation \n     of manufacturing in the United States if the unfair trade \n     practices of other nations on our domestic market are not \n     addressed; and\n        Whereas, the restoration and revival of the manufacturing \n     sector are vital to the economic recovery of the United \n     States, as manufacturing has consistently led the economic \n     recovery from previous down-turns; and\n        Whereas, maintaining a strong and vibrant manufacturing \n     industry is crucial to sustaining or enhancing our national \n     security. Recent bankruptcies and other losses in the \n     manufacturing industry could put the United States in the \n     unprecedented position where it must purchase defense \n     technology from other countries, as foreign companies \n     currently produce such items as a key guidance chip for smart \n     bombs. Most recently, a foreign company purchased a bankrupt \n     domestic manufacturer that retained the rights to the stealth \n     fighter technology; and\n        Whereas, developing a package of economic incentives to \n     help foster additional growth in the manufacturing industry \n     and assist in keeping domestic manufacturers competitive with \n     their foreign counterparts will greatly benefit not only the \n     manufacturing industry, but will also provide great economic \n     benefits to Michigan and the entire country: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to develop \n     economic incentives and other programs to aid in the recovery \n     and stabilization of the manufacturing industry in the United \n     States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the United States Secretary of Commerce, \n     and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n[[Page S791]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-347.

The invasion of \n     nonnative species, pollution from numerous sources, damage to \n     wetlands, and many other forces have damaged the lakes. \n     Efforts to address these problems in the past have generally \n     sought to reduce the damage rather than offering an \n     opportunity to restore the lakes; and\n       Whereas, the proposed Great Lakes Environmental Restoration \n     Act presently before the United States Senate holds great \n     promise to address long-term issues facing the Great Lakes. \n     This legislation would provide $6 billion over a ten-year \n     span--in addition to existing programs--for a wide range of \n     initiatives to restore the Great Lakes and put in place \n     mechanisms to ensure better coordination of efforts and \n     standards far into the future. Developing improved monitoring \n     indicators is a major part of the act, with requirements for \n     ongoing gathering and review of critical information; and\n       Whereas, the Great Lakes Restoration Financing Act, a \n     similar House proposal, through $4 billion in funding over a \n     five-year period, would provide a greater coordination of \n     efforts through involvement by Great Lakes governors and \n     elected officials as well as key federal agencies. There \n     would also be an emphasis on implementing individual state \n     management plans; and\n       Whereas, clearly, the Great Lakes network is one of the \n     world's greatest natural assets. Investing in its restoration \n     is paramount to the quality of the future we will share: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to enact Great Lakes environmental \n     restoration act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-349. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to enacting legislation to give states the authority \n     to ban out-of-state solid waste; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 85\n\n        Whereas, in 1992, the United States Supreme Court, in Fort \n     Gratiot Sanitary Landfill v. Michigan Department of Natural \n     Resources, ruled that states could not regulate or ban the \n     importation of solid waste because only Congress has the \n     authority to regulate interstate commerce. Since that time, \n     Michigan has become the dumping ground for increasing amounts \n     of solid waste from outside of our state and, with large \n     amounts of trash from Canada, from outside the country; and\n        Whereas, Michigan has become one of the largest recipients \n     of imported solid waste in the country. Approximately 15 \n     percent of all trash dumped in landfills in Michigan now \n     originates elsewhere. The amounts have increased \n     significantly in the past several years, and recent reports \n     of a major contract with Ontario and of the closing of the \n     nation's largest landfill in New York seem to indicate this \n     situation will only become a bigger issue in the future; and\n        Whereas, accepting unlimited volumes of trash from outside \n     our state is a serious long-term commitment. Long after the \n     money from the contract has been spent, there is a threat to \n     the environment and an obligation to monitor sites to protect \n     water and health. Clearly, any state accepting these long-\n     term risks should be able to regulate what comes across state \n     lines for disposal: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to give states the authority to ban out-of-state \n     solid waste; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representative, and the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-350.

The impact of exotic species on \n     municipal water systems, fishing, and aquatic plant life \n     exacts a terrible toll on the nation's most important \n     freshwater resource; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has exercised consistent leadership in \n     the effort to prevent the arrival of more nonnative species. \n     Out state has put incentives in place in an effort to curb \n     the release of untreated ballast water from the ships that \n     traverse the lakes, which is the primary source of these \n     foreign species. As a state that has suffered significantly \n     because of organisms released into the lakes through the \n     discharge of ballast water, Michigan has repeatedly called \n     for stronger steps to prevent this from happening; and\n       Whereas, the effort to halt the introduction and spread of \n     nonindigenous species through ballast water discharges \n     continues to be frustrated by federal regulations under the \n     Clean Water Act. Although this key federal act requires \n     permits through the National Pollution Discharge Elimination \n     System for discharges, 40 C.F.R. Sec. 122.3(a) provides that \n     discharges from vessels that are incidental to normal \n     operations are exempt from the permit requirement. Although \n     efforts to repeal this exemption recently failed, removing \n     the exemption remains a vitally important step to take to \n     safeguard the Great Lakes: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorializing the Congress of the United \n     States and the Environmental Protection Agency to repeal 40 \n     C.F.R.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to cancel \ncertain Bureau of Land Management leases that authorize extraction of \nsand and gravel from the Federal mineral estate in land in Soledad \nCanyon, California, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n   Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that would \nterminate two Bureau of Land Management mining leases in Soledad \nCanyon, an area that is adjacent to the city of Santa Clarita in Los \nAngeles County, CA.\n   The bill would also prohibit the issuance of any future mining \nleases for sand and gravel in the Soledad Canyon area that exceed the \nhistorical level of mining, which is estimated to be 285,000 tons of \nsand and gravel per year. Before issuing any future leases in this \narea, the Secretary of the Interior would be required to consult with \nthe city of Santa Clarita and take into consideration the environmental \nand traffic impacts of mining. Congressman Buck McKeon introduced this \nlegislation in the House of Representatives in November 2003.\n   Here is the problem. These two leases in Soledad Canyon would allow \nmining of approximately 56 million tons of sand and gravel over the \nnext 20 years. That will mean more dust and air pollution, as well as \nmore traffic congestion.\n   The residents of the city of Santa Clarita suffer from some of the \nworst air quality in the Nation. The mining in Soledad Canyon would \noccur in an area where State standards for particulate matter are \nalready exceeded. Development of these mining leases will worsen air \npollution by increasing dust and particulate matter emissions. This \nwill lead to more respiratory problems, increased doctor and emergency \nroom visits, more hospitalizations for cardiac and pulmonary disease, \nand premature deaths for area residents.\n   Increased traffic congestion will also result from these mining \nleases. Interstate 5 and State Route 14 are located in the vicinity of \nthe mining leases, and State Route 14 is already plagued with serious \ntraffic problems. Development of these leases would tremendously \nincrease truck traffic in the area, causing further congestion. It is \nestimated that the proposed expansion of mining in Soledad Canyon would \nresult in 347 trucks making round trips to and from the site each day \nin the first 10 years, increasing to 582 trucks in the second 10 years \nof operation.\n   Due to these serious concerns over impacts on air quality and \ntraffic congestion, there is very strong opposition to the two leases \nby the people of Santa Clarita and over 80 organizations in California. \nWe need this legislation.\n   I believe that local health and safety concerns should not be \noverridden by the Federal Government. Development of these leases \nshould not occur to the detriment of the people of Santa Clarita. I \nshare Congressman Buck McKeon's interest in working with TMC/Cemex--the \ncompany that currently holds the leases--the city of Santa Clarita, and \nthe Bureau of Land Management to find a resolution that is acceptable \nto all parties and that protects the health and safety of the city and \nits residents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2059. A bill to improve the governance and regulation of mutual \nfunds under the securities laws, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Mutual \nFund Reform Act of 2004. This legislation would make fund governance \ntruly accountable, require genuinely transparent total fund costs, \nenhance comprehension and comparison of fund fees, confront trading \nabuses, create a culture of compliance, eliminate hidden transactions \nthat mislead investors and drive up costs, and save billions of dollars \nfor the 95 million Americans who invest in mutual funds. Above all, the \nMutual Fund Reform Act strives to preserve the attraction of mutual \nfunds as a flexible and investor-friendly vehicle for long-term, \ndiversified investment.\n  I am pleased to be joined today by my distinguished colleagues on the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, Senator Carl Levin and Senator Susan \nCollins, the committee's chairman, who are original cosponsors of this \nlegislation. I am grateful for the extensive and important input both \nSenators provided in the drafting of this bill, and appreciate the \ninvaluable perspective Senator Collins provided based on her first-hand \nexperience as Maine's Commissioner of Professional and Financial \nRegulation.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the work of a \nnumber of our colleagues in this area. Last year, I was pleased to \ncosponsor S. 1822, introduced by Senator Daniel Akaka, the Ranking \nMember of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee\n\n[[Page S794]]\n\non Financial Management, the Budget, and International Security, which \nI chair, to address mutual fund trading abuses. Senators Corzine, Dodd, \nand Kerry also have sponsored mutual fund bills from which I drew, as \nwell as legislation introduced by Congressman Richard Baker last summer \nand overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives at the end of \nthe last session.\n  I also would like to acknowledge the ongoing work of the Senate \nCommittee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, the authorizing \ncommittee which will ultimately decide questions of mutual fund \nindustry reform. The committee is conducting a series of legislative \nhearings to examine the mutual fund scandal and the merits of various \nreform proposals. I commend the leadership of Chairman Richard Shelby \nand Ranking Member Paul Sarbanes, and look forward to continuing to \nwork with them and the other members of the Banking Committee on this \nissue in the coming months.\n  The bill I am introducing today reflects extensive testimony that was \npresented during oversight hearings of the Financial Management \nSubcommittee that I chaired on November 3, 2003, and January 27, 2004. \nThe general consensus of the panelists at the November hearing was that \nillegal late trading and illicit market timing were indeed very serious \nthreats to investors but that excessive fees and inadequate disclosure \nof those fees were an even more serious threat to American investors. \nWitnesses at our hearing last month testified regarding the propriety \nand the adequacy of the disclosure of mutual fund fees, specifically \nhidden fees such as revenue sharing, directed brokerage, soft money \narrangements, and hidden loads such as 12b-1 fees. The subcommittee \nalso heard from two whistleblowers who were responsible for the initial \nrevelations regarding Putnam Investments and Canary Capital Partners, \nLLC.\n  The bill also reflects the constructive input from a number of key \norganizations and leaders of mutual fund reform. I especially \nappreciate the extensive contributions of Mr. John Bogle, the founder \nand former CEO of the Vanguard Group, who has been a champion of \nreforms in the mutual fund industry for many years.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from Mr. Bogle, Massachusetts \nSecretary of State William Galvin, and organizations representing \ninvestors and consumers endorsing this bill be printed in the Record.\n  In 1980 only a small percentage of Americans invested in mutual funds \nand the assets of the industry were only $115 billion. Today, roughly \n95 million Americans own shares in mutual funds and the assets of all \nthe funds combined are now more than $7 trillion. Mutual funds have \ngrown in popularity in part because Congress has sanctioned or expanded \na variety of tax-sheltered savings vehicles such as 401(k)s, Keoghs, \ntraditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, Rollover IRAs, and college savings plans. \nGiven that mutual funds are now the repository of such a large share of \nso many Americans' savings, few issues we confront are as important as \nprotecting the money invested in mutual funds.\n  I want to commend the many recent regulatory initiatives from the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are collectively a step \nin the right direction and a demonstration of our seriousness in \nWashington about putting the interests of America's mutual investors \nfirst. But the SEC does not have the statutory authority to take all of \nthe needed steps to restore integrity and health to the mutual fund \nindustry. The current scandals demand that Congress take a \ncomprehensive look at an industry still governed by a 64-year old law.\n  Therefore, the Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004 puts the interests of \ninvestors first by: ensuring independent and empowered boards of \ndirectors, clarifying and making specific fund directors' foremost \nfiduciary duty to shareholders; strengthening the fund advisers' \nfiduciary duty regarding negotiating fees and providing fund \ninformation, and instituting Sarbanes-Oxley-style provisions for \nindependent accounting and auditing, codes of ethics, chief compliance \nofficers, compliance certifications, and whistleblower protections.\n  The Mutual Reform Act of 2004 empowers both investors and free \nmarkets with clear, comprehensible fund transaction information by: \nstandardizing computation and disclosure of (i) fund expenses and (ii) \ntransaction costs, which yield a total investment cost ratio, and tell \ninvestors actual dollar costs; providing disclosure and definitions of \nall types of costs and requiring that the SEC approve imposition of any \nnew types of costs; disclosing portfolio managers' compensation and \nstake in fund; disclosing broker compensation at the point of sale; \ndisclosing and explaining portfolio turnover ratios to investors, and \ndisclosing proxy voting policies and record.\n  The Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004 vastly simplifies the disclosure \nregime by: eliminating asset-based distribution fees (Rule 12b-1 fees), \nthe original purpose of which has been lost and the current use of \nwhich is confusing and misleading--and amending the Investment Company \nAct of 1940 to permit the use of the adviser's fee for distribution \nexpenses, which locates the incentive to keep distribution expenses \nreasonable exactly where it belongs--with the fund adviser; prohibiting \nshadow transactions--such as revenue sharing, directed brokerage, and \nsoft-dollar arrangements--that are riddled with conflicts of interest, \nserve no reasonable business purpose, and drive up costs; \n``Unbundling'' commissions, such that research and other services, \nheretofore covered by hidden soft-dollar arrangements, will be the \nsubject of separate negotiation and a freer and fairer market; \nrequiring enforceable market timing policies and mandatory redemption \nfees--as well as provision by omnibus account intermediaries of basic \ncustomer information to funds to enable funds to enforce their market \ntiming, redemption fee, and breakpoint discount policies; and requiring \nfair value pricing and strengthening late trading rules.\n  The Mutual Fund Reform Act also would perpetuate the dialogue and \npreserve the wisdom gathered from hard experience. The Act directs the \nSEC and the General Accounting Office to conduct several studies, \nincluding a study of ways to minimize conflicts of interest and \nincentivize internal management of mutual funds; a study on \ncoordination of enforcement efforts between SEC headquarters, SEC \nregional offices, and state regulatory and law enforcement entities; \nand a study to enhance the role of the internet in educating investors \nand providing timely information about laws, regulations, enforcement \nproceedings and individual funds, possibly by mandating disclosures on \nwebsites.\n  Enactment of the Mutual Fund Reform Act would help restore the \nintegrity of the mutual fund industry and would dramatically enhance \nthe amount of retirement savings for many long term investors. \nShareholders would be the big winners under this legislation, and the \nlosers would be high cost mutual funds. I therefore urge my colleagues \nto support passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, as well as a one-\npage summary and white paper describing the legislation, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           The Vanguard Group,\n\n                               Valley Forge, PA, February 6, 2004.\n       I salute Senator Fitzgerald for the bill he has drafted to \n     improve the governance and regulation of mutual funds. I've \n     spent the greater part of my career speaking out on nearly \n     all of the important legislative issues that Senator \n     Fitzgerald's Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004 addresses. While \n     nothing can solve the industry's problems overnight, I view \n     of the bill as the gold standard in putting mutual fund \n     shareholders back in the driver's seat, and endorse it in its \n     entirety.\n                                                    John C.

Peter Fitzgerald,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee of Financial Management, the Budget, \n         and International Security, Senate Committee of \n         Governmental Affairs, Hart Senate Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Fitzgerald: As the chief securities regulator \n     in Massachusetts, I write in support of the Mutual Fund \n     Reform Act of 2004. The recently-exposed abuses relating to \n     mutual funds show the need for this legislation. Small \n     investors are particularly\n\n[[Page S795]]\n\n     vulnerable to these abusive practices, since nearly half of \n     U.S. households own mutual funds--often through their \n     retirement plans.\n       The bill increases the independence of fund directors and \n     obliges them to act as fiduciaries on behalf of shareholders; \n     it makes the costs of mutual funds more transparent; and it \n     curtails many abusive mutual fund sales practices.\n       We particularly support the provisions to prohibit directed \n     brokerage and soft dollar arrangements by mutual funds. These \n     practices, at best, mask the true costs of fund operations; \n     at worst, they are kick back-type payments in the securities \n     industry.\n       I also encourage you to add a provision that will give \n     investors the ability to choose the forum where they may \n     arbitrate disputes with their brokers. Under the current \n     system, investors are forced to arbitrate their claims in a \n     forum chosen by the brokerage.\n       Please contact me if I can assist you in working for the \n     adoption of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William F. Galvin,\n     Secretary of the Commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 5, 2004.\n     Hon. Peter G. Fitzgerald,\n     Dirksen Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Fitzgerald: We are writing to express our \n     enthusiastic support for your draft ``Mutual Fund Reform \n     Act.'' More than any other legislation that has yet to be \n     introduced since the mutual fund scandals erupted last year, \n     this bill recognizes the need to fundamentally transform the \n     way in which mutual funds are governed, operated, and sold to \n     ensure that they live up to their statutory obligation to \n     operate in their shareholders' best interests.\n       This legislation offers a thoughtful and far-reaching \n     agenda for reform. It addresses significant gaps in the SEC's \n     proposals to improve fund governance, dramatically enhances \n     the quality of mutual fund cost disclosures, and prohibits \n     distribution practices that create unacceptable and poorly \n     understood conflicts of interest. It also takes the necessary \n     step of banning hidden ``soft dollar'' arrangements that \n     boost shareholder costs and create additional conflicts of \n     interest. We look forward to working with you to win passage \n     of these essential reforms.\n       Our support for this bill is based on the firm belief that \n     mutual funds have been and will continue to be the best way \n     for average, middle-income investors to participate in our \n     nation's securities markets. Individuals with only modest \n     amounts to invest have benefited greatly from the opportunity \n     mutual funds offer to achieve broad diversification. While \n     wealthy investors have other options that provide similar \n     benefits, average, middle-class investors do not. The \n     resulting influx of money into mutual funds has in turn \n     produced generous profits for fund companies.\n       This long record or mutual success had caused some in the \n     industry and among its regulators to become complacent, \n     taking for granted that all was well. By revealing the extent \n     to which some fund managers had abandoned their obligation to \n     operate in fund shareholders' best interests, the trading \n     scandals uncovered last fall provided sudden and compelling \n     evidence that such complacency was ill-founded. The closer \n     scrutiny of fund operations that resulted quickly uncovered \n     evidence of other similar failings: Management fees that had \n     failed to drop significantly, or in some cases at all, \n     despite a massive growth in assets; use of portfolio \n     transaction commissions, which are not incorporated in the \n     fund expense ratio, to pay for services whose costs would \n     otherwise have to be disclosed; use of portfolio transaction \n     commissions borne by shareholders to pay for services whose \n     benefits flowed in part or in whole to the fund manager; use \n     of poorly disclosed or misunderstood compensation methods, \n     including 12b-1 fees, directed brokerage, and payments for \n     shelf space to induce brokers to recommend particular funds; \n     and broker recommendation of mutual funds based on the \n     financial incentives received rather than on which funds \n     offer the best quality at the most reasonable price.\n       By driving up costs to investors and undermining \n     competition based on cost and quality, these practices \n     inflict far greater financial harm on their victims than the \n     trading scandals appear to have done.\n       Since it became clear that mutual fund sales and trading \n     abuses were widespread throughout the industry, the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission has responded with an \n     ambitious enforcement, investigation, and rule-making agenda. \n     In addition to developing reforms targeted specifically at \n     excessive and late trading, the Commission has issued \n     proposals to strengthen mutual fund governance, sought \n     suggestions on how to improve disclosure of portfolio \n     transaction costs, and proposed rules to improve disclosure \n     of distribution-related costs and conflicts of interest.\n       Despite this important progress, there are serious gaps in \n     the SEC's regulatory agenda. Some result from the agency's \n     lack of authority to effect change. Others result from the \n     SEC's lack of a vision of how mutual fund regulation must be \n     transformed. This legislation fills those gaps. If it is \n     adopted, it will dramatically improve fund governance, \n     eliminate practices that create unacceptable conflicts of \n     interest, and save mutual fund investors potentially tens of \n     billions of dollars a year by wringing out excess costs.\n       Our specific comments in support of some of the bill's most \n     important pro-investor provisions follow.\n       1. The legislation's fund governance reforms address \n     significant gaps in the SEC's rule proposal.\n       The Securities and Exchange Commission has made a promising \n     start on the issue of fund governance. In January, it issued \n     a rule proposal that would require that three-quarters of \n     mutual fund board members, including the chairman, be \n     independent. It would further require that independent \n     members meet at least quarterly without any interested \n     parties present. It authorizes the board to hire staff to \n     help it fulfill its responsibilities. And it requires boards \n     to retain copies of the written documents considered as part \n     of the board's annual review of the advisory contract.\n       Although the Commission certainly deserves credit for this \n     important first step, there is more that must be done to \n     achieve the goal of improved fund governance. First and \n     foremost, the Commission lacks the authority to strengthen \n     the definition of independent director. So, even if it adopts \n     its independent governance requirements without weakening \n     amendments over the already announced objections of two \n     commissioners, non-immediate family members, individuals \n     associated with significant service providers of the fund, \n     and recently retired fund company employees would all be \n     eligible to serve as ``independent'' directors. Furthermore, \n     the SEC proposal does not require that independent directors \n     have sole authority to nominate new directors and set \n     director compensation, potentially leaving significant issues \n     in the hands of fund managers.\n       This bill addresses all those concerns. It includes an \n     excellent definition of independence, which both specifically \n     addresses the issue of significant service providers and \n     authorizes the SEC to exclude from the definition of \n     independent director any set of individuals who for business, \n     family, or other reasons are unlikely to demonstrate the \n     appropriate degree of independence. It requires both that \n     independent directors determine director compensation and \n     that a committee of independent directors nominate new \n     directors. And it directs the SEC to study whether any limit \n     should be placed on the aggregate amount of director \n     compensation an individual could receive from a single fund \n     family and still be considered independent.\n       The bill further recognizes that lack if independence is \n     not the only concern about mutual fund governance. Also \n     problematic is the failure of many mutual fund boards to act \n     as fiduciaries, with a broad responsibility to protect \n     shareholder interests. The bill attacks this problem by \n     broadening the scope of directors' fiduciary duty. As defined \n     in the legislation, that duty would include, among other \n     things, a responsibility to: take quality of management as \n     well as actual costs and economies of scale into account when \n     negotiating management contracts; evaluate the quality, \n     comprehensiveness, and clarity of disclosures to fund \n     shareholders regarding costs; assess any distribution and \n     marketing plan with regard to its costs and benefits; and \n     monitor enforcement of policies and procedures to ensure \n     compliance with applicable securities laws. The SEC would be \n     responsible for detailing how the board's fiduciary duty \n     applies in each instance.\n       By shoring up the independence of fund boards and expanding \n     and clarifying their fiduciary duty to shareholders, this \n     bill would increase the likelihood that fund boards would \n     serve their intended function as the first line of defense \n     against a variety of abusive practices.\n       One element missing from the bill, however, is any \n     consideration of creating an independent board to oversee \n     mutual funds. In testimony late last year, SEC Chairman \n     William Donaldson suggested that the Commission was exploring \n     ways in which funds could ``assume greater responsibilities \n     for compliance with the federal securities laws, including \n     whether funds and advisers should periodically undergo an \n     independent third-party compliance audit.'' ``These \n     compliance audits could be a useful supplement to our own \n     examination program and could ensure more frequent \n     examination of funds and advisers,'' he said.\n       Recent accounting scandals should have taught us the risks \n     of relying on audits that are paid for by the entity being \n     audited. If the SEC needs a supplement to its own examination \n     program, a far better approach would be to create an \n     independent board, subject to SEC oversight, to conduct such \n     audits. The board could be modeled on the Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board, with similar authority to set \n     standards, conduct inspections, and bring enforcement actions \n     and similar (or, better yet, stronger) requirements for board \n     member independence. Your bill would require a GAO study of \n     the SEC's current organizational structure with respect to \n     mutual fund regulation. We urge you, at a minimum, to include \n     an assessment of the benefits of establishing an independent \n     oversight board as part of that study.\n       2. The legislation would dramatically enhance the quality \n     of mutual fund cost disclosures.\n       A major shortcoming in the SEC's regulation of mutual funds \n     have been its failure to take effective action to bring down \n     excessive costs. Not only has the agency not used its own \n     enforcement authority to bring cases against fund managers \n     who charge and fund boards who approve unreasonable fees, it \n     has criticized the New York Attorney General for negotiating \n     fee reduction agreements as\n\n[[Page S796]]\n\n     part of his settlement with fund companies that engaged in \n     abusive trading. In criticizing those fee reduction \n     agreements, Commission officials have suggested that they \n     prefer to rely on independent fund boards and the market to \n     discipline costs.\n       While the Commission can show some progress on the issue of \n     fund governance, its proposals on cost disclosure are \n     extremely disappointing. They fall far short of the bare \n     minimum needed to introduce meaningful cost competition in \n     the mutual fund marketplace. This legislation attacks to \n     excessive costs both through strengthened governance \n     requirements that do beyond those in the SEC rule proposal \n     and through improved disclosures that will be more effective \n     in raising investor awareness of costs than those proposed so \n     far by the SEC.\n       One important area where the bill improves on SEC proposals \n     is in disclosure of portfolio transaction costs. These costs \n     vary greatly from fund to fund, may be the highest cost for \n     an actively managed stock fund, and in some cases exceed all \n     others costs combined. A recent study found that, on average, \n     funds spend $0.43 on portfolio transactions for every $1.00 \n     of expenses that are disclosed in the current expense ratio, \n     and that in some cases fund transaction costs can exceed \n     three or four times the current expense ratio. (Jason \n     Karceski, Miles Livingston, Edward O'Neal, Mutual Fund \n     Brokerage Commissions, Jan. 2004, available at http://\nwww.zeroalphagroup.com/headlines/\nZAG_mutual_fund_true_cost_study.pdf.)\n       Yet, the SEC has long resisted incorporating these costs in \n     the expense ratio. In response to congressional pressure, the \n     agency has recently issued a concept release seeking \n     suggestions for improving transaction cost disclosure, but it \n     is not at all clear that the agency will come out in support \n     of an approach that goes much beyond its previously stated \n     preference for giving greater prominence to disclosure of the \n     portfolio turnover rate. Such an approach makes not \n     distinction between those funds that get good execution for \n     their trades and those that do not. Furthermore, it continues \n     to make it possible for funds to hide costs that would \n     otherwise have to be disclosed by paying for them through \n     soft dollar arrangements.\n       The bill would bring these costs out into the open where \n     they belong. It would do so by requiring a separate \n     computation of portfolio transaction costs that includes, at \n     a minimum, brokerage commissions and bid-ask spread costs. \n     And it would require this transaction cost ratio to be \n     disclosed both separately and as part of a total investment \n     cost ratio in the prospectus fee table and wherever else the \n     expense ratio is disclosed. Because the bill would retain the \n     current expense ratio, while also creating a new total \n     expense ratio that includes portfolio transaction costs, it \n     would allow the markets to decide which measure of fund costs \n     is most appropriate and useful. Once this information is \n     brought out into the open, these costs are more likely to be \n     subject to competitive pressures, helping to drive down \n     expenses for shareholders.\n       The bill would supplement this disclosure by requiring \n     individualized disclosure in annual reports of the projected \n     actual dollar amount of each investor's total annual costs \n     based upon the investor's assets at the time of the \n     disclosure. We strongly support individualized dollar cost \n     disclosures, but believe that, to be workable, this \n     information must be provided in the quarterly or annual \n     account statements that show the shareholder's account \n     balance and transaction activity. Putting cost information in \n     dollar amounts side-by-side with information on the fund's \n     gains or losses for the year is key to helping investors to \n     put those costs into perspective. We urge you to adopt this \n     clarification.\n       In addition, the draft version of the legislation that we \n     have reviewed does not require pre-sale disclosure of mutual \n     fund costs, as opposed to distribution costs. If we are to \n     promote effective cost competition in the mutual fund \n     industry, investors must receive cost information in advance \n     of the sale. Post-sale disclosure, while useful in raising \n     investor awareness of costs, comes too late to influence the \n     purchase decision. We believe investors would be best served \n     by pre-sale cost disclosures that are comparative in nature, \n     showing how the fund's cost compare to category averages and \n     minimums, and how this is likely to affect performance over \n     the long-term. The provision in the bill that allows for \n     point-of-sale disclosure provides an easy mechanism for \n     offering this information. We urge you to add a provision to \n     this effect to your bill.\n       With these changes, the cost disclosure provisions in this \n     bill will go a long way toward bringing meaningful cost \n     competition to an industry that has too long escaped its \n     disciplining effects.\n       3. The bill would prohibit a variety of distribution \n     practices that create unacceptable conflicts of interest.\n       Growing investor reluctance to pay the front loads that \n     were common in the 1980s has driven mutual fund distribution \n     costs underground. Funds substituted a variety of \n     distribution practices--e.g., 12b-1 fees, directed brokerage, \n     and payments for shelf space--that were less visible to \n     shareholders. These practices encouraged the impression that \n     the funds were load-free when in fact they imposed \n     significant distribution costs. The practices adopted also \n     posed significant new conflicts of interest.\n       Although 12b-1 fees are disclosed as a separate line item \n     on prospectus fee tables, evidence suggests that investors \n     are less aware of the cost implications of annual expenses \n     than they are of front loads and do not necessarily \n     understand that 12b-1 fees are used to compensate brokers. \n     Because they are included in the expense ratio, 12b-1 fees \n     appear to be a cost the shareholder pays for the fund, not a \n     cost they pay for the services the broker provides. Problems \n     with 12b-1 fees abound, including the fact that investors in \n     funds that charge substantial 12b-1 fees may be stuck paying \n     distribution costs whose benefits flow partially, or even \n     primarily, to the fund company. Shareholders are forced to \n     pay the fees even when they do not use the services the fees \n     are designed to provide. With fund manager compensation based \n     on a percentage of assets under management, fund managers \n     reap significant benefits from the asset growth the fees \n     promote, without having to risk their own money in the \n     process.\n       Because it also uses shareholder assets to promote \n     distribution, directed brokerage creates many of the same \n     conflicts as 12b-1 fees and more. Not only are shareholders \n     forced to pay higher costs for benefits that flow in part or \n     in full to the fund manager, in some cases costs paid by one \n     set of shareholders may be used in part to promote sale of \n     other funds in the same fund family. Furthermore, these \n     arrangements may encourage fund managers to decide where to \n     conduct their portfolio transactions based not on where they \n     can get the best execution, but on where they get the best \n     distribution. They may even encourage fund managers to trade \n     more than necessary simply to fulfill their directed \n     brokerage agreements. This, in turn, drives up costs to \n     shareholders. While 12b-1 fees are disclosed to investors, \n     distribution costs paid through directed brokerage are not. \n     Instead, they are hidden in undisclosed portfolio transaction \n     costs.\n       Payments for shelf space are similar to directed brokerage \n     agreements. Instead of being paid indirectly through \n     portfolio transaction costs, however, these financial \n     incentives are made in the form of cash payments by the fund \n     manager to the broker. At best, by eating into the manager's \n     bottom line, the payments may reduce the likelihood that the \n     management fee will be reduced in response to economies of \n     scale. At worst, fund managers will pass along those costs to \n     shareholders in a form that is even less transparent than \n     directed brokerage payments.\n       All these practices are designed to encourage brokers to \n     recommend funds based not on which offer the best quality at \n     the most reasonable price, but instead on which offer the \n     most generous compensation to the broker. As such, they stand \n     in sharp contrast to the image brokers promote of themselves \n     as objective advisers. To its great credit, the legislation \n     recognizes that simply disclosing these conflicts will not \n     solve the problem. The best disclosure in the world is \n     unlikely to counteract multi-million dollar advertising \n     campaigns intent on convincing investors to place their trust \n     in the objectivity and professionalism of their ``financial \n     consultant.''\n       Instead, the legislation deals with these conflicts in the \n     cleanest, most sensible way possible. It eliminates them. In \n     doing so, it takes an enormous and much needed step toward \n     forcing brokers to act like the objective advisers they claim \n     to be. Furthermore, reforming the distribution system in this \n     way is one of the most important things Congress can do to \n     promote competition in the mutual fund industry based on cost \n     and quality. That is because these practices allow mediocre, \n     high-cost funds to survive and even thrive simply by offering \n     generous compensation to the brokers that sell them. And, by \n     making it harder for brokers to hide the compensation they \n     receive for selling particular funds, this legislation should \n     make it easier for shareholders to assess whether the \n     services they receive from their broker justify the costs.\n       4. The bill would prohibit soft dollar arrangements that \n     boost shareholder costs and create unacceptable conflicts of \n     interest.\n       Soft dollar arrangements allow fund managers to pay for \n     services through portfolio transaction costs that they would \n     otherwise have to bill for directly--primarily research, but \n     a variety of other services as well. And, because these costs \n     are hidden, they create a strong incentive for fund managers \n     to pay for services in this fashion. The conflicts they \n     create are substantial. As with directed brokerage \n     agreements, they encourage fund managers to direct their \n     portfolio transactions based on the services they receive and \n     not on who offers the best execution for those trades. Soft \n     dollar arrangements also may encourage excessive trading with \n     no purpose except to fulfill soft dollar agreements. This, in \n     turn, requires shareholders to pay those unnecessary trading \n     costs. Soft dollar arrangements may also encourage fund \n     managers to choose service providers based not on who offers \n     the best service at the best price, but on what services can \n     be paid for through soft dollars, where the costs will be \n     hidden.\n       As with the distribution practices discussed above, the \n     legislation would deal with these conflicts by eliminating \n     them. We strongly support this approach, which would reduce \n     shareholder costs by requiring funds to seek best execution \n     on all their trades. Some in the independent research \n     community have raised concerns about this approach, \n     suggesting that it will harm independent research. Nothing \n     could be further\n\n[[Page S797]]\n\n     from the truth. As long as funds can pay for research through \n     soft dollars, they will have an incentive to choose the \n     research whose cost can be hidden in this fashion. If soft \n     dollar arrangements are banned, however, funds will have no \n     reason to choose research based on any consideration but \n     which is of the highest quality. If independent research can \n     compete on quality, its competitive position should be \n     improved under a soft dollar ban.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Mutual funds have been largely responsible for making it \n     possible for average, middle-income investors to participate \n     in our Nation's securities markets. As such, they have done \n     much to promote both the financial well-being of those \n     investors and the financial health of our capital markets. \n     Regulatory oversight, however, has not kept pace with mutual \n     funds' growing and changing role in our financial markets. \n     The recent trading and sales abuse scandals have offered a \n     painful reminder of just how far some fund companies have \n     strayed from their obligation to operate in shareholders' \n     best interests.\n       Fundamental reform is needed to get the fund industry back \n     on track. The SEC has gotten us part of the way there with \n     its recent enforcement actions and rule proposals. But \n     partway there is simply not good enough. Important gaps exist \n     in the SEC's agenda that will keep it from delivering the \n     comprehensive reform that the current situation demands. This \n     legislation fills those gaps. It offers a far-reaching and \n     thoughtful approach that, if enacted, will go a long way \n     toward getting the mutual fund industry back to operating in \n     shareholders' best interests once again. Please let us know \n     what we can do to help win passage of these essential, pro-\n     investor reforms.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Barbara Roper,\n       Director of Investor Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Travis Plunkett,\n       Legislative Director, Consumer Federation of America.\n     Mercer Bullard,\n       Founder and President, Fund Democracy, Inc.\n     Ed Mierzwinski,\n       Consumer Program Director, U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group.\n     Sally Greenberg,\n       Senior Counsel, Consumers Union.\n     Kenneth McEldowney,\n       Executive Director, Consumer Action.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Coalition of Mutual\n\n\n                                               Fund Investors,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 26, 2004.\n     Hon. Peter Fitzgerald,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Financial Management, The Budget \n         and International Security, Committee on Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Fitzgerald: The Coalition of Mutual Fund \n     Investors (``CMFI'' or ``Coalition'') has reviewed your \n     legislative proposals to reform the mutual fund industry. \n     Without a doubt, your legislative initiative is the most \n     comprehensive mutual fund bill yet to be introduced in either \n     the House or the Senate.\n       The Coalition strongly supports your efforts to improve the \n     mutual fund regulatory framework in a manner which benefits \n     all individual investors. As the mutual fund reform debate \n     begins this year in the Senate, your bill is likely to serve \n     as the gold standard by which other legislative proposals are \n     evaluated for their effectiveness in protecting the interests \n     of individual investors.\n       CMFI supports the provisions contained in the mutual fund \n     reform bill which recently passed the House of \n     Representatives (H.R. 2420), however, the Coalition has been \n     advocating additional regulatory measures to protect the \n     interests of individual investors. These additional measures \n     include: (1) better shareholder disclosure of mutual fund \n     operating and transaction costs, (2) improved oversight of \n     ``omnibus'' accounts operated by financial intermediaries, \n     and (3) enhanced disclosure of the Statement of Additional \n     Information.\n       You have included many of these reform proposals in your \n     bill and so the Coalition is very pleased to offer its \n     support to your legislation. The Coalition is particularly \n     pleased that your legislation includes a CMFI proposal to \n     require financial intermediaries operating ``omnibus'' \n     accounts to disclose basic shareholder identity and \n     transaction information to mutual funds so that the funds can \n     ensure uniform application of their policies, procedures, \n     fees, and charges across all shareholder classes. The \n     interests of long-term shareholders are being harmed by a \n     lack of oversight regarding the trading activities occurring \n     in these ``omnibus accounts'' and your legislation addresses \n     this structural problem with an effective solution.\n       The Coalition looks forward to working with you and your \n     staff to enact the many thoughtful provisions contained in \n     your bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Niels Holch,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2059\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MFRA strives \n     above all to preserve the attractiveness of mutual funds as a \n     flexible and investor-friendly vehicle for long-term, \n     diversified investment.\n\n\n                Title 1: Truly Fiduciary Fund Governance\n\n       The Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004 puts the interests of \n     investors first by:\n       Ensuring independent and empowered boards of directors;\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\n       Clarifying and making specific fund directors' foremost \n     fiduciary duty to shareholders;\n       Strengthening the fund advisers' fiduciary duty regarding \n     negotiating fees and providing fund information; and\n       Instituting Sarbanes-Oxley-style provisions for independent \n     accounting and auditing, codes of ethics, chief compliance \n     officers, compliance certifications, and whistleblower \n     protections.\n\n\n                 Title 2: Meaningful Fund Transparency\n\n       The Mutual Reform Act of 2004 empowers both investors and \n     free markets with clear, comprehensible fund transaction \n     information by:\n       Standardizing computation and disclosure of (i) fund \n     expenses and (ii) transaction costs, which yield a total \n     investment cost ratio, and tell investors actual dollar \n     costs;\n       Providing disclosure and definitions of all types of costs \n     and requiring that the SEC approve imposition of any new \n     types of costs;\n       Disclosing portfolio managers' compensation and stake in \n     fund;\n       Disclosing broker compensation at the point of sale;\n       Disclosing and explaining portfolio turnover ratios to \n     investors; and\n       Disclosing proxy voting policies and record.\n\n\n               Title 3: Straightforward Fund Transactions\n\n       The Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004 vastly simplifies \n     disclosure regime by:\n       Eliminating asset-based distribution fees (Rule 12b-1 \n     fees), the original purpose of which has been lost and the \n     current use of which is confusing and misleading--and \n     amending the Investment Company Act of 1940 to permit the use \n     of the adviser's fee for distribution expenses, which locates \n     the incentive to keep distribution expenses reasonable \n     exactly where it belongs--with the fund adviser;\n       Prohibiting shadow transactions--such as revenue sharing, \n     directed brokerage, and soft-dollar arrangements--that are \n     riddled with conflicts of interest, serve no reasonable \n     business purpose, and drive up costs;\n       ``Unbundling'' commissions, such that research and other \n     services, heretofore covered by hidden soft-dollar \n     arrangements, will be the subject of separate negotiation and \n     a freer and fairer market;\n       Requiring enforceable market timing policies and mandatory \n     redemption fees--as well as provision by omnibus account \n     intermediaries of basic customer information to funds to \n     enable funds to enforce their market timing, redemption fee, \n     and breakpoint discount policies; and\n       Requiring fair value pricing and strengthening late trading \n     rules.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004\n\n       The Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004 (MFRA) restores truly \n     fiduciary fund governance, simplifies fund fees, confronts \n     trading abuses, creates a culture of compliance, and \n     eliminates the conflict-riddled shadow transactions that \n     drive up costs. The essence of the legislation is not any \n     regulatory regime it creates, but the market forces it \n     liberates. Obscurity is the enemy of a free market. Too \n     little information--and too much incomprehensible \n     information--equally undermine informed investor decision-\n     making. The Mutual Fund Reform Act lifts the veil off \n     mislabeled and misleading transactions, ensures genuine \n     transparency, and promotes true price competition.\n       With 95 million American stakeholders, mutual funds are \n     truly America's investment vehicle of choice. MFRA strives \n     above all to preserve the attractiveness of mutual funds as a \n     flexible and investor-friendly vehicle for long-term, \n     diversified investment. That goal requires a careful \n     balancing of accountability and incentive--or carrot and \n     stick. Federal and state governments cannot police, much less \n     micromanage, over 8,000 funds. The overriding duty to \n     shareholders rests primarily with the funds themselves, and \n     secondarily with the funds' service providers--each guided by \n     a clearer statement of purpose and priority, incentivized by \n     a more robust and transparent market that rewards low cost \n     and good performance--because it can truly identify them--and \n     accountable for failures that privilege fund managers' or \n     brokers' interests over shareholders.\n       Vanguard Founder and industry savant John Bogle calls the \n     Mutual Fund Reform Act of 2004 ``the gold standard in putting \n     mutual fund shareholders back in the driver's seat.''The \n     Consumer Federation of America says the Mutual Fund Reform \n     Act of 2004 ``will save mutual fund investors potentially \n     tens of billions of dollars a year by wringing out excess \n     costs.'' The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) \n     recent spate of regulatory initiatives is a testament to \n     Washington's will in redressing the scandals and excessive \n     fees that erode America's retirement and college savings. But \n     the SEC cannot take the range of initiatives that are \n     necessary to rationalize an industry governed by 64-year-old \n     legislation. It is time for Congress to take the step that \n     truly empowers America's investors and invigorates market \n     forces. It is time for reforms that finally put investors \n     first.\n       MFRA is divided into four titles: Title 1 (Fund \n     Governance); Title 2 (Fund Transparency); Title 3 (Fund \n     Regulation and Oversight); and Title 4 (Studies). The \n     provisions under each title are analyzed below.\n\n\n                        title 1: Fund Governance\n\n                         Independent directors\n\n       The Mutual Fund Reform Act empowers a truly independent \n     board of directors to exercise its essential ``watchdog'' \n     role as the original Investment company Act of 1940 \n     envisioned. An inherent tendency to defer to authority--or to \n     parties with more information--must be countered with both \n     numbers and authority for the board to reliably flex its \n     independent muscle in the best interests of shareholders. \n     Thus, at least 75% of the board must be independent--\n     including the chair.\n       That independence must be self-perpetuating. Thus, \n     independent directors will nominate new directors and adopt \n     qualification standards for such nomination.\n       Close relationships with fund advisers, or other \n     significant service providers, can easily compromise \n     independence. Thus, the legislation tightens the definition \n     of independence to exclude individuals with material business \n     or close family relationships with such service providers. \n     Further, the legislation directs the SEC to study whether \n     substantial aggregate compensation from a fund adviser, \n     especially when directors serve on multiple boards, \n     compromises independence.\n\n                       Directors' fiduciary duty\n\n       Building on the ringing declaration in the Investment \n     Company Act's Preamble, section 36(a) refers specifically to \n     the fiduciary duty of directors--but it has been a relatively \n     empty reference. Merely to recite ``fiduciary duty,'' it \n     appears, will not ensure fidelity to it. Directors need \n     direction--and content--in discharging their fiduciary \n     duties. MFRA supplies both. MFRA amends the Investment \n     Company Act to make expressly clear that the directors' \n     fiduciary duty obliges them to act in the best interests \n     of shareholders.\n       A ``fiduciary'' duty is supposed to be a rigorous one--yet \n     its content has been unenforced guesswork. Mindful of the \n     industry's complexity, NFRA thus directs the SEC to provide \n     directors with specific guidance on the content of their \n     fiduciary duty. Such content will include, at a minimum, \n     determining the extent to which independent and reliable \n     sources of information are sufficient to discharge director \n     responsibilities, negotiating management and advisory fees \n     with due regard for the actual cost of services, including \n     economies of scale, evaluating management quality and \n     considering potentially superior alternatives, evaluating the \n     quality, comprehensiveness, and clarity of disclosures to \n     shareholders regarding costs, evaluating any distribution or \n     marketing plan of the company, including its costs and \n     benefits, evaluating the size of the fund's portfolio and its \n     suitability to the interests of shareholders, implementing \n     and monitoring policies and procedures to ensure compliance \n     with applicable securities laws, and implementing and \n     monitoring policies with respect to predatory trading \n     practices, such as market timing.\n\n                  Investment advisers' fiduciary duty\n\n       After Wharton School and SEC studies in the 1960s found \n     that mutual fund shareholders pay excessive fees because they \n     lack bargaining power, the SEC recommended to Congress that \n     it require that fees be ``reasonable.'' That did not happen. \n     Instead, in 1970, Congress imposed a ``fiduciary'' duty on \n     fund advisers with respect to fees. As with the directors' \n     ``fiduciary'' duty, however, the term lost any meaningful \n     moorning in client-first professional stewardship. Indeed, in \n     a watershed judicial interpretation of the adviser's \n     ``fiduciary'' duty under section 36(b), the Second Circuit \n     deemed the duty satisfied unless the adviser charged ``a fee \n     that is so disproportionately large that it bears no \n     reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could \n     not have been the product of arm's-length bargaining.'' \n     Gartenberg v. Merrill Lynch Asset Mgt., Inc., 694 F.2d 923 \n     (2d Cir. 1982). Against such a startling hurdle, no plaintiff \n     ever wins an excessive fee case--and the SEC has declined to \n     hold fund directors accountable for failing adequately to \n     review adviser fee agreements (under section 36(a)).\n       Once again, merely invoking the phrase ``fiduciary'' will \n     not ensure fair stewardship. MFRA makes clear that the fund \n     adviser's fiduciary duty with respect to fees ``may require \n     reasonable reference to actual costs of the adviser and \n     economies of scale.'' Advisers are entitled to a fair \n     profit--and nothing in MFRA ``caps'' or ``legislates'' fees, \n     or otherwise imposes a ``price control.'' But MFRA does \n     ensure that accountability is fairly allocated in the \n     interests of shareholders.\n       MFRA also addresses another fiduciary deficit in the \n     relationship between fund adviser and fund director. \n     Conscientious independent directors may experience reckless \n     intimidation and misdirection trying to penetrate the \n     adviser's monopoly on critical fund information. Indeed, as \n     Fund Democracy founder Mercer Bullard noted three years ago, \n     under the current regime, ``fund directors who try to do \n     their jobs may do so at their own risk. In 1997, the \n     directors of the Navellier Aggressive Small-Cap fund \n     complained to the SEC that the fund's adviser, Louis \n     Navellier, had refused to provide information they needed to \n     evaluate his services. . . . Intent on proving that no good \n     deed goes unpunished, Navellier dragged the fund's directors \n     through years of litigation,'' which was finally resolved in \n     the directors' favor.\n       Subjecting directors to the sufferance of fund advisers \n     turns the fiduciary duties of\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\n     both on their heads. MFRA cures this damaging imbalance by \n     specifying that fund advisers owe a specific fiduciary duty \n     to provide information that is material to fund governance. \n     In other words, directors will no longer be obliged to think \n     of every possible question necessary to obtain essential \n     information--much less be bullied by resistant advisers.\n\n                      Termination of fund adviser\n\n       When fund managers cease to perform as effective stewards \n     of the investments entrusted to them, they should be subject \n     to the market discipline facing most Americans on the job--\n     termination. Independent directors, exercising their \n     fiduciary duties in the best interests of shareholders, \n     should have the latitude to replace fund managers without \n     undue fear of reprisal, spurious litigation, and other \n     tactics by recalcitrant advisers. MFRA accordingly directs \n     the SEC to issue regulations that facilitate the process by \n     which independent directors, upon critical evaluation of fund \n     management, terminate the service of fund management in the \n     exercise of their fiduciary duties without undue exposure to \n     financial or litigation risk.\n\n                  Independent accounting and auditing\n\n       Last December, Business Week magazine called for Congress \n     to ``reverse the embarrassing exemption it gave to the \n     mutual-fund industry from the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate reform \n     law's requirement that outside auditors evaluate internal \n     controls.'' MFRA requires an audit committee, with \n     requirements that track Sarbanes-Oxley provisions, and \n     selection by that committee of an independent accountant.\n\n                          Compliance provisions\n\n        MFRA, like S.1971 introduced by Senators Corzine and Dodd, \n     draws significant inspiration from the lessons of the \n     corporate scandals that gave rise to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act \n     of 2002. While those corporate scandals triggered a massive \n     public outcry, it is noteworthy that the total cost to the \n     American public was far less than the trading abuses and \n     excessive fees in the $7 trillion mutual fund industry. Thus, \n     MFRA engenders a culture of compliance--employing tools from \n     the landmark Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n        MFRA requires adoption--by funds, investment advisers, and \n     principal underwriters--of a code of ethics, which is \n     reasonably designed to prevent violation of securities laws. \n     This code must be disclosed to the public and reviewed \n     annually. MFRA further requires appointment of a chief \n     compliance officer, whose compensation is set by independent \n     directors, who reports directly to independent directors, who \n     may be an employee of the fund adviser, but who may be \n     terminated only with the consent of the independent \n     directors.\n        MFRA requires certain certifications to ensure careful \n     monitoring and accountability. And finally, mindful of the \n     singular contribution of whistleblowers to illumination of \n     the current scandals, MFRA installs rigorous protections \n     against retaliation for disclosing violations of securities \n     laws or codes of ethics.\n\n\n                       Title 2: Fund Transparency\n\n                     Cost consolidation and clarity\n\n        For the market to discipline excessively high-cost funds, \n     investors must know total costs in comprehensive and \n     accessible disclosures. Current regulations require \n     disclosure of a fund's ``expense ratio''--but that figure \n     excludes significant costs borne directly by investors. These \n     largely hidden ``transaction costs'' occur when the fund buys \n     and sells securities in its portfolio. As the SEC recently \n     noted in its Concept Release on transaction costs, ``for many \n     funds, the amount of transaction costs incurred during a \n     typical year is substantial. One study estimates that \n     commissions and spreads alone cost the average equity fund as \n     much as 75 basis points.'' In other words, transaction costs \n     may sometimes double the cost of investment. Additional \n     transaction costs, such as market impact and opportunity \n     costs, may cost even more.\n        MFRA enhances cost disclosure in several ways. First, MFRA \n     requires standardized computation and disclosure of two cost \n     ratios: the first is the expense ratio, designed to capture \n     fund operating expenses, and the second is the transaction \n     cost ratio, designed to capture the true costs of portfolio \n     management. These two ratios must then be combined and \n     disclosed as a single ``investment cost ratio.'' MFRA \n     recognizes that certain transaction costs, such as \n     commissions and bid-ask spreads, are indisputable candidates \n     for disclosure in the ``transaction cost ratio''--while \n     others, such as market impact and opportunity costs, may more \n     precisely reflect simply the principal price a manager is \n     willing to pay (or accept) for securities, and thus may not, \n     in the ultimate judgment of the SEC, warrant computation and \n     disclosure as part of the transaction cost ratio.\n        Additionally, MFRA assists investors confronting \n     voluminous fund information with clear, simple, and at-least \n     annual actual dollar cost disclosure. Including actual cost \n     disclosure in the one document that investors do routinely \n     review--their own statement--simplifies cost analysis for all \n     investors and promotes genuine cost competition.\n        Some say that mutual fund reform invites the proverbial \n     ``rock on jello''--and that a wily industry will react to \n     reasonable restraints of one type of cost by simply shifting \n     the cost to a new label. MFRA stabilizes the mutual fund fee \n     structure. The SEC is directed to standardize all allowable \n     types or categories of fees, expenses, loads, or charges \n     borne by fund shareholders. New costs cannot be created \n     without an SEC determination that the new cost is in the best \n     interests of shareholders of (i) a particular fund, (ii) \n     certain types of funds, or (iii) funds generally. Everyone, \n     including (or perhaps especially) the mutual fund industry, \n     acknowledges the critical importance of restoring investor \n     trust. By stabilizing the fee structure--and building in \n     safeguards against cynical manipulation of complex fee \n     structures--MFRA takes the long stride toward ensuring \n     sustained investor confidence.\n       Finally, MFRA addresses financial literacy by requiring \n     clear explanation and definition of all types of fees, \n     charges, expenses, loads, commissions, and payments--as well \n     as where investors may find additional information about \n     them.\n\n           Advisor compensation and ownership of fund shares\n\n       The Sarbanes-Oxley Act turned the spotlight on executive \n     compensation--not merely to satisfy casual investor curiosity \n     but to deter conflicts of interest and distorted incentives. \n     MFRA does the same--albeit only with respect to portfolio \n     management. If, as a consequence of disclosure, fund managers \n     feel more motivated to earn their compensation, so much the \n     better for investors. It may likewise be relevant whether \n     fund managers are invested in the very funds they manage--and \n     investors are entitled to know. Finally, insider transactions \n     in the fund must be disclosed to the board of directors. \n     Insider transactions are not per se problematic--quite the \n     contrary, it may be a strong positive to have fund managers \n     invested in the funds they manage. But to help deter \n     potential abuses, the board should be informed of insider \n     transactions. (In Title 3, MFRA prohibits short-term insider \n     transactions to prevent abusive rapid trading by insiders.)\n\n                          Broker confirmations\n\n       MFRA requires point-of-sale disclosure of the source and \n     compensation to be received by the broker in connection with \n     the transaction. Such disclosure is standard with other \n     financial instruments--and broker/dealers can do the same for \n     mutual fund investors. Significantly, however, as discussed \n     below, MFRA vastly simplifies broker disclosures by \n     prohibiting certain conflict-riddled broker-compensation \n     practices--such as revenue sharing, directed brokerage and \n     soft-dollar arrangements--that artificially inflate broker \n     commissions and introduce distorted sales incentives.\n\n                          Breakpoint discounts\n\n       Breakpoint discounts are essentially ``volume discounts''--\n     reductions in sales charges for purchases beyond certain \n     thresholds. The policies for applying breakpoint discounts, \n     however, can be complicated. For example, an investor may be \n     entitled to a breakpoint discount based on total shares \n     purchased over a period of time, or from different accounts \n     or together with other family members.\n       The National Association of Securities Dealers (the self-\n     regulatory organization of brokers and dealers) estimated \n     that more than $86 million in breakpoint discounts were not \n     correctly applied by broker/dealers in 2001 and 2002, which \n     indicates investor overcharges in one out of every five \n     eligible transactions.\n       MFRA requires more prominent disclosure of information and \n     policies about breakpoint discounts, so that investors are \n     better equipped to help themselves. Perhaps more importantly \n     as discussed below under Customer Information from Account \n     Intermediaries, MFRA bridges one critical gap in the uniform \n     application of breakpoint discount policies.\n\n                        Portfolio turnover ratio\n\n       Many investors do not understand that the benign, or even \n     enticing, term--``actively managed''--may conceal \n     inordinately high transaction costs. When fund managers buy \n     and sell securities in the fund portfolio, they incur \n     transaction costs, such as commissions, bid-ask spread costs, \n     market impact costs and opportunity costs. All of these costs \n     diminish performance. To be sure, some actively managed funds \n     do very well. But investors have a right to know, in \n     straightforward terms, just how ``actively'' the portfolio is \n     managed. The portfolio turnover ratio is a good indicator. \n     MFRA requires prominent disclosure of the portfolio turnover \n     ratio, as well as explanation of its meaning and implications \n     for cost and performance. Thus, MFRA takes no legislative \n     position on the propriety of active or passive management--\n     but merely equips investors with clearer and more \n     comprehensible information so that they can make decisions \n     based upon their own investment objectives.\n\n                    Proxy voting policies and record\n\n       Mutual funds are a seven-trillion-dollar industry--and \n     control nearly one-third of U.S. equity voting power. See \n     Alan R. Palmiter, Mutual Fund Voting of Portfolio Shares: Why \n     Not Disclose? 23 Cardozo L. Rev. 1419, 1421 (March 2002). \n     That is an impressive stake in U.S. corporate governance. \n     Such enormous power is ill-suited to the shadows. MFRA \n     requires disclosure of the fund's proxy voting record, as \n     well as any proxy voting policies that may better equip \n     investors to align their mutual fund purchasing with their \n     corporate governance preferences.\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\n            Customer information from account intermediaries\n\n       Rules against market timing, application of breakpoint \n     discounts, imposition of redemption fees on short-term \n     trading--all of these salutary practices work only if the \n     fund knows the identify and trading activity of its \n     investors. But many financial intermediaries, including \n     broker/dealers, convey aggregate trading information to funds \n     through ``omnibus accounts,'' consisting of multiple \n     anonymous fund customers. Failure of a fund to know its own \n     investors seriously impairs fair and uniform enforcement of \n     its trading policies.\n       As Niels Holch, Executive Director of the Coalition of \n     Mutual Fund Investors, stated in a December 12, 2003 letter \n     to the SEC, ``individual, long-term shareholders will not \n     be guaranteed equal and fair application of fund policies, \n     procedures, fees and charges, unless and until each mutual \n     fund is provided information from its intermediaries about \n     the identity of all shareholders in omnibus accounts and \n     the individual transactions engaged in by those \n     shareholders.''\n       MFRA requires that intermediaries convey to funds the basic \n     customer identification and trading activity information \n     needed to enforce fund policies fairly and uniformly. \n     However, such information may only be used to enforce fund \n     policies, and all proprietary rights to such customer \n     information under state and federal law are preserved.\n\n                              Advertising\n\n       Mutual funds fairly compete for investor attention and \n     purchase. Indeed, because a certain percentage of investors \n     can be expected to sell their shares every year, mutual funds \n     want to meet these redemptions with new purchases so that \n     ``net redemptions'' do not force funds to sell off too many \n     portfolio assets. Advertising is one way to stimulate demand. \n     However, some funds engage in questionable claims. \n     Performance advertising, in particular, is fertile territory \n     for misleading investors. Former SEC Chief Economist Susan \n     Woodward put the matter bluntly in a recent Wall street \n     Journal op-ed: ``A fund's past performance provides zero \n     guidance about its future performance.''\n       MFRA directs the SEC to address several aspects of \n     performance advertising, including unrepresentative short-\n     term performance, performance based upon undisclosed non-\n     recurring or improbable events, and performance based upon \n     technically accurate but incomplete or misleading data.\n       Truthful and non-misleading advertising is a right \n     guaranteed by the United States Constitution. MFRA respects \n     that right--with requisite emphasis on ``non-misleading.''\n\n\n                 Title 3: Fund Regulation and Oversight\n\n       MFRA is truly structural reform. It does not merely mandate \n     yet more ``disclosure'' in an industry already saturated with \n     voluminous disclosure rules. MFRA's essence is not the \n     regulatory regime that it creates, but the free market forces \n     that it liberates. MFRA fuels a competitive mutual fund \n     market by making its transactions honest and comprehensible. \n     Market distortions occur when market players can obscure \n     their activities and mislead consumers. Examples addressed in \n     MFRA include 12b-1 fees, revenue sharing, soft-dollar \n     arrangements, and directed brokerage. MFRA lifts the veil of \n     mislabeled and misleading transactions, creates true \n     transparency and promotes meaningful competition. Merely \n     demanding more disclosure--while salutary up to a point--\n     risks encyclopedic and incomprehensible data dumps on \n     investors.\n       A more honest and straightforward, and thus more vibrantly \n     competitive, mutual fund market well serves the 95 million \n     Americans who entrust their savings to mutual funds--and not \n     incidentally, well serves the robustness of the mutual fund \n     industry itself. Mercer Bullar, founder of Fund Democracy and \n     sponsor of the recent Fund Summit in Oxford, Mississippi--\n     where 11 lawmakers, regulators, and industry leaders convened \n     to debate the direction of the industry--said of his \n     panelists that they all share the aspiration for ``America's \n     favorite retirement vehicle, a great institution, a great \n     industry, to provide the best service it can for America's \n     investors.'' That aspiration permeates the Mutual Fund Reform \n     Act of 2004. And central to that aspiration is the \n     recognition that scandal, cynicism, and revolt are inevitable \n     consequences of confusing and opaque cost schemes.\n       Time magazine notes, for example, that investors have been \n     flocking to ``separately managed accounts''--customized \n     investment vehicles with minimum investment requirements. One \n     noteworthy virtue, writes Time, of separately managed \n     accounts: ``fee transparency. Typically, separate-account \n     mangers charge a flat annual fee of 1.5% to 2.5% of assets. \n     In most cases there are none of the loads, redemption fees, \n     12b-1 marketing fees, trading commissions, or soft-dollar \n     costs that proliferate in the mutual-fund world and drive \n     annual expenses far higher than disclosed levels.'' The \n     vexation here is not merely with the ``hiddenness'' of many \n     of these costs--but with the very existence of such a \n     confusing and cynical welter of ways to siphon investors' \n     money. MFRA is a decisive answer to that vexation--and an \n     answer that well serves all Americans, not only the ones who \n     can afford the minimum investment requirements of separately \n     managed accounts and hedge funds.\n\n             Asset-based distribution expenses (Rule 12b-1)\n\n       A sales load was once an honest sales load. Then came Rule \n     12b-1. Designed in 1980 by the SEC, Rule 12b-1 permitted \n     funds to use fund assets, temporarily, for distribution and \n     market--to (1) stimulate purchases and thus redress temporary \n     net redemptions, and (2) increase the size of the fund so \n     that cost savings from economies of scale could be passed \n     along to investors. The theory was sound. But Rule 12b-1 has \n     wandered far from its original moorings. It has become a \n     permanent fixture of most fee schedules, and can cost \n     investors up to 1% of their investment every year. Over the \n     life of a retirement plan, that 1% can cost an investor 35% \n     to 40% of his or her retirement income. And it does not \n     appear that investors have benefited from economies of scale.\n       Nearly two-thirds of 12b-1 fees end up in the hands of \n     brokers. In other words, 12b-1 fees have become disguised \n     loads.\n       Fund management properly includes fund distribution. MFRA \n     accordingly places the distribution duty where it belongs. \n     MFRA gets funds out of the distribution business by \n     prohibiting asset-based distribution fees (such as 12b-1 \n     fees)--but, importantly, amends the Investment Company Act of \n     1940 to make clear that fund advisers may use their adviser \n     fees for distribution expenses. What happens when fund \n     advisers use their own profits--instead of tapping directly \n     into investors' money--for distribution expenses? \n     Distribution expenses become very reasonable.\n       In negotiating their fees with an empowered and independent \n     board, advisers will now have to make the case that their \n     costs necessarily include specified distribution expenses. \n     And once advisers receive their fee, distribution expenses \n     will, dollar for dollar, reduce adviser profits. That dynamic \n     locates the incentive to keep distribution expenses \n     reasonable precisely where it belongs. And MFRA incorporates \n     one additional structural check on unreasonable distribution \n     expenses--one that goes to the heart of the inherent conflict \n     between fund managers and fund shareholders. If the board of \n     directors determines that certain distribution expenses are \n     not in the best interests of existing shareholders, then the \n     board may stipulate that no part of the adviser's fee may be \n     used for that expense. A distribution expense designed solely \n     to pump up the asset base of an already large fund, for \n     example, and not otherwise necessary to meet net redemptions, \n     would obviously well-serve the adviser, who collects a \n     percentage of net assets, but not necessarily existing \n     shareholders.\n       Importantly, MFRA does not prohibit distribution expenses \n     or sales charges. Charging a load (subject to NASD rules) is \n     fully justified--but call it a load, make it account-based \n     and don't disguise it in a permanent asset-based distribution \n     fee.\n\n                    Indefensible brokerage practices\n\n       There is a reflexive preference in approaching our markets \n     for demanding ``disclosure'' as a total solution--and \n     sometimes as a total substitute for clear ethical and \n     practical judgments. But some practices cannot be rationally \n     defended. And some clear rules enrich and enliven our \n     markets. We do not tell football players that they can clip, \n     hold, or jump offside as long as they do so openly. We should \n     not tell fund advisers and broker-dealers that they may \n     misuse investor money with soft-dollar arrangements, revenue \n     sharing and directed brokerage as long as they file reports. \n     ``Disclosure'' of these practices merely precipitates an even \n     more confusing blizzard of incomprehensible information--and \n     even further alienates average investors from meaningful \n     participation in the mutual fund market. As former SEC \n     Chairman Arthur Levitt aptly remarked, ``[t]he law of \n     unintended results has come into play: Our passion for full \n     disclosure has created fact-bloated reports, and prospectuses \n     that are more redundant than revealing.'' Three practices--\n     soft dollar arrangements, revenue sharing, and directed \n     brokerage--ought not clutter any mutual fund prospectus. And \n     neither funds nor fund advisers should be spending time and \n     money crafting elaborate disclosures and justifications of \n     ultimately indefensible practices. By simply prohibiting \n     these practices, MFRA vastly simplifies the disclosure \n     regime, and benefits all stakeholders.\n\n                            Revenue sharing\n\n       Kiplinger.com commentator Steven Goldberg calls revenue \n     sharing ``the fund industry's most insidious practice . . . \n     It sounds benign, but it boils down to mutual fund payola, \n     giving brokers, financial planners or other financial \n     advisers a little extra compensation if they sell a load fund \n     to you. That is, a little something extra over and above the \n     load you're already paying.'' A ``little something''? Annual \n     revenue sharing payments to brokerage firms total an \n     estimated $2 billion. And investors listening to a broker's \n     ``advice'' may not realize that the broker's ``Preferred \n     List'' of mutual funds is a function of this payola.\n       Moreover, revenue-sharing, like nearly two-thirds of 12b-1 \n     money, goes to brokers, as a presumptive ``distribution'' \n     expense--yet revenue sharing effectively circumvents the \n     elaborate rules capping 12b-1 fees at no more than 1% of \n     assets. The only difference is that revenue sharing payments \n     are made by the fund adviser, out of the adviser's fee--which \n     of course comes from the fund assets. Consumer Federation of \n     America, along with several consumer groups that have \n     endorsed MFRA, note the negative impact of revenue sharing, \n     despite the fact that such payments come from the adviser \n     rather than directly\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\n     from fund assets: ``At best, by eating into the manager's \n     bottom line, the payments may reduce the likelihood that the \n     management fee will be reduced in response to economies of \n     scale. At worst, fund managers will pass along those costs to \n     shareholders in a form that is even less transparent than \n     directed brokerage payments.''\n       Revenue sharing aggravates the conflicted interests of both \n     brokers and fund advisers at the expense of fund \n     shareholders. On the one hand, brokers get payola out of the \n     fund adviser's management fee--and peddle funds they're paid \n     to peddle without the requisite regard for the investor's \n     best interests. On the other hand, fund advisers collectively \n     give away $2 billion of their evidently abundant fees to \n     promote yet further sales of fund shares, which increases \n     fund assets, which increases the adviser's fee, which makes \n     more money available for payola. MFRA breaks this investor-\n     hostile circular enrichment, and restores rational solicitude \n     for investors' money.\n\n                        Soft dollar arrangements\n\n        Under soft dollar arrangements, brokers inflate their \n     commissions on portfolio trades and give credits to fund \n     managers in return. These credits are then used for research \n     services, software, hardware, and other manager \n     ``overhead''--which directly and immediately benefit fund \n     managers, but only indirectly, if at all, benefit the \n     shareholders who pay for them. Moreover, these direct costs \n     to shareholders are not even reflected in the expense ratio, \n     because commissions--as with all transaction costs--are \n     excluded from the expense ratio. Thus, by using surreptitious \n     soft dollars, instead of honest hard dollars, the industry \n     effectively hides yet another significant cost of mutual fund \n     investment.\n        Soft dollars also effectively suppress entire markets. \n     Soft dollar arrangements distort the markets in both trade \n     executions and products and services ``purchased'' with soft \n     dollars--because there is little or no meaningful price \n     negotiation or competition in these markets. Why would there \n     be? Fund advisers use investors' money, through artificially \n     inflated brokerage commissions, and competition inevitably \n     and severely suffers when demand is driven by someone else's \n     money.\n        Managers should pay for their overhead out of their \n     management fee instead of forcing shareholders to pick up the \n     tab through artificially inflated brokerage commissions. MFRA \n     effectively ``unbundles'' the commission dollar. All \n     stakeholders can then more readily assess the true cost of \n     trade execution. And industry research and other unbundled \n     services, now purchased with hard dollars through traditional \n     negotiation, will acquire more authentic market values. Some \n     services will thrive; others will crater. That happens when \n     the market is healthy and transparent, and the demand side \n     cannot spend someone else's money.\n        MFRA's treatment of soft dollar arrangements, like its \n     treatment of 12b-1 fees, is inspired not by intent to \n     regulate private transactions--but to label such transactions \n     honestly. Just as a load is a load, and should be charged as \n     such, so research expense should be the fruit of competitive \n     negotiation for research--not the backdoor largesse of \n     forcing investors to pay inflated brokerage commissions.\n        John Montgomery of Bridgeway Funds perfectly summarized \n     the justification for banning soft dollars (as opposed to \n     mandating yet more elaborate ``disclosures'') when he \n     testified before the House Capital Markets Subcommittee in \n     March 2003: ``The bottom lines: Congress should not work to \n     improve disclosure of soft dollars; it should simply stop the \n     practice altogether. Ultimately, this will improve the \n     quality of decisions made on things soft dollars buy, save \n     shareholders some money, and greatly reduce the time that \n     advisers, auditors, regulators, and lawyers spend trying to \n     document the fairness of a firm's practice.''\n\n                           Directed brokerage\n\n        Directed brokerage is the practice by a customer (such as \n     a mutual fund or affiliated person) of directing brokerage \n     business to a particular broker or dealer in exchange for \n     services other than trade executions. Examples of such \n     services include sales support (as with revenue sharing), or \n     administrative services. Directed brokerage seems benign--but \n     the effect is yet a further hidden cost to investors, in the \n     form of higher brokerage costs. Once brokerage is \n     ``directed'' by a customer, the manager's ability to obtain \n     better or less expensive execution from a different broker is \n     disabled.\n        Last December, Louis Harvey, president of Dalbar Inc., a \n     Boston-based research company, told Investment News that the \n     practice of directed commissions obscures what best execution \n     actually costs. Thus, funds pay more than retail investors to \n     buy and sell stock. ``If the practice is done away with, it \n     will be replaced by competitive forces.''\n        In recognition of the indefensibility of the practice, \n     several funds announced recently that they are ceasing \n     directed brokerage arrangements. The industry's leading trade \n     association, the Investment Company Institute, likewise \n     recently advocated prohibiting directed brokerage.\n\n                              Late trading\n\n        Late trading is already illegal. The policy problem with \n     late trading is not with the law, but with the practice of \n     processing some orders after the calculation of ``net asset \n     value'' (NAV), and thus share price, for that day. Typically, \n     mutual funds calculate their NAVs as of 4:00 p.m. EST, the \n     closing time of the major U.S. stock exchanges. The SEC's \n     Rule 22c-1 requires funds to calculate NAV at least once a \n     day. All orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares received \n     on a particular day are executed at the same price. Under \n     Rule 22c-1, orders to buy or sell mutual fund shares must \n     be executed at a price based on the NAV next calculated \n     after receipt of the order. The Rule therefore requires \n     that orders for most funds received after 4:00 p.m. be \n     executed using the next day's price.\n       ``Late trading'' refers to the practice of submitting an \n     order to buy or redeem fund shares after the 4:00 p.m. \n     pricing time yet receiving that day's price rather than the \n     price set at 4:00 p.m. the following day, or placing a \n     conditional order prior to 4:00 p.m. that is either confirmed \n     or canceled after 4:00 p.m. A late trader typically seeks to \n     trade profitably on developments after 4:00 p.m., such as \n     earnings announcements or events in overseas markets. As \n     noted, late trading is already illegal.\n       But when is an order to buy or sell ``received'' under Rule \n     22c-1--when the fund receives the order, or when an \n     intermediary (such as a retail broker or a 401k \n     administrator) receives the order? To date, the SEC has \n     interpreted ``receipt'' as used in Rule 22c-1 to include \n     receipt of an order to buy or sell mutual fund shares by \n     retail brokers and other intermediaries. Investors may thus \n     place orders to buy or sell fund shares through broker-\n     dealers, through retirement accounts and through variable \n     insurance carriers, confident that they will receive that \n     day's price for the shares. According to some estimates, \n     mutual funds receive over half of their orders in the form of \n     aggregated orders provided by intermediaries after 4:00 p.m. \n     The SEC is currently reexamining its rules.\n       MFRA directs the SEC to enforce the current strict terms of \n     Rule 22c-1--but gives the SEC the authority to fashion rules \n     that accommodate investors transacting through their \n     preferred intermediaries. For example, if it can be verified \n     that intermediaries received their orders from their \n     customers before 4:00 p.m.--and the intermediaries have \n     systems in place that ensure compliance and permit \n     independent verification--then the rules developed by the SEC \n     may permit processing of such orders by the mutual fund after \n     the 4:00 p.m. close. MFRA's ultimate purpose is two-fold: (1) \n     preserve the appeal of mutual funds as a flexible and \n     investor-friendly vehicle for long-term investment; and (2) \n     prevent the unfair dilution of mutual fund value by short-\n     term predators.\n\n                             Market timing\n\n       ``I have no interest in building a business around market \n     timers, but at the same time I do not want to turn away $10-\n     20m,'' wrote Richard Garland, then head of Janus Capital \n     Groups international business to a colleague. Thus did Mr. \n     Garland succinctly describe the sirenic tug that triggered \n     the current industry scandals.\n       ``Market timing'' refers to a form of trading mutual fund \n     shares in which short-term investors seek to exploit a \n     perceived difference between the fund's calculated NAV and \n     the actual underlying value of the fund's portfolio holdings. \n     As earlier noted, funds must calculate their NAV and set \n     their share price at least once a day--typically at 4 p.m. \n     EST. Sometimes, the closing price of a portfolio security at \n     4:00 p.m. EST may not reflect its current market value. For \n     example, an event may occur or news may be released after \n     4:00 p.m. that can reasonably be expected to have an impact \n     on a security's price when trading resumes. Securities that \n     trade overseas are especially fertile ground for market \n     timers, because many hours may elapse between the close of \n     trading in an overseas market and the calculation of the \n     fund's NAV.\n       Market timers seek to reap quick profits in mutual fund \n     shares from these arbitrage opportunities. A market timer \n     seeks to purchase a fund's shares based on events occurring \n     before the fund's NAV calculation. For example, a market \n     timer might guess that rising prices in the U.S. securities \n     markets indicate likely higher prices in overseas markets the \n     next day. The market timer would purchase mutual fund shares \n     that reflect stale closing prices in overseas markets. The \n     market timer would then redeem the fund's shares the next \n     day, when the fund's next NAV calculation would reflect the \n     presumably higher prices in overseas markets. The market \n     timer seeks to make a quick and relatively risk-free profit.\n       Market timing is not specifically illegal--hence the \n     conundrum facing many fund advisers and other industry \n     players. But many mutual funds discourage market timing, \n     often resolutely, because timers take their profits directly \n     out of the value of shares held by long-term investors--i.e., \n     the very category of the 95 million American mutual fund \n     investors most likely to have entrusted retirement and \n     college savings to mutual funds. Sale of fund shares at an \n     artificially low price based on stale information dilutes the \n     ownership interest of existing shareholders. Similarly, \n     redemption of fund shares at an artificially high price \n     dilutes the interest of remaining shareholders.\n       Some question whether market timing strategies really work. \n     Importantly, however, merely the perception that market \n     timing works, and is available, encourages rapid trading, \n     which burdens funds regardless of whether the underlying \n     timing strategy works. A fund forced to meet multiple \n     redemptions from rapid trading activity may be obliged to \n     keep more fund assets in cash\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\n     or sell more portfolio securities to meet such redemptions--\n     which increases the fund's transactions costs at the expense \n     of existing shareholders.\n       As noted earlier, MFRA's overriding purpose with respect to \n     trading abuses is two-fold: (1) preserve the appeal of mutual \n     funds as a flexible and investor-friendly vehicle for long-\n     term investment; and (2) prevent the unfair dilution of \n     mutual fund value by short-term predators. MFRA thus \n     addresses the problem of market timing with solicitude for \n     the long-term investor, and steers market timing away from \n     the mutual funds. MFRA provisions include:\n       Requiring explicit disclosure in fund offering documents of \n     market timing policies and specific procedures to enforce \n     policies--and requiring that such a policy be deemed a \n     ``fundamental investment policy'' (which cannot, under the \n     Investment Company Act of 1940, be changed without a \n     shareholder vote).\n       Requiring that any fund that declines to adopt enforceable \n     restrictions on market timing must so advise prospective \n     investors in its prospectus, advertising, and otherwise as \n     determined by the SEC.\n       Requiring regular fair value pricing--so that NAV more \n     fairly reflects actual portfolio value, and opportunities for \n     predatory arbitrage are diminished.\n       Requiring mandatory redemption fees for short-term trading \n     (which fees are deposited back into fund assets, thus \n     benefiting all shareholders, while discouraging arbitrage by \n     increasing its cost).\n       Permitting (but not requiring) redemption fees exceeding \n     two percent for short-term transactions that are unfair to \n     shareholders.\n\n\n                            title 4: studies\n\n                Learning from experiences: Further study\n\n       MFRA seeks to perpetuate the dialogue and to preserve the \n     wisdom gathered from hard experience. Several studies are \n     directed:\n       A study and report by the SEC on the consequences of the \n     inherent conflict of interest confronting fund advisers, the \n     extent to which legislative or regulatory measures could \n     minimize this conflict of interest, and the extent to which \n     legislative or regulatory measures could incentivize internal \n     management of mutual funds.\n       A study and report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     on coordination of enforcement efforts between SEC \n     headquarters, SEC regional offices, and state regulatory and \n     law enforcement entities.\n       A study and report by GAO on the SEC's current \n     organizational structure with respect to investment company \n     regulation, and whether that organizational structure \n     sufficiently credits the importance of mutual fund oversight \n     to the 95 million mutual fund investors in America, and \n     whether certain features of that organizational structure, \n     such as the separation of regulatory and enforcement \n     functions, conduce to optimal regulatory understanding of \n     current practices.\n       A study and report by the SEC on trends and causes in \n     arbitration claims since 1995, and means to avert claims.\n       A study and report by the SEC on whether additional \n     regulation of alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge \n     funds, is appropriate to deter recurrence of trading abuses, \n     manipulation of regulated investment companies by unregulated \n     investment companies, or other distortion that may harm \n     investors in shares of registered investment companies.\n       A study by the SEC, coupled with regulatory and acquisition \n     initiatives as appropriate, designed to enhance the role of \n     the internet in educating investors and providing timely \n     information about laws, regulations, enforcement proceedings \n     and individual funds. Further, the SEC should study the \n     feasibility of mandating that funds have websites, and \n     disclosure thereupon of material filings and fund \n     information. Further, the SEC should take necessary steps to \n     ensure that its EDGAR system is user-friendly and contains a \n     search-engine that facilitates expeditious location of \n     material information in the SEC's database.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2060. A bill to permit certain local law enforcement officers to \ncarry firearms on aircraft; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nmake it easier for local law enforcement officers to travel across the \ncountry. Whether on official travel or personal travel, Federal law \nenforcement officers are allowed to carry firearms with them throughout \ntheir travel. The legislation I am introducing today would extend the \nsame privilege--and responsibility--to local law enforcement officers.\n  Ever since the horrific terrorist attacks that occurred on September \n11, we have seen how our local emergency responders, including local \nlaw enforcement officers, play a vital role in protecting not just \ntheir local communities, but the entire Nation. We think of local law \nenforcement officers as the Nation's first responders, but they are \nalso the Nation's early preventers. They are the first to identify \nlocal crimes that could turn into National attacks. They are the first \nto report suspicious behavior that could thwart a future terrorist \nattack. Stopping a terrorist threat before it becomes an attack is the \nbest way to keep our Nation safe. That effort relies upon the eyes, \nears and experience of our Nation's law enforcement officers.\n  A terrorist attack in any city is a national concern. Local law \nenforcement officers are a crucial element of the plan to protect our \nNation. I appreciate the help of Detective David Kallas and General \nCounsel John Dean Harper for bringing this issue to my attention. This \nbill will help give them and their law enforcement colleagues the \nstanding they deserve as they continue to protect our hometowns and the \nNation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2063. A bill to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to carry \nout a demonstration projects on priorities in the scheduling of \nappointments of veterans for health care through the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as I visit with veterans in North Dakota \nand here in Washington, too often I hear that waiting periods for \nmedical care, and particularly for specialty care, are too long. We owe \nan unbelievable debt to American's veterans, and it is just not right \nthat they cannot get the medical care they need when they need it. The \nlegislation I am introducing today begins to address this problem.\n  Last month, as Ranking Member of the Senate Budget committee, I \nscheduled a field hearing in Bismarck, ND, to listen to the concerns of \nveterans regarding funding for the VA. Because more than fifty percent \nof veterans in North Dakota live in highly rural areas with limited \naccess to VA medical facilities, I was particularly concerned about \nfunding for VA medical care and the continuing reports from veterans \nregarding access to care and delays in the scheduling of appointments \nfor medical care, especially speciality care.\n  Last September, I expressed similar concerns in testimony to the VA \nCARES Commission during field hearings in Minneapolis. I emphasized to \nCommission members that many North Dakota veterans have to travel \nhundreds of miles to access health care from the Fargo VA Medical \nCenter or another FA facility in VISN 23 and that the VA must do more \nto ensure timely access for appointments and other VA medical services.\n  Reports in the national press make clear, however, that significant \nproblems remain in the scheduling of appointments for medical care, \nparticularly specialty care. Further complicating matters, there are \nmany questions regarding the reliability of VA data on waiting list for \nappointments and the causes for the waiting periods according to \nreports in 2003 by the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of \nInspector General and in 2000 by the General Accounting Office.\n  In North Dakota, several veterans service officers have reported a \nnumber of veterans waiting months for eye care, orthopedics and one \nveteran waiting almost ten months for back surgery. Another veteran, \nfrom the Bismarck area, was required to travel to Iowa for cancer \ntreatment.\n  In view of these continuing concerns, I am today introducing \nlegislation that would require the VA to undertake a two year pilot \ndemonstration to study the implementation, cost and impact on VA \nservices of several recent directives by the VA relating to the \nscheduling of medical appointments. The demonstration would be \nundertaken in three VISN networks, one highly rural, one rural, and one \nurban, that represent a cross-section of VA providers.\n  Under the demonstration, the VA would offer participating veterans, \nboth new enrollees and established patients, service-connected and non-\nservice connected, an appointment for primary care evaluation, \nhospitalization including specialty care or outpatient care within a 30 \nday period. If the VA facility is unable to provide the medical care \nwithin the designated period, the Department would make arrangements \nfor the care at another VA facility or non-VA facility. Every effort,\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nhowever, would be made to provide the medical care for the veteran \nthrough the VA healthcare network.\n  Finally, because of concerns regarding the accuracy of VA data on \nappointment periods, the bill requires the VA to report to Congress by \nFY 2007 on waiting periods for health care appointments, primary care \nand speciality care services. The VA would be required to report on the \nwaiting periods for appointments by VA facility and VISN, include a \nbreakdown of waiting periods by speciality, and submit recommendations \nto Congress for addressing the shortages of medical personnel. Finally, \nthe legislation requests the Secretary, on the basis of the two year \ndemonstration, to report to Congress by FY 2007 on the costs associated \nwith implementation of the VA directive in the three VISNs and to \nreport on the estimated cost to fully implement the directive \nthroughout the VA system.\n  I am very pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Ranking Member of \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, Senator Bob Graham and \nSenators Jay Rockefeller, Tim Johnson and Daniel Akaka are joining me \nin sponsoring this legislation. I am also honored to have the strong \nsupport of the Disabled American Veterans and the AMVETS for this \nlegislative proposal. I want to express my appreciation to Dave Gorman, \nDAV Executive Director; Joseph Violante, DAV National Legislative \nDirector; Mike Dobmeier, former National Commander of the DAV and Rick \nJones, AMVETS, National Legislative Director for their support.\n  It is critical that Congress and the Administration address the \nconcerns of our veterans on the issue of waiting periods for medical \ncare before adjourning of the 108th Congress. Veterans returning from \nIraq, Afghanistan and from other peacekeeping deployments around the \nglobe should not have to wait months for needed medical care.

Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: On behalf of the more than one million \n     members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), we are \n     pleased to support your proposed legislation to assess the \n     feasibility and advisability of providing priorities in the \n     scheduling of appointments through the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) in accordance with VA's own access directives \n     and goals.\n       The highest priority for VA health care must always be the \n     core group of veterans the system was designed to treat: \n     service-connected disabled veterans, the medically indigent, \n     and those with special needs and catastrophic disabilities. \n     As you are aware, in the past year, the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs has issued two directives relating to priority care \n     and the scheduling of appointments for service-connected \n     veterans. In addition, VA has set access standards for \n     patient appointments and struggled with improving its access \n     goals of 30-30-20 for primary and specialty care \n     appointments; specifically, access to non-urgent primary care \n     appointments within 30 days, non-urgent appointments with a \n     specialist within 30 days of the date of referral, and being \n     seen by a provider at VA health care facilities within 20 \n     minutes of a patient's scheduled appointment. Despite VA's \n     efforts, we continue to hear reports from veterans of lengthy \n     delays in getting appointments for both primary and specialty \n     health care and services.\n       Through a pilot project in three Veterans Integrated \n     Service Networks representing urban, rural, and highly rural \n     areas, your bill seeks to improve access for veterans seeking \n     VA health care and to evaluate the personnel, cost, and other \n     resources necessary for VA to meet its own access goals. The \n     annual reporting requirements about delay times for primary \n     and specialty care appointments nationwide, and \n     recommendations for the allocation of personnel, financial, \n     and other resources needed to address such delays are \n     essential and will help Congress and VA better understand the \n     actual resources necessary to meet veterans health care needs \n     in a timely manner.\n       It has been abundantly clear for some time that our \n     government needs to develop long-term solutions to the \n     funding problems facing the veterans health care system. This\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\n     proposed measure will help begin to address this issue. The \n     DAV and the other major veterans groups are united in our \n     support for legislation that would guarantee an adequate \n     level of funding for the VA medical system as the key to \n     ensuring timely access to quality health care for our \n     nation's veterans. The Congress and the Administration must \n     make the commitment to provide the necessary resources to \n     fulfill the obligation to care for America's sick and \n     disabled vetrans--now and in the future.\n       Thank you for your continued interest in this issue, and \n     for sponsoring this important legislation. We greatly \n     appreciate your efforts on behalf of our nation's sick and \n     disabled veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan W. Bowers,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                       AMVETS,\n\n                                    Lantham, MD, February 9, 2004.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: It is our understanding that you plan \n     to offer legislation that would help reduce the time veterans \n     must wait for a VA doctor's appointment. AMVETS, a nationwide \n     veterans service organization, is pleased to support your \n     proposal.\n       The need for reducing the time veterans wait for medical \n     exams is well documented. A report issued last year by the \n     President's task force on improving veterans health care \n     delivery said there were nearly 300,000 veterans waiting for \n     medical services at the start of 2003.\n       While progress is being made to gain more timely care for \n     veterans, the Secretary's decision to halt enrollment of \n     certain veterans for the remainder of the year and into the \n     next fiscal year is another clear indicator that VA cannot \n     meet its own standard for scheduling and appointment within \n     30 days.\n       Your proposal would establish a two-year pilot program in \n     three Veterans Integrated Service Networks--a highly rural \n     VISN, a rural VISN, and an urban VISN--to improve access for \n     veterans seeking care and determine how much such standards \n     would cost in terms of resources and impact on other VA \n     medical services.\n       In effect, the bill provides a valuable tool to use for \n     reducing waiting times and responding to the healthcare needs \n     of veterans. Moreover, it would provide vital information on \n     the actual resource needs necessary to ensure veterans earned \n     benefits are provided in a timely manner.\n       We are grateful for your leadership in proposing this \n     legislation, and we thank you for supporting the men and \n     women who have served America's Armed Forces.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard A. Jones,\n                                    National Legislative Director.\n\n   Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend, Senator \nConrad, in support of legislation to ensure that the Department of \nVeterans Affairs meets appropriate health care access standards.\n   With more than 60,000 veterans nationwide still on waiting lists to \nsee a doctor--in some cases for more than a year--we must take measures \nto combat this problem. Right now, at the Gainesville VA Hospital in my \nhome State of Florida, there are 1,085 veterans that have been waiting \n6 months or longer to see a primary care doctor. And at the Fort Myers \nOutpatient Clinic, almost 600 veterans must wait at least a year to see \nan eye doctor. While VA has made improvements over the past year, I \nremain skeptical of their ability to rectify the problem. My concerns \nwere exacerbated by a May 2003 Inspector General report which concluded \nthat VA needed to improve their accuracy in tracking patients on \nwaiting lists.\n   The legislation Senator Conrad and I are introducing today would \nestablish three pilot programs that seek to improve the timeliness of \nveterans' access to VA health care services. The programs would first \nrequire VA to meet the access standards they set for themselves at 30 \ndays for a primary care appointment and 30 days for a specialty care \nappointment. If VA cannot schedule an appointment for a patient within \nthis timeline, then they must provide for the service elsewhere, such \nas through contracts with local private health care facilities.\n   This initiative would merely put VA's already existing access \nstandards into law, reinforcing VA's own targets and sending a message \nthat we are willing to work with VA to help combat this problem. It has \nbeen over a year now that the Department has dealt with waiting lists \nand has yet to eliminate them. We cannot continue to sit back and \ncriticize--we have provided the funding VA needs, and now we must also \ntry to assist them in other ways.\n   Most importantly, the pilot program would be cost-neutral because it \ngrants the Secretary discretion to defer from the access requirements \nif the cost of outside care exceeds that of VA's. Therefore, there will \nbe no detriment to the VA system for providing timely access to needed \nhealth care services. I know my colleagues agree that our Nation's \nveterans deserve quality health care within a reasonable time frame, \nand I urge them to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2004/02/10/senate-section/article/S809-1", "month": "02", "year": "2004", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2281.

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are approximately 1,500,000 interstate household \n     moves every year. While the vast majority of these interstate \n     moves are completed successfully, consumer complaints have \n     been increasing since the Interstate Commerce Commission was \n     abolished in 1996 and oversight of the household goods \n     industry was transferred to the Department of Transportation.\n       (2) While the overwhelming majority of household goods \n     carriers are honest and operate within the law, there appears \n     to be a growing criminal element that is exploiting a \n     perceived void in Federal and State enforcement efforts. The \n     growing criminal element tends to prey upon consumers.\n       (3) The movement of an individual's household goods is \n     unique and differs from the movement of a commercial \n     shipment. A consumer may utilize a moving company once or \n     twice in the consumer's lifetime and entrust virtually all of \n     the consumer's worldly goods to a mover.\n       (4) Federal resources are inadequate to properly police or \n     deter, on a nationwide basis, those movers who willfully \n     violate Federal regulations governing the household goods \n     industry and knowingly prey on consumers who are in a \n     vulnerable position. It is appropriate that a Federal-State \n     partnership be created to enhance enforcement against \n     fraudulent moving companies.\n\n     SEC. 4303. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title, the terms ``carrier'', ``household goods'', \n     ``motor carrier'', ``Secretary'', and ``transportation'' have \n     the meaning given such terms in section 13102 of title 49, \n     United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4304.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States successfully \n     fought the spread of Nazism and fascism by Germany, Italy, \n     and Japan.\n       (2) Nazi Germany persecuted and engaged in genocide against \n     Jews and certain other groups. By the end of the war, \n     6,000,000 Jews had perished at the hands of Nazi Germany. \n     United States Government policies, however, restricted entry \n     to the United States to Jewish and other refugees who sought \n     safety from Nazi persecution.\n       (3) While we were at war, the United States treated the \n     Japanese American, German American, and Italian American \n     communities as suspect.\n       (4) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to assess fully and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (5) During World War II, the United States Government \n     branded as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and \n     their families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification, limited their travel, and seized their \n     personal property. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (6) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those \n     nations.\n       (7) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American countries, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were captured, shipped to \n     the United States and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations during World War II, most to be exchanged for \n     Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.\n       (8) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (9) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian Americans and German American \n     communities, individuals and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (10) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution and sought safety in the United States. During \n     the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, immigration \n     regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to \n     process visa applications affected the number of Jewish \n     refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who \n     could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (11) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. __03.
