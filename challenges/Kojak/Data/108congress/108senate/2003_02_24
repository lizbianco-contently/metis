Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Chambliss, is recognized to read George \nWashington's Farewell Address.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am honored today to read George \nWashington's Farewell Address before the Senate. The tradition of \nreading this historical document was begun in 1893 and has continued \neach year with\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\nthe exception of 1895. I am humbled to sign my name to the list of \nSenators who have been privileged to read the Farewell Address in \nobservance of Washington's birthday, especially those from my home \nState of Georgia, Senators Augustus Bacon and Walter F. George.\n  George Washington, the first President of the United States, was a \nlegend in his own right by 1796, the year that the address was \npublished. Americans knew Washington as the ``Father of our Country.'' \nHe was chosen to serve two Presidential terms, and could easily have \nserved a third term with tremendous support from his fellow countrymen.\n  Washington was a man of high moral character and integrity. He was a \nfarmer, a military general, and a strong political leader whose \nleadership helped shape the foundation of our Government by balancing a \nstrong central authority with the union of States that held our \nfledgling Nation together. Washington's leadership earned him the well-\ndeserved title, ``Father of our Country.'' After the President's death, \nCongressman Henry Lee, speaking on behalf of the House of \nRepresentatives, described him as ``the first in war, the first in \npeace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.''\n  Washington's Farewell Address was printed in newspapers across the \nNation to convey his decision of voluntary retirement. George \nWashington's retirement after serving two terms may not sound odd to us \nin this day and time, but we must remember that before Washington the \nonly known entity to rule this country was the English monarchy. With \nWashington's voluntary retirement, a precedent was set regarding the \nOffice of the President. A statement was made about this announcement, \nwhich was although the person who serves in the Office of the President \nmay be disposable, the Office of the President will always be \nindispensable. This precedent was the fundamental difference between \nthe European monarchy and the Office of the President of the United \nStates of America.\n  Over time many historians have interpreted different meanings from \nthe address. Washington's Farewell Address was a communication to his \nfellow countrymen, I believe, to advise the country on how to sustain \nnational unity and purpose with or without him as President. This \nfundamental advice has stood the test of time, and will do so, I am \nsure, for many generations to come. Interestingly, many of the maxims \nset forth in the address are still applicable today.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n  The Farewell Address of President George Washington, September 19, \n1796:\n\n     To the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nindependence, the support of your tranquility at home, your peace \nabroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty which \nyou so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from different \ncauses and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many \nartifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\nany time exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\nwith indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\ncommercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand: neither \nseeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences; consulting the \nnatural course of things; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means \nthe streams of commerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers \nso disposed, in order to give trade a stable course--in order to give \nto trade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to \nenable the government to support them, conventional rules of \nintercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion \nwill permit, but temporary, and liable to be from time to time \nabandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; \nconstantly keeping in view, that it is folly in one nation to look for \ndisinterested favors from another--that is must pay with a portion of \nits independence for whatever it may accept under that character--that \nby such acceptance, it may place itself in the condition of having \ngiven equivalents for nominal favors and yet of being reproached with \ningratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to \nexpect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an \nillusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to \ndiscard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

ESTRADA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n           CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now go into executive session and resume consideration of \nExecutive Calendar No. 21, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Miguel A. Estrada, of \nVirginia, to be United States Circuit Judge for the District of \nColumbia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, as I listened to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia recite the Farewell Address of George Washington dating \nback to 1796, I could not help but think how the Founding Fathers must \nregard the debate on the confirmation of Miguel Estrada to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit that we have been having for 3 \nweeks. I rise this afternoon, at the beginning of that third week of \nSenate debate, with grave concerns about the judicial confirmation \nprocess and about how that process is being applied in this particular \ncase.\n  I am saddened to say I believe the process has degenerated into one \nwhere double standards are being applied, and games of payback that are \nreally beneath the dignity of this institution. I have actually heard \nwith my own ears, as the junior Senator from New York has said, that \nDemocrat obstructionism in this instance is justified by the manner in \nwhich confirmation proceedings have occurred in the past, using a \nphrase like ``what is good for the goose is good for the gander.''\n  That kind of language, that kind of attitude, that kind of conduct in \nthis Chamber is deeply disconcerting to me, and I suspect to all the \nAmerican people. As I have had the opportunity to say previously, many \nof us, myself included, were not in the Senate when these perceived \nslights took place in the past, but I believe what we need is a fresh \nstart with regard to judicial nominations and the judicial confirmation \nprocess, one where Presidential nominees can be given a timely hearing \nand then voted up or down without unnecessary delay and gamesmanship. \nOnly then can we discharge our responsibility and get on with the \nbusiness the American people have sent us to do, putting the public \ninterests and not special interests first.\n\n  In this instance, I am not just concerned about the unfair delays--in \nfact, Mr. Estrada was nominated by the President on May 9, 2001--I am \nalso concerned about unfair standards, double standards. Those who \noppose Mr. Estrada's confirmation will apparently stop at nothing to \nobstruct it. It must be a terrible dilemma indeed for those\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\nwho oppose this nomination because for them to win, the American dream \nmust lose.\n  Of course, the time to vote has come and gone. Yet we have only delay \nand obstruction. It does not affect only this one nomination. On every \nday the Senate has been in session since February 5, Members of this \nbody have extensively and exhaustively debated this nomination. \nPrecious Senate time, energy, and attention that could have been \ndevoted to getting the Nation's business done has simply been delayed: \nThings such as getting the economy moving again, strengthening our \nnational security, protecting our homeland, modernizing and \nstrengthening Medicare.\n  This time has been squandered by endlessly debating an obviously and \nextremely qualified nominee. So many other challenges needing this \nbody's attention have been hijacked by this delay and by those who will \nnot even allow a vote on Mr. Estrada's nomination, a truly selfish and \nunprecedented act.\n  The debates on this issue have run into the late hours of the day and \neven into the wee hours of the night. It is time, indeed it is long \npast time, to bring this debate to a close.\n  We have returned after the President's Day recess, and I hope others \nwill join with me as I join President Bush in calling for a vote on Mr. \nEstrada's nomination today.\n  Unfortunately, the Democratic leadership strategy is clear: Delay the \nnomination indefinitely in the belief that Mr. Estrada's countless \nsupporters across this Nation and across the political spectrum will \neventually grow tired and give up hope. These same leaders seek to \ndefeat Mr. Estrada, even though he commands the support of a bipartisan \nmajority of the Senate, and they want to deny the President his plan to \nplace Mr. Estrada, a role model for countless immigrants and an \ninspiration to all Americans, on to one of the most prestigious Federal \ncourts in all the land.\n  It is worth recounting who is Miguel Estrada. He is an individual of \nextraordinarily high academic achievement, having graduated magna cum \nlaude from both Columbia and Harvard Law School, and having been an \neditor on the Harvard Law Review. He is an individual who has already \nserved the public with great distinction, as a law clerk to one of \nPresident Jimmy Carter's most respected appointees on the Federal \ncourts of appeals, as a law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony \nKennedy, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and as an Assistant to the \nSolicitor General during the first Bush and Clinton administrations. \nThis is an individual who has argued 15 appeals to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, the legal equivalent of the Super Bowl, reserved for only the \nNation's very top lawyers.\n  This is an individual who has been endorsed by numerous top Clinton \nadministration lawyers and officials, including Vice President Gore's \nformer chief of staff and a former chief counsel to the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Ron Klain, the Clinton Justice Department \nSolicitor General, Seth Waxman, and several other high-ranking Clinton \nAdministration officials. This is an individual who has been supported \nby numerous Hispanic organizations, including the League of United \nLatin American Citizens, the National Hispanic Bar Association, the \nU.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the Latino Coalition, to name \nbut a few.\n  Miguel Estrada is an individual who was not born in this country but \nwho came here at age 17 from his native Honduras barely speaking \nEnglish. This is an individual described by the oldest and largest \nHispanic organization in the United States as ``truly one of the rising \nstars in the Hispanic community and a role model for our youth.'' This \nis an individual who has been rated unanimously well qualified by the \nAmerican Bar Association, which some of my Democratic colleagues have \nreferred to as the ``gold standard'' in judicial confirmation \nproceedings. And yes, this is an individual who embodies the \nrealization of the American dream for immigrants throughout our land. \nIt is no wonder that today, the beginning of the third week of debate \non this exceptional individual's nomination to the Federal bench, that \na bipartisan majority of the Senate stand ready to confirm him right \nnow without any further debate or discussion.\n  We need to do what the American people have sent us here to do. We \nneed to vote. The Democratic leadership has tried to convince Members \nof this body to vote against confirmation. But because those leaders \nhave failed to make the case for voting this nominee down, they are now \nleft with one alternative, and that is obstructing any vote on this \nnominee.\n  There is simply no reasonable case for refusing confirmation of this \nindividual to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Yet it \nseems that the Democratic leadership is obsessed with obstruction. \nBefore the November election in 2002, they obstructed President Bush's \nproposal to create a Department of Homeland Security to better ensure \nthe protection of the United States and the American people in the \nevent of further terrorist attacks. They have obstructed President \nBush's proposal to stimulate the economy by making the 2001 tax cuts \npermanent, leaving the economy flat and too many Americans out of work. \nThey also failed to pass a budget for the Federal Government last year.\n  Because of their obstruction, much of our time since January 7, 2003, \nwhen this Congress convened, has simply been devoted to cleaning up the \nmess left by the failure to get the job done last year under their \nleadership. And today they are obstructing a vote on President Bush's \nappointment of one of the most talented lawyers in our Nation to the \nFederal bench.\n  The Democratic leadership seems particularly obsessed and preoccupied \nwith obstructing Mr. Estrada's confirmation. I have wondered why that \nis. As I have already explained, he is an exceptionally qualified \nattorney and has an inspiring personal story. The Democratic leadership \ndoes not rebut any of that record, and they cannot point to any \nevidence that Mr. Estrada will not be a fair and just member of the \nFederal bench who will interpret the law as written, without injecting \nhis personal agenda or political views. Nor can they rebut his stellar \nrecord of government service as a law clerk on the U.S. Supreme Court \nand as a career Justice Department attorney, working under Democrats \nand Republicans alike. Nor can they rebut the fact that the American \nBar Association has unanimously given him the highest possible rating \nof well qualified.\n  So you might ask, why are they picking on Mr. Estrada? When I was \nback home in Texas last week during the Presidents Day recess, I read \nan editorial from the Dallas Morning News that perhaps gives us some \nclue as to why the Democratic leadership is so obsessed with \nobstructing Mr. Estrada's confirmation. They said: ``There is a time \nfor talking and a time for voting. The time has passed for the U.S. \nSenate to talk about Mr. Estrada's nomination. It is time to vote. . . \n. But . . . Democrats don't relish giving President Bush one more thing \nto brag about when he goes into Hispanic neighborhoods during his \nreelection campaign next year.''\n  I could not put it any better myself. The Democratic leadership wants \nto deny President Bush the opportunity to make history by placing an \nAmerican success story, an exceptionally talented attorney, and the \npride of the Hispanic community on one of the most prestigious courts \nin this country. Why? I am sorry to say, the answer is for petty \npartisan purposes. The Democratic leadership is frantic to stop Mr. \nEstrada, even though a bipartisan majority of the Senate stands ready \nto confirm him.\n\n  But how do you do that? How do you convince a majority of Senators to \nvote against such an exceptional individual? When you have such an \nobviously qualified person in Mr. Estrada, there is only one thing that \nthe Democratic leadership can do to stop him. There is only one tool of \nobstruction left and that is to change the rule and to create an unfair \ndouble standard.\n  Mr. President, the only tool of obstruction left for those who oppose \nthis nominee is simply to change the rules. The American people will \nnot stand for such unfair and childish behavior in the Senate.\n  Faced with a nomination of the President's exceptional nominee, the \nDemocratic leadership has no real evidence, no real facts, no real \njustification with which to oppose Mr. Estrada. As the Austin American \nStatesman has editorialized: ``If Democrats have\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\nsomething substantive to block Miguel Estrada's confirmation to the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, it's past time they \nshare it.''\n  I would refer Members to an excellent letter of February 12, 2003, \nsigned by White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, which responds to \nSenator Daschle's and Senator Leahy's renewed request for confidential \nDepartment of Justice memos written while Mr. Estrada worked in the \nOffice of Solicitor General, including for 4 years during the Clinton \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 2003.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy: On behalf of \n     President Bush, I write in response to your letter to the \n     President dated February 11, 2003. In the letter, you renew \n     your previous request for confidential Department of Justice \n     memoranda in which Mr. Estrada provided appeal, certiorari, \n     and amicus recommendations while he was a career attorney in \n     the Office of Solicitor General for four years in the Clinton \n     Administration and one year in the George H.W. Bush \n     Administration. You also request that Mr. Estrada answer \n     certain questions beyond the extensive questions that he \n     already answered appropriately and forthrightly during his \n     Committee hearing and in follow-up written responses.\n       We respect the Senate's constitutional role in the \n     confirmation process, and we agree that the Senate must make \n     an informed judgment consistent with its traditional role and \n     practices. However, your requests have no persuasive support \n     in the history and precedent of judicial appointments. \n     Indeed, the relevant history and precedent convincingly \n     demonstrate that a new and shifting standard is being applied \n     to Miguel Estrada.\n       First, as the Department of Justice explained in its \n     letters of June 5, 2002, October 8, 2002, and January 23, \n     2003, all living former Solicitors General (four Democrats \n     and three Republicans) have strongly opposed your request for \n     Solicitor General memoranda and stated that it would \n     sacrifice and compromise the ability of the Justice \n     Department to effectively represent the United States in \n     court. Even more telling, we are informed that the Senate has \n     not requested memos such as these for any of the 67 appeals \n     court nominees since 1977 who had previously worked in the \n     Justice Department (including the seven nominees who had \n     previously worked in the Solicitor General's office). The few \n     isolated examples you have cited--in which targeted requests \n     for particular documents about specific issues were \n     accommodated for nominees to positions other than the U.S. \n     Courts of Appeals--similarly do not support your request \n     here.\n       Second, as explained more fully below with respect to your \n     request that Mr. Estrada answer additional questions, the \n     only specific question identified in your letter refers to \n     this judicial role models. You claim that Mr. Estrada refused \n     to answer a question on this topic. In fact, in his written \n     responses to Senator Durbin's question on this precise \n     subject that Mr. Estrada submitted three months ago, he cited \n     Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Lewis Powell, and Judge \n     Amalya Kearse as judges he admires (he clerked for Justice \n     Kennedy and Judge Kearse), and he further pointed out, of \n     course, that he would seek to resolve cases as he analyzed \n     them ``without any preconception about how some other judge \n     might approach the question.'' Your letter to the President \n     ignores Mr. Estrada's answer to this question. In any event, \n     beyond this one query, your letter does not pose any \n     additional questions to him. Additionally, neither of you has \n     posed any written questions to Mr. Estrada in the more than \n     three months since his allday Committee hearing. Since the \n     hearing, Mr. Estrada also has met (and continues to meet) \n     with numerous Democrat Senators interested in learning more \n     about his record. Finally, as I will explain below, Mr. \n     Estrada forthrightly answered numerous questions about his \n     judicial approach and views in a manner that matches or \n     greatly exceeds answers demanded of previous appeals court \n     nominees.\n       With respect, it appears that a double standard is being \n     applied to Miguel Estrada. This is highly unfair and \n     inappropriate, particularly for this well-qualified and well-\n     respected nominee.\n       I will turn now in more detail to the various issues raised \n     by your letter. I will address them at some length given the \n     importance of this issue and the nature of your requests.\n\n       L. Miguel Estrada's Qualifications and Bipartisan Support\n\n       Miguel Estrada is an extraordinary qualified judicial \n     nominee. The American Bar Association, which Senators Leahy \n     and Schumer have referred to as the ``gold standard,'' \n     unanimously rated Estrada ``well qualified'' for the D.C. \n     Circuit, the ABA's highest possible rating. The ABA rating \n     was entirely appropriate in light of Mr. Estrada's superb \n     record as Assistant to the Solicitor General in the Clinton \n     and George H.W. Bush Administrations, as a federal prosecutor \n     in New York, as a law clerk to Justice Kennedy, and in \n     performing significant pro bono work.\n       Some who are misinformed have seized on Mr. Estrada's lack \n     of prior judicial experience, but five of the eight judges \n     currently serving on the D.C. Circuit had not prior judicial \n     experience, including two appointees of President Clinton and \n     one appointee of President Carter. Miguel Estrada has tried \n     numerous cases before federal juries, argued many cases in \n     the federal appeals courts, and argued 15 cases before the \n     Supreme Court of the United States. That is a record that few \n     judicial nominees can match. And few lawyers, whatever there \n     ideology or philosophy, have volunteered to represent a death \n     row inmate pro bono before the Supreme Court as did Miguel \n     Estrada.\n       Mr. Estrada's excellent legal qualifications are all the \n     more extraordinary given his personal history. Simply put, \n     Miguel Estrada is an American success story. He came to this \n     country at age 17 from Honduras speaking little English. \n     Through hard work and dedicated service to the United States, \n     Miguel Estrada has risen to the very pinnacle of the legal \n     profession. If confirmed, he would be the first Hispanic \n     judge to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. \n     Circuit. Given his record, his background, and his integrity, \n     it is no surprise that Miguel Estrada is strongly supported \n     by the vast majority of national Hispanic organizations. The \n     League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), for \n     example, wrote to Senator Leahy to urge Mr. Estrada's \n     confirmation and explain that he ``is truly one of the rising \n     stars in the Hispanic community and a role model for our \n     youth.'' A group of 19 Hispanic organizations, including \n     LULAC and the Hispanic National Bar Association, recently \n     wrote to the Senate urging ``on behalf of an overwhelming \n     majority of Hispanics in this country'' that ``both parties \n     in the U.S. Senate . . . put partisan politics aside so that \n     Hispanics are no longer denied representation in one of the \n     most prestigious courts in the land.''\n       The current effort to filibuster Mr. Estrada's nomination \n     is particularly unjustified given that those who have worked \n     with Miguel--including prominent Democratic lawyers whom \n     you know well--strongly support his confirmation. For \n     example, Ron Klain, who served as a high-ranking adviser \n     to former Vice President Gore and former Chief Counsel to \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee, wrote: ``Miguel is a \n     person of outstanding character, tremendous intellect, and \n     with a deep commitment to the faithful application of \n     precedent. . . . [T]he challenges that he has overcome in \n     his life have made him genuinely compassionate, genuinely \n     concerned for others, and genuinely devoted to helping \n     those in need.''\n       President Clinton's Solicitor General, Seth Waxman, wrote: \n     ``During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked together, he was a \n     model of professionalism and competence. . . . In no way did \n     I ever discern that the recommendations Mr. Estrada made or \n     the analyses he propounded were colored in any way by his \n     personal views--or indeed that they reflected any \n     consideration other than the long-term interests of the \n     United States. I have great respect both for Mr. Estrada's \n     intellect and for his integrity.``\n       A bipartisan group of 14 former colleagues in the Office of \n     the Solicitor General at the U.S. Department of Justice \n     wrote: ``We hold varying ideological views and affirmations \n     that range across the political spectrum, but we are \n     unanimous in our conviction that Miguel would be a fair and \n     honest judge who would decide cases in accordance with the \n     applicable legal principles and precedents, not on the basis \n     of personal preferences or political viewpoints.'' One former \n     colleague, Richard Seamon, wrote that he is a pro-choice, \n     lifelong Democrat with self-described ``liberal views on most \n     issues'' who said he would ``consider it a disgrace'' if Mr. \n     Estrada is not confirmed.\n       Similarly, Leonard Joy, head of the Federal Defense \n     Division of the Legal Aid Society of New York, wrote that \n     ``Miguel would make an excellent Circuit Court Judge. He is a \n     fine a lawyer as I have met and, on top of all his \n     intellectual abilities and judgment he would bring to bear, \n     he would bring a desirable diversity to the Court. I heartily \n     recommend him.''\n       Beyond the extensive personal testimony from those who \n     worked side-by-side with him for many years, the performance \n     reviews of Miguel for the years that he worked in the Office \n     of Solicitor General gave him the highest rating of \n     ``outstanding'' in every possible category. The reviews \n     stated that Miguel:\n       ``states the operative facts and applicable law completely \n     and persuasively, with record citations, and in conformance \n     with court and office rules, and with concern for fairness, \n     clarity, simplicity, and consicieness.''\n       ``[i]s extremely knowledgeable of resource materials and \n     uses them expertly; acting independently, goes directly to \n     point of the matter and gives reliable, accurate, responsive \n     information in communicating position to others.''\n       ``[a]ll dealings, oral and written, with the courts, \n     clients, and others are conducted in a diplomatic, \n     cooperative, and candid manner.''\n       ``[a]ll briefs, motions and memoranda reviewed consistently \n     reflect no policies at variance with Department or \n     Governmental policies, or fails to discuss and analyze \n     relevant authorities.''\n       ``[i]s constantly sought for advice and counsel. Inspires \n     co-workers by example.''\n       In the two years that Miguel Estrada and Paul Bender worked \n     together, Mr. Bender\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\n     signed those reviews. These employment reviews thus call into \n     serious question some press reports containing a negative \n     comment from Mr. Bender about Mr. Estrada's temperament \n     (which is the only negative comment made by anyone who \n     actually knows Mr. Estrada). Just as important, President \n     Clinton's Solicitor General Seth Waxman expressly refuted Mr. \n     Bender's statement.\n       In sum, based on his experience, his intellect, his \n     integrity, and his bipartisan support, Miguel Estrada should \n     be confirmed promptly.\n\n                         II. The Senate's Role\n\n       President Bush nominated Miguel Estrada nearly two years \n     ago on May 9, 2001. As explained above, he is well-qualified \n     and well-respected. By any traditional measure that the \n     Senate has used to evaluate appeals courts nominees, Miguel \n     Estrada should have been confirmed long ago. Your letter and \n     public statements indicate, however, that you are applying \n     both a new standard and new tactics to this particular \n     nominee.\n       As to the standard, the Senate has a very important role in \n     the process, but the Senate's traditional approach to appeals \n     court nominees, and the approach envisioned by the \n     Constitution's Farmers, is far different from the standard \n     that you now seek to apply. Senator Biden stated the \n     traditional approach in 1997: ``any person who is nominated \n     for the district or circuit court who, in fact, any Senator \n     believes will be a person of their word and follow stare \n     decisis, it does not matter to me what their ideology is, as \n     long as they are in a position where they are in the general \n     mainstream of American political life, and they have not \n     committed crimes of moral turpitude, and have not, in fact, \n     acted in a way that would shed a negative light on the \n     court.'' Congressional Record, March 19, 1997. Alexander \n     Hamilton explained that the purpose of Senate confirmation is \n     to prevent appointment of ``unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.'' Federalist No. 76. It was \n     anticipated that the Senate's approval would not often be \n     refused unless there were ``special and strong reasons for \n     the refusal.'' No. 76.\n       As to tactics, you have indicated that some Senate \n     Democrats intend to filibuster to prevent a vote on this \n     nominee. As you know, there has never been a successful \n     filibuster of a court of appeal nominee. Only a few years \n     ago, Senator Leahy and other Democrat Senators expressly \n     agreed with then-Governor Bush that every judicial nominee \n     was entitled to an up-or-down floor vote within a reasonable \n     time. On October 3, 2000, for example, Senator Leahy stated:\n       ``Governor Bush and I, while we disagree on some issues, \n     have one very significant issue on which we agree. He gave a \n     speech a while back and criticized what has happened in the \n     Senate where confirmation are held up not because somebody \n     votes down a nominee but because they cannot ever get a vote. \n     Governor Bush said: You have the nominee. Hold the hearing. \n     Then, within 60 days, vote them up or vote them down. Don't \n     leave them in limbo. Frankly, that is what we are paid to do \n     in this body. We are paid to vote either yes or no--not vote \n     maybe. When we hold a nominee up by not allowing them a vote \n     and not taking any action one way or the other, we are not \n     only voting `maybe,' but we are doing a terrible \n     disservice to the man or woman to whom we do this.''\n       Senator Daschle similarly stated on October 5, 1999, that \n     ``[t]he Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down. An up or down vote, \n     that is all we seek for Berzon and Paez. And after years of \n     waiting, they deserve at least that much.''\n       In his East Room speech of October 30, 2002, President Bush \n     reiterated that every judicial nominee deserves a timely up-\n     or-down vote in the Senate, no matter who is President or \n     which party controls the Senate. Contrary to President Bush's \n     attempts at permanent reform to bring order to the process, \n     your current effort to employ a filibuster and block an up-\n     or-down vote on the Estrada nomination may significantly \n     exacerbate the cycle of bitterness and recrimination that \n     President Bush has sought to resolve on a bipartisan basis. \n     We fear that the damage caused by a filibuster could take \n     many years to undo. To continue on this path would also be, \n     in Senator Leahy's words, ``a terrible disservice'' to Mr. \n     Estrada. We urge you to reconsider this extraordinary action, \n     to end the filibuster of Mr. Estrada's nomination, and to \n     allow the full Senate to vote up or down.\n\n         III. Request for Confidential Solicitor General Memos\n\n       You have suggested that Mr. Estrada's background, \n     experience, and support are insufficient to assess his \n     suitability for the D.C. Circuit. You have renewed your \n     request for Solicitor General memos authored by Mr. Estrada. \n     But every living former Solicitor General signed a joint \n     letter to the Senate opposing your request. The letter was \n     signed by Democrats Archibald Cox, Walter Dellinger, Drew \n     Days, and Seth Waxman. They stated: ``Any attempt to intrude \n     into the Office's highly privileged deliberations would come \n     at the cost of the Solicitor General's ability to defend \n     vigorously the United States' litigation interests--a cost \n     that also would be borne by Congress itself. . . . Although \n     we profoundly respect the Senate's duty to evaluate Mr. \n     Estrada's fitness for the federal judiciary, we do not think \n     that the confidentiality and integrity of internal \n     deliberations should be sacrificed in the process.''\n       It bears mention that the interest asserted here is that of \n     the United States, not the personal interest of Mr. Estrada. \n     Indeed, Mr. Estrada himself testified that ``I have not \n     opposed the release of those records. . . . I am \n     exceptionally proud of every piece of legal work that I have \n     done in my life. If it were up to me as a private citizen, I \n     would be more than proud to have you look at everything that \n     I have done for the government or for a private client.''\n       The history of Senate confirmations of nominees who had \n     previously worked in the Department of Justice makes clear \n     that an unfair double standard is being applied to Miguel \n     Estrada's nomination. Since the beginning of the Carter \n     Administration in 1977, the Senate has approved 67 United \n     States Court of Appeals nominees who previously had worked in \n     the Department of Justice. Of those 67 nominees, 38 had no \n     prior judicial experience, like Miguel Estrada. The \n     Department of Justice's review of those nomination records \n     disclosed that in none of those cases did the Department of \n     Justice produce internal deliberative materials created by of \n     the Department. In fact, the Department's review disclosed \n     that the Senate did not even request such materials for a \n     single one of these 67 nominees.\n       Of this group of 67 nominees, seven were nominees who had \n     worked as a Deputy Solicitor General or Assistant to the \n     Solicitor General. These seven nominees, nominated by \n     Presidents of each party and confirmed by Senates controlled \n     by each party, included Samuel Alito, Danny Boggs, William \n     Bryson, Frank Easterbrook, Daniel Friedman, Richard Posner, \n     and Raymond Randolph.\n       The five isolated historical examples you have cited do not \n     support your current request. In each of those five cases, \n     the Committee made a targeted request for specific \n     information primarily related to allegations of misconduct or \n     malfeasance identified by the Committee. Even in those \n     isolated cases, the vast majority of deliberative memoranda \n     written by those nominees were neither requested nor \n     produced. With respect to Judge Bork's nomination, for \n     example, the Committee received access to certain particular \n     memoranda (many related to Judge Bork's involvement in \n     Watergate-related issues). The vast majority of memoranda \n     authored by Judge Bork were never received. With respect to \n     Judge Trott, the Committee requested documents unrelated to \n     Judge Trott's service to the Department. So, too, in the \n     three other examples you cite, the Committee requested \n     specific documents primarily related to allegations have been \n     made in the case of Mr. Estrada.\n       In sum, the examples you have cited only highlight the lack \n     of precedent for the current request. As the Justice \n     Department has explained to you previously, the existence of \n     a few isolated examples where the Executive Branch on \n     occasion accommodated a Committee's targeted requests for \n     very specific information primarily related to allegations of \n     misconduct does not in any way alter the fundamental and \n     long-standing principle that memos from the Office of \n     Solicitor General--and deliberative Department of Justice \n     memoranda more broadly--must remain protected in the \n     confirmation context so as to maintain the integrity of the \n     Executive Branch's decisionmaking process. That is a \n     fundamental principle that has been followed irrespective of \n     the party that controls the White House and the Senate.\n       Your continued requests for these memoranda have provoked a \n     foreseeable and inevitable conflict that, in turn, has been \n     cited as a basis for obstructing a vote on Mr. Estrada's \n     nomination. Respectfully, the conflict is unnecessary because \n     your desire to assess the nominee can be readily accommodated \n     in many ways other than intruding into the severely damaging \n     the deliberative process of the Office of Solicitor General. \n     For example, you can review Mr. Estrada's written briefs and \n     oral arguments both as an attorney for the United States and \n     in private practice. As you know, those documents are \n     publicly available and easily accessible, that said, we would \n     be pleased to facilitate your access to them. (Mr. Estrada's \n     hearing transcript suggests that no Democrat Member of the \n     Committee had read Mr. Estrada's many dozens of Solicitor \n     General merits briefs, certiorari petitions, and opposition \n     briefs or the transcripts of his 14 oral arguments when he \n     represented the United States.) You also may consider the \n     opinions of others who served in the Office at the same time \n     (discussed above) and examine the nominee's written \n     performance reviews (also discussed above). There is more \n     than ample information for you to assess Mr. Estrada's \n     qualifications and suitability for the D.C. Circuit based \n     on the traditional standards the Senate has employed.\n       It also is important to recognize that political appointees \n     of President Clinton have read virtually all of the memoranda \n     in question--namely, the Democrat Solicitors General Drew \n     Days, Walter Dellinger, and Seth Waxman. None of those three \n     highly respected Democrat lawyers has expressed any concern \n     whatever about Mr. Estrada's nomination. Indeed, Mr. Waxman \n     wrote a letter of strong support, and Mr. Days made public \n     statements in support of Mr. Estrada.\n       In sum, the historical record and past precedent \n     convincingly demonstrate that this request creates and \n     applies an unfair double standard to Miguel Estrada.\n\n[[Page S2558]]\n\n      IV. Request That Miguel Estrada Answer Additional Questions\n\n       Your letter also suggests that Miguel Estrada should answer \n     certain questions that he allegedly did not answer in his \n     hearing. To begin with, we do not know what your specific \n     questions are. In addition, this request frankly comes as a \n     surprise given that (i) Senator Schumer chaired the hearing \n     on Mr. Estrada, (ii) the hearing lasted an entire day, (iii) \n     Senators at the all-day hearing asked numerous far-reaching \n     questions that Mr. Estrada answered forthrightly and \n     appropriately, and (iv) only two of the 10 Democrat Senators \n     then on the Committee even submitted any follow-up written \n     questions, and they submitted only a few questions (in marked \n     contrast to other nominees who received voluminous follow-up \n     questions).\n       It also bears mention that Mr. Estrada has personally met \n     with a large number of Democrat Senators, including Senators \n     Landrieu, Lincoln, Bill Nelson, Ben Nelson, Leahy, Feinstein, \n     Kohl, and Breaux; is scheduled to meet with Senator Carper, \n     and would be pleased to meet with additional Senators.\n       The only specific question your letter identifies refers to \n     Mr. Estrada's judicial role models, and you claim that he \n     refused to answer a question on this topic. In fact, in Mr. \n     Estrada's written responses to Senator Durbin's questions on \n     this precise subject, Mr. Estrada cited Justice Anthony \n     Kennedy, Justice Lewis Powell, and Judge Amalya Kearse as \n     judges he admires, and he further pointed out, of course, \n     that we would seek to resolve cases as he analyzed them \n     ``without any preconception about law some other judge might \n     approach the question.''\n       In our judgment, moreover, Mr. Estrada answered the \n     Committee's questions in a manner that was both entirely \n     appropriate and entirely consistent with the approach that \n     judicial nominees of President of both parties have taken for \n     many years. Your suggestions to the contrary do not square \n     with the hearing record or traditional practice.\n\n\n              A. Judicial Ethics and Traditional Practice\n\n       In assessing your request that Miguel Estrada did not \n     answer appropriate questions, we begin with rules of judicial \n     ethics that govern prospective nominees. Canon 5A(3)(d) \n     provides that prospective judges' ``shall not . . . make \n     statements that commit or appear to commit the candidate with \n     respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to \n     come before the court'' (emphasis added). Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall made the point well in 1967 when asked about the \n     Fifth Amendment: ``I do not think you want me to be in a \n     position of giving you a statement on the Fifth Amendment and \n     then, if I am confirmed and sit on the Court, when a Fifth \n     Amendment case comes up, I will have to disqualify myself.'' \n     Lloyd Cutler, who served as Counsel to President Carter and \n     President Clinton, has stated that ``candidates should \n     decline to reply when efforts are made to find out how they \n     would decide a particular case.''\n       In 1968, in the context of the Justice Abe Fortas' \n     nomination to be Chief Justice, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee similarly stated: ``Although recognizing the \n     constitutional dilemma which appears to exist when the Senate \n     is asked to advise and consent on a judicial nominee without \n     examining him on legal questions, the Committee is of the \n     view that Justice Fortas wisely and correctly declined to \n     answer questions in this area. To require a Justice to state \n     his views on legal questions or to discuss his past decisions \n     before the Committee would threaten the independence of the \n     judiciary and the integrity of the judicial system itself. It \n     would also impinge on the constitutional doctrine of \n     separation of powers among the three branches of Government \n     as required by the Constitution.'' S. Exec. Rep. No. 8, 90th \n     Cong. 2d Sess. 5 (1968).\n       Even in the context of a Supreme Court confirmation \n     hearing, Senator Kennedy defended Sandra Day O'Connor's \n     refusal to discuss her views on abortion: ``It is offensive \n     to suggest that a potential Justice of the Supreme \n     Court must pass some presumed test of judicial philosophy. It \n     is even more offensive to suggest that a potential justice \n     must pass the litmus test of any single-issue interest \n     group.'' Nomination of Sandra O'Connor: Hearings Before the \n     Senate Comm. on the Judiciary on the Nomination of Judge \n     Sandra Day O'Connor of Arizona to Serve as an Associate \n     Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, 97th Cong. \n     6 (1981) (statement of Sen. Kennedy).\n       Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg likewise declined to answer \n     certain questions: ``Because I am and hope to continue to be \n     a judge, it would be wrong for me to say or to preview in \n     this legislative chamber who I would cast my vote on \n     questions the Supreme Court may be called upon to decide. \n     Were I to rehearse here what I would say and how I would \n     reason on such questions, I would act injudiciously.'' \n     Similarly, Justice John Paul Stevens stated in his hearing: \n     ``I really don't think I should discuss this subject \n     generally, Senator. I don't mean to be unresponsive but in \n     all candor I must say that there have been many times in my \n     experience in the last five years where I found that my first \n     reaction to a problem was not the same as the reaction I had \n     when I had the responsibility of decisions and I think that \n     if I were to make comments that were not carefully though \n     through they might be given significance that they really did \n     not merit.''\n       Justice Ginsburg described the traditional practice in a \n     case decided last year: ``In the context of the federal \n     system, how a prospective nominee for the bench would resolve \n     particular contentious issues would certainly be `in \n     interest' to the President and the Senate . . . But in accord \n     with a longstanding norm, every Member of this Court declined \n     to furnish such information to the Senate, and presumably to \n     the President as well.'' Republican Party of Minnesota v. \n     White, 122 S. Ct. 2528, 2552 n. 1 (2002) (Ginsburg, J., \n     dissenting) (emphasis added). Justice Ginsburg added that \n     this adherence to this ``longstanding norm'' was ``crucial to \n     the health of the Federal Judiciary.'' Id. In his majority \n     opinion, Justice Scalia did not take issue with that \n     description and added: ``Nor do we assert that candidates \n     for judicial office should be compelled to announce their \n     views on disputed legal issues.'' Id. at 2539 n.11 \n     (emphasis in original).\n       In some recent hearings, including Mr. Estrada's, Senator \n     Schumer has asked that nominees identify particular Supreme \n     Court cases of the last few decades with which they disagree. \n     But the problems with such a question and answer were well \n     stated by Justice Stephen Breyer. As Justice Breyer put it, \n     ``Until [an issue] comes up, I don't really think it through \n     with the depth that it would require. . . . So often, when \n     you decide a matter for real, in a court or elsewhere, it \n     turns out to be very different after you've become informed \n     and think it through for real than what you would have said \n     at a cocktail party answering a question.'' 34 U.C. Davis L. \n     Rev. 425, 462.\n       Senator Schumer also has asked nominees how they would have \n     ruled in particular Supreme Court cases. Again, a double \n     standard is being applied. The nominees of President Clinton \n     did not answer such questions. For example, Richard Tallman, \n     a nominee with no prior judicial service who would now serves \n     on the Ninth Circuit, not only would not answer how he would \n     have ruled as a judge in Roe v. Wade--but even how he would \n     have ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson, the infamous case that \n     upheld the discredited and shameful ``separate but equal'' \n     doctrine. So, too, in the hearing on President Clinton's \n     nomination of Judges Barry and Fisher, Senator Smith asked \n     whether the nominees would have voted for a constitutional \n     right to abortion before Roe v. Wade. Chairman Hatch \n     interrupted Senator Smith to say ``that is not a fair \n     question to these two nominees because regardless of what \n     happened pre-1973, they have to abide by what has happened \n     post-1973 and the current precedents that the Supreme Court \n     has.''\n\n\n                      b. answers by miguel estrada\n\n       Miguel Estrada answered the Committee's question \n     forthrightly and appropriately. Indeed, Miguel Estrada was \n     more expansive than many judicial nominees traditionally have \n     been in Senate hearings, and he was asked a far broader range \n     of questions than many previous appeals court nominees were \n     asked. We will catalogue here a select sample of his answers.\n     Unenumerated rights, privacy, and abortion\n       When asked by Senator Edwards about the Constitution's \n     protection for rights not enumerated in the Constitution, Mr. \n     Estrada replied: ``I recognize that the Supreme Court has \n     said [on] numerous occasions in the area of privacy and \n     elsewhere that there are unenumerated rights in the \n     Constitution, and I have no view of any sort, whether legal \n     or personal, that would hinder me from applying those rulings \n     by the court. But I think the court has been quite clear that \n     there are a number of unenumerated rights in the \n     Constitution. In the main, the court has recognized them as \n     being inherent in the right of substantive due process and \n     the liberty clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.''\n       When asked by Senator Feinstein whether the Constitution \n     encompasses a right to privacy and abortion, Mr. Estrada \n     responded, ``The Supreme Court has so held, and I have no \n     view of any nature whatsoever, whether it be legal, \n     philosophical, moral, or any other type of view that would \n     keep me from applying that case law faithfully.'' When asked \n     whether Roe v. Wade was ``settled law,'' Mr. Estrada replied, \n     ``I believe so.''\n     General approach to judging\n       When asked by Senator Edwards about judicial review, Mr. \n     Estrada explained: ``Courts take the laws that have been \n     passed by you and give you the benefit of understanding that \n     you take the same oath that they do to uphold the \n     Constitution, and therefore they take the laws with the \n     presumption that they are constitutional. It is the \n     affirmative burden of the plaintiff to show that you have \n     gone beyond your oath. If they come into court, then it is \n     appropriate for courts to undertake to listen to the legal \n     arguments--why it is that the legislature went beyond [its] \n     role as a legislat[ure] and invaded the Constitution.''\n       Mr. Estrada stated to Senator Edwards that there are 200 \n     years of Supreme Court precedent and than it is not the case \n     that ``the appropriate conduct for courts is to be guided \n     solely by the bare text of the Constitution because that is \n     not the legal system that we have.''\n       When asked by Senator Edwards whether he was a strict \n     constructionist, Mr. Estrada replied that he was ``a fair \n     constructionist''--meaning that ``I don't think that it \n     should be the goal of courts to be strict or lax. The goal of \n     courts is to get it right. . . . It is not necessarily the \n     case in my mind that, for example, all parts of the \n     Constitution are suitable for the same type of interpretative \n     analysis. . . . [T]he Constitution says, for example, that \n     you must be 35 years\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\n     old to be our chief executive. . . . There are areas of the \n     Constitution that are more open-ended. And you adverted to \n     one, like the substantive component of the due process \n     clauses, where there are other methods of interpretation that \n     are not quite so obvious that the court has brought to bear \n     to try to bring forth what the appropriate answer should \n     be.''\n       When Senator Kohl asked him about environmental statutes, \n     for example, Mr. Estrada explained that those statutes come \n     to court ``with a strong presumption of constitutionality.''\n       In response to Senator Leahy, Mr. Estrada described the \n     most important attributes of a judge: ``The most important \n     quality for a judge, in my view Senator Leahy, is to have an \n     appropriate process for decisionmaking. That entails having \n     an open mind. It entails listening to the parties, reading \n     their briefs, going back beyond those briefs and doing all of \n     the legwork needed to ascertain who is right in his or her \n     claims as to what the law says and what the facts [are]. In a \n     court of appeals court, where judges sit in panels of three, \n     it is important to engage in deliberation and give ear to the \n     view of colleagues who may have come to different \n     conclusions. And in sum, to be committed to judging as a \n     process that is intended to give us the right answer, not to \n     a result. And I can give you my level best solemn assurance \n     that I firmly think I do have those qualities or else I would \n     not have accepted the nomination.''\n       In response to Senator Durbin, Miguel Estrada stated that \n     ``the Constitution, like other legal texts, should be \n     construed reasonably and fairly, to give effect to all that \n     its text contains.''\n       Mr. Estrada indicated to Senator Durbin that he admired the \n     judges for whom he clerked, Justice Kennedy and Judge Kearse, \n     as well as Justice Lewis Powell.\n       Mr. Estrada stated to Senator Durbin that ``I can \n     absolutely assure the Committee that I will follow binding \n     Supreme Court precedent until and unless such precedent has \n     been displaced by subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court \n     itself.''\n       In response to Senator Grassley, Mr. Estrada stated: ``When \n     facing a problem for which there is not a decisive precedent \n     from a higher court, my cardinal rule would be to seize aid \n     from anyplace where I could get it. Depending on the nature \n     of the problem, that would include related case law in other \n     areas that higher courts had dealt with that had some \n     insights to teach with respect to the problem at hand. It \n     could include the history of the enactment, including in the \n     case of a statute legislative history. It could include the \n     custom and practice under any predecessor statute or \n     document. It could include the views of academics to the \n     extent that they purport to analyze what the law is instead \n     of--instead of prescribing what it should be. And in sum, as \n     Chief Justice Marshall once said, to attempt not to overlook \n     anything from which aid might be derived.''\n       In response to Senator Sessions, Mr. Estrada stated: ``I am \n     very firmly of the view that although we all have views on a \n     number of subjects from A to Z, the first duty of a judge is \n     to self-consciously put that aside and look at each case by \n     starting withholding judgment with an open mind and listen to \n     the parties. So I think that the job of a judge is to put all \n     of that aside, and to the best of his human capacity to give \n     a judgment based solely on the arguments and the law.''\n       In response to Senator Sessions, Mr. Estrada stated that \n     ``I will follow binding case law in every case. . . . I may \n     have a personal, moral, philosophical view on the subject \n     matter. But I undertake to you that I would put all that \n     aside and decide cases in accordance with binding case law \n     and even in accordance with the case law that is not binding \n     but seems constructive on the area, without any influence \n     whatsoever from any personal view I may have about the \n     subject matter.''\n     Miranda/Stare decisis\n       Mr. Estrada stated that United States v. Dickerson--a case \n     raising the question whether Miranda should be overruled--\n     reflected a ``reasonable application of the doctrine of stare \n     decisis. In my view, it is rarely appropriate for the Supreme \n     court to overturn one of its own precedents.''\n     Affirmative action\n       With respect to affirmative action, Mr. Estrada responded \n     to Senator Kennedy that ``any policy views I might have as a \n     private citizen on the subject of affirmative action would \n     not enter into how I would approach any case that comes \n     before me as a judge. Under controlling Supreme Court \n     authority, particularly Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, \n     515 U.S. 200 (1995), if a government program creates a racial \n     classification, it will be subject to strict scrutiny. \n     Whether the program survives that sort of scrutiny will often \n     involve a highly contextual and fact-specific inquiry into \n     the nature of the justifications asserted by the government \n     and the fit between those justifications and the \n     classification at issue. Adarand and similar cases provide \n     the framework that I would be required to apply, and would \n     apply, in considering these issues as a judge.''\n       Asked by Senator Leahy about the strict scrutiny test, Mr. \n     Estrada replied, ``the Supreme Court in the Adarand case \n     stated, as a general rule, that the consideration of race is \n     subject to strict scrutiny. That means that though it may be \n     used in some cases, it has to be justified by a compelling \n     state interest. And with respect to the particular context, \n     there must be a fairly fact-bound individual assessment of \n     the fit between the interest that is being asserted and the \n     category being used. That is just another way of saying that \n     it is a very fact-intensive analysis in the context of a \n     specific program and in the context of the justifications \n     that are being offered in support of the program.''\n     Congressional authority\n       With respect to the outer limits of Congress' power to \n     confer authority on other governmental bodies, Miguel \n     responded to Senator Kennedy that the Supreme Court has said \n     that ``particular factual context is significant in analyzing \n     the appropriateness of a particular delegation. . . . Of \n     course, the fact that the Supreme Court only rarely has \n     struck down statutes on this ground suggests that the Court \n     has been quite deferential to congressional judgments about \n     the types of delegations that reasonably might be needed to \n     carry on the business of government.''\n       When Senator Kohl asked Mr. Estrada about the 1995 Lopez \n     case concerning the scope of Congress' power to regulate, Mr. \n     Estrada pointed out that he had argued in a companion case \n     ``for a very expansive view of the power to Congress to pass \n     statutes under the Commerce Clause and have them be upheld by \n     the court. . . . Lopez has given us guidance on when it is \n     appropriate for the court to exercise the commerce power. It \n     is binding law and I would follow it.''\n     Ethnicity\n       With respect to the fact that the President had noted \n     Miguel's ethnicity, Miguel responded to Senator Kennedy: \n     ``The President is the leader of a large and diverse country, \n     and it is accordingly appropriate for him, in exercising his \n     constitutional nomination and appointment powers, to select \n     qualified individuals who reflect the breadth and diversity \n     of our Nation.''\n       With respect to the Democrat Congressional Hispanic \n     Caucus's criticism of him, Miguel responded to Senator \n     Kennedy that ``I strongly disagree, however, with the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus' view that I lack an \n     understanding of the role and importance of courts in \n     protecting the legal rights of minorities, of the values and \n     mores of Latino culture, or the significance of role models \n     for minority communities.''\n     Racial discrimination\n       With respect to race discrimination, Mr. Estrada stated in \n     response to Senator Kennedy: ``I take a backseat to no one in \n     my abhorrence of race discrimination in law enforcement or \n     anything else.''\n       Senator Feingold asked Mr. Estrada whether he believed that \n     racial profiling and racially motivated law enforcement \n     misconduct are problems in this country today. Mr. Estrada \n     replied, ``I am--I will once again emphasize I'm unalterably \n     opposed to any sort of race discrimination in law \n     enforcement, Senator, whether it's called racial profiling or \n     anything else. . . . I know full well that we have real \n     problems with discrimination in our day and age.''\n       Senator Leahy asked Mr. Estrada about whether statistical \n     evidence of discriminatory impact is relevant in establishing \n     discrimination. Mr. Estrada replied: ``I am not a specialist \n     in this area of the law, Senator Leahy, but I am aware that \n     there is a line of cases, beginning with the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Griggs, that suggests that in appropriate cases \n     that [such evidence] may be appropriate. . . . I do \n     understand that there is a major area of law that deals with \n     how you prove and try disparate-impact cases.''\n     Congressional authority to regulate firearms\n       Senator Feinstein asked whether Congress may legislate in \n     the area of dangerous firearms, and Mr. Estrada responded \n     that the Supreme Court had ruled that ``if the government \n     were to prove that the firearm had at any time in its \n     lifetime been in interstate commerce even if that had nothing \n     to do with the crime at issue, that that would be an adequate \n     basis for the exercise of Congress' power.''\n     Right to counsel\n       Senator Edwards asked about Gideon v. Wainwright, the \n     Supreme Court case guaranteeing the right to counsel for poor \n     defendants who could not afford counsel. Although Senator \n     Edwards appeared to question the reasoning in that landmark \n     case, Mr. Estrada responded that ``I frankly have always \n     taken it as a given that that's--the ruling in the case.''\n\n\n               c. answers by president Clinton's nominees\n\n       Your criticism of Miguel Estrada's testimony creates a \n     double standard. You did not require nominees of President \n     Clinton to answer questions of this sort (keeping in mind \n     that you have not identified what your additional questions \n     to Mr. Estrada are). President Clinton's appeals court \n     nominees routinely testified without discussing their views \n     of specific issues or cases. A few select examples, including \n     of several nominees who had no prior judicial experience, \n     illustrate the point. (Please note that these are isolated \n     examples; there are many more we can provide if necessary).\n       Merrick Garland (no prior judicial experience). In the \n     nomination of Merrick Garland to the D.C. Circuit, Senator \n     Specter asked him: ``Do you favor, as a personal matter, \n     capital punishment?'' Judge Farland replied only that he \n     would follow Supreme Court precedent: ``This is really a \n     matter of settled law now. The Court has held that capital \n     punishment is constitutional and lower courts are to follow \n     that rule.'' Senator Specter also asked him about is views of \n     the\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\n     independent counsel statute's constitutionality, and Judge \n     Garland responded: ``Well, that, too, the Supreme Court in \n     Morrison v. Olson upheld as constitutional, and, of course, I \n     would follow that ruling.'' Judge Garland did not provide his \n     personal view of either subject.\n       Judith Rogers. In the hearing on Judge Judith Rogers' \n     nomination to the D.C. Circuit, Judge Rogers was asked by \n     Senator Cohen about the debate over an evolving Constitution. \n     Judge Rogers responded: ``My obligation as an appellate judge \n     is to apply precedent. Some of the debates which I have heard \n     and to which I think you may be alluding are interesting, but \n     as an appellate judge, my obligation is to apply precedent. \n     And so the interpretations of the Constitution by the U.S. \n     Supreme Court would be binding on me.'' She then was asked \n     how she would rule in the absence of precedent and responded: \n     ``When I was taking my mater's in judicial process at the \n     University of Virginia Law School, one of the points \n     emphasized was the growth of our common law system based on \n     the English common law judge system. And my opinions, I think \n     if you look at them, reflect that where I am presented with a \n     question of first impression, that I look to the language of \n     whatever provision we are addressing, that I look to whatever \n     debates are available, that I look to the interpretations by \n     other Federal courts, that I look to the interpretations of \n     other State courts, and it may be necessary, as well, to look \n     at the interpretations suggested by commentators. And within \n     that framework, which I consider to be a discipline, that I \n     would reach a view in a case of first impression.'' Finally, \n     Judge Rogers was asked her view of the three-strikes law and \n     stated: ``As an appellate judge, my obligation is to enforce \n     the laws that Congress passes or, where I am now, that the \n     District of Columbia Council passes.'' Judge Rogers did not \n     provide her personal view of these subjects.\n       Marsha Berzon (no prior judicial experience). Senator Smith \n     asked her views on Roe v. Wade and whether ``an unborn child \n     is a human being.'' Judge Berzon stated: ``[M]y role as a \n     judge is not to further anything that I personally believe or \n     don't believe, and I think that is the strength of our system \n     and the strength of our appellate system. The Supreme Court \n     has been quite definitive quite recently about the applicable \n     standard, and I absolutely pledge to you that I will follow \n     that standard as it exists now, and if it is changed, I will \n     follow that standard. And my personal views in this area, as \n     in any other, will have absolutely no effect.'' When Senator \n     Smith probed about their personal views on abortion and Roe \n     v. Wade, Chairman Hatch interrupted: ``I don't know how they \n     can say much more than that at this point in this meeting.''\n       Richard Tallman (no prior judicial experience). In response \n     to written questions, Judge Tallman explained that \n     ``[j]udicial nominees are limited by judicial ethical \n     considerations from answering any question in a manner that \n     would call for an `advisory opinion' as the courts have \n     defined it or that in effect ask a nominee to suggest how he \n     or she would rule on an issue that could foreseeably require \n     his or her attention in a future case or controversy after \n     confirmation.'' He was asked how he would have ruled in \n     Plessy v. Ferguson. He stated: ``It is entirely conjectural \n     as to what I would have done without having the opportunity \n     to thoroughly review the record presented on appeal, the \n     briefs and arguments of counsel, and supporting legal \n     authorities that were applicable at that time.'' He gave the \n     same response when asked how he would have ruled on Roe v. \n     Wade. When asked his personal view on abortion, he wrote: ``I \n     hold no personal views that would prevent me from doing my \n     judicial duty to follow the precedent set down by the \n     Supreme Court.'' He gave the same answer about the death \n     penalty.\n       Kim Wardlaw. In the hearing on Judge Kim Wardlaw's \n     nomination to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Wardlaw was asked \n     about the constitutionality of affirmative action. She stated \n     (in an answer similar to Miguel Estrada's answer to the same \n     question): ``The Supreme Court has held that racial \n     classifications are unconstitutional unless they are narrowly \n     tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest.''\n       Maryanne Trump Barry. In the hearing on Judge Maryanne \n     Trump Barry's nomination to the Third Circuit, Senator Smith \n     asked for her personal opinion on whether ``an unborn child \n     at any stage of the pregnancy is a human being.'' Judge Barry \n     responded: ``Casey is the law that I would look at. If I had \n     a personal opinion--and I am not suggesting that I do--it is \n     irrelevant because I must look to the law which binds me.''\n       Raymond Fisher. In the hearing on Judge Raymond Fisher's \n     nomination to the Ninth Circuit, Senator Sessions asked Judge \n     Fisher's own personal views on whether the death penalty was \n     constitutional. Judge Fisher responded that ``My view, \n     Senator, is that, as you indicated, the Supreme Court has \n     ruled that the death penalty is constitutional. As a lower \n     appellate court judge, that is the law that I am governed by. \n     I don't want in my judicial career, should I be fortunate \n     enough to have one, to inject my personal opinions into \n     whether or not I follow the law. I believe that the precedent \n     of the Supreme Court is binding and that is what my function \n     is.''\n\n\n                             v. conclusion\n\n       Miguel Estrada is a well-qualified and well-respected \n     judicial nominee who has very strong bipartisan support. \n     Based on our reading of history, we believe that you have \n     ample information about this nominee and have had more than \n     enough time to consider questions about his qualifications \n     and suitability. We urge you to stop the unfair treatment, \n     and the filibuster, allow an up-or-down vote, and vote to \n     confirm Mr. Estrada.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alberto R. Gonzales,\n                                         Counsel to the President.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. The first instance of a double standard being applied to \nMr. Estrada by those who oppose an up-or-down vote is that, as \nopponents charge, Mr. Estrada cannot serve on the D.C. Circuit Court \nbecause he has no judicial experience. Yet the fact is that a majority \nof the judges who currently serve on that court had no prior judicial \nexperience. That's right, they never served as a judge before the \nSenate voted to confirm them to serve in that important position.\n  Let's take one case as an example. Judge Merrick Garland was \nnominated by President Clinton and confirmed by a Republican-controlled \nSenate. Like Mr. Estrada, Judge Garland graduated from Harvard Law \nSchool magna cum laude, clerked for a prominent judge on the Second \nCircuit, and then later clerked for a Supreme Court Justice. Both Mr. \nEstrada and Mr. Garland served as assistant U.S. attorneys. Both worked \nat the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. Both practiced law in \nthe private sector. Both enjoyed bipartisan support, and neither had \nprior judicial experience. It took the Senate just a few months to \nconfirm Judge Garland.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. Estrada has waited 21 months, and still the Democratic \nleadership will not allow a vote on his confirmation.\n  But why stop there? If prior judicial experience were really so \nimportant to serving on a Federal court of appeals, why did the Senate \nvote to confirm Thurgood Marshall to the Second Circuit? Why did the \nSenate vote to confirm Stephen Breyer to the First Circuit? Why did the \nSenate vote to confirm Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the DC Circuit? And why \ndid the Senate confirm John Paul Stevens to the Seventh Circuit? \nIndeed, why did the Senate confirm Anthony Kennedy to the Ninth \nCircuit? None of these individuals, all of whom have subsequently \nserved on the U.S. Supreme Court, had any prior judicial service before \nthey were nominated to the circuit courts and confirmed.\n  Moreover, since the beginning of the Carter administration in 1977, \nthe Senate has approved 38 nominees to the Federal courts of appeals \nwho have previously worked at the Justice Department but never held \njudicial office, exactly like Miguel Estrada.\n  There is also a double standard being applied when opponents to \ncalling an up-or-down vote, advocates and proponents of this \nobstructionism, claim that Mr. Estrada cannot be confirmed until the \nJustice Department hands over all confidential documents he wrote as an \nAssistant to the Solicitor General.\n  This request would be too laughable if it was not so transparent and \nso cynical. First, Mr. Estrada does not even have control of these \nmemos, and he has said he does not object if the Justice Department \ndecides to release them. Second, Senator Daschle and Senator Leahy \nknow, were Mr. Estrada to somehow provide it, that it would violate \nethical rules which benefit the American people and the entire U.S. \nGovernment, including Congress, whose acts the Department of Justice is \ncharged with defending and enforcing in court.\n  Of course, this fishing expedition is unprecedented evidence, again, \nof a double standard being applied to Mr. Estrada. Since the beginning \nof the Carter administration in 1977, the Senate has confirmed 67 \nnominees to the Federal courts of appeals who have previously worked \nfor the Justice Department, including seven who worked as Deputy \nSolicitors General, or Assistants to the Solicitor General. Yet in none \nof these cases was the nominee required to produce such materials \nprotected by the attorney-client privilege. In fact, the Justice \nDepartment has determined that the Senate did not even request such \nmaterials for a single one of those 67 nominees.\n  Again, Mr. Estrada served in the Solicitor General's Office during \nthe entire first term of the Clinton Administration, from 1993 to 1997. \nThat means\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\nthe Solicitors General for whom he worked during that time were all \nDemocratic political appointees of President Clinton. None of these \nSolicitors General, I believe it is significant, have raised any \nobjection to Mr. Estrada. Moreover, all former Solicitors General, all \nformer living Solicitors General, both Democratic and Republican, for \nethical reasons, oppose the request for these documents made by Senator \nDaschle and Senator Leahy.\n\n  There is a third double standard being applied to Miguel Estrada by \nthe Democratic leadership, those who would obstruct an up-or-down vote \non this highly qualified nominee. They claim he has inappropriately \nrefused to answer specific questions indicating how he would rule on \nspecific legal questions that might come before him as a judge. Mr. \nPresident, Miguel Estrada is not running for election. He seeks to be a \njudge. It would be both wrong and unfair for him to prejudge those \nissues, issues that might well come before him as a judge. Indeed, this \nprinciple has been recognized by Supreme Court Justices Stevens, \nSouter, Breyer, and Ginsburg, who recently explained:\n\n       [H]ow a prospective nominee for the bench would resolve \n     particular contentious issues would certainly be ``of \n     interest'' to the President and the Senate in the exercise of \n     their respective nomination and confirmation powers. . . . \n     But in accord with a longstanding norm, every Member of [the \n     Supreme] Court declined to furnish such information to the \n     Senate. . . . [T]he line each of us drew in response to \n     preconfirmation questioning . . . is crucial to the health of \n     the Federal Judiciary.\n\n  I will not belabor the point here, but the letter written by White \nHouse Counsel Alberto Gonzales documents numerous Clinton judicial \nFederal nominees who answered just as Mr. Estrada did, just as these \nU.S. Supreme Court Justices did, to similar questions posed by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Yet all of these nominees were confirmed.\n  It becomes abundantly clear on examination that the Democratic \nleadership, so bent on obstruction of any up-or-down vote on Mr. \nEstrada's confirmation, is not really interested in the answers to \nthese questions as they claim. Consider this: After a whole day of \nhearings, the Senate Judiciary Committee released Mr. Estrada. They \ndidn't ask him to come back and answer more questions. They released \nhim. While it is common practice for members to submit follow-up \nquestions to the nominee, only 2 of the 10 Democratic Senators on the \ncommittee bothered to ask only a few followup questions, in stark \ncontrast to other nominees who have received voluminous written \nquestions.\n  So I say there is really no objection that Mr. Estrada has failed to \ncomply with the Senate's traditional standards for confirming nominees \nby refusing to answer specific questions. Yet this is just another \nexample of the Democratic leadership's double standard that seeks to \nstop Miguel Estrada.\n  Finally, Democrat leaders are seeking to impose a double standard by \ninsisting that 60 Senators must vote to close debate before a vote can \nbe had on Mr. Estrada's confirmation.\n  This is not legislation. This is a confirmation. The Constitution \ndoes not say 60 Senators must approve a judicial nomination. The \nConstitution does not say two-thirds of Senators must give advice and \nconsent to a judicial nomination, as it does specifically say with \nregard to treaties. It just says the Senate shall give its advice and \nconsent, which means a simple majority vote--not two-thirds of the \nSenate, but 51 votes. The fact is that 51 Senators--indeed, 54, as I \ncount them, a bipartisan majority of this Senate--stand ready to \nconfirm Mr. Estrada to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia Circuit if they would just be allowed to vote.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, no judicial nominee \nto the circuit court of appeals has ever been denied confirmation by \nfilibuster--not once in the entire history of the Senate. Yet the \nDemocratic leadership has seen fit to change the rules again--another \ndouble standard--as their only hope for stopping a bipartisan majority \nof the Senate from confirming the superbly qualified Miguel Estrada.\n  But one of the most remarkable things I have seen in the last 3 weeks \nas I have observed this debate was an argument that was featured on the \nfinal day of Senate debate before the President's Day recess. On \nFriday, February 14, the senior Senator from Illinois argued in effect \nthat the Constitution forbids confirming Mr. Estrada because the Senate \nhas not sufficiently investigated him.\n  I quote from my colleague's speech on the Senate floor:\n\n       [U]nder the Constitution, which we have sworn to uphold, \n     and which we take very seriously, in article II, section 2, \n     it says:\n       The President . . . shall nominate, and by and with the \n     Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges \n     of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United \n     States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided \n     for. . . .\n       This tells those who are watching that what is at stake \n     here is not just a discretionary decision by the Senate as to \n     whether or not we will investigate a judicial nominee. We \n     have a constitutional obligation. And if we believe in that \n     investigation that a nominee is wanting, might not be a \n     person suited to serve in the Federal judiciary, I think we \n     are duty bound to vote against him.\n\n  I am dumbfounded by this constitutional argument, particularly coming \nfrom a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Of course, we would \nwelcome that vote he speaks of, even if some, based upon an erroneous \nconstitutional standard, would choose to vote no on this nominee.\n  But for the life of me, I cannot understand why the Senator can make \nsuch an argument based on any review of the Constitution or the history \nof judicial confirmations. The only thing I can think of is that my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--some of them anyway, \nbecause, as I said, there is a bipartisan majority of the Senate that \nstands ready to confirm Mr. Estrada today--but at least the Democratic \nleadership has simply decided to do whatever it takes and to make any \nargument, no matter how implausible, however devoid of any basis in law \nor in fact, to maintain this unprecedented filibuster against an \nexceptionally qualified nominee.\n  The filibuster effort appears to have become so desperate, in fact, \nthat they might even argue that the Constitution requires a filibuster. \nI know, however, that the Senator from Illinois takes the Constitution \nvery seriously, as all of us do. And so I hope I can just take a few \nmoments to discuss what the Constitution contemplates in this regard \nand convince my colleague to reconsider his argument.\n  My distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Illinois, argues \nthat for the Senate to confirm Mr. Estrada now would violate the \nConstitution because the Senate has failed to conduct an adequate \ninvestigation. I would be the first to say the Senate's advice and \nconsent function is indeed an important function, particularly when you \nare dealing with lifetime-tenured judicial appointees. Each of us \nindeed has undertaken an oath to ``support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States.''\n  That Constitution includes a firm commitment to the doctrine of \nseparated powers. Under the Constitution, the Congress legislates, the \nPresident executes the laws, and it is the courts that interpret the \nlaws--not make laws.\n  It bears repeating. Judges interpret laws. They aren't legislators \nwearing black robes--at least they are not supposed to be. The only \nbody of our Government that legislates is the Congress. The \nConstitution, of course, demands that judges respect this fundamental \ndistinction--one that, in the debates on this nominee, some seem to \nhave been glossed over. I recall even one argument by the senior \nSenator from Vermont to the effect that Mr. Estrada ought to have to \nbasically run on a platform, as he would when he runs for election to \nthe U.S. Senate from Vermont, making no distinction between the fact \nthat a Senator is a representative, and a judge is a representative of \nno one other than the law.\n  I believe in the last 3 weeks that our solemn duty to advise and \nconsent and investigate this particular nominee has been more than \ncomplied with. Certainly in the last 2 years every Senator in this body \nhas had more than an adequate opportunity to investigate and study Mr. \nEstrada's qualifications. I can't imagine any judicial nominee who has \nbeen more vigorously investigated than Mr. Estrada. So we are hardly \ntalking about the Senate being\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\nrailroaded into confirming an individual without time to think, without \ntime to reflect, without time to investigate, and after a full and \nthorough debate.\n  Mr. Estrada has been very clear about his judicial philosophy. He has \nsaid that nothing in his personal views would prevent him from \nfollowing the law. That is very important in a judge. We want to make \nsure that the only judges we confirm are those who will follow the law \nas written by the legislature and is handed down in precedents by the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Senate has undertaken a substantial investigation into Mr. \nEstrada already, and in so doing has developed a record that amply \nsupports Mr. Estrada's sworn testimony about how he would conduct \nhimself as a judge.\n  That record includes strongly supported statements from numerous \nwitnesses across the political spectrum, including prominent Clinton \nAdministration lawyers. I go back to Ron Klain, whom I mentioned \nearlier was Vice President Gore's Chief of Staff and a former \nDemocratic chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has \nknown Mr. Estrada since their days together at Harvard, and has \nconcluded that Mr. Estrada would ``faithfully follow the law.''\n  President Clinton's Solicitor General, Seth Waxman, flatly rejected \nany notion that ``the recommendations Mr. Estrada made or the analyses \nthat he prepared were colored in any way by his personal views.'' A \nbipartisan group of 14 of Mr. Estrada's former colleagues in the Office \nof Solicitor General have written:\n\n       We hold varying ideological views and affiliations that \n     range across the political spectrum, but we are unanimous in \n     our conviction that Miguel would be a fair and honest judge \n     who would decide cases in accordance with the applicable \n     legal principles and precedents, not on the basis of personal \n     preferences or political viewpoints.\n\n  I could go on and on.\n  The FBI has investigated Mr. Estrada and given him a clean bill of \nhealth. The American Bar Association has investigated him and given him \na unanimous well-qualified rating--the highest that the American Bar \nAssociation has to offer.\n  The Senate has more than discharged its responsibility, with respect \nto Mr. Estrada, to confirm as judges only those individuals who respect \nthe law and who respect the distinction between judging and \nlegislating, those who will not politicize our courts, and those who \nwill put aside personal views and enforce laws as written by Congress \nand by our Founders.\n  I submit that our colleagues who oppose this vote on this highly \nqualified nominee have again changed the rules and imposed a double \nstandard by contending that, not withstanding this ample record and \nvigorous investigation, the Senate must still go further and must \ninquire evermore deeply into Mr. Estrada's personal views. When \nconfirmed, Mr. Estrada will behave as a judge and not as a legislator. \nThe Senate needs nothing further in order to confirm him to the Federal \nbench other than to simply vote.\n  The Constitution requires a majority of the Senate for an individual \nto be confirmed to judicial office. Although this is an important \nfunction, it is also the lowest threshold level of Congressional \nparticipation contemplated anywhere in the Constitution. By contrast, \nto enact legislation requires a majority of both Houses of Congress, \nnot just the Senate. To authorize the President to ratify a treaty \nrequires a two-thirds vote of this body. To impeach and convict a \nFederal official requires the approval of both Houses of Congress, \nincluding two-thirds of the Senate. Amending the Constitution and \noverriding a Presidential veto requires two-thirds of both Houses of \nCongress. In other words, the Constitution makes it easier for the \nSenate to confirm judicial nominees than it does to enact legislation, \nconsent to treaties, punish an official during an impeachment effort, \nor to amend the Constitution.\n  Professor Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional scholar and author of a \nscholarly volume called ``The Federal Appointments Process,'' has \nreviewed all of these constitutional provisions and compared them to \nthe Senate's advice and consent function with respect to nominees and \nconcluded that ``[t]he Constitution . . . establishes a presumption of \nconfirmation''--a presumption of confirmation--``that works to the \nadvantage of the President and his nominees.'' In fact, I think Mr. \nGerhardt is on to something.\n  Here again, this is not just about Miguel Estrada. The Democratic \nleadership seeks to defeat a constitutional presumption of confirmation \nin the judicial confirmation process. They are still fighting the last \nelection by and through the person of Miguel Estrada. Although the \ncountry has embraced this President and his great leadership, the \nDemocratic leadership is still fighting against it, seeking to defeat \nPresident Bush wherever and whenever they can.\n  The constitutional structure demonstrates that the Senate's role is \nsatisfied when the record makes clear that whatever a nominee's \npersonal views, that they will play no role in how the nominee will \njudge specific cases and controversies. After all, to do otherwise \nwould mean that it would take practically all of the Senate's time to \nconfirm Presidential nominees, leaving no room for legislation, \ntreaties, and other matters to which the Constitution gives even more \nresponsibility to Congress than in the confirmation process.\n  The Constitution nowhere requires a majority of the Senate to \nundertake a full-blown trial of a judicial nominee. Yet that seems to \nbe what the Democratic leadership is asking for. Quite to the contrary, \nthe Framers of the Constitution well understood that the Senate's role \nin the process is really quite limited--something it does us well to \nreflect on, with the confirmation process today so skewed and so \npoisoned, and so toxic, toxic not only to the nominees but also to this \nbody.\n  As Alexander Hamilton explained in the Federalist Papers, the \nConstitution gives the Senate a confirmation role to ensure that the \nPresident has not injected cronyism into his appointment process. \nAlexander Hamilton does not say that the Senate is supposed to second-\nguess the President's judgment or to conduct a deep and searching \ninquiry into the legal views of the nominee--the sorts of things that \nare being asked for here. Instead, Alexander Hamilton writes, in \nFederalist No. 76:\n\n       To what purpose then require the cooperation of the Senate? \n     . . . It would be an excellent check upon a spirit of \n     favoritism in the President, and would tend greatly to \n     prevent the appointment of unfit characters from State \n     prejudice, from family connection, from personal attachment, \n     or from a view to popularity.\n\n  Indeed, far from indicating that substantial hearings and \ninvestigation would be required, Hamilton noted that the Senate's \nconfirmation role would be, ``in general, a silent operation.''\n  Hamilton's understanding of the confirmation process--that it would \nlargely be what he called ``a silent operation''--is reflected in the \ntext of the Constitution. By contrast, the impeachment provisions of \nthe Constitution require the Senate to undertake an actual trial before \nan official can be punished, including removal from office.\n  So it is clear that the text, the structure, the original \nunderstanding, and, indeed, the tradition of confirmation proceedings \nhanded down these last 200 years all refute the theory of Senate advice \nand consent suggested by those who would obstruct this vote, including \nthe views expressed by the senior Senator from Illinois and those who \nwould espouse a new standard, one made of whole cloth, again changing \nthe rules and applying a double standard to Miguel Estrada.\n  Once the Senate has determined that an otherwise qualified judicial \nnominee respects the law and understands that judges interpret the law \nand do not make the law, that nominee may be confirmed to the Federal \nbench. It is absurd to think that the Constitution would require \nanything else.\n  Moreover--and this is significant, to show how far afield we have \ncome from the confirmation process as practiced by the Founding Fathers \nand those in the last 200 years--for much of our Nation's history, the \nSenate did not even conduct confirmation hearings, not even for \nnominees to the U.S. Supreme Court. Instead, the Senate either deferred \nto the President's determination that the nominee would abide by \nconstitutionally required distinctions between judging and law making, \nor would reject nominees without resort to intrusive hearings.\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\n  Indeed, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary did not even exist \nduring the first half century of this country's existence--nearly 30 \nyears after the ratification of the Constitution. It did not even exist \nuntil 1816. And even when such hearings were later held in our Nation's \nhistory, by custom, the nominee would not even appear.\n  The first extensive hearings on a Supreme Court nominee were not held \nuntil the nomination of Louis Brandeis in 1916. Yet despite those \nhearings, Mr. Brandeis never even appeared in person before the Senate \nor a committee.\n  On September 5, 1922, the day after Justice John Hessin Clarke \nresigned, President Harding nominated George Sutherland to the Supreme \nCourt, and the Senate confirmed him that very day. It was not until \nHarlan Fiske Stone, in 1925, that the first nominee for the U.S. \nSupreme Court would actually appear in person before the Judiciary \nCommittee, and even that was a novel episode, after which nominees \nwould revert back to the tradition of not appearing personally before \nthe Judiciary Committee. That tradition continued for over a decade, \nuntil Felix Frankfurter testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee \nin 1939. Even then, Justice Frankfurter read a prepared statement in \nwhich he said he would not express his personal views on controversial \nissues before the court, the same answer that Mr. Estrada has given in \nresponse to the questions asked him during these proceedings.\n  As late as 1949, Sherman Minton refused to appear before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and was still confirmed. And it was not until 1955, \nwhen John Marshall Harlan started the modern tradition of judicial \nnominees appearing and testifying before the Senate. And even then, \nconfirmation hearings have typically been brief, even in cases of \nSupreme Court nominations. Justice Byron White's confirmation, for \nexample, in 1962, lasted less than 2 hours.\n  Can it really be the position of the senior Senator from Illinois or \nour colleagues across the aisle who are blocking a vote on this \nnomination that the countless Federal judges and Supreme Court Justices \nwho were confirmed following a less extensive investigation than that \nalready inflicted on Mr. Estrada all served pursuant to illegal \nconfirmations? Did so many of our predecessors in the Senate violate \nthe constitutional oath they took on each and every one of those \noccasions? Of course not.\n  The nomination of Miguel Estrada is the unfortunate culmination of a \ndestructive judicial confirmation process that must stop. It must stop \nfor the health and the proper functioning of this institution. It must \nstop so that the confidence of the public in the job we are here \nperforming on their behalf can continue. This destructive judicial \nconfirmation process must stop, so that Presidents, now and in the \nfuture, will be able to nominate candidates for judicial office, who \notherwise might not be willing to subject themselves to this \nunreasonable process that has been so much in evidence during the \ncourse of Miguel Estrada's confirmation.\n  The obstruction must stop. The double standard for Miguel Estrada \nmust stop. This filibuster especially must stop.\n  Across the country, the American people are insisting that the Senate \ntake a vote on this exceptional and inspiring candidate for the Federal \nbench. Newspapers across my State of Texas--the Dallas Morning News, \nthe El Paso Times, the Austin American-Statesman, the Fort Worth Star-\nTelegram--are all urging that the Democratic leadership permit a vote \non this nominee.\n  I say let's stop the games. Let's stop the double standard. Let's \nvote. Of course, every Senator is entitled to vote according to the \ndictates of their conscience, but let's vote.\n  There is no basis for the current unprecedented attempt to deny a \nbipartisan majority of the Senate from the opportunity to even vote up \nor down on this nominee. That has never before happened in the history \nof the United States.\n  It should not start today. It should certainly not start against a \nnominee of such exceptional talent. In the words of the Washington \nPost: ``Just vote.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). The Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nstatement, the Senator from California be recognized to speak on a \nsubject not related to this nomination and following that Senator \nGrassley be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, and I probably will not, I \nunderstand the Senator from California wishes to speak on a topic other \nthan the nomination of Miguel Estrada. If I am correct, I am wondering \nwhy, if there is no further debate on the nomination, we cannot proceed \nto a vote. With that said, I withdraw my reservation.\n  We do have speakers for this afternoon on the nomination. I would \nhope that we can remain on the nomination. I believe Senator Grassley \nwill be here about 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there objection or is there not \nobjection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Grassley be \nrecognized following Senator Feinstein's remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object or not object?\n  Mr. CORNYN. With that, I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that was part of the unanimous consent \nrequest, that Senator Grassley be recognized.\n  I have been involved in many debates in the Senate. I have been \ninvolved in the debate since the beginning on the Estrada nomination. \nSenator Hatch and I have been here until 1 o'clock in the morning. \nNever have I heard the name calling and the statements such as ``heard \npeople talking about payback.'' If there are statements that strong, \nthey should be inserted in the Record.\n  In addition, in my many years in the Senate, I have not heard \nstatements such as ``desperate,'' ``laughable,'' ``cynical,'' and then \npart of it I was not able to hear because the Presiding Officer was \ntalking to me, but I hope the debate on this matter will remain \nsenatorial and not go to name calling. We have a right to speak about \nthis nomination for as long as we want until the majority or someone \nfiles a motion to invoke cloture. That is the way to stop debate.\n  There has been a lot of talk about not allowing a vote. We are not \nstopping a vote. The only situation is, the Senate rules are such that \nif you want to have a vote and you want to stop the debate, you invoke \ncloture. It takes 16 or 17 Senators to file a cloture motion. That is \nhow it works.\n  We need to understand that there are certain issues that are \nimportant. I recognize there is a lot more to do in this country. We \nhave a lot to do. I believe that what is happening here is an effort to \ncover for the fact that there is nothing being done by the majority. \nThey could pull off this anytime they wanted. If they have other things \nto do, let the majority move to something else or invoke cloture to \nstop the debate from going forward.\n  There have been statements made that this has never happened before. \nOf course, you shouldn't talk to the Abe Fortas family. The fact is, if \nyou read a history book, that is how that was stopped, his nomination \nto be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  In the years I have served in the Senate, there have not been, as \nSenator Hatch said, real filibusters, but sometimes those nonreal \nfilibusters have stopped nominations from going forward. It is a fact. \nMr. President, the ABA gold standard--let's talk about that a little \nbit. My friend from Texas talks about this ABA stamp of approval being \nso important. As the Presiding Officer knows, and I am sure most every \nSenator knows, the majority, when they were in the majority before we \ntook over, wanted to do away with the ABA. We thought it was a good \nthing that it continue. I still feel that way, in spite of the lack of \ncredibility of this nomination.\n\n  The reason I say that is the person who moved forward on this \nnomination for the ABA--I am sure he asked for it and he got it--was a \nman by the name of Fred Fielding. Mr. Fielding, of course, likes \nEstrada. That is very clear.\n  Mr. Fielding, who evaluated Mr. Estrada's record and qualifications, \nis\n\n[[Page S2564]]\n\na partner at Wiley, Rein & Fielding. While serving on the ABA committee \nto evaluate judicial nominees, Mr. Fielding continued to be actively \ninvolved in partisan activities, such as working with counsel for the \nRepublican National Committee. He served on the Bush-Cheney transition \nteam. Of course, then he wrote a report recommending Miguel Estrada to \nthe DC Circuit Court.\n  If those partisan activities were not enough, take this and see if it \nhas any bearing on whether this was an impartial evaluation. While \nstill serving on the ABA committee responsible for peer review ratings, \nFielding cofounded the Committee for Justice with Bush confidant and \nformer Bush White House counsel C. Boydon Gray. They formed this \ncommittee to help the White House with public relations and in its \neffort to pack the court and run ads against Democrats who dare vote \nagainst their judicial nominees.\n  In addition to forming this group, he served as deputy counsel to \nPresident Nixon. He served on the Reagan-Bush campaign team, the \nLawyers for Reagan advisory group. With the Reagan-Bush transition \nteam, he was conflict-of-interest counsel--which is really interesting \nto me--in that process. He served in the Office of Counsel to the \nPresident. He worked as deputy counsel to President Reagan. He served \non the Bush-Quayle campaign. He was Republican National Committee legal \nadvisor, campaign counsel to Senator Quayle, and he served as deputy \ndirector to the Bush-Quayle campaign in 1992 as a senior legal advisor. \nHe served then as legal advisor to the Dole-Kemp campaign.\n  Virtually all of Mr. Fielding's substantial Federal election \ncontributions are for Republican candidates or the Republican National \nCommittee. The Bush White House could not have handpicked someone with \nbetter partisan credentials than Mr. Fielding to evaluate its DC \nCircuit Court nominees--and especially Mr. Estrada. Which lawyers, \nRepublican or Democrat, would be courageous enough to be candid with \nany concerns that may have been existing about Mr. Estrada's \nqualifications, temperament, or rating, with an insider like Fielding \nwriting the evaluation and recommending the ratings?\n  It is noteworthy that when Fielding testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee last September, he was asked about the Senate's consideration \nof ideology of judicial nominees, as well as the White House's. When \nasked whether the Republican Presidents he served ever appointed a \nliberal, he said he hoped not.\n  Obviously, the White House took ideology into account in choosing \nEstrada. How fortunate it was for the White House that the loyalist, \nMr. Fielding, was there to recommend such a high rating for Estrada, \ndespite his youth, lack of experience, and the types of cases he \nhandled in the DC Circuit, and temperament and fairness issues that \nhave been raised by many others.\n\n  We do appreciate the ABA's continued efforts, but if there were ever \na review and revamping that needs to take place, take a look at \nFielding and Estrada. It is simply unethical for this to take place. If \nthere were ever a conflict of interest, this is it.\n  Now, there were continued statements by the distinguished junior \nSenator from Texas, who has served in the Senate now going on 2 months, \nabout the need for a vote. I agree. As I said earlier, if the majority \nwants a vote, it is up to them. They can have one in 2 days. File a \ncloture motion and it ripens in 2 days. The vote is up to them.\n  There are also statements made that the Democratic leaders have \nfailed to make a case. If the case is so bad, let them file a cloture \nmotion. My friend from Texas said the Democratic leaders--I assume I am \none of those--are obsessed with obstruction. If that is the case and we \nare name-calling here, it appears with what has happened to the \neconomy, the Republican majority must be obsessed with deficits. The \nPresident takes office and there is a $7 trillion surplus. Now, in this \nyear alone, we will have the largest single deficit in the history of \nthe world. You see it printed in the paper, that it is $350 billion. \nThat is without the disguise that takes place because of the Social \nSecurity surpluses. It is closer to $500 billion. The surplus of $7 \ntrillion is history--gone, every penny of it. It is not because of the \nwar; it is because of economic policies of this administration and the \ntax cuts.\n  Now, it is very difficult for me to do, but I listened, and my friend \nfrom Texas says what they are doing is cleaning up the mess from the \nlast Congress. As I recall, the Senate passed all 13 appropriations \nbills out of committee. But we could not get the House to move on them. \nWhy? Because they refused to take votes prior to the November elections \nbecause they knew the American people would not stand for the draconian \ncuts they had in their bills. So nothing was done. We went on a \ncontinuing resolution. If there was a mess created last Congress, it \nwasn't by the Senate. We reported out of committee, chaired by Senator \nByrd, with ranking member Senator Stevens, every one of the \nappropriations bills. We did that. The House refused to take hard \nvotes.\n  Mr. President, the speaker before me also indicated the fact that Mr. \nEstrada has no judicial experience should not matter, should not be \ndeterminative. I agree. There are great judges who had no judicial \nexperience. We are not making that an issue.\n  LULAC. As most everyone knows, the vast majority of Hispanic groups \nin the country, 85 to 90 percent of them, support the position we are \ntaking, which is that Miguel Estrada should not be a member of the DC \nCircuit Court until he answers questions and has his memos from when he \nworked at the Solicitor General's Office made public. We believe that \nto be the case. That is why the Hispanic groups support our position.\n  LULAC, which is a fine organization, wrote a letter last week. It was \nwritten to Senators Hatch and Daschle. Among other things, it said:\n\n       We do not subscribe to this view at all and we do not wish \n     to be associated with such accusations.\n\n  What are those? The accusations that the Senate Democrats and \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus are opposing the nomination because of \nhis ethnicity.\n  What does LULAC say?\n\n       We do not subscribe to this view at all and we do not wish \n     to be associated with such accusations.\n\n  They should just back away from that. The letter says:\n\n       LULAC has had a long and productive working relationship \n     with Senate Democrats and all the members of the \n     Congressional Hispanic Caucus, and our experience is they \n     would never oppose any nominee because of his or her race or \n     ethnicity.\n       On the contrary, it is most often the Democratic Members of \n     the Senate who support LULAC'S priority issues and score \n     highest on the national Hispanic leadership agenda \n     congressional scorecard which LULAC helps to compile. It is \n     the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that is the champion of our \n     legislative priority as outlined in the enclosed LULAC \n     legislative platform.\n\n  Mr. President, when talking about LULAC being the determinative \nfactor, I think people should read the letter they sent to us.\n  I repeat, if the majority wants a vote on Miguel Estrada, the only \nvote they are going to get is whether to invoke cloture. They made a \ndecision, obviously, not to go forward on cloture. I suggest we have a \nlot of business to do, and that is what we should be doing.\n  I repeat what I said earlier this afternoon that this matter is not \nmoving forward because there is no agenda, no plan, no program by the \nmajority. This is filling up time so they cannot be criticized for \ndoing nothing. If we were not doing this Estrada nomination, we would \nbe doing nothing.\n  I returned from Nevada a few days ago. People in Nevada are concerned \nabout the war. They are concerned about economic problems. They are \nconcerned about health care. There are a lot of issues, not the least \nof which is homeland security. I have no concern with the Secretary of \nHomeland Security suggesting that people learn about duct tape and \nplastic wrap, but certainly there is more to homeland security.\n  If the majority does not have a program, we do. We have a Democratic \nstimulus package that we think would be most helpful to the American \npeople. It would be immediate tax relief, it would go to the middle \nclass, and it would not have any impact on the long-term deficit. Let's \nmove to that this afternoon. Let's move to it tomorrow. We can have a \nlong, full debate on that stimulus package. The longer we\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\nwait for a stimulus package, the worse it is going to be for our \ncountry. But the majority does not want to do that because they know \nthe tax plan submitted to us by the Bush administration is not going \nanywhere. The Speaker said it was not. My friend, who was on the floor \njust a minute ago, Senator Grassley, initially said he had problems \nwith it. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House and \nscores of Nobel Prize winners in economics have said the plan is no \ngood. That is why they are unwilling to move on cloture and want to \nstay on this nomination.\n  People wonder why we are on this nomination. My friend, the junior \nSenator from Texas, said: On treaties, we need a two-thirds vote; on \nimpeachment, we need a supermajority; and on filibusters, we need 60 \nvotes. For legislative measures, we need a simple majority. That is \nright. But this is something the Senate has been dealing with, and that \nis a filibuster. That is what is going on here. It is part of the \nSenate tradition.\n  Talk about tradition, this is it, and there is a way to get rid of \nit. One way is to invoke cloture, the other way is to get off the \nlegislation, and another way would be to do what we have asked be done: \nLet Miguel Estrada come back and answer questions and submit--with \nwhich he said he has no problem--the memoranda from the Solicitor \nGeneral's Office. He said he does not care. It is being held back by, I \nassume, the administration.\n  There are those who ask why we have some questions about Miguel \nEstrada. Let me show my colleagues why we have some concerns.\n\n  Miguel Estrada's answers to the Judiciary Committee's questions, \nsummarized on this chart, amount to nothing. The answers he has given \nus do not answer anything. There were a lot of words but no answers.\n  We have also asked about these legal memoranda. Why are people trying \nto keep these memoranda from us? Is there a reason? We want to look at \nthose memoranda. Those are the only legal records we have where we can \nfind out what his legal philosophy might be.\n  Some have said he has argued some cases before the Supreme Court, and \nhe has handled other cases. From all the cases I handled, one could not \ndetermine what my political philosophy was. Legal philosophy maybe; \nmaybe not because I represented people who had causes they brought to \nme and they paid me and I did the best I could to represent them in \ntheir causes. We need those legal memoranda to find out about Miguel \nEstrada's philosophy.\n  The same applies to his legal philosophy. We do not know what it is. \nWe do know there has been a lot of talk about some of the people he \nwent to law school with thinking he is a great guy. I have no doubt he \nis a very nice man. I am sure he is a fine man. He appears to have been \na good law student, but the fact is that some people do not think it \nwould be good for him to serve on the court.\n  The person who was his supervisor, a man by the name of Paul Bender, \nwho was in the Solicitor General's Office, has qualifications that \nmatch that of Miguel Estrada. He received an LLD magna cum laude from \nHarvard Law School. He wrote as an editor for the Harvard Law Review. \nAfter graduation, he clerked for a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. He \nworked as a law clerk to Judge Learned Hand, one of the most \ndistinguished judges in the history of this country. As I indicated, \nPaul Bender worked as a law clerk for Justice Felix Frankfurt. He was a \nlaw professor at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school, \nfor 24 years. He was dean of the Arizona State University College of \nLaw. He was principal Deputy Solicitor General of the United States \nfrom 1993 to 1996, and that is where Miguel Estrada worked for him.\n  He has since been working at Arizona State University as a law \nprofessor. He has argued more cases before the Supreme Court than \nMiguel Estrada.\n  The point I am trying to make is this guy is not some kind of slouch. \nHe said it would not be in the best interest of our country if this man \nset on the court. He was too much of an ideologue. Those were his \nwords.\n  In more detail, there was some question that Paul Bender really meant \nwhat he said in his letter to Senator Hatch, dated February 10. He \nmakes a number of important points, including the point that some \nRepublicans are misrepresenting his position and suggesting that \nProfessor Bender has changed his opinion about the nomination, and he \nsaid that is wrong. Professor Bender, who was Miguel Estrada's direct \nsupervisor at the Solicitor General's Office, notes:\n\n       I have not changed my opinion of the nomination, nor have I \n     ever said to anyone I changed my opinion. Someone must have \n     inadvertently given you incorrect information about this \n     letter to Senator Hatch.\n\n  Mr. President, Professor Bender is a person who worked directly with \nMiguel Estrada.\n  Then, of course, they bring in all the evaluations showing he did a \ngood job. Professor Bender also answered that point. He said every \nperson who worked there received the same evaluation. That is what he \nwas supposed to do.\n  There has been another point raised recently that it is inappropriate \nto answer questions about judicial philosophy; it would be \ninappropriate and would violate the ABA ethics code. In fact, the \nRepublican National Committee, through the National Republican Lawyers \nAssociation, sent out a press release. The ABA said it is the wrong \nthing to do.\n\n  The fact is that judicial candidates should not make pledges how they \nwill vote or make statements that appear to commit them on \ncontroversies or issues likely to come before the court. But they are \nusing this to defend the new threshold that people have tried to set \nfor Estrada by having him refuse to answer even the most basic \nquestions about judicial philosophy or his view of legal decisions \nprior to entrusting him to a lifetime seat on the second highest court \nin the country.\n  This is hypocritical, given the fact the Republican Party sued the \nState of Minnesota to ensure that their candidates for judicial office \ncould give their views on legal issues without violating judicial \nethics. Republicans took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, and they \nwon. In an opinion by Justice Scalia, one of Bush's model jurists, the \nSupreme Court ruled that the ethics code did not prevent candidates for \njudicial office from expressing their views on cases or legal issues.\n  In its recent letter to Senators Daschle and Leahy, the White House, \ncontrary to citing Scalia, cites the dissent by Ginsburg in that case. \nThey refuse to mention the word ``Scalia.''\n  Some people may disagree with the judicial philosophy of Antonin \nScalia but no one can dispute his brilliance. He is a man who I am sure \nis an advocate on that court. When they go behind those curtains, I am \nsure they have a handful to try to handle his logic because he is \nreally good. He is a smart man. So we have to accept something that he \nwould say, and Scalia has said that anyone coming to a judgeship is \nbound to have opinions about legal issues and the law and there is \nnothing improper about expressing them, so long as a candidate does not \npledge to always rule a certain way. Specifically, in Republican Party \nof Minnesota v. White, the U.S. Supreme Court overruled ABA model \nrestrictions against candidates for elected judicial office from \nindicating their views on legal issues while campaigning or seeking \njudicial office. In his opinion, Justice Scalia wrote that making \nstatements of honestly held views would not make a candidate unfit.\n  In that majority opinion, Justice Scalia explained that even if it \nwere possible to select judges who do not have preconceived views on \nlegal issues, it would hardly be desirable to do so. Proof that a \njustice's mind at the time he joined a court was a blank slate in the \narea of constitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of \nqualification, not lack of bias. And since avoiding judicial \npreconceptions on legal issues is neither possible nor desirable, \npretending otherwise by attempting to preserve the appearance of that \ntype of impartiality can hardly be a compelling state of interest, \neither. That is Scalia. Was that a brilliant statement? One may not \nagree with it but don't they understand what he is saying? Of course, \nthey do.\n  Accordingly, prior to last summer, some judicial candidates may have \nthought that they could not share their views on legal issues, although \nsome tried to answer questions as best they could. Some candidates \ntried to view\n\n[[Page S2566]]\n\nthe ABA modeling rules expansively to try to avoid sharing their views.\n  Professor McConnell, who was confirmed last year, answered all the \nquestions. It is clear that the ethical rules do not prevent a \ncandidate from sharing his or her views, a result sought by Republicans \neager to use these views to try to win the election of Republican \njudges to short-term positions. They went to the Supreme Court to prove \nthis. Of course, a judicial candidate cannot be compelled to share his \nviews but he refuses to do so at his own peril. That is what we are \ntalking about.\n\n  Scalia said that even if it were possible to select judges who do not \nhave preconceived views on legal issues, it would hardly be desirable \nto do so. Proof that a justice's mind at the time he joined the court \nwas complete--and he uses a Latin word. I did not take much Latin, but \nit is tabula rasa, which means a blank slate--in the areas of \nconstitutional adjudication would be evidence of lack of qualification, \nnot lack of bias.\n  Scalia was quoting from Justice Rehnquist's 1971 opinion in Laird v. \nTatum in which he refused to recuse himself on a case involving an \nissue on which he had previously expressed a view.\n  So expressing a view on a legal issue or case does not violate legal \nethics and would also be unlikely to require recusal.\n  I do not serve on the Judiciary Committee but I have talked to a \nnumber of my colleagues, and a man by the name of McConnell came before \nthe committee and all of the red flags came up on this side of the \naisle: He is too conservative; Senator Hatch has handpicked him. All of \nthese kinds of things came up.\n  He appeared before the Judiciary Committee, and even though some may \nhave disagreed, I am told, with some of the things he said, they \nthought he answered every question, and he is now a member of a circuit \ncourt of appeals. He did not hide his views. He answered the questions. \nSo people knew what he was talking about.\n  We do not know anything about Estrada, other than he is smart. That \nis not enough to get you to be a circuit court judge.\n  Saying, as Mr. Estrada has, that you cannot give your view of any \nSupreme Court case without reading the briefs, listening to oral \nargument, conferring with colleagues and doing your own independent \nlegal research is just a fancy way of saying I am not going to tell you \nguys anything. It also defies the experiences of law students, lawyers, \nand citizens. It is especially evasive when a nominee has a reputation \nfor being outspoken, passionate, and an aggressive debater on legal \nissues and decisions from a strong ideological perspective so much that \nhe is a front-runner in right-wing circles for the Supreme Court, and \nthe notion that he could be counted on to rule their way, even more so \nthan the counsel to the President, Mr. Gonzales.\n  Yesterday I saw a prominent faculty member from a law school in this \nmetropolitan area. I am not going to give his name. It may embarrass \nhim in some way, and I did not get permission to quote him publicly, \nbut he is a very conservative law professor, I can guarantee that. He \ncame up to me and he said, you would make a mistake going with Estrada. \nNow, this is from a conservative, prominent, constitutional scholar.\n  So we are entitled to know his views. He should answer the questions.\n  There has been a lot quoted from editorials from this paper and that, \nmost of them from Texas, which certainly my friend who just spoke is \nfrom Texas and that would be the place he should go to look for his \neditorials, but there was a syndicated column written by a man named \nE.J. Dionne, Jr., on last Friday. I am going to quote some things from \nhis article, although not everything. It is entitled ``They Started \nIt.''\n\n       So why are Senate Democrats filibustering President Bush's \n     nomination of Miguel Estrada to one of the nation's most \n     important courts?.  .  .\n       To say the guy is no slouch is an understatement. But the \n     fight over Estrada's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit is not simply about him. \n     It is about a concerted effort to pack our courts with \n     representatives of a single point of view. If Democrats just \n     rolled over on Bush's judicial nominations, they would be \n     guilty of oppositional malpractice.\n       To understand this battle, you could go back to Richard \n     Nixon's campaign against liberal judges. But let's just look \n     at what happened to Bill Clinton's effort to get two highly \n     qualified nominees onto the D.C. Circuit.\n\n  The DC Circuit is the circuit that Estrada wants to go to.\n\n       Elena Kagan, who served in the Clinton White House, \n     graduated at the top of her class at Estrada's law school and \n     now teaches there, saw her nomination languish in the \n     Republican Senate for 18 months. Allen Snyder clerked for \n     that well-known left-winger, U.S. Chief Justice William \n     Rehnquist, and was also at the top at Harvard Law School. His \n     nomination languished for 15 months.\n       If Republicans believe in voting for quality--their \n     argument for Estrada--why didn't they confirm Kagan and \n     Snyder? The answer is obvious: We have before us, sadly, a \n     fierce political struggle for control of the courts.\n       It's not good enough to say that the way out of this \n     politicized process is for Democrats to ignore the past and \n     cave in to the Republicans. To do that would be to reward a \n     determined conservative effort to control the courts for a \n     generation. Stage One involved obstructing Clinton's \n     nominees. Stage Two involves using any means necessary--\n     including outrageous charges of ethnic bias--to ram \n     conservative choices through.\n\n  I read from the LULAC statement that that simply is invalid.\n\n       The stakes go beyond any single nominee. Do we want courts \n     entirely dominated by one side, or do we want a fair and \n     balanced judiciary?\n       Consider these statistics, gathered by the Democratic staff \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee. There are 13 circuits: 11 \n     regional plus the D.C. Circuit and the federal court that \n     handles specialized cases. If all of Clinton's nominees had \n     been approved, the circuits would have been evenly \n     balanced in partisan terms by the time he left office. Six \n     would have had majorities appointed by Democratic \n     presidents, six by Republicans, and one would have been \n     evenly split.\n       But if Bush succeeds in filling every open seat, some of \n     them vacant because Clinton nominees were blocked, 11 of the \n     13 circuits will have Republican-appointed majorities. In \n     eight of the 13, Republican nominees would have majorities of \n     2 to 1 or more. Is that a formula for careful, balanced \n     decisionmaking?\n       To push attention away from this fundamental question, \n     Republican who say they don't want a politicized nominating \n     process--and who regularly accuse Democrats of ``playing the \n     race card''--are doing all they can to turn the Estrada fight \n     into an ethnic imbroglio.\n       ``If we deny Mr. Estrada the position on the D.C. Circuit, \n     it would be to shut the door on the American dream of \n     Hispanic Americans everywhere,'' Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) \n     said in January. Last year, Republican Sen. Trent Lott if \n     Mississippi said of the Democrats: ``They don't want Miguel \n     Estrada because he's Hispanic.''\n       Never mind that eight of the 10 Hispanic appellate judges \n     were appointed by Clinton. And never mind that Republicans \n     had no problem blocking such Hispanic Clinton nominees as \n     Enrique Moreno, Jorge Rangel and Christine Arguello.\n\n  Mr. President, the congressional Hispanic Caucus, which wants as many \nHispanics involved in Government and the judiciary as is possible, \nopposes this man. We believe the debate today is where it was a week \nago, 2 weeks ago, that there are ways we can move this nomination. Give \nus the information, answer questions, give us the memo, pull the \nnomination, or invoke cloture. That is about all there is.\n  I hope the majority leader will make a decision of what he is going \nto do and we can move, I hope tomorrow, to our proposal to give a \nstimulus package to the country--that certainly would be appropriate--\nor move to something the majority wants to do.\n  I repeat for the third time, one reason we are so tied up is the \nmajority has nothing to do. They do not know what they want to move to \nnext. I certainly hope we do not spend more time on this nomination.\n  The Presiding Officer is going to get the Golden Gavel Award probably \nwithin the next few months and is spending so much time here presiding. \nFor those listening, Golden Gavel, as I understood, is someone who \npresides for 100 hours, and they get a plaque. It is hard to preside \n100 hours during the year. I hope the Presiding Officer does that. It \nis a great way to learn about what goes on in the Senate. I can \nremember doing that myself.\n  The Presiding Officer has heard me say this on other occasions: We \nhave more we can do. There are other things we should do. We approved \n100 judges during the time we were under control. The only three judges \nwho have come before the floor this year we approved unanimously. We \ncan continue this debate for a week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, whatever it \ntakes. We can spend time here at night. That is no punishment.\n\n[[Page S2567]]\n\nThe majority is the one that has to have Presiding Officers. If you \nwant to punish yourselves, that is fine, go ahead and do that. We will \nhave someone here making sure everything is done properly.\n  Everything has been said about Miguel Estrada. I could take a test on \nMiguel Estrada's life and I would get an A+. I would either do multiple \nchoice, true and false, or an essay question. I can do just fine on \nMiguel Estrada. I know everything there is to know about Miguel \nEstrada. But everything we have to know today about Miguel Estrada from \nour perspective is not much. I can tell you he was 17 when he came \nhere, he was a fine student at Harvard. Everyone seems to like him. He \nseems like a nice guy. I met him. I saw him on television when he was \nquestioned by the Judiciary Committee. He obviously is very bright. He \nis very opinionated. But we do not know all those opinions. We only get \nthat from people he has talked with.\n  Everything has been said. We are getting to the point where almost \neveryone has said it. But we can repeat it. Who knows, maybe the \nmajority will decide, with the help of Mr. Gonzales, the counsel of the \nPresident, that we can get the information we want. Senators Daschle \nand Leahy wrote a letter and asked for the memos and that he appear \nagain. We got a 15-page letter in response. Obviously this is not a \nmatter where everyone can compromise. That is too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have spoken twice about Miguel \nEstrada and have made my views rather well known. However, in response \nto the distinguished Senator from Texas, who is a relative newcomer on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee, I want to just quickly point out what I \nfound in my 10 years of service on that committee.\n  From the 104th to the 106th Congress, when Republicans controlled the \nSenate, 53 Clinton judges were refused even a hearing in committee; six \nhad a hearing but no vote; 11 came out of committee, but no floor vote.\n  What is my point in this? My point is there is more than one way of \nfilibustering a judge. Right now, there is a filibuster going on over a \nnominee to the D.C. Circuit. However, that filibuster can occur in a \ncouple of ways. One, someone can object to unanimous consent to come to \na vote. A cloture vote can happen. If there are 60 votes there, it ends \nthe filibuster.\n  But another kind of filibuster is a filibuster in committee when an \nindividual is nominated and they wait year after year, some for an \nappellate court as long as 4 years, and never have a hearing. Some of \nPresident Clinton's nominees withdrew rather than continue this painful \nprocess.\n  The fact of the matter is every Presidential nominee who comes over \nto the Judiciary Committee for review, for a hearing, and for a vote, \ndoes not receive that review, that hearing, and that vote. That is just \na fact. So you could say 70 Clinton judicial nominees were essentially \nfilibustered by a Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee--53 never \nhad a hearing, six had their hearing, but were never brought to a \ncommittee vote, and 11 were actually reported out of committee, but \nnever had a vote in the Senate.\n  I do not think what is happening with respect to Mr. Estrada is \nanything that is very unusual. There are good reasons for it. There is \nprobably no circuit more sensitive than the DC Circuit. The Presiding \nOfficer, who is a very bright individual, understands this. We all \nunderstand the circuit is evenly split. We all understand that \nPresident Clinton proposed nominees, two of whom never got a vote, for \nthat particular circuit. Therefore, whoever is appointed to this \ncircuit has a special predominance in our thinking. We would like to \nknow what that individual believes. We would like to know their \njurisprudence. We would like to be able to know their temperament. Mr. \nEstrada, to a great extent, through his own volition, has prevented \nthat from happening.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  I come to the floor today in another capacity, and that is as a \nmember of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I quickly bring \nto the Senate recent disclosures about how a number of energy firms \nhave engaged in deceptive trading practices to drive up prices for \nconsumers in the western energy market. I believe strongly this recent \nevidence requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take \nadditional strong and aggressive steps to keep energy markets from \ncontinually being abused. I will update the Senate on these revelations \nthat have been uncovered in the past year.\n  Earlier this month, Jeffrey Richter, the former head of Enron's \nShort-Term California energy trading desk, pled guilty to conspiracy to \ncommit fraud as part of Enron's well known schemes to manipulate \nwestern energy markets. Richter's plea follows that of head Enron \ntrader Tim Belden in the fall of 2002. Belden admitted that he schemed \nto defraud California during the Western energy crisis and also plead \nguilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n  The Enron plea came on the heels of FERC's release of transcripts \nfrom Reliant Energy that reveal how their traders intentionally \nwithheld power from the California market in an attempt to increase \nprices. This is one of the most egregious examples of fraud and \nmanipulation that affected the western energy market in 2000 and 2001 \nand it is clear and convincing evidence of coordinate schemes to \ndefraud consumers.\n  Let me read just one part of the transcript to demonstrate the greed \nbehind the market abuse by Reliant and its traders.\n  On June 20, 2000 two Reliant employees had the following conversation \nthat reveals the company withheld power from the California market to \ndrive prices up. Let me read to you this phone call transcript.\n\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``I don't necessarily foresee \n     those units being run the remainder of this week. In fact you \n     will probably see, in fact I know, tomorrow we have all the \n     units at Coolwater off.''\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``Really?''\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``Potentially. Even number \n     four. More due to some market manipulation attempts on our \n     part. And so, on number four it probably wouldn't last long. \n     I would probably be back on the next day, if not the day \n     after that. Trying to uh . . .''\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``Trying to shorten supply, uh? \n     That way the price on demand goes up.''\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``Well, we'll see.''\n       Reliant Plant Operator 2: ``I can understand. That's \n     cool.''\n       Reliant Operations Manager 1: ``We've got some term \n     positions that, you know, that would benefit.''\n\n  Six months after this incident, as the Senate Energy Committee was \nattempting to get to the bottom of why energy prices were soaring in \nthe west, the President and CEO of Reliant testified before Congress \nthat the State of California ``has focused on an inaccurate perception \nof market manipulation.''\n  Reliant's President and CEO went on to say:\n\n       We are proud of our contributions to keep generation \n     running to try to meet the demand for power in California. \n     Reliant Energy's plant and technical staffs have worked hard \n     to maximize the performance of our generation.\n\n  These transcripts prove otherwise and reveal the truth about market \nmanipulation in the energy sector.\n  If you think that is a lot of money, remember that the cost of energy \nfor California went from $8 billion 1 year to $28 billion the next \nyear. So the fraud and the manipulation was huge during that period of \ntime.\n  Despite this clear and convincing evidence of fraud, on January 31 of \nthis year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chose to give \nReliant a slap on the wrist for this behavior. The company paid only \n$13.8 million to sweep this criminal behavior under the rug and settle \nwith FERC.\n  Let me turn to some other recent examples that demonstrate how other \nenergy companies manipulated the western energy market as Reliant did. \nOn December 11 FERC finally released audio tapes that show how traders \nat Williams conspired with AES Energy plant operators to keep power \noffline and drive prices up.\n  The tapes depict how on April 27, 2000, Williams outage coordinator \nRhonda Morgan encouraged an AES operator at the company's Alamitos \nplant to extend a plant outage because the California grid operator was \npaying ``a premium'' for power at the time. The Williams employee \nstated:\n\n       That's one reason it wouldn't hurt Williams' feelings if \n     the outage ran long.\n\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\n\n  Later that day, Eric Pendergraft, a high-ranking AES employee called \nto confirm with Ms. Morgan that Williams wanted the plant to stay \noffline by saying:\n\n       You guys were saying that it might not be such a bad thing \n     if it took us a little while longer to do our work? I don't \n     want to do something underhanded, Ms. Morgan responded, but \n     if there is work you can continue to do . . .''\n\n  At this point Mr. Pendergraft interrupted to cut off their suspicious \nconversation, saying:\n\n       I understand. You don't have to talk anymore.\n\n  Clearly, this is evidence of a calculated intent to withhold power to \nraise prices. I find it unconscionable.\n  Let's turn to some other examples.\n  On January 27, 2003, Michelle Marie Valencia, a 32-year-old former \nsenior energy trader for Dynegy was arrested on charges that she \nreported fictitious natural gas transactions to an industry \npublication.\n  On December 5, 2002, Todd Geiger, a former vice president on the \nCanadian natural gas trading desk for El Paso Merchant Energy, was \ncharged with wire fraud and filing a false report after allegedly \ntelling a trade publication about the prices for 48 natural gas trades \nthat he never made in an effort to boost prices and company profit.\n  These indictments are just the latest examples of how energy firms \nreported inaccurate prices to trade publications to drive energy prices \nhigher.\n  Industry publications claimed they could not be fooled by false \nprices because deviant prices are rejected, but this claim was \npredicated on the fact that everyone was reporting honestly--which we \nnow know they weren't doing.\n  CMS Energy, Williams, American Electric Power Company, and Dynegy \nhave each acknowledged that its employees gave inaccurate price data to \nindustry participants. On December 19 Dynegy agreed to pay a $5 million \nfine for its actions.\n  In September an Administrative Law Judge at FERC issued a landmark \nruling concluding that El Paso Corporation withheld natural gas from \nCalifornia and recommended penalty proceedings against the company. \nSince the El Paso Pipeline carries most of the natural gas to Southern \nCalifornia, this ruling has tremendous implications. The FERC \nCommissioners are expected to take up this case for a final judgment \nsoon.\n  This is one of the things I tried to see the President about, but he \nwouldn't see me, because it became very clear during this period of \ntime that natural gas going into San Juan, NM, was trading at about $5 \nto $6 a decatherm, whereas natural gas going just a short distance away \ninto southern California was trading at $60 a decatherm, and natural \ngas forms the basis for the price of electricity. I had hoped if I \ncould give this information to the President of the United States at \nthat time that he might look into it and we might have prevented some \nof what happened in the western energy markets. Unfortunately--and I \nwrote four letters--he refused to see me on this subject.\n  This past summer, California State Senate investigators uncovered how \nPerot Systems--a company which set up the computer system for \nCalifornia's electricity market--provided its energy clients with a \ndetailed blueprint of how to exploit holes in the state's bidding \nsystem to drive prices up.\n  These have been the latest revelations in a series of energy \ndisclosure bombshells that began on Monday, May 6, when the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission posted a series of documents on their \nwebsite that revealed Enron manipulated the western energy market by \nengaging in a number of suspect trading strategies.\n  These memos revealed for the first time how Enron used schemes called \n``Death Star,'' ``Get Shorty,'' ``Fat Boy,'' and ``Ricochet'' to fleece \nfamilies and businesses in the West.\n  By using Death Star, for example, Enron would ``get paid for moving \nenergy to relieve congestion without actually moving energy or \nrelieving any congestion.'' That is according to their own internal \nmemo.\n  Just on its face, that is fraud. We are going to move energy without \nmoving energy--fraud.\n  In another strategy detailed in these memos, Enron would ``create the \nappearance of congestion through the deliberate overstatement of \nloads'' to drive prices up.\n  Create ``the appearance of congestion through the deliberate \noverstatement of loads''--fraud.\n  The above-mentioned strategy reveals an intentional and coordinated \nattempt to manipulate the western energy market for profit.\n  This is an important piece of the puzzle, and some former Enron \ntraders helped fill in the blanks.\n  CBS news reported in May that former Enron traders admitted that the \nenergy company was directly responsible for rolling blackouts in \nCalifornia. Yet, interestingly enough, no one has followed up on this \nreport.\n  Anybody who has ever been through a rolling blackout knows what it is \nlike. Everything goes off and you cannot predict where it goes off \nnext. Street lights, hospitals--literally everything goes off.\n  According to CBS news, the traders said Enron's former President, \nJeff Skilling, pushed them to trade aggressively in California and told \nthem: If you can't do that, then you need to find a job at another \ncompany or go trade pork bellies.\n  The CBS article mentions that Enron traders played a disturbing role \nin blackouts that hit California. The report mentioned specific \nmanipulative behavior by Enron on June 14 and 15 in the summer of 2000 \nwhen traders said they intentionally clogged Path 26. That is a key \ntransmission path connecting northern and southern California. Here is \nwhat one trader said about that event:\n\n       What we did was overbook the line we had the rights on \n     during the shortage or in a heat wave. We did this in June of \n     2000 when the Bay Area was going through a heat wave and the \n     ISO couldn't send power to the north. The ISO has to pay \n     Enron to free up the line in order to send power to San \n     Francisco to keep the lights on. But by the time they agreed \n     to pay us rolling blackouts had already hit California and \n     the price for electricity went through the roof.\n\n  California lost billions. Yet, according to the traders, Enron made \nmillions of dollars by employing this strategy alone.\n  On top of all of this, traders disclosed that Enron's manipulative \ntrading strategy helped force California to sign expensive long-term \ncontracts. It is no surprise that Enron and others were able to profit \nso handsomely during the crisis.\n  Financial statements show that revenue and income surged for energy \ntrading companies in 2000 and 2001. Many firms such as Duke, Dynegy, \nEnron, Mirant, Reliant, and Williams greatly increased their revenues \nby taking advantage--taking advantage--of the California market.\n  And the evidence suggests that other companies were--and may continue \nto be--engaging in these manipulative strategies and that the Enron \nmemos may well be the tip of the iceberg. One of the Enron memos said: \nEnron may have been the first to use this strategy, others have picked \nup on it, too.\n  Dynegy, Duke Energy, El Paso, Reliant Resources, CMS Energy, and \nWilliams all admitted engaging in false ``round-trip'' or ``wash'' \ntrades.\n\n  What is a ``round-trip'' or ``wash'' trade, one might ask? ``Round-\ntrip'' trades occur when one firm sells energy to another and then the \nsecond firm simultaneously sells the same amount of energy back to the \nfirst company at exactly the same price. No commodity ever changes \nhands. But when done on an exchange, these transactions send a price \nsignal to the market and they artificially boost revenue for the \ncompany. Fraud again.\n  How widespread are ``round-trip'' trades? The Congressional Research \nService looked at trading patterns in the energy sector over the last \nfew years. This is what they reported:\n\n       This pattern of trading suggests a market environment in \n     which a significant volume of fictitious trading could have \n     taken place. Yet since most of the trading is unregulated by \n     the Government, we have only a slim idea of the illusion \n     being perpetrated in the energy sector.\n\n  Consider the following recent confessions from energy firms about \n``round-trip'' trades:\n\n       Reliant admitted 10 percent of its trading revenues came \n     from ``round-trip'' trades. The announcement forced the \n     company's president and head of wholesale trading to both \n     step down.\n\n  DMS Energy announced 80 percent of its trade in 2001 were ``round-\ntrip'' trades.\n\n[[Page S2569]]\n\n  That means 80 percent of all of their trades that year were bogus \ntrades where no commodity changed hands, and yet the balance sheets \nreflect added revenue. If that isn't fraudulent, I do not know what is.\n  Remember, these trades are sham deals where nothing was exchanged.\n  Duke Energy disclosed that $1.1 billion worth of trades were ``round-\ntrip'' since 1999. Roughly two-thirds of these were done on the \nInterContinental Exchange; that is, the online, nonregulated, \nnonaudited, nonoversight for manipulation and fraud entity run by banks \nin this country. That means thousands of subscribers would see false \npricing.\n  A lawyer for J.P. Morgan Chase admitted the bank engineered a series \nof ``round-trip'' trades with Enron.\n  Dynegy and Williams have also admitted to ``round-trip'' trades.\n  Although these trades mostly occurred with electricity, there is \nevidence that suggests that ``round-trip'' trades were made in natural \ngas and even broad band.\n  By exchanging the same amount of commodity at the same price, I \nbelieve these companies have not engaged in meaningful transactions but \ndeceptive practices to fool investors and drive up energy prices for \nconsumers. It is, therefore, imperative that the Department of Justice, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, and every other \noversight agency within this Federal Government conduct an aggressive \nand vigorous investigation into all of the energy companies that \nparticipated in these markets.\n  Beyond that, I believe Congress must reexamine what tools the \nGovernment needs to better keep watch over these volatile markets that \nare, frankly, little understood.\n  In the absence of vigilant Government oversight of the energy sector, \nfirms have the incentive to create the appearance of a mature, liquid, \nand well-functioning market. But it is unclear, and I think improbable, \nthat such a market actually exists.\n  The ``round-trip'' trades and the Enron memos raise questions about \nillusions in the energy market. To this end, I believe it is critical \nfor the Senate to act soon on the legislation I offered last April to \nregulate online energy trading.\n  This week, I plan to reintroduce this legislation with Senators \nFitzgerald, Lugar, Harkin, Cantwell, Wyden, and Leahy, to subject \nelectronic exchanges like Enron On-Line to the same oversight, \nreporting, and capital requirements as other commodity exchanges such \nas the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, \nand the Chicago Board of Trade.\n  This legislation will be called the Energy Market Oversight Act. \nWithout this type of legislation, there is insufficient authority to \ninvestigate and prevent fraud and price manipulation and, also, the \nparties making the trade are not required to keep any records, nor are \nthe trades transparent. In other words, they are secret trades with no \naudit trails, no oversight for fraud and manipulation. They cannot \nexist over a regular exchange like that, but the Internet, the online \ntrading community is exempt from this oversight. It is a huge loophole, \nand it has cost my State billions.\n  I strongly believe that in order to restore confidence in the \neconomy, we must bolster the authority of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission, and other regulatory agencies.\n  The marketplace must be fair and transparent, and regulatory bodies \nsuch as FERC must show they will act in the public interest and release \nto the public all information on fraud and manipulation. This includes \nremoving the ``protective order'' FERC has placed on evidence uncovered \nby the State of California and other interested parties, information \nthe Commission has on wrongdoing in the energy sector but hasn't \ndisclosed. With something as broadly based as energy, as important to \npeople as energy, it is unconscionable to have all this information \nprotected in a lockbox. It must change.\n  I strongly believe families and businesses that suffered during the \nwestern energy crisis have a right to know the extent of the fraud and \nmanipulation that was wrought upon them. So I intend to help ensure \nthat FERC fulfills its public duty so this abuse cannot happen again. \nUnfortunately, at this time, none of us can give this guarantee to the \npeople of America. And that must change.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will speak about the nomination of Miguel \nEstrada to be a judge for the District of Columbia Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  That is, of course, the pending business before the Senate, and it is \nthe business which we will complete before we can move on to other \nmatters, such as the adoption of a budget, and the consideration of the \nPresident's economic growth and jobs creation package. But I do not \nthink the President is going to back down on his nomination. Yet I \nheard a member of the other side of the aisle yesterday, on television, \nsay as far as he was concerned, that nomination would never come up for \na vote; that is to say, at least until he ``answered'' the questions of \nthe Members of the other side.\n  I would like to set the record straight. Through an entire day of \nhearings, and some 30 questions that were asked of him, Miguel Estrada \nanswered the questions posed. There has been an opportunity to follow \nup with written questions. If Members have not availed themselves of \nthat opportunity, then that is their problem, not his.\n  Miguel Estrada has answered all of the questions put before him. He \nis one of the most competent, qualified, brilliant lawyers the \nPresident could have nominated for this position. And really nobody \ndisputes that. So the business about not answering questions is really \na smokescreen. It is a smokescreen for opposition to his candidacy \nbased upon the fact that President Bush nominated him and President \nBush is a conservative President.\n  President Bush, I suspect, is more representative of the mainstream \nof the thinking in this country than certain people on the fringe of \neither the Democratic party or the Republican party. So I do not think \none can simply say because President Bush has nominated somebody that \nthey are extremist or rightwing or that they are ideologves. In fact, \nthe people who have opposed Judge Estrada's nomination have confirmed \nas much by saying they simply do not know enough about him. So I am a \nlittle tired of those who say, on the one hand, we do not know enough \nabout him but, on the other hand, he is some kind of an ideologve. The \nfact is, he isn't. They do not have anything to suggest he is. It seems \nto me in the great American idiom, it is time to put up or shut up.\n  Now, we are not going to shut the Democratic side up. If they want to \nkeep talking about Miguel Estrada, they can talk, as far as we are \nconcerned, as long as they want to. But they should be addressing his \nnomination instead of speaking about other things or simply not being \nhere on the Senate floor debating his confirmation. His confirmation is \nthe pending business. If Members have a concern about him, they ought \nto bring it forth. If they have some evidence that he has done \nsomething in his background that isn't right, then they ought to bring \nit forth. If they have an objection to one of his opinions, then they \nshould bring that forth. None of this has happened or will happen \nbecause, in fact, there is nothing there. That is why they are \nregulated to saying: Well, we just don't know enough about him.\n  It is time for those who oppose Miguel Estrada to be honest about \ntheir opposition, to come forth and talk to the American people about \nit, and find out what the American people think about their opposition \nto Miguel Estrada.\n  I put together just a few quotations of people around the country who \nhave commented on his nomination. I would like to just read a few of \nthem.\n\n  We are all aware of the fact the American Bar Association--whose \nopinion used to be the ``Gold Standard'' for Democrat Members in the \nSenate on judicial nominations--rated Miguel Estrada well qualified \nunanimously. That is their highest rating. And they take into \nconsideration everything, from judicial temperament, to educational \nbackground, to experience. Obviously, if someone were way outside the \nmainstream or too political, the\n\n[[Page S2570]]\n\nAmerican Bar Association would not have unanimously indicated their \napproval of the candidate.\n  This is from Ruben Navarette, who wrote in the Dallas Morning News--\nby the way, a very competent journalist who used to write for the \nArizona Republic, one of my hometown newspapers:\n\n       Miguel Estrada deserves a hearing, and Mr. Bush deserves to \n     have his nominees considered in a timely manner. The only \n     thing preventing that in the case of Mr. Estrada is Democrat \n     fear of the political damage they could sustain from such a \n     nomination.\n\n  So spoken by Ruben Navarette.\n  Ron Klain is a former counsel to Vice President Gore. He said this \njust about a year ago:\n\n       I have no doubt that on the bench, Miguel will faithfully \n     apply the precedents of his court, and the Supreme Court, \n     without regard to his personal views or his political \n     perspectives. His belief in the rule of law, in a limited \n     judiciary, and in the separation of powers is too strong for \n     him to act otherwise.\n\n  That goes directly to this business that somehow or other Miguel \nEstrada--though he has not written anything or said anything that would \nlead to this conclusion--could not be trusted to apply the rule of law \nas he understands it from the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Here is a former counsel to Vice President Gore saying he knows \nMiguel Estrada is beyond that, that Miguel Estrada is a person who \nunderstands his role as a judge, his belief in the rule of law, and a \nlimited judiciary, and the separation of powers and, therefore, that he \nwould act in accordance with what we understand to be the correct role \nof a judge in these circumstances.\n  There was a statement I thought particularly interesting from former \nSolicitors General. Remember that Miguel Estrada was an Assistant \nSolicitor General. This is the office in the Department of Justice that \nactually represents the Government before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Miguel Estrada has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In \na letter signed by colleagues from the Office of the Solicitor General \nunder Presidents Clinton and George H. W. Bush, dated September 19, \n2002, I quote:\n\n       Miguel is a brilliant lawyer, with an extraordinary \n     capacity for articulate and incisive legal analysis and a \n     commanding knowledge of an appreciation for the law. \n     Moreover, he is a person whose conduct is characterized by \n     the utmost integrity and scrupulous fairness, as befits a \n     nominee to the federal bench. In addition, Miguel has a deep \n     and abiding love for his adopted country and the principles \n     for which it stands, and in particular for the rule of law.\n\n  Again, Democrats and Republicans alike affirm the fact that Miguel \nEstrada is above partisan politics and appreciates his role as a judge, \napplying the law of the precedents of the courts and of the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Seth Waxman was former Solicitor General during the Clinton \nadministration, a well-respected lawyer. This is what he wrote:\n\n       During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked together, he was a \n     model of professionalism and competence. In no way did I ever \n     discern that the recommendations Mr. Estrada made or the \n     analyses he propounded were colored in any way by his \n     personal views--or indeed that they reflected any \n     consideration other than the long-term interests of the \n     United States.\n\n  It is astounding to me that our friends on the other side of the \naisle, despite the recommendations of high level Clinton administration \nlawyers affirming the professionalism and honesty and credentials of \nMiguel Estrada, would still contend that they don't have enough \ninformation about him. I suggest to my colleagues that they consult \nsome of their friends in the former Clinton administration, former \nSolicitors General, and ask them about Miguel Estrada. If they are \nsaying they don't know enough about him, there are some very highly \nqualified people to whom they could speak. I doubt there is anybody \nthey could speak to who knows Miguel Estrada well that wouldn't confirm \nhis qualifications to be on the court.\n  Instead they are relegated to dark, suspicious comments such as, \n``Well, maybe he believes things that we don't know about because he \njust hasn't answered our questions thoroughly enough.'' I suggest they \ntalk to those who have worked with him on a day-in and day-out basis. \nThey will find that he is not only highly qualified but very fair.\n  Just perhaps one or two other comments. Then I will yield to my \nfriends.\n  Rick Davolina, LULAC national president, said:\n\n       We are confident that Mr. Estrada will fulfill the duties \n     of the United States Circuit Judge for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit with fairness, intelligence, and commitment \n     to the ideals of the United States.\n\n  I had a call from one of the local LULAC officials over the weekend \nwho confirmed LULAC's position and support of his nomination.\n  Elizabeth Lisboa-Farrow, chair of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce, said:\n\n       From his humble beginnings as an immigrant from Honduras \n     who achieved a stellar academic career . . . to his varied \n     and impressive achievements in the Justice Department and \n     private firms, Mr. Estrada has shown himself to be one of \n     superior talents and accomplishments.\n\n  From the Hispanic community, from newspapers around the country, from \nformer Clinton administration officials and others who know Miguel \nEstrada well, there is no doubt in their mind that he is not only \nqualified to serve but that he would do so applying the precedents of \nhis court and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Therefore, I again ask my colleagues again on the other side of the \naisle, if you have concerns about Miguel Estrada, bring them to the \nfloor. Let's talk about them. Let's debate them. But at the end of the \nday, it is only fair to give Miguel Estrada a vote so that he can be \nconfirmed as a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague from \nArizona and wish to join him in urging our colleagues to vote in favor \nof Miguel Estrada to be on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Senator Kyl \nsaid it all and said it well. I compliment him. I compliment Senator \nHatch for his leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Miguel Estrada. I did something I \nhaven't done in my many years in the Senate. I suggested to some of our \ncolleagues that because, in the last couple of years, we had had a hard \ntime moving forward circuit court nominees before the Senate, that we \nindividually take one or two of these nominees and more or less adopt \nthem, get to know them well and encourage their nomination.\n  We had good success. I thank my friend, the former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. We had good success in moving through a lot of the \ndistrict court nominees. Senator Leahy was very accommodating with us. \nWe moved through four Oklahoma judges to serve on the district court. \nIt didn't take very long. A lot of district court nominees were \nconfirmed.\n  But on the appellate level, on the circuit court level, it wasn't the \nsame. In fact, I believe in the last 2 years, the first 2 years, or the \n107th Congress, President Bush submitted 32 nominees to the circuit \ncourt and only 17 were confirmed--53 percent. That compares to \nPresident Clinton. In his first 2 years he got 87 percent; President \nBush, 96 percent; and President Reagan, 95 percent. This President Bush \nin the 107th Congress only got 53 percent.\n  I suggested to our colleagues, let's take special attention, \nindividual Senators take special attention to some of the nominees and \nthen encourage that they be confirmed. The reason I would do that is \nobviously home State Senators are going to encourage their particular \nnominees for district court, but maybe when you talk about the circuit \ncourt, since it applies to many States, many areas, it doesn't have \nquite the same degree of support from an individual Senator.\n  It so happens on Miguel Estrada, Senator Pete Domenici and I both \ndecided that we would take particular interest in Miguel Estrada. By \nthat we got to know him. We had meetings with him. We had press \nconferences on his behalf. We encouraged others to join in the effort \nto confirm Miguel Estrada. We were not successful in the last 2 years. \nHe was eventually approved by the committee but not on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  That is with great regret. Now we are before the Senate trying to \nconfirm Miguel Estrada. We haven't been able to get a vote. We have \nbeen talking for a long time. Now people want to talk, I don't know how \nlong, but we will spend some time because this is an outstanding \nnominee.\n\n[[Page S2571]]\n\n  I got to know him. He is a truly a success story. He immigrated to \nthis country from Honduras at age 17. Then he graduated magna cum laude \nand Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia. He also graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Harvard Law School where he distinguished himself as editor of the \nHarvard Law Review. What a remarkable accomplishment for somebody who \nimmigrated to this country at age 17 and could hardly speak English.\n  Since then he has argued 15 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. He \nwon 10 of those cases. Find the number of attorneys in the United \nStates who have argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court. It is a \npretty elite group. Almost by definition he is an outstanding attorney \nor he would not have argued 15 cases before the Supreme Court.\n  He was rated unanimously well qualified by the American \nBar Association, its highest possible rating. President Clinton's \nSolicitor General, a Democrat, Seth Waxman, had this to say about \nMiguel Estrada:\n\n       During the time Mr. Estrada and I worked together, he was a \n     model of professionalism and competence. In no way did I ever \n     discern that the recommendations Mr. Estrada made or the \n     [views] he propounded were colored in any way by his personal \n     views--or indeed that they reflected anything other than the \n     long-term interests of the United States.\n\n  That is from President Clinton's Solicitor General. Some people are \nsaying, we want to see his notes when he was giving advice or memos as \nAssistant Solicitor General. That should not be done.\n  Ron Klain, former counsel to Vice President Gore, wrote to Senator \nLeahy on January 16, 2002:\n\n       Miguel is a person of outstanding character, tremendous \n     intellect, and with a deep commitment to the faithful \n     application of precedent. Miguel will rule justly towards all \n     without showing favor towards any group or individual.\n\n  Is there any higher standard that we should hold our judges to than \nthat? This is from the counsel to former Vice President Gore, also a \nDemocrat.\n  Mr. Estrada has extensive appellate practice, and he is widely \nregarded as one of the country's best appellate lawyers. He is \ncurrently a partner in the prestigious Washington, DC, law firm of \nGibson, Dunn & Crutcher. He also clerked for Judge Kearse, President \nCarter's well-respected appointee to the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. In 1998 and 1999, he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Anthony \nKennedy. It goes without saying that somebody who clerks for a Supreme \nCourt Justice is an exceptionally talented individual. He served as \nAssistant Solicitor General of the United States under both Presidents \nClinton and Bush. He held that position for 5 years.\n  This is an exceptionally well-qualified individual. He has performed \nsignificant pro bono service, including representation of a death row \ninmate before the Supreme Court, a case to which he dedicated \napproximately 400 hours.\n  So I don't think anyone can dispute that he is well qualified, and he \nis an outstanding success story. I find no legitimate reason whatsoever \nto oppose his nomination. I am very concerned about colleagues trying \nto say, ``Now, you are going to have to get 60 votes to confirm Miguel \nEstrada as a Federal judge.'' I am concerned about that.\n  I have been in the Senate for 22 years. I have heard people talk \nabout filibustering judges, but it has never happened in my Senate \ncareer. We have filed cloture a few times--maybe for procedural \nreasons, or whatever; but most of the time, even when cloture was \nfiled, it was granted overwhelmingly, with 85 or 90 votes in most \ncases. Those were not filibusters. The only successful filibuster goes \nback to 1968. So that is the only filibuster of a judicial nominee that \nhas happened in the history of the United States. That was on Abe \nFortas' nomination. It was filibustered by Democrats and Republicans. I \nam not saying it was right. I think it was probably wrong. But this \nhasn't been done since 1968.\n  I think it has been implied that many people in the Democrat Party \nare talking about filibustering several judges. So we are going to have \na new standard now--that confirmation of judges is not 50 or 51, but it \nis going to be 60. We didn't do that with Judge Bork, Justice Thomas, \nor Justice Rehnquist, or in previous nominations that were fairly \ncontroversial.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about this. If they are going to march \ndown this road and say you need 60 votes to confirm Mr. Estrada and \nothers, that may be a serious mistake. One may look back on his or her \nSenate career and say we made a mistake. Both sides can play that game. \nI don't want this side to play that game, and I don't want the other \nside to play that game. Two wrongs don't make a right. We should not \nmake the first bad mistake on Miguel Estrada.\n  Other people have said they want to have more information. They don't \nknow enough about this young man. Compare. What did we know about many \nof the judges who have been confirmed? They don't commit themselves on \nhow they would rule on a future case. Well, I hope they don't. They \nshould not. He is not turning over his memoranda that he did as \nAssistant Solicitor General. First, those are confidential attorney-\nclient memoranda, which were not requested by the seven previous \nnominees who worked in the Solicitor General's Office. We didn't \nrequest them previously, and we should not today. Every former \nSolicitor General, including Democrats Archibald Cox, Seth Waxman, Drew \nDays, and Walter Dellinger, signed a letter to the Judiciary Committee \nstating their opposition to the production of these documents, saying, \n``By doing that, they would have a debilitating effect on the ability \nof the Department of Justice to represent the United States before the \nSupreme Court.''\n  Heaven forbid, if you have somebody working for a client saying, I \ncannot give a memo because it might not be politically correct, or it \nmight not help me if I wish to be confirmed before the Senate in the \nfuture, that is a terrible idea. Seth Waxman, a Democrat Solicitor \nGeneral under President Clinton, already said he represented the \ninterests of the United States. That may not have coincided with his \ninterest. It was in the interest of his client on whose behalf he was \nadvocating.\n  Also, it so happens--I believe Mr. Estrada has said he would be \nwilling to come forward with those, but the Justice Department rightly \nsays that would be a very negative precedent to set, and they are \nrightfully saying they should be withheld, as all the former living \nSolicitors General have said. They are correct.\n  Again, we didn't request these memoranda from the seven other \nnominees who worked as Assistant Solicitors General. We should not do \nit in this case.\n  Somebody said: What about Judge Paez and Judge Berzon? They were both \non the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the most liberal circuit court \nin the country. Yes, there was a cloture vote on both of them. I will \nnote that the cloture vote on both of them was--first, Marsha Berzon's \nwas 86 to 13. Cloture on Richard Paez was 85 to 14. So there wasn't a \nfilibuster on those two judges. We had a vote. I voted against them. I \nthink I made a good vote. They were confirmed.\n  We should vote on Miguel Estrada, and if people don't wish to confirm \nhim, they can vote no. The fact is, they know he would be confirmed, so \nthey are trying to deny him a vote. I urge my colleagues to step back a \nlittle bit and ask what would this be doing to the Senate? The \nConstitution gives the right to the Senate in the confirmation to give \nadvice and consent. That implies a vote. We should vote on Miguel \nEstrada and we should confirm Miguel Estrada. I have every confidence, \nhaving known him probably better than almost any circuit court nominee \nin my 22 years, that he will make an outstanding circuit court judge, \none that we will be proud to have confirmed, one that the people who \nare obstructing his confirmation will regret. I think they will soon \nfind out that he is an outstanding nominee and he will make an \noutstanding judge.\n  I urge my colleagues who have maybe participated in dragging this \nthing on--and we have been on it for a couple weeks--after talking to \nMajority Leader Frist, I think we will be on it for a long time. Mr. \nEstrada deserves a vote. He deserves our vote of confidence, and he \ndeserves to be confirmed by the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  conference agreement on h.j. res. 2\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I submit for the Record  a table which \nsummarizes the conference agreement on H.J. Res. 2, the fiscal year \n2003 omnibus appropriations resolution. This table was prepared by my \nstaff based upon the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  I congratulate our majority leader and the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for working to provide no more in total \nappropriations for fiscal year 2003 than was requested by the \nPresident. The conference agreement on H.J. Res. 2 contains $397.855 \nbillion in discretionary spending which, when added to amounts in the \nDefense and military construction appropriations bills already enacted, \ntotals $763.184 billion in fiscal year 2003 discretionary spending. \nThese totals increased from the Senate-passed levels primarily to \naccommodate additional defense spending requested by the President. The \ntotals also include a 0.65 percent across-the-board reduction, \namounting to $2.622 billion, from most accounts in the 11 appropriation \nbills included in the conference agreement.\n  Compared to fiscal year 2002, total discretionary spending after \nenactment of H.J. Res. 2 will grow by 3.9 percent. Defense \ndiscretionary spending will grow by 8.7 percent, and domestic \ndiscretionary spending will decline by 0.7 percent.\n  Compared to fiscal year 2002 less spending for one-time nonrecurring \nprojects, total discretionary spending after enactment of H.J.

Mr. President, I will speak for a few minutes regarding \nthe debate on Mr. Estrada. The reason I say this, when I came on the \nfloor I heard a great deal of discussion about the Hispanic National \nBar Association. I heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle \nthe current president of the Hispanic National Bar Association has led \nthe support of this organization for Mr. Estrada's nomination, which is \nso. However, it jogged my memory that this morning I received a letter \nfrom 15 former presidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association. \nThese 15 take an entirely different position than the current \npresident: 15 well-respected former national leaders of this important \nbar association. They date back to the founding of it in 1972.\n  They have written to the Senate to oppose this nomination. They wrote \nto Senator Hatch and they wrote to Senator Frist, as well as to Senator \nDaschle and myself. I am sure the speakers earlier this morning, when \nthey spoke of the importance of the position of the president of the \nHispanic National Bar Association, were probably not aware that but one \nis in favor of Mr. Estrada and 15 were opposed. It is very weighty \nopposition for 15 prior presidents of the Hispanic National Bar \nAssociation, based on the criteria to evaluate judicial nominees that \nthis association has formally used since 1991, which has been the \npractical standard for the past 30 years, to make this assessment.\n  In addition to the candidate's professional experience and \ntemperament, the criteria for endorsement includes the extent to which \na candidate has been involved, supportive of, and responsive to the \nissues, needs, and concerns of Hispanic Americans and, secondly, the \ncandidate's demonstrated commitment to the concept of equal opportunity \nand equal justice under the law.\n  In the view of the overwhelming majority of the living past \npresidents of the Hispanic National Bar Association, Mr. Estrada's \nrecord does not provide evidence that meets those criteria. But they \nsay his candidacy ``falls short in these respects.''\n  They conclude:\n\n       We believe that for many reasons including: his virtually \n     non-existent written record, his verbally expressed and \n     unrebutted extreme views, his lack of judicial or academic \n     teaching experience (against which his fairness, reasoning \n     skills and judicial philosophy could be properly tested), his \n     poor judicial temperament, his total lack of any connection \n     whatsoever to, or lack of demonstrated interest in the \n     Hispanic community, his refusals to answer even the most \n     basic questions about civil rights and constitutional law, \n     his less than candid responses to other straightforward \n     questions of Senate Judiciary Committee members, and because \n     of the Administration's refusal to provide the Judiciary \n     Committee the additional information and cooperation it needs \n     to address these concerns, the United States Senate cannot \n     and must not conclude that Mr. Estrada can be a fair and \n     impartial appellate court judge.\n\n  This is a significant letter because during the tenure of these past \npresidents, the Hispanic National Bar Association has had a fair \nnonpartisan record of following its criteria, and endorsing or not \nendorsing or rejecting nominees, regardless of whether the nominee is \nRepublican or Democrat. They follow the same criteria for Republicans \nand Democrats. The HNBA has been at the forefront of the effort to \nincrease diversity on the Federal bench and improve the public \nconfidence among Hispanics and others in the fairness of the Federal \ncourts. They have supported Republican nominees as well as Democratic \nnominees. But these 15 individuals, who devoted a great deal of time in \ntheir legal careers to advancing the careers of Hispanics in the legal \ncommunity, have felt compelled publicly to oppose the Estrada \nnomination, although they publicly supported both Democrats and \nRepublicans before. This one they opposed.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter that was sent to me, to Senator \nHatch, to Senator Frist, and to Senator Daschle be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          HNBA's Past Presidents' Statement, February 21, 2003\n\n       We the undersigned past presidents of the Hispanic National \n     Bar Association write in strong opposition to the nomination \n     of Miguel A. Estrada for a judgeship on the Court of Appeals \n     for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n       Since the HNBA's Establishment in 1972, promoting civil \n     rights and advocating for judicial appointments of qualified \n     Hispanic Americans throughout our nation have been our \n     fundamental concerns. Over the years, we have had a proven \n     and respected record of endorsing or not endorsing or \n     rejecting nominees on a non-partisan basis of both Republican \n     and Democratic presidents.\n       In addition to evaluating a candidate's professional \n     experience and judicial temperament, the HNBA's policies and \n     procedures governing judicial endorsements have required that \n     the following additional criteria be considered:\n       1. The extent to which a candidate has been involved in, \n     supportive of, and responsive to the issues, needs and \n     concerns of Hispanic Americans, and\n       2. The candidate's demonstrated commitment to the concept \n     of equal opportunity and equal justice under the law.\n       Based upon our review and understanding of the totality of \n     Mr. Estrada's record and life's experiences, we believe that \n     there are more than enough reasons to conclude that Mr. \n     Estrada's candidacy falls short in these respects. We believe \n     that for many reasons including: his virtually non-existent \n     written record, his verbally expressed and un-rebutted \n     extreme views, his lack of judicial or academic teaching \n     experience, (against which his fairness, reasoning skills and \n     judicial philosophy could be properly tested), his poor \n     judicial temperament, his total lack of any connection \n     whatsoever to, or lack of demonstrated interest in the \n     Hispanic community, has refusals to answer even the most \n     basic questions about civil rights and constitutional law, \n     his less than candid responses to other straightforward \n     questions of Senate Judiciary Committee members, and because \n     of the Administration's refusal to provide the Judiciary \n     Committee the additional information and cooperation it needs \n     to address these concerns, the United States Senate cannot \n     and must not conclude that Mr. Estrada can be a fair and \n     impartial appellate court judge.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       Signed by 15 past HNBA presidents.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/24/senate-section/article/S2573-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prosecutorial Remedies and \n     Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of \n     2003'' or ``PROTECT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to \n     protection under the First Amendment under Miller v. \n     California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v. \n     Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may \n     be prohibited.\n       (2) The Government has a compelling state interest in \n     protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, \n     including both child molesters and child pornographers. ``The \n     prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children \n     constitutes a government objective of surpassing \n     importance,'' New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982) \n     (emphasis added), and this interest extends to stamping out \n     the vice of child pornography at all levels in the \n     distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 \n     (1990).\n       (3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in \n     ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child \n     pornography remain enforceable and effective. ``[T]he most \n     expeditious if not the only practical method of law\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\n     enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by \n     imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, \n     advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.'' Ferber, \n     458 U.S. at 760.\n       (4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the \n     technology did not exist to: [(A) create depictions of \n     virtual children that are indistinguishable from depictions \n     of real children;] (A) computer generate depictions of \n     children that are indistinguishable from depictions of real \n     children; [(B) create depictions of virtual children using \n     compositions of real children to create an unidentifiable \n     child; or] (B) use parts of images of real children to create \n     a composite image that is unidentifiable as a particular \n     child and in a way that prevents even an expert from \n     concluding that parts of images of real children were used; \n     or (C) disguise pictures of real children being abused by \n     making the image look computer generated.\n       (5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \n     demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise \n     depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and \n     to make depictions of real children appear computer \n     generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not \n     already, [to make depictions of virtual children look real] \n     to computer generate realistic images of children.\n       (6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions \n     today involve images contained on computer hard drives, \n     computer disks, [and/or] or related media.\n       (7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child \n     pornography images being trafficked today were made other \n     than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless, \n     technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal \n     defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography \n     they possess are not those of real children, insisting that \n     the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \n     images are not computer-generated. Such challenges [will \n     likely increase] increased significantly after the Ashcroft \n     v. Free Speech Coalition decision.\n       (8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by \n     definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers \n     and has been transferred over the Internet, often in \n     different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An \n     image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely \n     a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images \n     can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an \n     expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts \n     a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a \n     paper version into a digital format, this task can be even \n     harder since proper forensic [delineation] assessment may \n     depend on the quality of the image scanned and the tools used \n     to scan it.\n       (9) The impact on the government's ability to prosecute \n     child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth \n     Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions \n     since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in \n     Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions \n     generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the \n     most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically \n     identify the child in the depiction or otherwise identify the \n     origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child \n     pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme \n     Court's affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision, \n     prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed \n     concern about the continued viability of previously indicted \n     cases as well as declined potentially meritorious \n     prosecutions.\n       (10) Since the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech \n     Coalition, defendants in child pornography cases have almost \n     universally raised the contention that the images in question \n     could be virtual, thereby requiring the government, in nearly \n     every child pornography prosecution, to find proof that the \n     child is real. Some of these defense efforts have already \n     been successful.\n       [(10)] (11) In the absence of congressional action, this \n     problem will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere \n     prospect that the technology exists to create computer or \n     computer-generated depictions that are indistinguishable from \n     depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess \n     images of real children to escape prosecution, for it \n     threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of \n     computer images even when a real child was abused. This \n     threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real \n     children unenforceable. Moreover, imposing an additional \n     requirement that the Government prove beyond a reasonable \n     doubt that the defendant knew that the image was in fact a \n     real child--as some courts have done--threatens to result in \n     the de facto legalization of the possession, receipt, and \n     distribution of child pornography for all except the original \n     producers of the material.\n       [(11)] (12) To avoid this grave threat to the Government's \n     unquestioned compelling interest in effective enforcement of \n     the child pornography laws that protect real children, a \n     statute must be adopted that prohibits a narrowly-defined \n     subcategory of images.\n       [(12)] (13) The Supreme Court's 1982 Ferber [v. New York] \n     decision holding that child pornography was not protected \n     drove child pornography off the shelves of adult bookstores. \n     Congressional action is necessary now to ensure that open and \n     notorious trafficking in such materials does not reappear, \n     and even increase, on the Internet.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I am trying to keep this schedule \nto what the distinguished majority leader wanted and do what was told \nothers. Frankly, I don't care when the vote is, but I do thank the \nstaff for trying to keep us on other schedules.\n  If we go the full time, then the vote would be, am I correct, unless \nsome time is yielded back, it would be around 20 minutes to 6 and not \n5:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished senior Senator from Utah is on his way \nback from another engagement. I will begin.\n  I join with Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nin urging passage of S. 151, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, a bill \nproviding important new tools to fight child pornography. I commend \nSenator Hatch for his leadership and his unflagging efforts to protect \nour nation's children\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\nfrom exploitation by child pornographers.\n  When Senator Hatch and I introduced this bill last month, I supported \npassing a bill that was identical to the measure that we worked so hard \non in the last Congress. That bill had passed the Judiciary Committee \nand the Senate unanimously in the 107th Congress. It did not become law \nlast year because, even though the Senate was still meeting, \nconsidering and passing legislation, the House of Representatives had \nadjourned and would not return to take action on this measure that had \npassed the Senate unanimously or to work out our differences.\n  As I said when we introduced the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act and again as \nthe Judiciary Committee considered this measure, although this bill is \nnot perfect, it is a good faith effort to provide powerful tools for \nprosecutors to deal with the problem of child pornography within \nconstitutional limits. We failed to do that in the 1996 Child \nPornography Prevention Act--``CPPA'', much of which the Supreme Court \nstruck down last year. We must not make the same mistake again. The \nlast thing we want to do is to create years of legal limbo for our \nnation's children, after which the courts strike down yet another law \nas unconstitutional.\n  I also said at our Judiciary Committee meeting that I hoped we could \npass the bill in the same form as it unanimously passed in the last \nCongress. That is still my position and I believe it would have been \nwiser to proceed in that manner. Since my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle and the Administration have jointly decided not to follow \nthis route, however, I have nevertheless continued to work with Senator \nHatch to craft the strongest bill possible that will produce \nconvictions that will stick under the constitution.\n  I urge the Senate to pass this legislation, and I strongly urge the \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives to take this \nsecond opportunity to pass this important legislation in the form that \nwe send to them. I urge the Administration to support this bipartisan \nmeasure, instead of using this debate as an opportunity to add more \nchanges that strive to make an ideological statement, but which may not \nwithstand Constitutional scrutiny and may bog down the bill. If we act \nin a bipartisan manner, we can have a bill to the President that can \nbegin working for America's children in short order.\n  I want to take a moment to speak again about the history of this \nimportant bill and the joint effort that it took to get to this point. \nIn May of 2002, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in \nintroducing the PROTECT Act, after the Supreme Court's decision in \nAshcroft v. Free Speech Coalition ``Free Speech''. Although there were \nsome others who raised constitutional concerns about specific \nprovisions in that bill, I believed that unlike legislative language \nproposed by the Administration in the last Congress, it was a good \nfaith effort to work within the First Amendment.\n  Everyone in the Senate agrees that we should do all we can to protect \nour children from being victimized by child pornography. That would be \nan easy debate and vote. The more difficult thing is to write a law \nthat will both do that and will produce convictions that stick. In \n1996, when we passed the CPPA many warned us that certain provisions of \nthat Act violated the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's decision \nlast year in Free Speech has proven them correct.\n  We should not sit by and do nothing. It is important that we respond \nto the Supreme Court's decision. It is just as important, however, that \nwe avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the CPPA, this time we \nshould respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our \nchildren deserve more than a press conference on this issue. They \ndeserve a law that will last rather than be stricken from the law \nbooks.\n  It is important that we do all we can to end the victimization of \nreal children by child pornographers, but it is also important that we \npass a law that will withstand First Amendment scrutiny. We need a law \nwith real bite, not one with false teeth.\n  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act in the \n107th Congress, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last \nCongress, I convened a hearing on October 2, 2002 on the legislation. \nWe heard from the Administration, from the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children--``NCMEC'', and from experts who came and told \nus that our bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but \nthe House-passed bill supported by the Administration would not.\n  I then placed the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act on the Judiciary \nCommittee's calendar for the October 8, 2002, business meeting. I \ncontinued to work with Senator Hatch to improve the bill so that it \ncould be quickly enacted. Unfortunately the Judiciary Committee was \nunable to consider it because of procedural maneuvering by my \ncolleagues that had nothing to do with this important legislation.\n  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why, for a full week in \nOctober, I worked to clear and have the full Senate pass a substitute \nto the bill that tracked the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute \nin nearly every area. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted \nparts of the House bill which would help the NCMEC work with local and \nstate law enforcement on these cases. Twice, I spoke on the Senate \nfloor imploring that we approve such legislation. As I stated then, \nevery single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged \nRepublicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--\nso similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could \nswiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster. \nUnfortunately, they did not. Facing the recess before the mid-term \nelections, we were stymied again.\n\n  Even after the last election, however, during our lame duck session, \nI continued to work with Senator Hatch to pass this legislation through \nthe Senate. As I had stated I would do prior to the election, I called \na meeting of the Judiciary Committee on November 14, 2002. In the last \nmeeting of the Judiciary Committee under my Chairmanship in the 107th \nCongress, I placed S. 2520, the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act, on the agenda \nyet again. At that meeting the Judiciary Committee amended and approved \nthis legislation. We agreed on a substitute and to improvements in the \nvictim shield provision that I authored.\n  Although I did not agree with certain of Senator Hatch's amendments, \nbecause I thought that they risked having the bill declared \nunconstitutional, I nevertheless both called for the Committee to \napprove the bill and voted for the bill in its amended form. That is \nthe legislative process. I compromised on some issues, and Senator \nHatch compromised on others. Even though the bill was not exactly as \neither of us would have wished, we both worked fervently to seek its \npassage.\n  I sought, the same day as the bill unanimously passed the Judiciary \nCommittee, to gain the unanimous consent of the full Senate to pass the \nHatch-Leahy PROTECT Act as reported, and I worked with Senator Hatch to \nclear the bill on both sides of the aisle. I am pleased that the Senate \ndid pass the bill by unanimous consent. I want to thank Senator Hatch \nfor all he did to help clear the bill for passage in the 107th \nCongress. Unfortunately, the House failed to act on this measure last \nyear and the Administration decided not to push for passage. If they \nhad, we could have passed a bill, sent it to the President, and already \nhad a new law on the books.\n  Instead, we were forced to repeat the entire process again, and I am \nhere again with Senator Hatch asking yet again that this bill be \nenacted. I am glad to have been able to work hand-in-hand with Senator \nHatch on the PROTECT Act because, it is a bill that gives prosecutors \nand investigators the tools they need to combat child pornography. The \nHatch-Leahy PROTECT Act strives to be a serious response to a serious \nproblem. Let me outline some of the bill's important provisions:\n  Section 3 of the bill creates two new crimes aimed at people who \ndistribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice \nchildren to do illegal acts. Each of these new crimes carries a 15 year \nmaximum prison sentence for a first offense and double that term for \nrepeat offenders. First, the bill criminalizes the pandering of child \npornography, creating a new crime to respond to the Supreme Court's \nrecent ruling striking down the CPPA's definition of pandering. This \nprovision is\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nnarrower than the old ``pandering'' definition in at least one way that \nresponds to a specific Court criticism. The new crime only applies to \nthe people who actually pander the child pornography or solicit it, not \nto all those who possess the material ``downstream'' and it requires \nthe government to demonstrate that the defendant acted with the \nspecific intent that the material is believed to be child pornography. \nThe bill also contains a directive to the Sentencing Commission which \nasks it to distinguish between those who pander or distribute such \nmaterial and those who only ``solicit'' the material. As with narcotics \ncases, distributors and producers are more culpable than users and \nshould be more harshly punished for maximum deterrent effect.\n  I would have liked for the pandering provision to be crafted more \nnarrowly so that ``purported'' material was not included and so that \nall pandering prosecutions would be linked to ``obscenity'' doctrine. \nThat is the way that Senator Hatch and I originally wrote and \nintroduced this provision in the last Congress. Unfortunately, the \namendment process has resulted in some expansions to this once non-\ncontroversial provision that may subject it to a constitutional \nchallenge. Thus, while it responds to some specific concerns raised by \nthe Supreme Court there are constitutional issues that the courts will \nhave to seriously consider with respect to this provision. I will \ndiscuss these issues later.\n  Second, the bill creates a new crime that I proposed to take direct \naim at one of the chief evils of child pornography: namely, its use by \nsexual predators to entice minors either to engage in sexual activity \nor the production of more child pornography. This was one of the \ncompelling arguments made by the government before the Supreme Court in \nsupport of the CPPA, but the Court rejected that argument as an \ninsufficient basis to ban the production, distribution or possession of \n``virtual'' child pornography. This bill addresses that same harm in a \nmore targeted and narrowly tailored manner. It creates a new felony, \nwhich applies to both actual and virtual child pornography, for people \nwho use such material to entice minors to participate in illegal \nactivity. This will provide prosecutors a potent new tool to put away \nthose who prey upon children using such pornography B whether the child \npornography is virtual or not.\n  Next, this bill attempts to revamp the existing affirmative defense \nin child pornography cases both in response to criticisms of the \nSupreme Court and so that the defense does not erect unfair hurdles to \nthe prosecution of cases involving real children. Responding directly \nto criticisms of the Court, the new affirmative defense applies equally \nto those who are charged with possessing child pornography and to those \nwho actually produce it, a change from current law. It also allows, \nagain responding to specific Supreme Court criticisms, for a defense \nthat no actual children were used in the production of the child \npornography--i.e. that it was made using computers. At the same time, \nthis provision protects prosecutors from unfair surprise in the use of \nthis affirmative defense by requiring that a defendant give advance \nnotice of his intent to assert it, just as defendants are currently \nrequired to give if they plan to assert an alibi or insanity defense. \nAs a former prosecutor I suggested this provision because it effects \nthe real way that these important trials are conducted. With the \nprovision, the government will have sufficient notice to marshal the \nexpert testimony that may be needed to rebut this ``virtual porn'' \ndefense in cases where real children were victimized.\n  This improved affirmative defense measure also provides important \nsupport for the constitutionality of much of this bill after the Free \nSpeech decision. Even Justice Thomas specifically wrote that it would \nbe a key factor for him. This is one reason for making the defense \napplicable to all non-obscene, child pornography, as defined in 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 2256. In the bill's current form, however, the affirmative \ndefense is not available in one of the new proposed classes of virtual \nchild pornography, which would be found at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252B(b)(2). \nThis omission may render that provision unconstitutional under the \nFirst Amendment, and I hope that, as the legislative process continues, \nwe can work to improve the bill in this and other ways. I do not want \nto be here again in five years, after yet another Supreme Court \ndecision striking this law down.\n\n  The bill also provides needed assistance to prosecutors in rebutting \nthe virtual porn defense by removing a restriction on the use of \nrecords of performers portrayed in certain sexually explicit conduct \nthat are required to be maintained under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2257, and \nexpanding such records to cover computer images. These records, which \nwill be helpful in proving that the material in question is not \n``virtual'' child pornography, may be used in federal child pornography \nand obscenity prosecutions under this Act. The purpose of this \nprovision is to protect real children from exploitation. It is \nimportant that prosecutors have access to this information in both \nchild pornography and obscenity prosecutions, since the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision has had the effect of narrowing the child pornography \nlaws, making more likely that the general obscenity statutes will be \nimportant tools in protecting children from exploitation. In addition, \nthe Act raises the penalties for not keeping accurate records, further \ndeterring the exploitation of minors and enhancing the reliability of \nthe records.\n  Next, the Hatch-Leahy bill contains several provisions altering the \ndefinition of ``child pornography'' in response to the Free Speech \ncase. One approach would have been simply to add an ``obscenity'' \nrequirement to the child pornography definitions. Outlawing all obscene \nchild pornography--real and virtual; minor and `youthful-adult;' \nsimulated and real--would clearly pass a constitutional challenge \nbecause obscene speech enjoys no protection at all. Under the Miller \nobscenity test, such material (1) ``appeals to the prurient interest,'' \n(2) is utterly ``offensive'' in any ``community,'' and (3) has \nabsolutely no serious ``literary, artistic or scientific value.''\n  Some new provisions of this bill do take this ``obscenity'' approach, \nlike the new Sec. 2252B(b)(1) and, to a lesser extent the new \nSec. 2252B(b)(2), which I crafted with Senator Hatch. Other provisions, \nhowever, take a different approach. Specifically, the CPPA's definition \nof ``identifiable minor'' has been modified in the bill to include a \nprong for persons who are ``virtually indistinguishable from an actual \nminor.'' This adopts language from Justice O'Connor's concurrence in \nthe Free Speech case. Thus, while this language is defensible, I \npredict that this provision will be the center of much constitutional \ndebate. Although I will explain in more detail later, these new \ndefinitional provisions risk crossing the constitutional line. I am not \nalone in this view and ask to have supporting letters from \nconstitutional experts printed in the record.\n  This bill also contains a variety of other measures designed to \nincrease jail sentences in cases where children are victimized by \nsexual predators. First, it enhances penalties for repeat offenders of \nchild sex offenses by expanding the predicate crimes which trigger \ntough, mandatory minimum sentences. Second, the bill requires the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to address a disturbing disparity in the current \nSentencing Guidelines. The current sentences for a person who actually \ntravels across state lines to have sex with a child are not as high as \nfor child pornography. The Commission needs to correct this oversight \nimmediately, so that prosecutors can take these dangerous sexual \npredators off the street. These are all strong measures designed to \nprotect children and increase prison sentences for child molesters and \nthose who otherwise exploit children.\n  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also has several provisions designed to \nprotect the children who are victims in these horrible cases. Privacy \nof the children must be paramount. It is important that they not be \nvictimized yet again in the criminal process. This bill provides for \nthe first time ever an explicit shield law that prohibits the name or \nother non physical identifying information of the child victim (other \nthan the age or approximate age) from being admitted at any child \npornography trial. It is also intended that judges can and will take \nappropriate steps to ensure that such information as the child's name, \naddress or other\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\nidentifying information not be publicly disclosed during the pretrial \nphase of the case or at sentencing as well. The bill also contains a \nprovision requiring the judge to instruct the jury, upon request of the \ngovernment, that no inference should be drawn against the United States \nbecause of information inadmissible under the new shield law.\n  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also amends certain reporting provisions \ngoverning child pornography. Specifically, it allows federal \nauthorities to report information they receive from the Center from \nMissing and Exploited Children, (``CMEC''), to state and local police \nwithout a court order. In addition, the bill removes the restrictions \nunder the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, (ECPA) for reporting \nthe contents of, and information pertaining to, a subscriber of stored \nelectronic communications to the CMEC when a mandatory child porn \nreport is filed with the CMEC pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032.\n  While this change may invite rogue federal, state or local agents to \ntry to circumvent all subpoena and court order requirements under ECPA \nand allow them to obtain subscriber emails and information by \ntriggering the initial report to the CMEC themselves, it should be well \nunderstood that this is not the intention behind this provision. These \nimportant safeguards are not being altered in any way, and a deliberate \nuse of the tip line by a government agent to circumvent the well \nestablished statutory requirements of these provisions would be a \nserious violation of the law. Nevertheless, we should still consider \nfurther clarification to guard against subverting the safeguards in \nECPA from government officials going on fishing expeditions for stored \nelectronic communications under the rubric of child porn \ninvestigations.\n  As I made clear when this bill was introduced, I continue to express \nmy disappointment in the Department of Justice information sharing \nregulations related to the CMEC tip line. According to a recent \nGovernment Accounting Office, (GAO) report, due to outdated turf \nmentalities, the Attorney General's regulations exclude both the United \nStates Secret Service and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service from \ndirect access to important tip line information. That is totally \nunacceptable, especially in the post 9-11 world where the importance of \ninformation sharing is greater than ever. How can the Administration \njustify support of this Hatch-Leahy bill, which allows state and local \nlaw enforcement officers such access, when they are simultaneously \nrefusing to allow other federal law enforcement agencies access to the \nsame information? I made this request in my statement when we \nintroduced this bill, but once more I urge the Attorney General to end \nthis unseemly turf battle and to issue regulations allowing both the \nSecret Service and the Postal Inspection Service, who both perform \nvaluable work in investigating these cases, to have access to this \nimportant information so that they can better protect our nation's \nchildren.\n\n  The Hatch-Leahy bill also provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwhere a defendant induces a child to engage in sexually explicit \nconduct outside the United States for the purposes of producing child \npornography which they intend to transport to the United States. The \nprovision is crafted to require the intent of actual transport of the \nmaterial into the United States, unlike the House bill from the last \nCongress, which criminalized even an intent to make such material \n``accessible.'' Under that overly broad wording, any material posted on \na web site internationally could be covered, whether or not it was ever \nintended that the material be downloaded in the United States. Under \nthe bill we consider today, however, proof of a specific intent to send \nsuch material to the United States is required.\n  Finally, the bill provides a new private right of action for the \nvictims of child pornography. This provision has teeth, including \ninjunctive relief and punitive damages that will help to put those who \nproduce child pornography out of business for good. I commend Senator \nHatch for his leadership on this provision and his recognition that \nsuch punitive damages provisions are important means of deterring \nmisconduct. These provisions are important, practical tools to put \nchild pornographers out of business for good and in jail where they \nbelong.\n  As I mentioned previously, the PROTECT Act is a good faith effort to \ntackle the child pornography problem, and I have supported its passage \nfrom the outset. I am also glad that because of our bipartisan \ncooperation, Senator Hatch and I were able to offer a joint amendment \nin Committee that strengthened the bill further against constitutional \nattack. Here are some of the improvements that we jointly made to the \nbill as introduced.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment created a new specific intent requirement \nin the pandering crime. The provision is now better focused on the true \nwrongdoers and requires that the government prove beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that the defendant actually intended others to believe that the \nmaterial in question is obscene child pornography. This is a positive \nstep.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment narrowed the definition of ``sexually \nexplicit conduct'' for prosecutions of computer created child \npornography. Although I continue to have serious reservations about the \nconstitutionality of prosecuting cases involving such ``virtual child \npornography'' after the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech \nCoalition v. Ashcroft, narrowing the definition of the conduct covered \nprovides another argument that the provision is not as overbroad as the \none in the CPPA. I had also proposed a change that contained an even \nbetter definition, in order to focus the provision to true ``hard \ncore'' child pornography, and I hope we will consider such a change as \nthe process continues.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment the saved the existing ``anti-morphing'' \nprovision from a fresh constitutional attack by excluding 100% virtual \nchild pornography from its scope. That morphing provision was one of \nthe few measures from the CPPA that the Supreme Court did not strike \ndown last year. I am pleased that we are avoiding placing this measure \nin constitutional peril in this bill.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment refined the definition of virtual child \npornography in the provision that Senator Hatch and I worked together \nto craft last year, which will be new 18 U.S.C. Sec.  2252B. These \nprovisions rely to a large extent on obscenity doctrine, and thus are \nmore rooted in the constitution than other parts of the bill. I was \npleased that the Hatch-Leahy amendments includes in new 2252B(2) a \ndefinition that the image be ``graphic''--that is one where the \ngenitalia are actually shown during the sex act for two reasons.\n  First, because the old law would have required proof of ``actual'' \nminors in cases with ``virtual'' pictures, I believe that this \nclarification will remove a potential contradiction from the new law \nwhich pornographers could have used to mount a defense. Second, it will \nprovide another argument supporting the law's constitutionality because \nthe new provision is narrowly tailored to cover only the most ``hard \ncore'' child pornography. I am disappointed that we could not include a \nsimilar definition in the S. 151's other virtual child pornography \nprovision, which was included at the request of the Administration. I \nhope that will be considered as this bill moves forward.\n  The Hatch-Leahy amendment also clarifies that digital pictures are \ncovered by the PROTECT Act, an important addition in today's world of \ndigital cameras and camcorders.\n  These were important changes, and I was glad to work with Senator \nHatch to craft them.\n  This law is not perfect, however, and I would have liked to see some \nadditional improvements to the bill. Let me outline some of them.\n  First, regarding the tip line, I would have liked to further clarify \nthat law enforcement agents may not and should not ``tickle the tip \nline'' to avoid the key protections of the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act (ECPA). This might have included clarifying 42 U.S.C. \nSec. 13032 that the initial tip triggering the report may not be \ngenerated by the government's investigative agents themselves. A tip \nline to the CMEC is just that--a way for outsiders to report wrongdoing \nto the CMEC and the government, not for the government to generate a \nreport to itself without following otherwise required lawful process. \nIt was not the intent of any part of this bill to alter that purpose.\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n  Second, regarding the affirmative defense, I would have liked to \nensure that there is an affirmative defense for each new category of \nchild pornography and for all cases where a defendant can prove in \ncourt that a specific, non-obscene image was made using not any child \nbut only actual, identifiable adults. That will no doubt be a basis for \nattacking the constitutionality of this law.\n  As a general matter, it is worth repeating that we could be avoiding \nall these problems were we to take the simple approach of outlawing \n``obscene'' child pornography of all types, which we do in one new \nprovision that I suggested. That approach would produce a law beyond \nany possible challenge. This approach is also supported by the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, which we all respect as the \ntrue expert in this field.\n  Following is an excerpt from the Center's answer to written questions \nsubmitted after our hearing, which I will place in the record in its \nentirety and I quote:\n\n       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all child \n     pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges and \n     juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt in \n     criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person under \n     community standards model, it is highly unlikely that any \n     community would not find child pornography obscene. . . .\n       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate, the \n     prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach \n     is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.\n\n  Based on this letter, according to the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, the approach that is least likely to raise \nconstitutional questions--using established obscenity law--is also an \neffective one. In short, the obscenity approach is the most narrowly \ntailored to prevent child pornography. New section 2252B adopts this \nobscenity approach, but because that is not the approach that other \nparts of the PROTECT Act uses, I recognize that it contains provisions \nabout which some may have legitimate Constitutional questions.\n  Specifically, in addition to the provisions that I have already \ndiscussed, there were two amendments adopted in the Judiciary Committee \nin the last Congress and one on this Congress to which I objected that \nare included in the bill as we consider it today. I felt and still feel \nthat these alterations from the original way that Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced the bill needlessly risk a serious constitutional challenge \nto a bill that provided prosecutors the tools they needed to do their \njobs, and that the bill would be even stronger than it is now were they \nchanged. Let me discuss my opposition to these changes adopted by the \nJudiciary Committee in this Congress and the last.\n  Although I worked with Senator Hatch to write the new pandering \nprovision in the PROTECT Act, I did not support two of Senator Hatch's \namendments extending the provision to cover (1) ``purported'' material, \nand (2) material not linked to obscenity.\n  First, in the last Congress during our markup I objected to an \namendment from Senator Hatch to include in the pandering provision \n``purported'' material, which criminalizes speech even when there is no \nunderlying material at all--whether obscene or non-obscene, virtual or \nreal, child or adult. The pandering provision is an important tool for \nprosecutors to punish true child pornographers who for some technical \nreason are beyond the reach of the normal child porn distribution or \nproduction statutes. It is not meant to federally criminalize talking \ndirty over the internet or the telephone when the person never \npossesses any material at all. That is speech, and that goes too far.\n  The original pandering provision in S. 2520 as introduced last \nCongress was quite broad, and some argued that it presented \nconstitutional problems as written, but I thought that prosecutors \nneeded a strong tool, so I supported Senator Hatch on that provision.\n  I was heartened that Professor Schauer of Harvard, a noted First \nAmendment expert, testified at our hearing last year that he thought \nthat the original provision was Constitutional, barely. Unfortunately, \nProfessor Schauer has since written to me stating that this new \namendment to include ``purported'' material ``would push well over the \nconstitutional edge a provision that is now up against the edge, but \nprobably barely on the constitutional side of it'' I placed his letter \nin the record upon introduction of the bill in this Congress on January \n13, 2003.\n  The second amendment to the pandering provision to which I objected \nexpanded it to cover cases not linked in any way to obscenity. It would \nallow prosecution of anyone who ``presented'' a movie that was intended \nto cause another person to believe that it included a minor engaging in \nsexually explicit conduct, whether or not it was obscene and whether or \nnot any real child was involved. Any person or movie theater that \npresented films like Traffic, Romeo and Juliet, and American Beauty \nwould be guilty of a felony. The very point of these dramatic works is \nto cause a person to believe that something is true when in fact it is \nnot. These were precisely the overbreadth concerns that led 7 justices \nof the Supreme Court to strike down parts of the 1996 Act. We do not \nwant to put child porn convictions on hold while we wait another 6 \nyears to see if the law will survive constitutional scrutiny.\n  Because these two changes endanger the entire pandering provision, \nbecause they are unwise, and because that section is already strong \nenough to prosecute those who peddle child pornography, I oppose those \nexpansions of the provision and still hope that we can reconsider them.\n  Although I joined Senator Hatch in introducing this bill, even when \nit was introduced last year I expressed concern over certain \nprovisions. One such provision was the new definition of ``identifiable \nminor.'' When the bill was introduced, I noted that this provision \nmight ``both confuse the statute unnecessarily and endanger the already \nupheld ``morphing'' section of the CPPA.'' I said I was concerned that \nit ``could present both overbreadth and vagueness problems in a later \nconstitutional challenge.'' Unfortunately, this provision remains \nproblematic and susceptible to constitutional challenge.\n\n  As the bill developed, a change to the definition of ``identifiable \nminor'' expanded it to cover ``virtual'' child pornography--that is, \n100% computer generated pictures not involving any real children. For \nthat reason, it presented additional constitutional problems similar to \nthe Administration supported House bill. I objected to this amendment \nwhen it was added to the bill in the last Congress in Committee, and I \ncontinue to have serious concerns with it now.\n  The ``identifiable minor'' provision in the PROTECT Act may be used \nwithout any link to obscenity doctrine. Therefore, what potentially \nsaved the original version we introduced in the 107th Congress was that \nit applied to child porn made with real ``persons.'' The provision was \ndesigned to cover all sorts of images of real kids that are morphed or \naltered, but not something entirely made by computer, with no child \ninvolved.\n  The change adopted in the Judiciary Committee last year and supported \nby the Administration, however, redefined ``identifiable minor'' by \ncreating a new category of pornography for any ``computer generated \nimage that is virtually indistinguishable from an actual minor'' \ndislodged, in my view, that sole constitutional anchor. The new \nprovision could be read to include images that never involved real \nchildren at all but were 100 percent computer generated.\n  That was not the original goal of this provision, and that was the \nreason it was constitutional. There are other provisions in this bill \nthat deal with obscene virtual child pornography that I support, such \nas those in new section 2252B, which are linked to obscenity doctrine. \nThis provision, however, was intended to ease the prosecutor's burden \nin cases where images of real children were cleverly altered to avoid \nprosecution. By changing the identifiable minor provision into a \nvirtual porn provision, the Administration has needlessly endangered \nits constitutionality.\n  For these reasons, I was glad to work alongside Senator Hatch to \nnarrow this provision before the Judiciary Committee. Unfortunately, \ndespite our best efforts, I fear we did not do everything possible to \nstrengthen it against constitutional attack. Let me explain.\n  Although the Hatch-Leahy amendment adopted in Committee included a\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\nslightly narrower definition of sexually explicit conduct and excluded \ncartoons, sculptures, paintings, anatomical models and the like, the \nvirtual porn provision still sweeps quite broadly and is potentially \nvague. New section 2252A(2)(B)(i) lumps in such truly ``hard core'' \nsexual activities such as intercourse, bestiality, and s in with \nsimple lascivious exhibition of the genitals and simulated intercourse \nwhere any part of a breast is shown. Equating such disparate types of \nconduct, however, does not mesh with community standards and is \nprecisely the type of ``one size fits all'' approach that the Supreme \nCourt rejected in the area of virtual pornography in the Free Speech \ncase. The contrast between this broad definition and the tighter \ndefinition in new Section 2252B(b)(2), crafted by Senator Hatch and \nmyself, is striking. In fact, I suggested that we include the same \ndefinition of ``graphic'' conduct found in new section 2252B in the new \nSection 2252A virtual child porn provision to better focus it on hard \ncore conduct. Unfortunately, the Administration rejected that proposal \nand the provision may be open to overbreadth attacks.\n  I also believe that there is a vagueness concern in the new statute \n2252A because, while it is clearly aimed at ``virtual'' child \npornography (where no real children are involved), it still requires \n``actual'' conduct. In the realm of computer generated images, however, \nthe distinction between actual and simulated conduct makes no sense. It \nis so vague and confusing that I fear that clever defendants might seek \nto argue that this new provision still requires proof ``actual'' sexual \nacts involving real children. I hope that this language is further \nclarified in order to address these concerns.\n  The Supreme Court made it clear that we can only outlaw child \npornography in two situations: No. 1, it is obscene, or No. 2, it \ninvolves real kids. That is the law as stated by the Supreme Court, \nwhether or not we agree with it.\n  Senator Hatch and I agree that legislation in this area is important. \nBut regardless of our personal views, any law must be within \nconstitutional limits or it does no good at all. The amended \nidentifiable minor provision, which would include most ``virtual child \npornography'' in the definition of child pornography, in my view, \ncrosses the constitutional line, however, and needlessly risks \nprotracted litigation that could assist child pornographers in escaping \npunishment.\n  Another new provision in the bill includes a mandatory directive to \nthe United States Sentencing Commission to establish penalties for \nthese new crimes at certain levels. In my experience, however, the non-\npartisan Sentencing Commission operates best when it is allowed to \nstudy an issue carefully and come up with a particular sentencing \nguideline based upon its expertise in these matters. In fact, in child \npornography cases the Sentencing Commission has established \nappropriately high penalties in the past, and there is no reason to \nbelieve that it would not do so again with respect to these new laws.\n  While most all of the provisions of the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act are \ndesigned to withstand constitutional scrutiny, unfortunately legal \nexperts could not vouch for the constitutionality of the bill supported \nby the Administration in the last Congress, which seemed to challenge \nthe Supreme Court's decision, rather than accommodate the restraints \nspelled out by the Supreme Court. That proposal and the associated \nHouse bill from the 107th Congress simply ignored the Supreme Court's \ndecision, reflecting an ideological response rather than a carefully \ndrawn bill that would stand up to scrutiny.\n  I supported passage of the PROTECT Act as Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced it and as it passed the Senate unanimously in the last \nSenate. Even so, I was willing to work with him to further amend the \nbill in the Judiciary Committee. Some amendments that we considered in \ncommittee I supported because they improved the bill. Others went too \nfar.\n  These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the interest of \nmaking progress I support consideration and passage of the measure in \nits current form. I hope that we can work to further improve this bill \nso that it has the best possible chance of withstanding a \nconstitutional challenge.\n  That is not everyone's view. Others evidently think it is more \nimportant to make an ideological statement than to write a law. A media \nreport on this legislation at the end of the last Congress reported the \nwide consensus that the Hatch-Leahy bill was more likely than the House \nbill to withstand scrutiny, but quoted a Republican House member as \nstating: ``Even if it comes back to Congress three times we will have \ncreated better legislation.''\n  To me, that makes no sense. Why not create the ``better legislation'' \nright now for today's children, instead of inviting more years of \nlitigation and putting at risk any convictions obtained in the interim \nperiod before the Supreme Court again reviews the constitutionality of \nCongress' effort to address this serious problem? That is what the \nPROTECT Act seeks to accomplish.\n  Even though this bill is not perfect, I am glad to stand with Senator \nHatch to secure its approval by the Senate as I did in the last \nCongress. The floor statements, including my statement today and the \nstatement and material I placed in the Congressional Record on \nintroduction of this bill on January 13, 2003, will be important to the \nlegislative history of this matter, and so I seek consent to place \nletters from experts in the record commenting upon aspects of the bill. \nCreating a comprehensive record is especially important for statutes \nthat face constitutional challenges, as this law nearly certainly will.\n  As I have explained, I believe that this issue is so important that I \nhave been willing to compromise and to support a measure even though I \ndo not agree with each and every provision that it contains. That is \nhow legislation is normally passed. I hope that the administration and \nthe House do not decide to play politics with this issue and seek \nfurther changes that could bog the bill down. I urge swift \nconsideration and passage of this important bill as it is currently \nwritten. It is aimed at protecting our Nation's children.\n  Just to further explain my support for this measure and to reiterate, \nlet me continue. As I said when we introduced the Hatch-Leahy PROTECT \nAct, again, as the Judiciary Committee considered this measure, \nalthough the bill is not perfect, and on this subject it is difficult \nto get a perfect bill, it is a good-faith effort to provide powerful \ntools for prosecutors to deal with the problem of child pornography \nwithin constitutional limits. We failed to do that in 1996 with the \nChild Pornography Prevention Act, much of which the Supreme Court \nstruck down last year.\n  I hope we would not make the same mistake again. The last thing we \nwant to do is to create years of legal limbo for our Nation's children, \nafter which the courts strike down yet another law as unconstitutional.\n  I also said at our Judiciary Committee meeting that I hoped we could \npass the bill in the same form as unanimously passed in the last \nCongress. That is still my position. I believe it would have been wiser \nto have proceeded in that manner. Since my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, at the request of the administration, have decided not to \nfollow this route, I have nevertheless continued to work with Senator \nHatch to craft the strongest bill possible to produce convictions that \nwill stick under the Constitution.\n  In my years as a prosecutor, I learned that it was important to make \nsure that any cases we brought were based on legislation that was \nconstitutional in the first place so the prosecution would stick.\n  I urge the Senate to pass the Hatch-Leahy bill, and I urge the \nRepublican leadership in the House of Representatives to take the \nsecond opportunity to pass this important legislation. As I said \nearlier, the Senate did pass it last year. The other body did not take \nup our bill.\n  I also urge the administration to support this bipartisan measure. It \nis not a partisan issue to be against child pornographers. We are all \nagainst child pornographers, Republican or Democrats. Those who are \nparents or grandparents feel very strongly the desire to pass this \nlegislation. If we act in a bipartisan manner we can have a bill to the \nPresident that begins working to\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\nprotect America's children, and we can do it in very short order.\n  Our children deserve more than a press conference on this issue. It \nis easy enough for people to stand up and say they are against child \npornographers, as though anyone here would be for them. But it is one \nthing to have a press conference and another thing to give to \nprosecutors tools they can use. Our children deserve a law that will \nlast rather than one that is passed to make political points but will \nbe struck down as unconstitutional.\n\n  Let me describe a few of the provisions in the Hatch-Leahy bill. \nSection 3 of the bill creates two new crimes aimed at people who \ndistribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice \nchildren to do illegal acts. The bill creates a new crime that I \npropose to take direct aim at one of the chief evils of child \npornography; namely, its use by sexual predators to entice minors to \neither engage in sexual activity or other crimes. This 15-year felony \nwill provide prosecutors a potent new tool to put away those who \nactually prey upon children in using such pornography.\n  Next, this bill revamps existing affirmative defense of child \npornography cases, both in response to criticisms of the Supreme Court. \nAs a former prosecutor, I made sure that the provision is drafted to \nprotect prosecutors from unfair surprise in the use of affirmative \ndefense by requiring a defendant give advance notice of his intent to \nassert.\n  Frankly, what I did was put myself in the position of what \nprosecutors would have to do to get convictions. I tried to make sure \nby the provisions I put into this bill, that prosecutors would have the \ntools to give them the best chance to get such convictions.\n  Next, the Hatch-Leahy bill contains several provisions altering the \ndefinition of child pornography in response to the free speech case in \nallowing prosecution of virtual or computer-created child porn. Some \nsuch provisions take the traditional obscenity approach, like the new \nsection 2252(b) which I crafted with Senator Hatch. Other provisions, \nhowever, take a broader approach as advocated by the administration \nlast year. I predict this provision will be the center of much \nconstitutional debate. I am afraid that some in the administration were \nmore eager to have a debating point than they were to have something on \nwhich prosecutors could rely.\n\n  The bill also contains a variety of other measures designed to \nincrease jail sentences in cases where victims are actually sexually \nvictimized by sexual predators. The bill requires the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission to address what I believe is a disturbing disparity in the \ncurrent sentencing guidelines.\n  What is disturbing to me is that the current sentences for a person \nwho actually travels across State lines to have sex with a child are \nnot as high as they are for child pornography. The Commission needs to \ncorrect this oversight immediately so prosecutors can take such \ndangerous sexual predators off the streets.\n  The Hatch-Leahy PROTECT Act also has several provisions designed to \nprotect the children who are victims in these horrible cases. Privacy \nof the children must be paramount. Unfortunately, sometimes, if you \ndrag the name of a child who has been the victim of a sexual predator \nout into the public, then they are victimized yet again, even as you go \nafter the predator. The bill provides for the first time ever an \nexplicit shield law that prohibits a name or other nonphysical \nidentifying information of the child victim from being admitted at \nchild pornography trials.\n  Finally, the bill provides a new private right of action for the \nvictims of child pornography. This is something we have not done before \nin this arena. This provision has real teeth. It includes injunctive \nrelief and punitive damages to help put those who produce child \npornography out of business for good. I commend Senator Hatch for his \nrecognition that punitive damage provisions are an important means for \ndeterring misconduct.\n  Some of these people think if they just move from place to place and \nnothing happens to them, they are free. If they know that whatever \nprofits they make are gone and they are going to have punitive damages \nassessed and still may face, on top of that, criminal action, then they \nwill think twice. These are important, practical tools not only to put \nchild pornographers out of business but to put them in jail.\n  The law is not perfect. As I said, I wish we had adopted the version \nthat had unanimously passed the Senate last Congress, that all \nRepublicans and Democrats supported. That was the decision made by the \nmajority not to do that.\n  As a general matter, it is worth repeating that we could be avoiding \nall problems if we were to take the simple approach of outlawing \nobscene child pornography of all types. The reason I say that is \nbecause of the experts in this area, and it is a very difficult area, \nagree. This approach is supported by the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children. I think we all respect them as true experts on \nprotecting the children. I wish we had followed their approach.\n  Following, again, is an excerpt from the answer to the Senator's \nwritten questions submitted after a hearing and I quote:\n\n       Our view is that the vast majority (99-100 percent) of all \n     child pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges \n     and juries, even under a standard of beyond a reasonable \n     doubt in criminal cases. . . .\n       In the post Free Speech decision legal climate, the \n     prosecution of child pornography under an obscenity approach \n     is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.\n\n  Thus, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nchildren, the approach least likely to raise constitutional questions--\nusing established obscenity law--is also an effective one.\n  Because certain provisions do not follow this approach, I recognize \nthat some may have legitimate constitutional questions about provisions \nin this act. These provisions raise legitimate concerns, but in the \ninterests of making progress, I support consideration and passage of \nthe measure in its current form, and I hope we can work to improve the \nbill so it has the best possible chance of withstanding a \nconstitutional challenge.\n  The bill is not perfect but I am glad to stand with Senator Hatch to \nsecure its approval by the Senate, as I did in the last Congress.\n  I know I speak for the Senator from Utah that the thing both of us \nwant is that we have a bill that can be used by those attacking \npornographers, prosecutors attacking pornographers, that will stand up \nin court. It is not a case of there are people for or against child \npornographers. We are all against them. But we want to make sure for \nthe prosecutor, if you sue them, if you seek injunctive relief if you \nprosecute, that you win.\n  I believe this issue is so important that I have been willing to \ncompromise and to support a measure, even though I do not agree with \neach and every provision it contains. I hope the administration, and \nthe other body, do not decide to play politics with this issue and seek \nfurther changes that could bog down the bill. Had they allowed the bill \nto go forward last year, the one Senator Hatch and I brought to the \nfloor of the Senate and passed unanimously, we would have a bill in \nlaw--a law on the books today. But I urge swift consideration and \npassage of this important bill as it is currently written. It is aimed \nat protecting our Nation's children.\n  It is important we do all we can to end the victimization of real \nchildren by child pornographers, but it is also important that we pass \na law that will withstand first amendment scrutiny. We need a law with \nreal bite, not one with false teeth.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have expert views on this legislation \nprinted in the Record, in addition to the supporting letters and \nmaterials to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       National Center for Missing\n\n\n                                       and Exploited Children,\n\n                                                 October 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     express the views of the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children on these critically important issues for \n     our nation's children. Your stewardship of the Committee's \n     tireless efforts to craft a statute that will withstand \n     constitutional scrutiny is wise and in the long-term best \n     interest of the nation. The National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children is grateful for your leadership on this \n     issue.\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\n       Please find below my response to your written questions \n     submitted on October 9, 2002 regarding the ``Stopping Child \n     Pornography: Protecting our Children and the Constitution.''\n       1. Our view is that the vast majority (99-100%) of all \n     child pornography would be found to be obscene by most judges \n     and juries, even under the standard of beyond a reasonable \n     doubt in criminal cases. Even within the reasonable person \n     under community standards model, it is highly unlikely that \n     any community would not find child pornography obscene.\n       There is a legitimate concern that the obscenity standard \n     does not fully recognize, and therefore punish the \n     exceptional harm to children inherent in child pornography. \n     This issue can be addressed by the enactment of tougher \n     sentencing provisions if the obscenity standard is \n     implemented in the law regarding child pornography. Moreover, \n     mere possession of obscene materials under current law in \n     most jurisdictions is not a criminal violation. If the \n     obscenity standard were implemented for child pornography the \n     legislative intent should be clear concerning punishment for \n     possession of child obscene pornography.\n       In the post--Free Speech decision legal climate the \n     prosecution of child pornography cases under an obscenity \n     approach is a reasonable strategy and sound policy.\n       2. Based on my experience all the images in actual criminal \n     cases meet the lawful definition of obscenity, irrespective \n     of what community you litigate the case. In my experience \n     there has never been a visual depiction of child pornography \n     that did not meet the constitutional requirements for \n     obscenity.\n       3. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     fully supports the correction of this sentencing disparity \n     and welcomes the provision of additional tools for federal \n     judges to remove these predators from our communities. These \n     types of offenders belong to a demographic that is the \n     highest percentile in terms of recidivism than any other \n     single offender category.\n       4. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     fully supports language that allows only ``non-government \n     sources'' to provide tips to the CyberTipline. The role of \n     the CyberTipline at the National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children is to provide tips received from the \n     public and Electronic Communication Services communities and \n     make them available to appropriate law enforcement agencies. \n     Due in part to the overwhelming success of the system and in \n     part to the tragedies of September 11, 2001, federal law \n     enforcement resources cannot address all of the legitimate \n     tips and leads received by the CyberTipline. Allowing the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \n     appropriate federal agencies to forward this valuable \n     information to state and local law enforcement while at the \n     same time addressing legitimate privacy concerns is fully \n     supported.\n       5. The victim shield provision is an excellent and timely \n     policy initiative and one that is fully supported by the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. This \n     provision should allow the narrow exception to a general non-\n     disclosure clause that anticipates the need for law \n     enforcement and prosecutors to use the victim's photography \n     and other relevant information for the sole purpose of \n     verification and authentication of an actual child victim in \n     future cases. This exception would allow the successful \n     prosecution of other cases that may involve a particular \n     victim and still provide the protection against the re-\n     victimization by the criminal justice system.\n       6. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     fully supports extending the terms of authorized supervised \n     release in federal cases involving in exploitation of minors. \n     The evidence for extended supervision in such cases is \n     overwhelming. Without adequate treatment and continued \n     supervision, there is a significantly higher risk for re-\n     offending by this type of offender. Moreover, thee is a \n     significant link between those offenders who possess child \n     pornography and those who sexually assault children. Please \n     see the attached studies that the National Center for Missing \n     and Exploited Children has produced on these issues.\n       Thank you again for the opportunity to address these \n     important issues. Should you need further input or assistance \n     please contact us at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Daniel Armagh,\n     Director, Legal Resource Division.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 13, 2002.\n     Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We write to express our grave concern \n     with the legislation recently proposed by the Department of \n     Justice in response to the Supreme Court's decision in \n     Ashcroft, et al. v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al., No. \n     00-795 (Apr. 16, 2002). In particular, the proposed \n     legislation purports to ban speech that is neither obscene \n     nor unprotected child pornography (indeed, the bill expressly \n     targets images that do not involve real human beings at all). \n     Accordingly, in our view, it suffers from the same \n     infirmities that led the Court to invalidate the statute at \n     issue in Ashcroft.\n       We emphasize that we share the revulsion all Americans feel \n     toward those who harm children, and fully support legitimate \n     efforts to eradicate child pornography. As the Court in \n     Ashcroft emphasized, however, in doing so Congress must act \n     within the limits of the First Amendment. In our view, the \n     bill proposed by the Department of Justice fails to do so.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n       Jodie L.

Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement \n     and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday, \n     October 2, 2002, the staff of the Committee has asked me to \n     comment on the constitutional implications of changing the \n     current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in \n     Section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to \n     ``purported material.''\n       In my opinion the change would push well over the \n     constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against \n     that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side of \n     it.\n       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme \n     Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling \n     decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in \n     2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be \n     an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the \n     offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child \n     pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition \n     in S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five \n     years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision, \n     however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as \n     commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of \n     an unlawful product or service is not protected by the \n     Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made \n     clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press \n     v. Human Relations Commission, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is \n     important to recognize, however, that this feature of \n     commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial \n     speech, where the description or advocacy of illegal acts is \n     fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not \n     applicable here, of immediate incitement.\n       The implication of this is that moving away from \n     communication that could be described as an actual commercial \n     advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to \n     defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if \n     advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all \n     (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a \n     substantial risk that the change moves the entire section \n     away from the straight commercial speech category into more \n     general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy. \n     Because the existing arguments for the constitutionally of \n     this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech \n     Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a \n     straight offer to engage in commercial transaction increases \n     the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including \n     ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering looks \n     less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and \n     thus less open to the constitutional defense I outlined in my \n     written statement and oral testimony.\n       I hope that this is helpful.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                            Frederick Schauer,\n\n                                          Frank Stranton Professor\n                                           of the First Amendment.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see the distinguished senior Senator from \nUtah, the chairman of our committee, in the Chamber. As I said earlier, \nI would certainly yield once he arrived. I commend him for his \ncosponsorship of this bill. I yield the floor, reserving the remainder \nof my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be adopted en bloc and that the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am delighted that we are considering S. \n151, the PROTECT Act of 2003. Senator Leahy and I introduced this bill \nlast May following the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free \nSpeech Coalition, a ruling that made child pornography prosecutions \nimmeasurably\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\nmore difficult. This problem is intolerable and demands our immediate \nattention. Because we could not get this bill to the President's desk \nlast year, it has been my top priority this year.\n  I want to begin by thanking Senator Leahy and his staff for working \nso diligently with me in writing the PROTECT Act during the past ten \nmonths. While we have not seen eye to eye on every provision, we have \nagreed about most of them. We still have some honestly held \ndisagreements, but that is hardly unusual when people talk about the \nFirst Amendment. Senator Leahy's valuable input and insights helped to \nmake this a better bill. I very much hope that he is as proud of the \nfinal result as I am.\n  Mr. President, Congress has long recognized that child pornography \nproduces three distinct and lasting harms to our children. First, child \npornography whets the appetites of pedophiles and prompts them to act \nout their perverse sexual fantasies on real children. Second, child \npornography is a tool used by pedophiles to break down the inhibitions \nof children. Third, child pornography creates an immeasurable and \nindelible harm on the children who are abused to manufacture it.\n  It goes without saying that we have a compelling interest in \nprotecting our children from harm. The PROTECT Act strikes a necessary \nbalance between this goal and the First Amendment.\n  First--and most significantly--the bill plugs a gaping loophole that \nexists in current law. Following the Supreme Court's decision last \nApril, child pornographers can evade even legitimate prosecutions by \nfalsely claiming that their sexually explicit materials did not depict \nreal children. This frivolous argument is made possible by the growth \nof technology. Computer imaging technology has become so sophisticated \nthat even experts often cannot say with absolute certainty that an \nimage is real or a ``virtual'' computer creation. The PROTECT Act \ntherefore permits a prosecution to proceed when the child pornography \ninvolves life-like computer images of real kids. The bill balances this \nprovision by creating a new and powerful affirmative defense. In \nvirtually every prosecution for child pornography, the PROTECT Act \naffords the accused a complete defense to liability upon a showing that \nthe child pornography did not involve an actual minor. In creating this \nnew balance, the bill responds directly to the concerns expressed by \nthe Supreme Court in the Free Speech Coalition decision.\n  Second, the PROTECT Act creates three brand new offenses that are \ndesigned to target some particular problems that stem from child \npornography. One provision prohibits the use of child pornography to \nentice a minor to participate in sexual activity or some other crime. \nAnother prohibits offers to buy, sell or trade either obscene or actual \nchild pornography. The third creates a new offense for obscene child \npornography that will be punished more severely than ordinary \nobscenity.\n  Third, the PROTECT Act expands the record keeping requirements in \nexisting law that apply to those who decide to produce sexually \nexplicit materials. Section 7 of the bill expands the scope of \nmaterials covered to reflect the computerized manner in which they are \nincreasingly being distributed and sold. Producers of such sexually \nexplicit materials must make and maintain records confirming that no \nactual minors were involved in the making of the sexually explicit \nmaterials. In light of the difficulty experts face in determining an \nactor's true age and identity just by viewing the material itself, \nmaintaining these records is vital to ensuring that only adults appear \nin such productions.\n  Fourth, in recognition of the enormous breadth and scope of the \nproblem, the PROTECT Act broadens enforcement efforts in order to \ncreate a more level playing field. Section 9 of the bill provides \nextra-territorial jurisdiction over those foreign producers of child \npornography who transport, or intend to transport, such materials to \nthe United States. Because this is one area of the law where we can \ntruly benefit from more vigorous enforcement, section 14 of the bill \ndirects the Department of Justice to appoint 25 additional attorneys \ndedicated to enforcing child pornography laws, and section 11 creates a \nnew civil action for those aggrieved by such violations. The PROTECT \nAct also toughens existing penalties for offenders. Not only does it \nbroaden the category of repeat offenders subject to more stringent \ncriminal sentences, but it also calls on the U.S. Sentencing Commission \nto review the appalling low sentences that currently apply to offenders \nwho travel across state lines in order to have sex with children.\n  Finally, the PROTECT Act contains new provisions to refine and \nenhance the government's existing authority to tackle child sex crimes. \nSection 15 adds a number of child crimes into the section of Title 18 \nthat authorizes the government to apply for wiretaps. Without this new \nprovision, the government could not seek a wiretap to investigate cases \nwhere, for example, children are being forced to engaging in sex for \nmoney. Section 16 updates the type of information the government can \nobtain from telephone companies with an administrative subpoena in, \namong other things, an investigation involving the sexual exploitation \nof children. Other sections of the bill, moreover, enhance the ability \nof internet service providers to report instances when they spot child \npornography, and authorize the release of that information to state and \nlocal officials for prosecution.\n  The PROTECT Act has been carefully drafted to avoid constitutional \nconcern. I wish it could be stronger. But because of the Supreme Court \ndecisions, we have had to draft it the way we have. From the beginning, \nI have worked very hard to digest the relevant legal issues and to make \nthe PROTECT Act square with the law as articulated by the Supreme \nCourt. This bill has gone through more than a dozen rounds of edits \nsince we began drafting it in April 2002. The issues are complex, and \nwe have meticulously gone over every word and phase numerous times in \norder to write a carefully tailored law that will withstand judicial \nreview. I am confident that we have done just that. The end result of \nall of our hard work is a bill that we can all be proud of: One that is \ntough on pedophiles and child pornographers in a measured and \nconstitutional way.\n\n  Congress has consistently acted in a bipartisan manner to address the \nharms of child pornography. I am pleased to report that we are doing so \nagain with the PROTECT Act. This has been a bipartisan effort from the \nbeginning, and it remains a bipartisan effort today.\n  I respect my colleagues on the other side for being willing to work \nwith us to fashion this bill in a constitutionally sound form. We \nexpect the overwhelming support of Members on both sides of the aisle, \nand, quite frankly, our Nation's children deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget \nOffice cost estimate for the PROTECT Act, S. 151, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 19, 2003.\n     Hon.

The bill would authorize the \n     appropriation of such sums as may be necessary for the \n     Attorney General to appoint 25 additional trial attorneys to \n     prosecute child pornographers.\n       Assuming appropriations of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 151 would cost about $55 \n     million over the 2003-2008 period for new attorneys and for \n     anticipated costs to the federal court and prison system as a \n     result of those hires. About\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\n     $30 million of the total estimated would be to accommodate \n     more convicted offenders in federal prisons. This legislation \n     could affect direct spending and receipts, but we estimate \n     that any such effects would be less than $500,000 annually.\n       S. 151 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). Any costs resulting \n     from the voluntary disclosure of stored communications by \n     public electronic communications providers would be \n     insignificant. The bill would impose a private-sector mandate \n     as defined in UMRA on producers involved in interstate and \n     foreign commerce of certain sexually explicit material. CBO \n     estimates that the cost of the mandate would not exceed the \n     annual threshold by UMRA ($117 million in 2003, adjusted \n     annually for inflation).\n\n\n                estimated cost to the federal government\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 151 is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget function 750 (administration of justice).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2003   2004   2005   2006   2007   2008\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nEstimated Authorized Level....      1      5      9     12     14     15\nEstimated Outlays.............      1      5      9     12     14     15\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In addition to the costs shown above, enacting S. 151 could \n     affect direct spending and receipts. However, we estimate \n     that any such effects would be less than $500,000 in any \n     year.\n\n\n                           basis of estimate\n\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 151 would cost about $55 \n     million over the 2003-2008 period, mostly to hire attorneys \n     and to accommodate more prisoners in the federal prison \n     system. For this estimate, CBO assumes that the bill will be \n     enacted during 2003 and that the necessary amounts will be \n     appropriated for each fiscal year. In addition, we estimate \n     that the bill would increase revenues and direct spending by \n     less than $500,000 each year.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       Based on information from the Department of Justice, CBO \n     estimates that the costs of hiring 25 additional attorneys \n     and necessary support staff would reach $3 million in fiscal \n     year 2004 and would total $18 million over the 2003-2008 \n     period, subject to the appropriation of the necessary \n     amounts.\n       Because the bill would establish new federal crimes and \n     would provide funding for more attorneys to prosecute \n     offenders, the government would be able to pursue more cases \n     than it could under current law. Based on information from \n     the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, CBO \n     expects the 25 new attorneys to generate roughly 600 new \n     cases each year against child sex offenders, which would \n     increase court costs by about $9 million over the 2003-2008 \n     period. Those costs would be subject to the availability of \n     appropriated funds.\n       In addition, implementing S. 151 would increase costs to \n     the federal prison system to accommodate more convicted \n     offenders. The effects of this legislation on the prison \n     system cannot be predicted with certainty, but based on \n     incarceration rates and prison sentences for current sex \n     offenders, CBO expects that the additional cases generated \n     by S. 151 would increase the prison population by roughly \n     1,000 prisoners per year by 2008. At an annual cost per \n     prisoner of about $7,000 (at 2003 prices), CBO estimates \n     that the cost to support those additional prisoners would \n     be a little less than $30 million over the 2003-2008 \n     period.\n     Direct spending and receipts\n       Because those prosecuted and convicted under S. 151 could \n     be subject to criminal fines, the federal government might \n     collect additional fines if the legislation is enacted. \n     Collections of such fines are recorded in the budget as \n     revenues (i.e., governmental receipts), which are deposited \n     in the Crime Victims Fund and later spent. CBO expects that \n     any additional revenues and direct spending would be less \n     than $500,000 annually.\n\n\n        ESTIMATED IMPACT ON STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS\n\n       S. 151 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     UMRA. Any costs resulting from the voluntary disclosure of \n     stored communications by public electronic communications \n     providers would be insignificant.\n\n\n                 ESTIMATED IMPACT ON THE PRIVATE SECTOR\n\n       S. 151 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined by \n     UMRA on producers involved in interstate and foreign commerce \n     of certain sexually explicit material. Under current law, \n     those producers are required to create and maintain records \n     of all performers portrayed in certain sexually explicit \n     conduct displayed in any book, magazine, periodical, film, or \n     video tape. This bill would expand the recordkeeping \n     requirement to include performers portrayed in a computer-\n     generated image, digital image, or picture. CBO estimates \n     that the cost for additional recordkeeping would be small and \n     would not exceed the annual threshold established by UMRA \n     ($117 million in 2003, adjusted annually for inflation).\n       Estimate Prepared By: Federal Costs: Mark Grabowicz (226-\n     2860); Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Greg \n     Waring (225-3220); and Impact on the Private Sector: Jean \n     Talarico (226-2949)\n       Estimate Approved By: Peter H.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator from \nVermont or his designees?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-nine minutes and 13 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask how much time is remaining to the \nSenator from Vermont and how much time to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 33 minutes; the Senator from \nUtah has no time remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, would I be correct, if I yielded back my \ntime, then all time would be yielded back? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. While sorely tempted only as a chance to demonstrate an \nearlier point, I will refrain from that and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the PROTECT \nAct, which I am proud to be co-sponsoring with Senators Hatch, Leahy \nand others. I have been greatly concerned with the increase in reports \nof child abductions and murders, so I am glad to be a part of this \neffort to address this growing problem. In my tenure on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have long fought for our Nation's children, and have \nardently supported laws that bring them and their families greater \nprotection.\n  This legislation comes at a critical time because we are hearing more \nand more about children being taken from their homes or schools and \nabused, or worse, murdered. Our children are a gift to us, are our \nnational treasure, and are our future. We must do all that we can to \nprotect these innocents and give law enforcement every tool possible to \nferret out the criminals who would do our children harm. With this \nlegislation, we will be ensuring a greater measure of protection for \nour children.\n  This bill helps the public know about sexual predators in their \ncommunities, improves the Nation's ability to respond to child \nabduction reports, and aids criminal investigators and prosecutors in \ntheir efforts to protect the public by identifying and locking-up child \npredators.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to vote for this important bill.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 151, the \nProsecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children \nToday Act, or the PROTECT Act, a critical piece of legislation which is \ndesperately needed to fight the war on child pornography.\n  And make no mistake, the fight against child pornography is indeed a \nwar. It's a worldwide war being fought out largely on the worldwide \nweb. Child pornographers are organized and spread across the globe, but \nthe globe is a lot smaller now that the Internet reaches from Antwerp, \nBelgium, to Antwerp, New York, and everywhere in between.\n  As I speak, prosecutors across our country are fighting an \nexponential growth in child pornography, from here and abroad, and they \nare struggling to keep up with the wily tactics of the child \npornographers.\n  To fight this critical fight, our prosecutors need new, more, and \nbetter weapons. Just as our local police in so many communities are \ntaking to the streets outgunned by drug dealers, our cybercops are \nworking at a technological disadvantage as they go after cybersmut \npurveyors.\n  The enemy does not sit still and neither should we. The PROTECT Act \ngives prosecutors more of the weapons they need.\n\n[[Page S2586]]\n\n  We cannot and we will not permit child pornographers to hide behind \nthe courts or modern technology. We cannot and we will not permit them \nto continue to abuse children, real, live children, children from all \nraces, backgrounds and creeds.\n  We must send child pornographers the message that Congress will not \ntolerate child abuse or child pornography, today, tomorrow, or ever, no \nmatter what the state of technology is. Technology is intended to help \nchildren, not hurt them. This bill helps us take a big step in that \ndirection.\n  The PROTECT Act goes a long way toward strengthening federal law \nagainst child pornography.\n  For starters, it creates two new crimes which target distributors of \nchild pornography and people who entice new children to engage in it.\n  The bill provides tough punishment with both of these crimes carrying \na maximum penalty of 15 years in prison for a first offense and double \nthat for repeat offenders. Only through serious measures like these can \nwe show that we are serious about fighting this war on child \npornography.\n  Like our anti-terrorism laws which deal with the threat from \noverseas, the PROTECT Act deals with the threat to our children from \nthose who make child pornography overseas then bring it into the United \nStates. This new law will say that if you force a child to participate \nin pornography and intend to send that pornography to the United \nStates, you are committing a crime and answerable to our system of \njustice. In short, you are going to jail, and you're not looking at a \nshort stint in any country club prison. You are doing serious time.\n\n  The PROTECT Act specifically increases penalties for people who \ncommit repeat acts of sex offenses by expanding the types of crimes \nwhich can trigger mandatory minimum sentences. In this bill, we back up \nour tough talk on penalties by requiring the U.S. Sentencing Commission \nto fix a disparity in the current sentencing scheme.\n  Believe it or not, under current law, under some circumstances you \ncan get less jail time for having sex with a child than you'd get for \npossessing child pornography. The PROTECT Act fixes this absurd \ndisparity.\n  The PROTECT Act also provides protection for the true victims of \nchild pornography, the children who are used and abused to make it.\n  A recent New York Times article highlighted the horrific truth about \nwho these children are. In the article, in the Sunday New York Times \nfrom February 9, 2003, the author wrote that ``most children depicted \nin child pornography are prepubescent, with most of them appearing to \nbe from 6 to 11 years old'' and ``many of the victims appear to be \ntoddlers or infants.'' These are real children, our children, children \nwho need to be protected from this despicable evil.\n  And as its name implies, the PROTECT Act protects these children. \nThis legislation provides, for the first time, a ``child victim shield \nprovision'' to protect the names of victims. Under this provision, the \nGovernment can file a motion in a child pornography case to keep the \nname, address, social security number and other nonphysical identifying \ninformation of the real child victim from being revealed.\n  This is critical to successful child pornography prosecutions. To get \nchild victims to cooperate, we must protect their identities. To reveal \nthe name of a child pornography victim without good cause and through a \njudge, would be to victimize that child twice. We cannot permit that to \nhappen.\n  This bill also protects victims by creating, again for the first \ntime, a new private right of action for victims of child pornography \nagainst those who produce it. We are hearing a lot about tort reform \nhere these days, but I hope my colleagues will agree that victims of \nchild pornography should have the right to collect punitive damages \nfrom their abusers. If anyone deserves punitive damages, they do.\n  But the bill does not stop there. It also addresses a subject that \nhas been of some controversy in light of the Supreme Court decision \nlast year, but which we need to address. That subject is the use of \nmodern technology by child pornographers to attempt to hide the fact \nthat their images are made using real children.\n  In the old days, child pornographers would ply their filthy craft by \ntaking photographs and distributing them. With the advent of \ntelevision, child pornographers began to take video images, images \nwhich displayed real, live children engaged in sick, perverted sexual \nor obscene acts.\n\n  With the development of the video recorder, child pornographers were \nable to store these images and distribute them more widely. With the \ndevelopment of the CD and DVD, the images could be stored on a disk \nwhich could literally fit in the palm of your hand.\n  The greatest growth in the creation and distribution of child \npornography, however, has come in recent years with the development of \nthe Internet and the digital image. These developments have permitted \nchild pornographers to disseminate their product exponentially, not \nonly across America, but around the world, with a few simple strokes of \na keyboard.\n  As the New York Times observed, ``the combination of digital \nphotograph and high-speed home Internet across has set off what \nauthorities say is an explosion of homemade child pornography in recent \nyears, with growing numbers of victims.'' We need to stop the number of \nvictims by shrinking the number of child pornographers.\n  In fact, today, it has become apparent through evidence submitted to \nCongress by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \nother groups that child pornographers use technology to disguise \ndepictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and appear to \nbe computer generated.\n  Some efforts are being undertaken to deal with so-called ``virtual \nporn'' which distorts the images of real children, but those efforts \ndon't go far enough.\n  We need to do more to bring the law up to speed with the technology \nof child pornography. The PROTECT Act attempts to do so.\n  One of our Nation's biggest law enforcement problems is the failure \nof Federal authorities to work closely with their state counterparts. \nThis is especially true when it comes to child pornography. There are \ncountless cases where Federal officials have stepped on state officers' \ntoes while conducting parallel investigations and never talking with \neach other. This bill requires a greater degree of Federal local \ncoordination than has ever happened before in these kinds of cases.\n  In sum, the time has come to send a message to child pornographers. \nWe are telling them that no matter how advanced their computers and \ncameras are, child porn makers and puveryors cannot run and hide from \nAmerican law enforcement.\n  This is a 21st century problem in need of a 21st century solution. \nThe PROTECT Act does not solve all of our problems in this area, but \nit's a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are near 5:30. Even though I have more \ntime remaining, in a couple of minutes I am going to yield back that \ntime. I understand from both the Republican side and the Democratic \nside that Members prefer to vote at 5:30.\n  Let me first ask for the yeas and nays on the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, as I said earlier in my speech, I would much prefer \nthat we pass exactly the bill Senator Hatch and I wrote last year and \nwhich passed the Senate unanimously. It was then for some reason that \nleadership in the other body decided not to bring it up. Now we have \nwritten one that is very much like the original Hatch-Leahy bill with \nsome modification. I am worried about some of the modifications because \nof the constitutional problem that may arise, but I am willing to \nsupport this bill and will vote for this bill.\n\n  I would hope the other body would take this bill as it is and not add \nfurther to it. I think what happened last year was the case where we \npassed a good piece of legislation. Republicans and Democrats came \ntogether across the political spectrum and passed a good bill on child \npornography. And some, I guess, were more concerned about making \nspeeches and all than to actually pass a piece of legislation that \nwould protect children.\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\n  I have looked at this with the eyes of a former prosecutor. I want to \nbe able to go after child pornographers. There is nobody in this body--\nRepublican or Democrat--who is on the side of child pornographers. This \nis not a free speech question; this a child abuse question. Nobody \nsupports those who abuse children for this purpose.\n  So let us understand that and know we can pass this piece of \nlegislation. Let's hope nobody tries to change it to make a political \nfootball of it. Let it go forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Blanche Lincoln \nof Arkansas be added as a cosponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill for the third \ntime.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Prosecutorial Remedies and \n     Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of \n     2003'' or ``PROTECT Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Obscenity and child pornography are not entitled to \n     protection under the First Amendment under Miller v. \n     California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (obscenity), or New York v. \n     Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (child pornography) and thus may \n     be prohibited.\n       (2) The Government has a compelling state interest in \n     protecting children from those who sexually exploit them, \n     including both child molesters and child pornographers. ``The \n     prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children \n     constitutes a government objective of surpassing \n     importance,'' New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982) \n     (emphasis added), and this interest extends to stamping out \n     the vice of child pornography at all levels in the \n     distribution chain. Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S. 103, 110 \n     (1990).\n       (3) The Government thus has a compelling interest in \n     ensuring that the criminal prohibitions against child \n     pornography remain enforceable and effective. ``[T]he most \n     expeditious if not the only practical method of law \n     enforcement may be to dry up the market for this material by \n     imposing severe criminal penalties on persons selling, \n     advertising, or otherwise promoting the product.'' Ferber, \n     458 U.S. at 760.\n       (4) In 1982, when the Supreme Court decided Ferber, the \n     technology did not exist to: (A) computer generate depictions \n     of children that are indistinguishable from depictions of \n     real children; (B) use parts of images of real children to \n     create a composite image that is unidentifiable as a \n     particular child and in a way that prevents even an expert \n     from concluding that parts of images of real children were \n     used; or (C) disguise pictures of real children being abused \n     by making the image look computer generated.\n       (5) Evidence submitted to the Congress, including from the \n     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, \n     demonstrates that technology already exists to disguise \n     depictions of real children to make them unidentifiable and \n     to make depictions of real children appear computer \n     generated. The technology will soon exist, if it does not \n     already, to computer generate realistic images of children.\n       (6) The vast majority of child pornography prosecutions \n     today involve images contained on computer hard drives, \n     computer disks, or related media.\n       (7) There is no substantial evidence that any of the child \n     pornography images being trafficked today were made other \n     than by the abuse of real children. Nevertheless, \n     technological advances since Ferber have led many criminal \n     defendants to suggest that the images of child pornography \n     they possess are not those of real children, insisting that \n     the government prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the \n     images are not computer-generated. Such challenges increased \n     significantly after the Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition \n     decision.\n       (8) Child pornography circulating on the Internet has, by \n     definition, been digitally uploaded or scanned into computers \n     and has been transferred over the Internet, often in \n     different file formats, from trafficker to trafficker. An \n     image seized from a collector of child pornography is rarely \n     a first-generation product, and the retransmission of images \n     can alter the image so as to make it difficult for even an \n     expert conclusively to opine that a particular image depicts \n     a real child. If the original image has been scanned from a \n     paper version into a digital format, this task can be even \n     harder since proper forensic assessment may depend on the \n     quality of the image scanned and the tools used to scan it.\n       (9) The impact on the government's ability to prosecute \n     child pornography offenders is already evident. The Ninth \n     Circuit has seen a significant adverse effect on prosecutions \n     since the 1999 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in \n     Free Speech Coalition. After that decision, prosecutions \n     generally have been brought in the Ninth Circuit only in the \n     most clear-cut cases in which the government can specifically \n     identify the child in the depiction or otherwise identify the \n     origin of the image. This is a fraction of meritorious child \n     pornography cases. The National Center for Missing and \n     Exploited Children testified that, in light of the Supreme \n     Court's affirmation of the Ninth Circuit decision, \n     prosecutors in various parts of the country have expressed \n     concern about the continued viability of previously indicted \n     cases as well as declined potentially meritorious \n     prosecutions.\n       (10) Since the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech \n     Coalition, defendants in child pornography cases have almost \n     universally raised the contention that the images in question \n     could be virtual, thereby requiring the government, in nearly \n     every child pornography prosecution, to find proof that the \n     child is real. Some of these defense efforts have already \n     been successful.\n       (11) In the absence of congressional action, this problem \n     will continue to grow increasingly worse. The mere prospect \n     that the technology exists to create computer or computer-\n     generated depictions that are indistinguishable from \n     depictions of real children will allow defendants who possess \n     images of real children to escape prosecution, for it \n     threatens to create a reasonable doubt in every case of \n     computer images even when a real child was abused. This \n     threatens to render child pornography laws that protect real \n     children unenforceable. Moreover, imposing an additional \n     requirement that the Government prove beyond a reasonable \n     doubt that the defendant knew that the image was in fact a \n     real child--as some courts have done--threatens to result in \n     the de facto legalization of the possession, receipt, and \n     distribution of child pornography\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\n     for all except the original producers of the material.\n       (12) To avoid this grave threat to the Government's \n     unquestioned compelling interest in effective enforcement of \n     the child pornography laws that protect real children, a \n     statute must be adopted that prohibits a narrowly-defined \n     subcategory of images.\n       (13) The Supreme Court's 1982 Ferber decision holding that \n     child pornography was not protected drove child pornography \n     off the shelves of adult bookstores. Congressional action is \n     necessary now to ensure that open and notorious trafficking \n     in such materials does not reappear, and even increase, on \n     the Internet.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I strongly support S. \n151, the PROTECT Act. Unfortunately, I was detained in Florida earlier \ntoday and was not able to cast my vote in favor of this important \nlegislation.\n  Current law not only provides a convenient defense for child \npornographers, but also allows a practice to continue which endangers \nthe Nation's kids regardless of whether actual children are used in the \nproduction of the pornographic materials in question.\n  Because of the Supreme Court's decision in Free Speech Coalition, \ndefendants in child pornography cases are now arguing that the \npornographic images at issue are computer generated and are therefore \nlegal and harmless. This defense requires the government, in nearly \nevery child pornography prosecution, to prove that the child portrayed \nin the image is in fact a minor. Unfortunately, those who would prey on \nour children have already successfully used this defense.\n  Even when pornographic materials are not generated using actual \nchildren, simply implying that the image is of child contributes to \nbehaviors, which endanger the Nation's kids by encouraging exploitive \npractices.\n  The exploitation of children through child pornography is one of the \nmost despicable crimes in our society. The government clearly has a \ncompelling interest in curbing child pornography, whether virtual or \nreal, and I believe this legislation was drafted narrowly enough to \nwithstand constitutional scrutiny.\n  I hope the House will join the Senate in quickly passing this \nlegislation, so that it can be sent to the President as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. In the last Congress, Senator Kennedy and I \nintroduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence \nof any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 4, 2002 \nin Alexandria, VA. A man threw a brick through the window of an Afghan \nman's car. The incident began when 28 year-old Michael Woolls \napproached the victim on the street and demanded to know his national \norigin. When the man said he was from Afghanistan, Woolls hit his car \nwith a stick and threw a brick through the window, striking a \npassenger.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Black History \nMonth. On February 1, 1960, four brave freshmen from North Carolina A \nconducted the first major sit-i9n protest of the civil rights movement. \nThe ``Greensboro Four,'' as they came to be known, acted on the \nAmerican principle that all people are created equal. Although the \nUnited States was founded on that premise, it is too often denied.\n  We know that when one person breaks a barrier to equality, the \npotential opportunities for all Americans are redefined. That is why \nevery February, we teach our students about pioneers like Ralph J. \nBunche, the first African American to win a Nobel Peace Prize, and \nJackie Robinson, the first African American in the major leagues. We \nmust also remember, however, that individual success does not assure \nuniversal progress.\n  My State is proud that the University of Washington accepted its \nfirst Black student in 1874. This was an important step towards equal \naccess to education. At the time, the Puget Sound Dispatch declared, \n``Every child of African descent born in this country has the same \nright of access to our public schools as the children of the most \nprivileged of Caucasian blood. No teacher or school officer has any \nmore legal right to exclude one than the other.'' However, it took 70 \nmore years for the Supreme Court to endorse this standard. Now we face \nracial inequities in education and the resegregation of our schools. In \nfact, this year a study found that public schools have been undergoing \na ``process of continuous resegregation'' since the early 1990s. We \nmust ensure that our legal ideal of equality is a reality for every \nAmerican.\n  Hiram Revels, the son of former slaves, became the first African-\nAmerican Senator in 1870. He overcame many obstacles and forever \nchanged this institution. Because of leaders such as Senator Revels, \nthis is the most diverse Senate in the history of the United States. \nAnd yet at the same time, there is not a single African-American \nSenator serving in this body.\n  The American people want leaders who represent their values, ideas, \nand life experiences. For this reason, I am optimistic that as our \ncountry moves forward, we will continue to select leaders who value \ndiversity and the representation of all people. It is the right way to \nprotect our founding principle of equality, and the best way to ensure \nour prosperity. As Dr. Martin Luther King explained in his letter from \nBirmingham jail, we are bound by a ``single garment of destiny where \nwhatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.'' Our world is \neven more intertwined today. Like the great Americans before us, from \nThomas Jefferson to the ``Greensboro Four,'' this month we reaffirm our \ncommitment to the fundamental premise that all people are created \nequal, and must be treated equally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/24/senate-section/article/S2592-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2592-S2593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    TRIBUTE TO WINTON ``RED'' BLOUNT\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend, a beloved family man, a successful business man, and a \ntreasure to the State of Alabama. Winton `Red' Blount, a native of \nUnion Springs, AL passed on October 24, 2002. He was one of those \npeople who everyone should emulate, because he took advantage of \neverything life had to offer--having a loving family, running a \nsuccessful business, standing up for justice during the Civil Rights \nmovement, enjoying the arts,\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\nand pursuing civil service. It is my hope, that in this tribute, I can \ndraw a bit of a picture to describe the kind of life that Red Blount \nlived.\n  During the 1960s civil rights movements, the State of Alabama was \nhome to some tumultuous times. When Governor George Wallace blocked \nintegration into the University of Alabama, Red Blount calmly and \nconstructively worked with U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy and \nGovernor Wallace to keep the peace and allow African-American students \ninto the University. Blount, at that time, served as a member of the \nUniversity's Board of Trustees, and, more importantly, served as a \nvoice of reason during a time when reasonable voices were few and far \nbetween.\n  As a businessman, Blount was straight-forward, hard working, and \nhonest in his practices. He founded Blount Brothers and quickly \ndeveloped a reputation for delivering products on time and without \nunexpected costs. Blount's company can be credited with building the \nlaunch pad at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, FL, which \nsent the first space flight to the moon. Blount Brothers also built the \nNation's first ballistic missile site, the New Orleans Superdome, and \ninternational projects including King Saud University, near Riyadh, \nSaudi Arabia.\n  Since I can remember, Red was a dedicated civil servant and a devoted \nmember of the Republican Party. Known as Mr. Republican, he wanted to \nmake a difference in Alabama and across the Nation. In 1960, Red headed \nup then-Vice President Richard Nixon's unsuccessful bid for the \npresidency as his southeastern campaign chairman. In 1968, Red became \npresident of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and then he went on to serve \nas President Richard Nixon's Postmaster General. In this capacity, he \nadvocated for and implemented massive reform, making the postal service \nless political and more efficient. Red even threw his hat into the ring \nfor a bid to the U.S. Senate in 1972. Unfortunately, he lost, but there \nis no question that he would've made a great Senator.\n  Among Red Blount's many business and political achievements, having a \nfamily was his most important accomplishment. His five children are \ngrown and successful in their own right, and there is no question that \nBlount instilled a strong work ethic into them and fostered their \nability to succeed in whatever they chose to do. Blount's family \nexpanded when he married his second wife, Carolyn Self Varner Blount, \nand he became step father to her two children. They enjoyed gathering \nat the holidays with all the children and grandchildren in the extended \nBlount family.\n  One of the things that Alabamians will remember most about Red Blount \nwas his love of the arts. In 1982, Red discovered that the Alabama \nShakespeare Festival, of which his wife, Carolyn served on the board, \nwas very much in debt. He was able to assist them with their financial \ndifficulties by building a theater on the 250-acre grounds behind his \nhome. This became Montgomery's Blount Cultural Park, and the theater \nwas named for his wife.\n  The theater grew with the support of State grants, but mostly because \nof the investment that Red and Carolyn made in it. They made nearly $15 \nmillion in donations of art work, which encouraged the Montgomery \nMuseum of Fine Arts, which was looking to change locations, to move to \nthe park grounds. The park continued to grow with gardens and an \namphitheater, and Blount expanded the land by buying more acres. He \nmade contributions totaling $21.5 million to the Alabama Shakespeare \nFestival, which remains the single-largest gift ever given to a \nregional theater in the country.\n  Blount's philanthropic heart turned Montgomery into a leading \ncultural center. Had Red and Carolyn not made the financial and \ncreative investment, the theater, museum, and park would not be what it \nis today. They helped to create a priceless treasure for the area, \nencouraging the young and old to experience the arts.\n  There aren't too many people in the world who loved life as much as \nRed did. He was the kind of person we all want to be, and the State of \nAlabama is a better place for having Red Blount as part of our history. \nWe are all grateful to Red and his family for giving so much of \nthemselves, and allowing Red to leave us with a wonderful legacy we \nwill never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/24/senate-section/article/S2593-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER JUDI JO ROGERS\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true military heroine who has honorably served our \ncountry for 22 years in the Navy Nurse Corps: CDR Judi J. Rogers. \nCommander Rogers began her career as a staff nurse at Naval Medical \nCenter, San Diego, CA. She quickly rose through the ranks and served at \nNaval bases throughout the world, including Naval Hospital Okinawa, \nJapan, Naval Hospital Long Beach, CA, National Naval Medical Center \nBethesda, MD, and Naval Medical Center Portsmouth, VA. Following in her \nfather's footsteps, the late LCDR Kenneth Rogers, USN, Retired, \nCommander Rogers served aboard combatant ships independently providing \nanesthesia services as a certified registered nurse anesthetist, CRNA, \nto the sailors and marines aboard the U.S.S Theodore Roosevelt, CVN-71, \nand the U.S.S WASP, LHD-1, during all underway periods including two 6-\nmonth Mediterranean deployments. She was then assigned as the first \nwoman to serve as the Assistant Group Surgeon for Combatant Amphibious \nAssault Group Two. In each assignment, Commander Rogers excelled and \nmet every challenge, and was rewarded with greater responsibilities and \nopportunities.\n  Her talent for teaching and mentoring personnel, as well as her \ncreativity and skill in management, were instrumental in providing \nMilitary Medicine the cadre of CRNAs serving today. As an advanced \ncardiac life support, ACLS, instructor, Commander Rogers continually \nsupported mission readiness by providing ACLS courses to hundreds of \nactive duty and reserve troops, and trauma skills and training vital \nfor battlefield survival of our troops. Above all, she is a stellar \nleader and a compassionate nurse who always put the welfare of her \nstaff and patients first.\n  Commander Rogers is a committed health care professional who has \npositively influenced the practice of nursing nationally. She is an \nactive member of the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists, AANA. \nA faculty member for AANA's Education and Research Foundation since \n1988, Commander Rogers personally provided 18 Special Epidural \nWorkshops to 450 CRNAs across the country. She also authored a chapter \nof AANA's official text, The Clinical Techniques of Regional \nAnesthesia, titled ``Acute Pain Management.'' Commander Rogers always \nwent the extra mile to serve her country and her fellow man.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay \ntribute to one of Kentucky's finest educators. Pat Keller, a music \nteacher at Potter Gray Elementary School, was recently named Kentucky \nElementary Music Teacher of the Year by the Kentucky Music Educators \nAssociation.\n  Pat Keller has done more than teach her south central Kentucky \nstudents the concepts of music. Through Pat's 15 years as an educator, \nher efforts have instilled a sense of self-confidence that her students \nhave benefitted from well beyond the classroom. Pat's students have \ngained the same respect and love for music that their teacher has and \nhave also been given the self-assurance to contribute to the field of \nmusic.\n  I am glad that Pat Keller chose to be a teacher in the Commonwealth \nof Kentucky and it is a source of great pride to call attention to her \nexcellence. Her contributions have made all the difference in the lives \nof her students.\n  The citizens from the Potter Gray Elementary School community are \nfortunate to call Pat Keller one of their own. They should be \nprivileged to be served by such a fine educator. Her example should be \nfollowed by teachers across Kentucky.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/24/senate-section/article/S2594-1", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2594]]\n                        REMEMBERING RUSS ROURKE\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I note with deep regret the recent \npassing of a dedicated public official, defense leader, and a fellow \nMarine, Russell A. Rourke.\n  From his humble beginnings in the Bronx, Russ Rourke put himself \nthrough the University of Maryland and Georgetown Law School. Through \nhard work and perseverance, he went on to great success here on Capitol \nHill, at the White House, the Pentagon, and later in the private \nsector.\n  He served as a top legislative aide in the Congress for 20 years, was \na Special Assistant to President Ford, Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor Legislative Affairs, and Secretary of the Air Force under President \nRonald Reagan.\n  Despite these many high honors, Russ made it clear that the highest \nhonor he ever hoped to attain was when he earned the right to wear the \neagle, globe and anchor. Throughout his life, nothing else transcended \nthe honor and title of United States Marine. He revered the Marine \nCorps, its way of life, its traditions and values.\n  Russ was on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1953 to 1956, \nincluding service in Korea. He remained in an active capacity with the \nMarine Corps Reserve, and retired after 32 years of service with the \nrank of colonel in July 1985.\n  Throughout his career, Russ was recognized as a proponent for a \nstrong national defense. When he served in the Reagan administration as \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs, he was once \ndescribed by the New York Times as Defense Secretary Cap Weinberger's \n``chief scout and musket loader in defending the military budget \nagainst a siege of skeptics in Congress.''\n  As in my life, Russ Rourke's life experience were embodied in the \nMarine Corps culture and ethos. In all that he did, he conducted \nhimself at all times as foremost a Marine, with honesty and conviction, \nwith a high sense of duty and great pride. His devotion to family, \ncountry, and Corps was legendary and an inspiration. His distinguished \ncareer demonstrated the highest standards of integrity, \nprofessionalism, and devotion to public service.\n  Russ died at the age of 71 on January 19 after a lengthy battle with \nmalignant melanoma. He leaves his lovely wife and partner of 41 years, \nJudith Muller Rourke, of Annapolis, MD, their three married daughters, \nand four grandchildren. Russ also leaves a Marine Corps legacy. His \nnephew, Col. Arthur White, is the current State liaison for the Marine \nCorps.\n  I am extremely proud of my fellow Marine, the Honorable Russell A. \nRourke. He will be greatly missed by his family and friends, many in \nthe House and the Senate, and the men and women in the uniformed \nservices. Our Nation's military might is stronger today because of his \nsterling leadership and his numerous contributions in service to his \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/02/24/senate-section/article/S2594-2", "month": "02", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of January 7, 2003, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on February 18, 2003, during the recess of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker has signed the following enrolled bill.\n\n       H.J.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to assist \nStates and communities in preparing for and responding to threats to \nthe agriculture of the United States; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 430. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to enhance \nagricultural biosecurity in the United States through increased \nprevention, preparation, and response planning; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to address the threat of \nbioterrorist attacks on American agriculture by introducing the \nAgriculture Security Preparedness Act, ASPA, and the Agriculture \nSecurity Assistance Act, ASAA.\n  Thomas Jefferson described the four pillars of American prosperity as \nagriculture, manufacturing, commerce and navigation. Two hundred years \nlater, our government is working to protect and defend all critical \nsectors of our society. But are we doing enough to protect American \nagriculture from either deliberate or naturally occurring disease \noutbreaks?\n  Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson stated in \nSeptember 2002 that the administration has not paid enough attention to \nprotecting agriculture while Secretary of Agriculture Ann Venneman \nstated that agricultural biosecurity is her highest priority.\n  What is at risk when I speak of ``agricultural security?'' Quite \nsimply, a threat to agriculture is a threat to the Nation. My \nlegislation will assist efforts by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, \nUSDA, new Department of Homeland Security, DHS, to ensure the first \npillar of American prosperity.\n  Agriculture terrorism can impact the safety of our food supply and \npublic health. A large scale agricultural disaster, much like risks to \nour information and communication systems, also would undermine \nAmerican economic security. Agricultural activity accounts for \napproximately 13 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product and nearly \n17 percent of domestic employment. Based on the economic damage caused \nby the 2001 foot and mouth disease, FMD, epidemic in Great Britain, a \nsingle outbreak of FMD could cost the U.S. economy over $10 billion.\n  Every State has its own agricultural strengths and economy. My State \nof Hawaii generates more than $1.9 billion in agricultural sales. The \nagriculture sector employs, either directly or indirectly, 38,000 \npeople in Hawaii. The State's crops range from sugarcane and pineapple \nto coffee and macadamia nuts. However, Hawaii also has to $28 million \nmilk industry and nearly $25 million worth of cattle and hogs. When the \nadditional losses in tourism and travel are considered, we can see the \neconomic impact on Hawaii or any State from an agricultural disease \nemergency would be devastating.\n  Pests and diseases are difficult to control when they are introduced \naccidentally. According to a National Academy of Sciences study on \nagricultural security, a deliberate infestation demands even more \nprecautions and research and development.\n  The Agriculture Security Preparedness Act and the Agriculture \nSecurity Assistance Act give Federal and State partners responsible for \nresponding to threats against our agriculture the tools they need to \noperate efficiently and effectively. Moreover, my legislation amends \nthe Homeland Security Act to give agriculture security the attention it \ndeserves as a component of our critical infrastructure.\n  An agricultural disease outbreak, whether of natural or deliberate \norigin, will require coordinated efforts by the USDA, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, FEMA, and DHS, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, and the Departments of Health and Human \nServices, HHS, Defense, Transportation, and Justice. USDA is the lead \nagency in responding to agricultural emergencies and has created a \nhomeland defense council and increased border inspection and research \nactivities. These are promising steps. I am happy to see that the USDA \nand FEMA are in the process of drafting a national response plan for \nemerging agriculture diseases. My legislation will compliment these \nefforts and encourage coordination and preparedness on the Federal, \nState, regional, and local level.\n\n  The Agriculture Security Preparedness Act will enhance agricultural \nbiosecurity through strengthened interagency and international \ncoordination. The Act will establish senior level liaisons in DHS and \nHHS to coordinate with USDA on agriculture disease emergency management \nand response. My legislation also tasks DHS and USDA to work with the \nDepartment of Transportation to address one of the largest risk factors \nin controlling the spread of a plant or animal disease--the movement of \nanimals, plants, and people between and around farms.\n  Agricultural disease outbreaks will continue to be rare occurrences \nin the United States. However, high-risk animal and plant diseases are \nendemic in some part of the world. The Agriculture Security \nPreparedness Act will help train American veterinarians and emergency \nresponders, and provide much needed help overseas, through bilateral \nmutual aid agreements. The\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\nAct also directs the Department of Justice and USDA to take a long-\noverdue look at local and State laws that may impede or contradict \nresponse plans for an agricultural disease emergency.\n  The Agricultural Security Assistance Act will assist States and \ncommunities preparing for and responding to threats to the Nation's \nagriculture. Rapid detection and swift response is imperative to \ncontain the spread of any disease, and my bill will help remove delays \nand impediments for local and state officials responding to outbreaks.\n  The bill directs USDA to work with each State to develop and \nimplement response plans. My legislation establishes grant programs for \ncommunities and states to incorporate modeling and geographic \ninformation systems into planning and response activities totaling over \n$15 million. This funding also will help animal health professionals \nparticipate in community emergency planning activities and assist \nfarmers and ranchers strengthen the biosecurity measures on their own \nproperty.\n  In most cases of a suspected or actual agricultural disease outbreak, \ninitial response will come from the impacted community and State. \nFederal resources, coordinated by USDA, will augment State \ncapabilities. Federal assistance and guidance also is needed long \nbefore an outbreak occurs. My legislation will increase Federal, State, \nand local abilities to develop resources and response mechanisms to \ncontain and eradicate agricultural diseases when they are discovered on \nU.S. soil.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 427\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Agriculture Security \n     Assistance Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) some agricultural diseases pose a direct threat to \n     human health;\n       (2) economic sabotage, in the form of agroterrorism, is \n     also a concern;\n       (3) the United States has an $80,000,000,000 livestock \n     industry;\n       (4) an outbreak of an agricultural disease, whether \n     naturally occurring or intentionally introduced, could--\n       (A) have a profound impact on the infrastructure, economy, \n     and export markets of the United States; and\n       (B) erode consumer confidence in the Federal Government and \n     the safety of the food supply of the United States;\n       (5) as with human health and bioterrorism preparedness, \n     enhancing current monitoring and response mechanisms to deal \n     with a deliberate act of agricultural terrorism would \n     strengthen the ability of the United States to diagnose and \n     respond quickly to any animal health crisis;\n       (6)(A) activities to ensure the biosecurity of farms are an \n     important tool in preventing--\n       (i) the intentional or accidental introduction of an \n     agricultural disease; and\n       (ii) the spread of an introduced agricultural disease into \n     an outbreak; and\n       (B) most surveys of producers indicate discouraging and \n     dangerous trends in basic elements of farm security \n     activities;\n       (7)(A) a national response plan, developed by the \n     Department of Agriculture and the Federal Emergency \n     Management Agency, would determine how interdependent \n     agricultural health and emergency management response \n     functions will be coordinated to ensure an orderly, \n     immediate, and unified response to all aspects of an outbreak \n     of an agricultural disease;\n       (B) the Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with \n     State and industry partners, would implement the plan as \n     needed; and\n       (C) State and local partners would need assistance to \n     implement their shares of the plan;\n       (8) States and communities also require assistance to \n     prepare and plan for agricultural disasters;\n       (9)(A) rapid detection of an agricultural disease is \n     imperative in containing the spread of the agricultural \n     disease; and\n       (B) potential delays and difficulty in detection may \n     complicate decisions regarding appropriate control measures; \n     and\n       (10)(A) planning for a response to an outbreak of an \n     agricultural disease will vary from State to State, \n     reflecting--\n       (i) the level of awareness;\n       (ii) the perception of risk;\n       (iii) competing time demands; and\n       (iv) the availability of resources; and\n       (B) State response capability would be significantly \n     enhanced if State agricultural and emergency management \n     officials were to jointly develop a comprehensive \n     agricultural disease response plan.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the intentional use of agricultural disease agents to \n     attack United States agriculture threatens an industry that \n     accounts for approximately 13 percent of the gross domestic \n     product of the United States;\n       (2) the economic impact of a worst-case agricultural \n     disease affecting multiple farms in multiple States could be \n     measured in billions of dollars, including the costs of \n     eradication, production losses, and other market \n     repercussions;\n       (3) agricultural diseases can be naturally occurring (such \n     as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Great Britain \n     during 2001) or intentionally created by malicious actors;\n       (4) risk factors affecting the spread of a plant or animal \n     disease include--\n       (A) animal density;\n       (B) animal and plant concentration points (such as auction \n     markets, sale barns, and grain lots);\n       (C) plant and animal movement;\n       (D) individuals moving on and off farms;\n       (E) wildlife; and\n       (F) weather conditions;\n       (5) the rapid and widespread movement of animals and crops \n     is an integral part of United States agriculture and the \n     principle means by which an agricultural disease will spread \n     if an agricultural disease occurs;\n       (6) response planning and mitigation requires the \n     coordination between the animal health and agricultural \n     community, transportation officials, and representatives of \n     the shipping and trucking industry;\n       (7) the United States Department of Agriculture and State \n     departments of agriculture have responsibility for the \n     protection of the agricultural resources of the United \n     States;\n       (8) in the event of an agricultural disease, the Department \n     of Agriculture and State departments of agriculture will need \n     the support and resources of other Federal, State, and local \n     agencies that carry out traditional emergency management and \n     response functions;\n       (9) while the introduction of an infectious foreign animal \n     disease (such as foot-and-mouth disease) will be the primary \n     threat addressed by an agricultural security plan, the \n     principles used to prevent, detect, control, or eradicate \n     such a disease will apply to large-scale outbreaks of other \n     diseases and other agricultural diseases that affect \n     agriculture;\n       (10) numerous Federal agencies have authorities and \n     responsibilities relating to public, animal, and wildlife \n     health, safety, and management;\n       (11) the highest priority of the United States, in \n     connection with agricultural diseases, is to prevent the \n     introduction of, detect, control, and eradicate an \n     agricultural disease as quickly as practicable and return the \n     United States to a disease-free status;\n       (12)(A) the Incident Command System was adopted by the \n     National Fire Academy as the model system of the Academy in \n     1987 and was later endorsed by the International Association \n     of Chiefs of Police and the American Public Works \n     Association;\n       (B) the Incident Command System is used by many Federal \n     agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the \n     United States Fire Administration, while responding to \n     emergencies; and\n       (C) the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Animal \n     and Plant Health Inspection Service, should incorporate the \n     Incident Command System in all agricultural disaster \n     emergency response plans; and\n       (13) since agricultural diseases will continue to be rare \n     occurrences in the United States, the Department of \n     Agriculture and Federal, State, and local partners will need \n     to reinforce preparedness, training, and response \n     mechanisms--\n       (A) through an all-hazard approach to all agricultural \n     disaster emergencies; and\n       (B) by gaining field experience in foreign countries where \n     high-risk agricultural diseases are endemic.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the distribution of judgment funds to \nthe Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill I had \nintroduced during the 107th Congress, which will provide for the use \nand distribution of judgment funds awarded to the Assiniboine and Sioux \nTribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in northeast Montana.\n  In 1987, the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck \nReservation brought suit against the United States to recover interest \nearned on their trust funds while those funds were in Special Deposit \nand IMPL-Agency accounts. The case was filed in the U.S. Claims court, \nand docketed as No. 773-87-L.\n  After the court ruled that the United States was liable to the Fort \nPeck Tribes and individual Indians for interest on those funds, the \ntribes and the United States reached an agreement for settling the \nclaims in the case, for the sum of $4,522,551.84. The court approved \nthe settlement agreement.\n  The settlement agreement further provided that the judgment be \ndivided between the Fort Peck Tribes and those individual Indians who \nare found to be eligible to share in the judgment. On January 31, 2001, \nthe court approved a stipulation between the parties that defined the \nprocedures by which the Fort Peck Tribes' and individual Indians' \nrespective shares in the judgment would be determined and distributed \nto them.\n  Pursuant to the court-approved stipulation in the case, on February \n14, 2001, a portion of the tribe's share of the judgment was deposited \ninto an account in Treasury for the use of the Fort Peck Tribes. As \nprovided by the court-approved stipulation, those funds are to be \navailable for immediate use by the tribe pursuant to a plan adopted \nunder the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act, 25 \nU.S.C. 1401 et seq. The court-approved stipulation further recognized \nthat the tribe will most likely receive additional payments from this \nsettlement once the work identifying all individuals eligible to share \nin the judgment is complete and the pro rata shares are finally \ncomputed. Those funds, too, are to be available for use by the tribe in \naccord with a plan adopted under the Tribal Judgment Funds Use or \nDistribution Act.\n  As required by the stipulation and the Tribal Judgment Funds Use or \nDistribution Act, the tribe developed a plan for the use of the tribe's \nshare of the settlement. Under the plan, the Tribe's share of the \njudgment will be used for tribal health, education, housing, and social \nservices programs.\n  The tribe submitted its plan to the Department of the Interior for \nreview and approval. Public hearings were held during which the views \nand recommendations of tribal members were heard regarding the plan. \nThe tribe has been advised that the Department of Interior has no \nobjection to the tribe's plan and can approve it. However, although the \nplan was developed and public hearing held during 2001, the Interior \nDepartment did not complete its review of the plan, nor submit the \napproved plan to Congress within the 1-year deadline imposed by the \nTribal Judgment Fund Use or Distribution Act. As a result, in order for \nthe Fort Peck Tribe to make use of the judgment awarded to the tribe, \nit is necessary for Congress to formally adopt legislation approving \nthe tribe's plan. The proposed bill language, would serve this purpose.\n  This judgment is based on money that rightfully belongs to the Fort \nPeck tribes and should be moved expeditiously through Congress. I look \nforward to working with the Committee on Indian Affairs to move this \nlegislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 429. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to regulate \ncertain 50 caliber sniper weapons in the same manner as machine guns \nand other firearms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and \nSenators Kennedy, Schumer, Corzine, Lautenberg, Durbin, and Levin to \nintroduce the ``Anti-Terrorism Military Sniper Weapon Reclassification \nAct of 2003.''\n  This bill, identical to legislation I have introduced in the last two \nCongresses, will reclassify powerful fifty-caliber military sniper \nrifles under the National Firearms Act, thus making it much more \ndifficult for terrorists, doomsday cults, and criminals to obtain these \nguns for illegitimate use.\n  Fifty-caliber sniper rifles, manufactured by a small handful of \ncompanies and individuals, are deadly, military style assault weapons, \ndesigned for armed combat with wartime enemies. They weight up to 28 \npounds and are capable of piercing light armor at more than 4 miles. \nThe guns enable a single shooter to destroy enemy aircraft, jeeps, \ntanks, personnel carriers, bunkers, fuel stations, and even \ncommunication centers. As a result, their use by military organizations \nworldwide has been spreading rapidly.\n  But along with the increasing military use of the gun, we have also \nseen increased use of the weapon by violent criminals and terrorists \naround the world.\n  These weapons are deadly accurate up to 2,000 yards. This means that \na shooter using a 50-caliber weapon can reliably hit a target more than \na mile away. In fact, according to a training manual for military and \npolice snipers published in 1993, a bullet from this gun ``even at one \nand a half miles crashes into a target with more energy than Dirty \nHarry's famous .44 magnum at point-blank'' range.\n  And the gun is ``effective'' up to 7,500 yards. In other words, \nalthough it may be hard to aim at this distance, the gun will have its \ndesired destructive effect at that distance--more than 4 miles from the \ntarget.\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n  The weapon can penetrate several inches of steel, concrete, or even \nlight armor. In fact, many ranges used for target practice do not even \nhave enough safety features to accommodate these guns--they are just \ntoo powerful.\n  Recent advances in weapons technology allow this gun to be used by \ncivilians against armored limousines, bunkers, individuals, and even \naircraft--in fact, one advertisement for the gun apparently promoted \nthe weapon as able to ``wreck several million dollars' worth of jet \naircraft with one or two dollars worth of cartridge.''\n  This gun is so powerful that one dealer told undercover GAO \ninvestigators ``You'd better buy one soon. It's only a matter of time \nbefore someone lets go a round on a range that travels so far, it hits \na school bus full of kids. The government will definitely ban .50-\ncalibers. This gun is just too powerful.''\n  When I first introduced this bill, I commented that a study by the \nGeneral Accounting Office revealed some eye-opening facts about how and \nwhere this gun is used, and how easily it is obtained. The GAO reports \nthat many of these guns wind up in the hands of domestic and \ninternational terrorists, religious cults, outlaw motorcycle gangs, \ndrug traffickers, and violent criminals.\n\n  According to a special agent at ATF's Atlanta Field Division, the \nBarrett .50-caliber rifle is ``a devastatingly powerful weapon against \nwhich most troops, most law enforcement and no civilians have any means \nof defense.'' He added that the rifle is ``a tremendous threat'' for \n``those most shocking and horrifying crimes, assassinations, murders, \nassaults on law enforcement officers.''\n  In 1998, Federal law enforcement apprehended three men belonging to a \nradical Michigan militia group. The three were charged with plotting to \nbomb Federal office buildings, destroy highways and utilities. They \nwere also charged with plotting to assassinate the State's Governor, a \nU.S. Senator and Federal judges. A .50-caliber sniper rifle was found \nin their possession along with a cache of weapons that included three \nillegal machine guns.\n  One doomsday cult headquartered in Montana purchased 10 of these guns \nand stockpiled them in an underground bunker, along with thousands of \nrounds of ammunition and other guns.\n  At least one .50-caliber gun was recovered by Mexican authorities \nafter a shoot-out with an international drug cartel in that country. \nThe gun was originally purchased in Wyoming, so it is clear that the \nguns are making their way into the hands of criminals worldwide.\n  Another .50-caliber sniper rifle, smuggled out of the United States, \nwas used by the Irish Republican Army to kill a large number of British \nsoldiers.\n  Even more recently we have learned that Al Qaeda has received .50-\ncaliber sniper rifles--rifles that were manufactured right here in the \nUnited States. Nearly 2 years ago today, Essam al Ridi, a U.S. agent \nfor Al Qaeda, testified that he acquired 25 Barrett .50-caliber sniper \nrifles and shipped them to Al Qaeda members in Afghanistan. We have no \nway of knowing whether Al Qaeda has obtained more or who has supplied \nthem with these weapons, but we can be sure that any .50-caliber weapon \nin the hands of Al Qaeda will almost certainly be used against \nAmericans or American interests.\n  Ammunition for these guns is also readily available, even over the \nInternet. Bullets for these guns include ``armor piercing incendiary'' \nammunition that explodes on impact, and even ``armor piercing tracing'' \nammunition reminiscent of the ammunition that lit up the skies over \nBaghdad during the Persian Gulf war.\n  Several ammunition dealers were willing to sell armor piercing \nammunition to an undercover GAO investigator even after the \ninvestigator said he wanted the ammunition to pierce an armored \nlimousine or maybe to ``take down'' a helicopter. In fact, our own \nmilitary helps to provide thousands of rounds of .50-caliber \nammunition, by essentially giving away tons of spent cartridges, many \nof which are then refurbished and sold on the civilian market.\n  This bill will begin the process of making these guns harder to get \nand easier to track.\n  Current law classifies .50-caliber guns as ``long guns,'' subject to \nthe least government regulation for any firearm. Sawed-off shotguns, \nmachine guns, and even handguns are more highly regulated than this \nmilitary sniper rifle. In fact, many States allow possession of .50-\ncaliber guns by those as young as 14 years old, and there is no \nregulation on second-hand sales.\n  Essentially, this bill would reclassify .50-caliber guns under the \nNational Firearms Act, which imposes far stricter standards on powerful \nand destruction weapons. For instance: NFA guns may only be purchased \nfrom a licensed dealer, and not second-hand. This will prevent the sale \nof these guns at gun shows and in other venues that make it hard for \nlaw enforcement to track the weapons.\n  Second, purchasers of NFA guns must fill out license transfer \napplications and provide fingerprints to be processed by the FBI in \ndetailed criminal background checks. By reclassifying the .50-caliber, \nCongress will be making a determination that sellers should be more \ncareful about to whom they give these powerful, military guns.\n  ATF reports that this background check process takes about 60 days, \nso prospective gun buyers will face some delay. However, legitimate \npurchasers of this $7,000 gun can certainly wait that long.\n  Clearly, placing a few more restrictions on who can get these guns \nand how is simply common sense. This bill will not ban the sale, use or \npossession of .50-caliber weapons. The .50-caliber shooting club will \nnot face extinction, and ``legitimate'' purchasers of these guns will \nnot lose their access--even though that, too, might be a reasonable \nstep, since I cannot imagine a legitimate use of this gun.\n  I do not view the reclassification of .50-caliber weapons so much as \nan issue of firearm safety, but rather as a matter of national \nsecurity. And I can say for a fact that I am not alone in that view.\n  Indeed the U.S. Air Force has studied the scenario of a potential \nterrorist attack with a .50-caliber weapon. According to a November \n2001 article in the Air Force's official magazine, Airman, an \nantisniper assessment claimed that planes parked on a fully protected \nU.S. airbase are as vulnerable as ``ducks on a pond'' because the \nweapons can shoot from beyond most airbase perimeters. The Air Force \nhas addressed the issue and the effectiveness of specially trained \ncountersnipers to respond to a .50-caliber weapon attack on aircraft, \nfuel tanks, control towers, and personnel.\n  While I am glad to know our military has given due consideration to \nthe threats posed by .50-caliber weapons, I have real concerns over the \nthreats posed to civilian aviation.\n  Our Nation's airports in no way match the security measures at air \nforce bases. These commercial facilities handle millions of passengers \nand tons of cargo each day and are especially vulnerable to the threats \nposed by .50-caliber weapons.\n  The threats to civilian aviation have been made abundantly clear over \nthe last year and a half. The events of September 11 certainly showed \nthe ability of terrorists to find loopholes in aviation security.\n\n  The recent attack on an Israeli airliner last November in Kenya \nserves as an example of the threat these weapons pose. Less than 4 \nmonths ago, an Israeli airliner, loaded with hundreds of innocent \ncivilians, became the target of a terrorist attack. Two heat-seeking, \nRussian-made missiles known as SA-7s were launched at Arkia Flight 582 \na few minutes after it took off from the Mombasa airport bound for \nIsrael.\n  Fortunately, the two missiles passed by the jet, and the flight, with \n271 people on board, was able to land safely in Tel Aviv a few hours \nlater. A shoulder-fire missile launcher was found on the ground near \nthe airport.\n  A previously unknown group calling itself the Army of Palestine \nclaimed responsibility for the attacks, but government officials in \nKenya and Israel, along with terrorism experts, said the operation was \nwell coordinated and bore the trademarks of Al Qaeda or an affiliated \ngroup.\n  This type of attack, one on civilian aircraft, is exactly the sort \nthat a .50-caliber weapon is capable of. Experts have agreed that .50-\ncaliber weapons aimed at a plane while stationary, or\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\ntaking off or arriving could be just as disastrous as a hit from a \nmissile launcher. Gal Luft, co-Director of the Institute for the \nAnalysis of Global Security has described .50-caliber weapons as \n``lethal to slow moving planes.''\n  For further assurance of the potential destruction of these weapons, \nsimply listen to the manufacturers themselves. According to a Barrett \nFirearms Manufacturing Model 82A1 .50 caliber sniper rifle brochure.\n  ``The cost effectiveness of the Model 82A1 cannot be overemphasized \nwhen a round of ammunition purchased for less than 10 U.S. dollars can \nbe used to destroy or disable a modern jet aircraft. The compressor \nsections of jet engines or the transmissions of helicopters are likely \ntargets for the weapon, making it capable of destroying multimillion \ndollar aircraft with a single hit delivered to a vital area.''\n  The Nordic Ammunition Company is the developer of the Raufoss \nmultipurpose ammunition for .50-caliber weapons that combines armor-\npiercing, incendiary, and explosive features and was used by U.S. \nforces during the gulf war. According to the company, the ammunition \ncan ignite military jet fuel and has ``the equivalent firing power of a \n20-mm projectile to include such targets as helicopters, aircrafts, \nlight armor vehicles, ships, and light fortifications.''\n  The bill will simply place stricter requirements on the way in which \nthese guns can be sold, and to whom. The measure is meant to offer a \nreasoned solution to making it harder for terrorists, assassins, and \nother criminals to obtain these powerful weapons. If we are to continue \nto allow private citizens to own and use guns of this caliber, range, \nand destructive power, we should at the very least take greater care in \nmaking sure that these guns do no fall into the wrong hands.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH:\n  S. 431. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to impose \ncertain limits on the receipt of out-of-State municipal solid waste; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will allow States to finally obtain relief from the seemingly \nendless stream of solid waste that is flowing into States like Ohio, \nPennsylvania, Indiana, Michigan, Virginia and many others.\n  My bill, ``the Municipal Solid Waste Interstate Transportation and \nLocal Authority Act,'' gives State and local governments the tools they \nneed to limit garbage imports from other States and manage their own \nwaste within their own States.\n  Ohio receives more than 1.5 million tons of municipal solid waste \nannually from other States and this number has been increasing \nregularly. In fact, estimates for 2001 indicate that Ohio imported \nalmost 2 million tons of municipal solid waste, which is almost 600,000 \nmore tons of waste than Ohio imported in 1997. While I am pleased that \nthese shipments have been reduced since our record high of 3.7 million \ntons in 1989, I believe it is still entirely too high.\n  Because it is cheap and because it is expedient, communities in other \nStates have simply put their garbage on trains or on trucks and shipped \nit to be landfilled in States like Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, \nPennsylvania and Virginia. This is wrong and it has to stop.\n  Many State and local governments in importing States have worked hard \nto develop strategies to reduce waste and plan for future disposal \nneeds. As Governor of Ohio, I worked aggressively to limit shipments of \nout-of-state waste into Ohio through voluntary cooperation of Ohio \nlandfill operators and agreements with other States. We saw limited \nrelief. Ohio has no assurance that our out-of-state waste numbers won't \nrise significantly, particularly in light of the closure of the Fresh \nKills landfill on Staten Island in 2001. Unfortunately, the Federal \ncourts have prevented States from enacting laws to protect our natural \nresources from being utilized as landfill space. What has emerged is an \nunnatural pattern where Ohio and other States--both importing and \nexporting--have tried to take reasonable steps to encourage \nconservation and local disposal, only to be undermined by a barrage of \ncourt decisions at every turn.\n  Quite frankly, State and local governments' hands are tied. Lacking a \nspecific delegation of authority from Congress, States that have acted \nresponsibly to implement environmentally sound waste disposal plans and \nrecycling programs are still being subjected to a flood of out-of-state \nwaste. In Ohio, this has undermined our recycling efforts because \nOhioans continue to ask why they should recycle to conserve landfill \nspace when it is being used for other States' trash. Our citizens \nalready have to live with the consequences of large amounts of out-of-\nstate waste--increased noise, traffic, wear and tear on our roads and \nlitter that is blown onto private homes, schools and businesses.\n  Ohio and many other States have taken comprehensive steps to protect \nour resources and address a significant environmental threat. However, \nexcessive, uncontrolled waste disposal from other States has limited \nthe ability of Ohioans to protect their environment, health and safety. \nI do not believe the Commerce Clause requires us to service other \nStates at the expense of our own citizens' efforts.\n  A national solution is long overdue. When I became Governor of Ohio \nin 1991, I joined a coalition with other Midwest Governors--Governor \nBayh, now Senator Bayh, of Indiana, Governor Engler of Michigan and \nGovernor Casey, and later Governors Ridge and O'Bannon, of \nPennsylvania--to try to pass effective interstate waste and flow \ncontrol legislation.\n  In 1996, Midwest Governors were asked by Congress to reach an \nagreement with Governors Whitman and Pataki on interstate waste \nprovisions. Our States quickly came to an agreement with New Jersey--\nthe second largest exporting State--on interstate waste provisions. We \nbegan discussions with New York, but these were put on hold \nindefinitely in the wake of their May, 1996 announcement to close the \nFresh Kills landfill.\n  The bill that I am introducing today reflects the agreement that my \nState, along with Indiana, Michigan and Pennsylvania, reached with \nthen-Governor Whitman.\n  For Ohio, the most important aspect of this bill is the ability for \nStates to limit future waste flows. For instance, they would have the \noption to set a ``permit cap,'' which would allow a State to impose a \npercentage limit on the amount of out-of-state waste that a new \nfacility or expansion of an existing facility could receive annually. \nOr, a State could choose a provision giving them the authority to deny \na permit for a new facility if it is determined that there is not a \nlocal or in-state regional need for that facility.\n  These provisions provide assurances to Ohio and other States that new \nfacilities will not be built primarily for the purpose of receiving \nout-of-state waste. For instance, in 1996, Ohio EPA had to issue a \npermit for a landfill that was bidding to take 5,000 tons of garbage a \nday--approximately 1.5 million tons a year--from Canada alone, which \nwould have doubled the amount of out-of-state waste entering Ohio. \nThankfully this landfill lost the Canadian bid. Ironically though, the \nwaste company put their plans on hold to build the facility because \nthere is not enough need for the facility in the State and they need to \nensure a steady out-of-state waste flow to make the plan feasible.\n  In addition, this bill would ensure that landfills and incinerators \ncould not receive trash from other States until local governments \napprove its receipt. States could also freeze their out-of-state waste \nat 1993 levels, while some States would be able to reduce these levels \nto 65 percent by the year 2008. This bill also allows States to reduce \nthe amount of construction and demolition debris they receive by 50 \npercent in 2014 at the earliest.\n  States also could impose up to a $3-per-ton cost recovery surcharge \non out-of-state waste. This fee would help provide States with the \nfunding necessary to implement solid waste management programs.\n  Unfortunately, efforts to place reasonable restrictions on out-of-\nstate waste shipments have been perceived by some as an attempt to ban \nall out-of-state trash. On the contrary, I am not asking for outright \nauthority for States to prohibit all out-of-state waste, nor am I \nseeking to prohibit\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nwaste from any one State. I am merely asking for reasonable tools that \nwill enable State and local governments to act responsibly to manage \ntheir own waste and limit unreasonable waste imports from other States. \nSuch measures would give substantial authority to limit imports and \nplan facilities around each States' needs.\n  I believe the time is right to consider and pass an effective \ninterstate waste bill. The bill I am introducing today is a consensus \nof importing and exporting States--States that have willingly come \nforward to offer a reasonable solution.\n  Congress must act this year to give citizens in Ohio and other \naffected States the relief they need from the truckloads of waste that \ndaily pass through their communities. We have waited too long for a \nsolution. Congress must act now to prevent this problem from spreading \nfurther to our neighbors out West and to help our neighbors in the East \nbetter manage the trash they generate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 431\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Wood \nPreservation Safety Act of 2003 with my Idaho colleague Senator Crapo \nand our friend from Nevada, Mr. Ensign. If enacted, this legislation \nwould authorize the Forest Products Laboratory of the US Forest Service \nto study the effectiveness of silver-based biocides as a wood \npreservative treatment. This legislation was also introduced in the \n107th Congress.\n  According to silver experts and academics, silver biocides could \nserve as a viable, safe and cost effective alternative wood \npreservative. Given silver's long-standing role as an effective \nbiocide, testing should be undertaken to determine silver's suitability \nas a wood preservative. Thus, I feel it is important to study and fully \nexplore the potential of silver as a wood preservative.\n  Mining has been an important part of Idaho's history since the late \n1800s. It became Idaho's first industry and remains a critical part of \nIdaho and the nation's economy. Mining in Idaho has supplied the nation \nwith minerals necessary for today's modern lifestyle which many of us \ntake for granted. In 1985, the mines of Idaho's Coeur d'Alene mining \ndistrict produced their one billionth ounce of silver. The Sunshine \nMine was America's richest silver mine, producing over 300 million \nounces of silver, more than the entire output of Nevada's famous \nComstock Lode. Silver contributes to our quality of life in many ways, \nand its use as a biocide in wood products is an important application \nthat must be explored.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that \nwould create a comprehensive research program to test the viability of \nsilver-based biocides for the treatment of wood products.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 61--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE IN \n                                FINANCE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted the following resolution; from the Committee \non Finance; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Res. 62\n\n       Whereas the democracies of the Western Hemisphere have \n     approved an Inter-American Democratic Charter that sets a \n     regional standard regarding respect for human rights and \n     fundamental freedoms;\n       Whereas the government of the Republic of Cuba approved and \n     is bound to respect the Charter of the Organization of \n     American States (OAS) and the American Declaration of the \n     Rights and Duties of Man;\n       Whereas in 2001, 2000, 1999, 1998, and previous years, the \n     government of the Republic of Cuba declined to reply to the \n     OAS Inter-American Commission on Human Rights when it sought \n     the government's views on human rights violations in the \n     Republic of Cuba;\n       Whereas all countries have an obligation to promote and \n     protect human rights and\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\n     fundamental freedoms as stated in the Charter of the United \n     Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on Human Rights \n     considered and passed a resolution in 2002 regarding the \n     situation of human rights in the Republic of Cuba and called \n     for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to \n     send a personal representative to the Republic of Cuba;\n       Whereas the United States and other countries remain \n     concerned about violations of human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms in the Republic of Cuba, including the freedoms of \n     expression, association, and assembly, and the rights \n     associated with the administration of justice;\n       Whereas, according to the Department of State, Cuban \n     authorities use exile as a means of repression and continue \n     to harass, threaten, arbitrarily arrest, detain, imprison, \n     and defame human rights advocates and members of independent \n     professional associations, including journalists, economists, \n     doctors, and lawyers with the goal of coercing them into \n     leaving the country;\n       Whereas Cuban citizens are routinely jailed solely because \n     their views do not coincide with those of the government;\n       Whereas Amnesty International in its 2002 report noted an \n     increase in human rights violations in the Republic of Cuba, \n     including short-term arbitrary arrests, threats, summonses, \n     evictions, interrogations, losses of employment, restrictions \n     on travel, house arrests, and other forms of harassment \n     directed by the government against political dissidents, \n     independent journalists, and other activists in an effort to \n     limit their ability to exercise fundamental freedoms;\n       Whereas Amnesty International also noted with concern the \n     beginning of a trend toward the increased use of violence by \n     Cuban authorities in order to repress dissent;\n       Whereas Cuban political prisoners are deliberately exposed \n     to harm and poor conditions as a means of punishment, \n     including beatings, denial of medical treatment, forced labor \n     against medical advice, unsanitary eating conditions, and \n     coexistence with inmates carrying highly infectious diseases;\n       Whereas peaceful dissidents in the Republic of Cuba, such \n     as Oscar Elias Biscet, who upon finishing more than 3 years \n     in jail for ``instigation to commit a crime'' is again in \n     police custody and facing a possible year-long sentence, are \n     subjected to ongoing harassment and imprisonment;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as journalist Bernardo Arevalo \n     Padron who is currently in jail serving a 6 year sentence, \n     are routinely jailed under the charge of ``disrespect'' for \n     making negative statements about the government of the \n     Republic of Cuba;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Carlos Oquendo Rodriguez who \n     is serving 2 years in prison, are routinely jailed under the \n     charge of ``public disorder'' for criticizing the Castro \n     regime;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez, \n     the longest serving current Amnesty International prisoner of \n     conscience in the Republic of Cuba, are imprisoned on charges \n     of ``revealing state security secrets'' and ``falsifying \n     public documents'' for promoting democratic practices and \n     human rights;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Juan Carlos Gonzalez Leiva, a \n     blind lawyer and president of the Cuban Foundation for Human \n     Rights, are imprisoned on charges of ``disobedience'' and \n     tortured while incarcerated for peacefully protesting the \n     Republic of Cuba's brutal treatment of dissidents;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Leonardo Miguel Bruzon Avila, \n     president of the 24th of February Movement (named for both a \n     turning point in the Spanish-American War and the day in 1996 \n     when 2 civilian aircraft carrying 4 members of the Cuban \n     American Brothers to the Rescue movement were shot down over \n     international waters by Cuban fighter jets), are charged with \n     ``public disorder'' and held without trial for planning \n     peaceful public ceremonies;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Nestor Rodriguez Lobaina, who \n     is president of the Cuban Youth for Democracy Movement and \n     currently serving a 6 year prison sentence, are charged with \n     ``damages'' for denouncing violations of human rights by the \n     Cuban government and communicating the brutality of the Cuban \n     regime to Cuban citizens and the world;\n       Whereas many Cubans, such as Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, who \n     is a founder of the Pedro Luis Boitel Political Prisoners \n     Movement and serving a 15 year prison sentence, are charged \n     with ``enemy propaganda'' and suffer systematic abuse and a \n     lack of medical assistance while in prison, for criticizing \n     communism;\n       Whereas Amnesty International reports that participants in \n     Oswaldo Paya's Varela Project collecting the required 10,000 \n     signatures on a petition for peaceful change to the legal \n     system of the Republic of Cuba have been harassed, detained, \n     subjected to confiscation of signed petitions, and ``kicked, \n     punched, and threatened'' by Cuban state security officials; \n     and\n       Whereas the European Parliament rightfully recognized \n     Oswaldo Paya for his work on the Varela Project with the 2002 \n     Sakharov Prize for his human rights work in the Republic of \n     Cuba: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls upon--\n       (1) the Organization of American States Inter-American \n     Commission on Human Rights to continue its reporting on the \n     human rights situation in the Republic of Cuba and to request \n     a visit to the Republic of Cuba for the purposes of reviewing \n     and reporting to the international community on the human \n     rights situation there;\n       (2) the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \n     and his newly appointed personal representative to vigorously \n     pursue the implementation of the 2002 Resolution regarding \n     the situation of human rights in the Republic of Cuba;\n       (3) the European Union, to build upon the European \n     Parliament's recognition of Cuban dissidents and, through the \n     appropriate bodies and mechanisms, request to visit the \n     Republic of Cuba for the purpose of reviewing the human \n     rights situation there and issue a report to the \n     international community on its findings; and\n       (4) human rights organizations throughout the world to \n     issue statements of solidarity with the Cuban human rights \n     activists, political dissidents, prisoners of conscience, \n     independent journalists, and other Cubans seeking to secure \n     their internationally recognized human rights and fundamental \n     freedoms.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nexpressing the grave concern of the United States Senate over the \nhorrific human rights conditions in Cuba under the regime of Fidel \nCastro, and calling on the international community to take concrete \nsteps to help the peaceful dissidents in Cuba who are pressing for \ndemocratic change, and being brutally repressed as a result.\n  The American and Cuban peoples share many things in common--a love of \nfreedom, a fierce spirit of independence, and a desire that our two \nnations will one day live as friends and neighbors in a hemisphere \nwhere the scourge of tyranny has been eradicated.\n  There is one obstacle to the common aspirations of our two peoples--\nFidel Castro. And because of him, our peoples share one more thing in \ncommon. Both of our countries have had innocent civilians killed on his \norders by his brutal security apparatus.\n  Seven years ago, on this day, February 24, Cuban MIG fighters \nconfronted three planes flying in international airspace by members of \nBrothers to the Rescue, a group whose principal mission was to search \nfor rafters in the Florida Straits risking their lives to escape \nCastro's oppression. Three planes left. Only one plane returned. The \nother two--unarmed Cessnas--were shot down on the direct orders of \nFidel Castro. Three American citizens and one legal resident were \nmurdered in cold blood.\n  Here is how the Organization of American States Inter-American \nCommission on Human Rights described the incident: ``The Cuban Air \nForce never notified nor warned the civil small aircraft, did not \nattempt to make use of other methods of interception, and never gave \nthem the opportunity to land. The first and only response of the MIGs \nwas the international destruction of the civil aircraft and of their \nfour occupants.''\n  This event seven years ago shocked our nation. But for Cubans living \nin Castro's tropical gulag, this sort of brutality is not shocking in \nthe least--it is their every day reality.\n  And so we introduce this resolution today to express our solidarity \nwith the families of the victims who perished that day, to be sure. \nHowever, we also do it to show our solidarity with all those still \nsuffering in Fidel Castro's Cuba--and those brave dissidents who risk \ntheir lives each day to press for freedom, democracy and rule of law.\n  Leonardo Miguel Bruzon Avila, is one such dissident. He is president \nof the 24th of February Movement and is being held without trial by the \nCastro regime. His crime? Planning peaceful public ceremonies to \ncommemorate the shoot-down of the Brothers to the Rescue planes.\n  It is a travesty that more than a decade after the Cold War has \nended, a brutal communist dictator is still oppressing people in our \nhemisphere. Castro's Cuba is like a modern day Jurassic Park--a lost \nisland, where the political dinosaurs of an earlier era still roam, \nleaving death and destruction in their wake. Our challenge, our \nmission, is to help the Cuban people escape--to join the 21st century \nas a free nation.\n  For some reason, there are still those who see Castro as a romantic \nrevolutionary. It is an image he works hard to promote. But there is \nnothing romantic about life in Castro's Cuba.\n  Thus, it is important to call attention to the reality of the \nconditions he imposes on his people. The UN, the OAS, the EU, and non \ngovernmental organizations such as Amnesty International and Human \nRights Watch\n\n[[Page S2611]]\n\nhave done this, but exposing the truth is only the first step. This \nresolution calls on these entities to do more, because the situation in \nCuba is not improving--it is deteriorating.\n  Amnesty International's 2002 report notes an increase in human rights \nviolations, including short-term arbitrary arrests, threats, summonses, \nevictions, interrogations, losses of employment, restrictions on \ntravel, and house arrests directed by the government against political \ndissidents, independent journalists, and other activists in an effort \nto limit their ability to exercise fundamental freedoms.\n  No one who disagrees with the Castro brothers' communist dictatorship \ncan live peacefully in Cuba. No one who loves liberty is allowed to \nflourish. No one who dares to speak out against the Castro government's \nbrutality and repression is permitted to remain free.\n  And once imprisoned, Cuban political prisoners are deliberately \nexposed to harm and poor conditions as a means of punishment, including \nbeatings, denial of medical treatment, forced labor against medical \nadvise, and coexistence with inmates carrying highly infectious \ndiseases.\n  It is critical that we send a message--to Fidel Castro and the \nworld--that we know what is happening under his rule. And we must make \nsure these peaceful freedom fighters know they are not forgotten.\n  Natan Sharansky tells the story about his time in the Soviet gulag, \nwhen word came that President Reagan had called the Soviet Union an \n``Evil Empire.'' The Soviet press had reprinted his remarks, as \nevidence of his anti-Soviet attitudes. But for the prisoners in the \nSoviet gulag, it was the first sign that they had not been forgotten--\nthat the leader of the world's most powerful democracy had no illusions \nabout the true nature of that regime--that he knew of their plight and \nwas ready to call the Soviet system what is was--evil.\n  He spoke about how Reagan and Senator Scoop Jackson became beacons of \nlight to all the political prisoners through the long days and nights \nof their struggle against the Soviet Union. He said Jackson and Reagan \nknew the value of freedom and they understood the nature of \ntotalitarian evil. They inspired all of the dissidents with their \nintegrity, their values, and their courage.\n  With this resolution, we send a signal to all the dissidents and \npolitical prisoners in Cuba--that we have no illusions about the nature \nof Fidel Castro's regime--that we know of their plight and stand ready \nto help them.\n  Specifically, this resolution highlights the plight of eight Cuban \ndissidents who are currently in jail: Oscar Elias Biscet, Bernardo \nArevalo Padron, Carlos Oquendo Rodriguez, Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez, \nJuan Carlos Gonzales Leiva, Leonardo Miguel Bruzon Avila, Nestor \nRodriguez Lobaina and Jorge Luis Garica Perez.\n  Unfortunately, as the resolution makes, clear, there are many other \npolitical prisoners, charged with the same offenses, enduring the same \nhorrible fate. It is my hope that by engaging the help of the \ninternational community, we will improve their condition, secure their \nrelease, and eliminate the harassment of human rights activists in the \nfuture.\n  Castro and his cronies must know that the world is watching; that \nCuba will remain an international pariah until the human rights \nsituation dramatically improves. And those suffering under the jackboot \nof his oppression must know that we are watching--and that we will not \nrest and will not tire and will keep working to support them until they \nare finally free.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 63--AUTHORIZING EXPENDITURES BY THE COMMITTEE ON \n                      ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works:\n\n                               S.
