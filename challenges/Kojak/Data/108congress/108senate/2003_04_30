Mr. President, I am proud to stand here with my \ndistinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Minnesota, Mark \nDayton, to offer congratulations to a group of young men of great \naccomplishment. In these difficult and troubled times, it is wonderful \nto recognize the accomplishment of young people. This accomplishment is \nsomething that is very close to the hearts of Minnesotans and folks in \nother parts of the country. It is about hockey.\n  Hockey is a sport in which it is not about individual team stars. It \nis about folks working as a team and toughing it out and showing \ncourage and determination. Hockey is a family sport. Moms and dads, \nhockey moms and dads are folks who get up at 4, 5 o'clock in the \nmorning to find ice time for their kids. And if it is not in the formal \nrink, it is a little rink outside where you kind of dust away the snow \nso your kids can skate. It represents so much of the best of America.\n  I am proud to announce I will be introducing, with my colleague \nSenator Dayton, a resolution later today commending the University of \nMinnesota Golden Gophers men's hockey team for winning the NCAA \nDivision I National Championship. And again, I am pleased to be joined \nby my colleague.\n  Hockey is not a partisan sport. I don't know whether hockey players \nare Democrats or Republicans. They are good Americans, and they are \ngood young people.\n  I understand that upon this resolution's introduction, the Senate \nwill take up and pass this fitting tribute to the Golden Gophers.\n  During their championship game against New Hampshire, a Gophers fan \nin attendance held up a sign that said, ``The Dynasty Begins.'' With \nthis as their second straight championship, the first team to \naccomplish this in 31 years, I would have to agree. At last year's \nFrozen Four, they defeated Maine in overtime 4 to 3, and this year's \nchampionship win came by a score of 5 to 1. Their first and second \nround games were also big wins, leading them to face Michigan in the \nsemifinals, where they defeated the Wolverines in overtime.\n  With their achievements on the ice, it is clear this hockey team has \nexceptional athletic abilities. But they should also be recognized for \ntheir academic excellence; they maintained a grade point average above \nthe university-wide average.\n  On a side note, allow me the opportunity to mention that the \nMinnesota-New Hampshire match in the final led to a similar competition \nhere in the Senate between my good friend and colleague, Senator Gregg. \nAs to that outcome, let me just say I am looking forward to my lobster \nand maple syrup. I will be presenting this very stylish Minnesota \nnecktie with the Golden Gopher colors to my good friend, the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire, for him to wear proudly as a sign of the \ngreat triumph for the people of Minnesota over the folks from New \nHampshire. On behalf of all Minnesotans, I am pleased to make this \naddition to his wardrobe and, again, I look forward to his wearing this \ngood-looking gopher tie on one of his many high profile days in the \nSenate.\n  I am proud to stand today to commend the Golden Gophers hockey team \nfor winning the national championship and to recognize the outstanding \nachievements of all the team players, their coach Don Lucia and his \nstaff.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I rise with my colleague on the morning after a difficult \nnight for Minnesota sports fans with both of our teams, the \nTimberwolves and the Wild, losing playoff games at home. This is a way \nto remind ourselves of days of former glory, and certainly with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Coleman, who was instrumental and \nprobably deserves more credit than any other person in Minnesota for \nbringing professional hockey back to St. Paul and Minnesota. The \nMinnesota Wild, which is now in its third year, is performing so well, \nit is fitting that we can rise together here for the second time this \nyear to pay tribute to a Minnesota team, its collegiate hockey team; in \nthis case, the Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota, who have \nrepeated now as national champions for the second time, the first time \nin 31 years that a college team has repeated for the men's \nchampionship.\n  They join the University of Minnesota women's team, the Duluth \nBulldogs women's team, who earlier this year won their third \nconsecutive national collegiate hockey championship.\n  As they were playing the Golden Gophers for the national title, I \nhappened to be flying across the Pacific Ocean on a codel headed by \nMajority Leader Bill Frist, and it turns out that his press secretary \nwas a graduate of the University of New Hampshire. So we had a friendly \nwager on the outcome. I am delighted to soon be the recipient of a \nquart of maple syrup, which makes it as sweet a victory for me as for \nthe team, and certainly for all the hockey fans throughout Minnesota.\n  This was supposed to be a rebuilding year for this team. Nobody \nthought they would make the playoffs, much less win the national \nchampionship. They had a new goalie and were the defending national \nchampions. That made them everyone's target. They kept getting better \nand better as the year went on. When they reached the playoffs, they \nwere unbeatable. They won four straight victories to win the WCHA \nchampionship and then four straight victories, over stiff competition--\nthe best in the Nation--in order to win the national championship for \nthe second straight year. Once again, they accomplished this with \nalmost entirely Minnesota talent.\n  Some people ask why it took 23 years--from 1979 to 1992--for \nMinnesota, which is the hockey capital of the Nation, to repeat as the \nnational collegiate champion. In 1979, when they won, there were only \ntwo Division I college teams in Minnesota. Presently there are five. \nThere is that increase in competition among the Minnesota colleges \nthemselves and for our Minnesota hockey talent. In addition, the other \nprograms--in the West, WCHA, and in the east, the CCHA--recruited \nextensively in Minnesota, and even eastern hockey spent heavily on \nCanadian talent. In my days of playing, in the 1960s, for example, in \nDivision I hockey, it used to be said that Canadian boys dreamed of \nplaying in the National Hockey League, and if those hopes and dreams \nwere dashed, they went on to college in the United States.\n  Despite all that fierce competition for the talent and the pressures \non that team, Coach Don Lucia has built, in just 5 years, an \nextraordinary program, a world class program in Minnesota that has \nrestored collegiate hockey to its rightful place, at the very top in \nMinnesota. It is a real tribute to Coach Lucia and his entire team, all \nthe players who performed extraordinarily well under the circumstances, \nand who are now, once again, the national collegiate champions.\n  It is Senator Coleman's and my hope that the President will be \ngracious enough to invite our two teams, the University of Minnesota \nGolden Gophers men's team and the University of Minnesota Duluth \nwomen's team, to the White House for recognition, as he had in the \nprevious year with both teams, and before that with the women's team.\n  I went to college with the President. He was a year ahead of me, and \nhe was not a hockey player. He was a rugby player. He was a sports fan. \nHe roomed in college with a college All-American from Minnesota, Jack \nMorrison. He was a frequent attendee at our hockey games at Yale \nUniversity. Two years ago, when the UMD women won the first \nchampionship, the President was gracious and responded instantaneously \nand invited the women's team, as he had previously invited the men's \nchampionship team from Boston College, to be feted at the White House. \nIt could not have been a more exciting moment for the players, their \nfamilies, friends, and the coaches at the University of Minnesota \nDuluth. Last year, we had the good fortune of having both championship \nteams, and the President was gracious enough to invite them both, along \nwith the families, friends, and coaches, to the White House.\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\n  Senator Coleman and I have put in our request and soon expect that \nthe President will be gracious enough to once again invite the teams \nand commend all those who play sports throughout the Nation, such as \nhockey, as they should be played--with all the enthusiasm and the best \nof their talent and ability, learning the values of sportsmanship, \nteamwork, competition. Sometimes they don't come out as well as they \nwould like, but every once in a while they may reach the pinnacle of \nsuccess of a national championship. I am sure the President would \nconcur with that.\n  Again, I salute my favorite teams in Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Dorgan pertaining to \nthe introduction of S. 950 are printed in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5503-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5503-S5504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BIPARTISAN SENATORIAL TRIP TO JAPAN, TAIWAN, SOUTH KOREA, AND CHINA\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I want to share some of my experiences \nover the last 2 weeks as part of a bipartisan delegation of Senators \nwho traveled to Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and China. Upon my return \nto Minnesota last week, directly from Beijing, I never had so many \ninquiries from people meeting with me as to my health and well-being. \nFortunately, I assured them I was not carrying SARS, which is something \nto be taken obviously very seriously.\n  The trip was led by our Senate majority leader Bill Frist, and was \nled extraordinarily well by him. I cannot say enough to reflect my \nrespect and admiration for his demeanor, his leadership, his poise, and \nhis presence when facing the heads of state when we had these meetings \nin China, South Korea, and Taiwan.\n  We may be Republicans and Democrats, but occasionally we need to be \nreminded that at our core all of us are Americans. Ultimately, we all \nsucceed or we do not succeed together, and that was certainly the \nspirit of this bipartisan delegation of five Republican Senators and \nthree Democratic Senators. We got along very well. I do not think there \nwas a cross word among us. We enjoyed very much the privilege of \nrepresenting the United States of America as we did, and I believe \nunder Senator Frist's leadership we did so responsibly and hopefully \nhonorably.\n  After careful consideration, at the end of our trip, the principal \nreason we decided to go through with our plans to go to China was the \nopportunity it presented to meet with the new Chinese leadership and \nparticularly to discuss the situation concerning North Korea's nuclear \nweapons program. We certainly carefully considered and Senator Frist, \nof course, being a doctor, was in the forefront of considering very \ncarefully the exposure we would have, the risks that would be entailed \nin regard to SARS. We took every possible precaution. I washed my hands \nand face more in 2 and a half days in Beijing than I usually do in \nabout 2 weeks in Minnesota. So far, knock on wood, it seems to have \nbeen effective.\n  As I said, we believed the opportunity to converse directly with the \nnew President of China, President Hu Jintao, as well as the other new \nChinese leadership, and to press upon them the urgency we felt about \nresolving the nuclear situation in North Korea was worth that trip, and \nit proved to be. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that, in fact, \nChina shares our goal, as their leadership expressed several times, to \nbring about a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, and that position which \nwas stated by them was corroborated by our Ambassador, Clark T. Randt, \nJr., who apparently was a classmate of the President who appointed him, \nPresident Bush. Both of them, it turns out, were fraternity brothers of \nmine back in college.\n  I had a chance to reminisce with him. He reassured all of us that the \nChinese Government had been very influential in bringing North Korea to \nthe negotiating table last week, the trilateral talks that commenced in \nBeijing. They could have been more timely but at least they are \nunderway. Hopefully, they will continue actively with the top-level \nattention they certainly need.\n  It was a signal of a great opportunity to work in partnership with \nthe new Chinese Government to reach the shared objective of ridding \nNorth Korea of its nuclear weapons and to create a nuclear-free Korean \npeninsula. What a great way to build a partnership for the next 10, 20 \nyears, which is what this Government in China now professes it wants \nwith the United States. President Hu said himself their primary \nobjective for the next two decades is to increase and expand the \neconomic progress that has been made in their country, to raise the \nstandard of living of more and more of their citizens through the \nUnited States and other foreign investment through additional trade and \neconomic growth there which has been staggering in the last 10 to 15 \nyears. As they pointed out, especially in the middle and western parts \nof the country, so much more needs to be done to bring those areas up \nto the eastern seaboard, mainland of China.\n  That, hopefully, will be their priority and one that will serve to \nincrease the likelihood of peace and economic and international \nsecurity throughout the world. There would be nothing we could do that \nwould be any more beneficial to our national interests than to \nencourage their economic progress and to build a relationship that is \neconomic, that is cultural and social after they have resolved their \ncurrent health crisis, and also provide the strong influence of both \ncountries for peaceful resolution of the situation in North Korea and \nothers that will arise inevitably in that part of the world.\n  They also stressed, as did the South Korean and Taiwanese \nGovernments, the importance of peacefully resolving the situation in \nNorth Korea. Anyone who believes a military resolution would be \nadvisable should go over and meet with the leaders of those three \nrespective countries--South Korea, China, and Taiwan, and even in \nJapan, as well. From the leadership with whom we met there, there is no \none in that part of the world in responsible positions who wants to see \na military threat or military action initiated there.\n  There has been a great deal of economic progress in the areas of \nSouth Korea and Taiwan. While claiming to suffer from the worldwide \neconomic slowdown, the rates of economic growth they are realizing in \nthose countries, from 3.5- to 5-percent growth annually, is something \nthat certainly this country and other nations in the world would be \ndelighted to achieve. For them, that is a slowdown, creating \nunemployment they have not had heretofore and economic and social \nproblems and welfare and safety net problems they have not had to deal \nwith for the last decade.\n  They also have a vital stake in having North Korea's nuclear program \neliminated, as the President has said properly so, but continued so in \na way that does not threaten the security and the stability of that \nregion of the world.\n  We also had the opportunity to travel to the demilitarized zone \nbetween North Korea and South Korea and had dinner with the 2nd Army \nDivision--``second to none'' is one of their mottos, and appropriately \nso. They are second to none in their dedication and courage and \ncommitment for being there. We stood right there on the DMZ and looked, \nas they do night after night, across the border. Another motto of \ntheirs is ``fight tonight.'' They are in a constant State of readiness \nand alert, and all Americans should be mindful and respectful and \nenormously grateful to those brave men and women who put their lives on \nthe line day and night, one after the other, without the kind of \nrecognition their compatriots get in other parts of the globe--just as \nwell trained, just as well prepared, every bit as willing to stand and \ndefend the beacon of freedom in Korea as our forces have done so \noutstandingly in Iraq and previously in Afghanistan and anywhere else \nin the world.\n\n  That is a reminder, once again, that freedom is priceless, but it is \nnot free. It has to be won and preserved through dedication of the \nbrave men and women in the 2nd Army Division. And to all of them, and \ntheir leader, GEN Leon LaPorte, commander of the United States forces \nin Korea, we all have the utmost respect and admiration.\n  It reminded me why I introduced, along with Senator Sessions last \nyear,\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\nlegislation that would provide for financial incentive for troops \ninvolved, particularly those who reenlist in areas of the world such as \nKorea where they are separated from their families for long periods of \ntime. It is one of the most difficult places in the military, we are \ntold by the commanders, in which to recruit and especially re-recruit \nmen and women to serve terms of duty because of the hardships, because \nof the additional costs that have to be borne because usually their \nfamilies are left behind and that involves two parallel tracks of \nexpenses--separation and phone bills. Senator Sessions and I proposed \nan income tax exemption for troops who serve in far-flung areas of the \nworld such as Korea. I will renew my efforts this year to see that \nlegislation enacted because it is the least we can do and the least \nthat is deserved by these brave men and women.\n  The commanders in those areas have asserted it would be invaluable in \nrecruiting efforts.\n  I see the real leader and the commander of the Senate when it comes \nto the Armed Services, my very distinguished chairman of the committee \non which I am proud to serve, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, the Senator from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before my colleague departs, I commend him for the \ninterest the Senator has taken in the men and women of the Armed \nForces, the national security policy of this country as a Member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. Well done, sir.\n  I have been privileged to be on that committee now, this being my \n25th year in the Senate, and the personal rewards from it for the \nassociation that the Senator has as a member of the committee with the \nmen and women in uniform is beyond expectation. I thank the Senator for \nhis service.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner and Mr. Dayton pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 951 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesies, and I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there \nwill be 1 hour for debate to be equally divided by the Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Allen, and the ranking member, with 5 minutes of the time \nunder majority control for the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, Senator McCain, the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, is tied up right now, but I thank him for his \nthoughtful leadership and his continued effort and dedication on this \nimportant bipartisan measure.\n  I rise today to respectfully urge my colleagues to support S. 196, \nthe minority-serving institution Digital and Wireless Technology \nOpportunity Act of 2003. This legislation will provide vital resources \nto address the technology gap that exists at many minority-serving \ninstitutions. It establishes a new grant program within the National \nScience Foundation that provides annually for 5 years up to $250 \nmillion to help historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic \nserving institutions, and tribal colleges to close what is often called \nthe digital divide, when, in fact, what it really is is an ``economic \nopportunity divide.''\n  Since the days before I was elected to the Senate, my goal was to \nlook for ways to improve education and empower all our young people, \nregardless of race, ethnicity, gender, religious beliefs, or their \neconomic background, so that they can compete and succeed in life.\n  Additionally, I strongly believe we need to embrace the advancements \nand innovations in technology--especially as a means to provide greater \nopportunities or security for Americans.\n  In my view, increasing access to technology provides our young people \nwith an important tool for success, both in the classroom and in the \nworkforce.\n  We all know that the best jobs in the future will go to those who are \nthe best prepared. However, I am increasingly concerned that when it \ncomes to high-technology jobs, which pay higher wages, this country \nruns the risk of economically limiting many college students in our \nsociety. It is important for all Americans that we close this \nopportunity gap.\n  Now, we know the demand for workers with skills in science and \ntechnology continues to grow. Unfortunately, since 1996, the number of \nbachelor degrees awarded in the physical sciences has dropped 29 \npercent, mathematics is down 19 percent, and engineering is down 21 \npercent.\n  We also know that information technology companies are still relying \non H-1B visas and using foreign workers to fill important IT jobs and \npositions. I want to be clear that I am not against legal immigration, \nbut I say let's properly educate and train Americans so they can get \nthose good high-technology jobs.\n  Now, minority-serving institutions, when one looks at them, still \nlack desired information and digital technology infrastructure in many \ncases. I encourage my colleagues to read the Commerce Committee report \nfindings on minority-serving institutions' technology deficiencies.\n\n[[Page S5505]]\n\n  I will share with you some of the pertinent facts from this report \nand, in particular, a study completed by the Department of Commerce and \nthe National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, \nwhich indicated, among other facts, that no historically black college \nor university requires computer ownership for their undergraduate \nstudents; 13 HBCUs reported having no students--not one--owning their \nown personal computer; over 70 percent of the students at historically \nblack colleges and universities rely on the college or the university \nto provide computers, but only 50 percent of those universities can \nprovide their students with access to computers and computer labs, \nlibraries, classrooms, or other locations; most of these minority-\nserving colleges do not have the private foundation resources to \nprovide financial support to upgrade their network infrastructure.\n\n  So it is not surprising that most HBCUs do not have high-speed \nInternet access, especially the desired ATM or asynchronous transfer \nmode technology and that only 3 percent of historically black colleges \nand universities have financial aid available to help students close \nthe computer ownership gap.\n  Access to the Internet is no longer a luxury, it is a necessity. \nBecause of the rapid advancement and growing dependence on technology, \nbeing technologically proficient has become more essential to \neducational achievement. The fact is, 60 percent of all jobs require \ninformation technology skills. Jobs in information technology pay \nsignificantly higher salaries than jobs in the noninformation \ntechnology fields. Thus, students who lack access to these information \ntechnology tools are at an increasing disadvantage. Consequently, it is \nvitally important that all institutions of higher education provide \ntheir students with access to the most current IT and digital \nequipment. It would also help those universities to attract professors \nif they have that equipment to help them impart that knowledge to their \nstudents.\n  This proposed technology program will allow eligible historically \nblack colleges and universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and \ntribal institutions the opportunity to acquire equipment, networking \ncapability, hardware and software, digital network technology, and \nwireless technology and infrastructure, such as wireless fidelity, or \nWi-Fi, to develop and provide educational services. Additionally, the \nfunds in this bill could be used to offer students much needed \nuniversal access to campus networks, dramatically increasing their \nconnectivity rates or make necessary infrastructure improvements.\n  At the request of some of my colleagues, we recently added provisions \nto assure that diversity among these minority serving institutions \nincludes public and private colleges and universities, both 2-year and \n4-year institutions, and public and private postsecondary technical \ninstitutions.\n  Under Chairman McCain's leadership, and with the ranking member, \nSenator Hollings, and colleagues from across the aisle, the Commerce \nCommittee heard testimony from the presidents of various colleges and \nuniversities representing each of the major national associations--the \nHispanics Association of Colleges and Universities, the American Indian \nHigher Education Consortium, National Association for Equal Opportunity \nin Higher Education, the United Negro College Fund, and also we heard \nspecifically from former Congressman Floyd Flake, who is president of \nWilberforce University; and Dr. Marie McDemmond, president of Norfolk \nState University; Dr. William DeLauder, president of Delaware State; \nDr. Ricardo Fernandez, president of Herbert Lehman College in New York; \nand Dr. Cary Monette, president of Turtle Mountain Community College \ntestified in support of S. 196.\n  In testimony before the committee, it was estimated that in 10 years \nminorities will comprise nearly 40 percent of all college-age \nAmericans. One-third of all African Americans with undergraduate \ndegrees, earned them from an HBCU. According to the Hispanic \nAssociation of Colleges and Universities, their institutions educate \ntwo-thirds of the 1.6 million Hispanic Americans enrolled in higher \neducation today.\n  There are over 200 Hispanic Serving Institutions; over 100 \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities and 34 tribal colleges \nthroughout our country.\n  It is clear that minority-serving institutions in the United States \nare providing a valuable service to the educational strength and future \ngrowth of our Nation. And these institutions must upgrade their \ntechnology capabilities for their students.\n  I am proud to say Virginia is home to 5 HBCUs--Norfolk State \nUniversity, St. Paul's College, Virginia Union University, Hampton \nUniversity, and Virginia State University.\n  I will continue to look for ways to improve education, create new \njobs, and seek out new opportunities to benefit the people of my \nCommonwealth and indeed our entire Nation. By improving technology-\neducation programs in minority-serving institutions, we can accomplish \nall three of these goals for students throughout our Nation.\n  S. 196 is also supported by the technology industry--The Information \nTechnology Association of America; Computer Associates International; \nOracle; Gateway Computers; BearingPoint Technologies; and Motorola all \nsupport this measure.\n  We all recognize the technology requirements on the 21st century \nworkforce call for tangible action, not rhetoric. Our future economic \nand national security needs depend on and demand that all of our eager \nyoung students have the highly technical skills needed to compete and \nsucceed in the workforce.\n  We must tap the underutilized talent of our minority serving \ninstitutions to ensure that America's workforce is prepared to lead the \nworld.\n  I thank my colleagues for joining me today. I thank the chairman of \nour committee, Senator McCain, and other sponsors of this measure, \nincluding Senators Stevens, Hollings, Miller, Warner, DeWine, Santorum, \nTalent, Cochran, Grassley, Hutchison, Sessions, Graham of South \nCarolina, the occupant of the chair, Fitzgerald, Lott, Domenici, \nCampbell, Kerry, Bingaman, Daschle, Murkowski, and Johnson.\n  I also thank our former colleague, Max Cleland, for his work last \nyear on a measure that is similar to what we will soon be voting on. I \nthank Floyd DesChamps of the Commerce Committee staff, who has done a \ngreat job, and my staff, Frank Cavaliere.\n  Indeed, this legislation is a significant, constructive, and positive \naction to ensure that many more of our college students are provided \naccess to better technology and education; and most importantly, even \ngreater opportunities in life. And, with the passage of this bill, we \nwill close the opportunity gap. We will leave no college student \nbehind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to applaud my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Allen, for his leadership. We are privileged in \nVirginia, primarily in the northern area, and then to an extent in the \nTidewater and Richmond areas, to have a very heavy concentration of \ntechnology firms.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Allen and other Senate colleagues we \nare addressing the needs of the technology improvements at historically \nblack colleges and universities. Sixty percent of all jobs require \ninformation technology skills, and jobs in information technology can \npay significantly higher salaries than jobs in other fields.\n  At the same time, many of our historically black colleges and \nuniversities often lack the resources and the capital to offer an \neducational program and assistance to their students to bridge the \ndigital divide that exists in many places in America.\n  The bill will establish a grant program for these institutions of \nhigher learning to bring increased access to computer technology and \nthe Internet to their student populations.\n  In Virginia, there are five historically black colleges and \nuniversities that will be given an opportunity for grants and/or \nmatching funds to achieve this most noble goal of bridging the digital \ndivide.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I begin by congratulating Senator Allen \nfor his very important work on this legislation. Senator Allen has long \nbeen an advocate of equal opportunity, but he has also displayed a \ngreat deal of expertise and knowledge on a number of\n\n[[Page S5506]]\n\nhigh-tech issues. As a member of the Commerce Committee, he has \ncontinuously displayed that leadership and worked actively, \nparticularly on telecommunications and high-tech issues. So I commend \nhim for his leadership and his commitment to this important \nlegislation. He had a lot of help, but the fact is that Senator Allen \nwas the leader in this legislation, and I thank him for his outstanding \nwork. This legislation could provide an opportunity for those who would \nnever have an opportunity in America to grow and to prosper and to take \nadvantage of incredible opportunities that this legislation provides.\n  The Digital and Wireless Network Technology Act of 2003 would \nestablish a $250 million per year program within the National Science \nFoundation for fiscal years 2004 to 2008. The purpose of the grant \nprogram is to help strengthen the ability of minority-serving \ninstitutions, which includes Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, Hispanic-Serving Institutions, and tribal colleges and \nuniversities, to provide educational instructions through digital and \nwireless network technologies.\n  As we look at the scenes of the war in Iraq, we are amazed at the \ntechnological capabilities of our Armed Forces. They are able to do \nthings that we simply were not available to do just a few years ago. \nNevertheless, this superiority must be supplied with a constant supply \nof new technologies, which are the result of the Nation's investment in \na research and development infrastructure.\n  During these times of economic slowdown and global threat, it is \nimperative that our Nation's institutions of higher education are \nprepared to produce a technologically advanced workforce. As the \ndemographics of the Nation become more and more diverse, minority \ninstitutions of higher education take on an even greater importance. It \nis estimated that in 10 years, minorities will comprise 40 percent of \nthe college-age Americans, the pool from which the Nation's future \nengineers and scientist will emerge.\n  Rita Colwell, Director of the National Science Foundation, stated in \na letter earlier this year to new members of Congress that, ``. . . \nAmerican science and technology is failing to tap a vast pool of talent \namong our women and ethnic minorities.'' In an effort to enable the \nNation to tap this underutilized pool of future engineers and \nscientists, it is essentially to provide assistance to minority \ninstitutions. The hundreds of MSI's should be provided with the \nresources to ensure that we are indeed utilizing their large student \npopulations.\n  The legislation before us is not the result of any special interest \ngroups or highly financed lobbying efforts. It is based upon data \nprovided by 80 of the 118 HBCUs in a study entitled, ``HBCU Technology \nAssessment Study,'' funded by the U.S. Department of Commerce and \nconducted by a national black college association and a minority \nbusiness.\n  The study assessed the computing resources, networking, and \nconnectivity of HBCUs and other institutions that provide educational \nservices to predominately African-American populations.\n  The study concluded that [During this era of continuous innovation \nand change, continual upgrading of networking and connectivity systems \nis critical if HBCUs are to continue to cross the digital divide and \nnot fall victim to it. Failure to do this may result in what is a \nmanageable digital divide today, evolving into an unmanageable digital \ngulf tomorrow. Based upon testimony provided during the February \nhearing held by the Commerce Committee, we concluded that the findings \nfrom the study also would apply to Hispanic-serving institutions, and \ntribal colleges and universities.\n  This legislation builds upon the work begun by Senator Cleland and \nmany others during the last Congress. In testimony before the Commerce \nCommittee last year, the President of the United Negro College Fund, \nCongressman William Gray, stated that we can ill afford to promote \ncollege graduates who enter the workforce without mastering the basic \ncomputer skills and understanding how information technology applies to \ntheir work or profession.\n  This point was further illuminated by the Dr. Marie McDemmond, \nPresident of Norfolk State University, when she testified at the \nCommerce Committee's February hearing that over 175,000 foreign \nnationals have come to our country in efforts to fill quality, high \npaying jobs in science and technology, mainly because our own workforce \ndoes not possess the skills and training necessary to fill these \nessential jobs.\n  At the same hearing, other college presidents from the Nation's \nHBCU's Hispanic-serving institutions and Native-American schools also \ntestified about the daunting task of building their technology \ninfrastructure. While these problems apply to all of our Nation's \nuniversities, they are more severe at many of our minority-serving \ninstitutions. Within the State of Arizona, for example, many of the \ntribal colleges and universities and Hispanic-serving institutions are \nfacing daily technical challenges of the new millennium. They struggle, \nas do many other institutions, to keep up with an ever-changing \nnetworking technology environment.\n  I again thank Senator Allen for his leadership on this important \nissue. I think he had it right when he said this bill is about closing \nan economic opportunity divide. In this case, it is a divide that \nexists primarily because of the difference in the educational base of \nour citizens which affects economic opportunities.\n  I especially thank Senator Allen for including the Hispanic and \ntribal institutions in this legislation. I remind my friend from \nVirginia that in my State of Arizona, one of the poorest areas of our \nNation exists in northern Arizona on the Navajo Reservation, the \nlargest Indian reservation by far in America. These Native Americans \nhave been left behind, as well as have African Americans and Hispanics. \nI thank the Senator for including especially our Native Americans but \nalso our Hispanic populations and institutions in this legislation.\n  Again, I congratulate him for his commitment in this time of economic \ndifficulties and perhaps less opportunities, and because of that, he is \nmaking, I believe, a significant step forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Allen for \nbringing this legislation, S. 196, to the floor today. As many of you \nknow, this bill had its genesis with our former colleague, Senator Max \nCleland.\n  Senator Cleland knew that access to the Internet is no longer a \nluxury, but a necessity, and he wanted to make sure that all of our \ninstitutions of higher learning could provide their students with \naccess to the most current technologies. That is why he introduced this \nlegislation last Congress and I am glad that Senator Allen and I can \nbring Senator Cleland's vision to fruition today.\n  After all, according to a 2000 study, African Americans, Hispanics, \nand Native Americans constitute one-quarter of the total U.S. workforce \nand 30 percent of the college-age population. Yet, members of these \nminorities comprise only 7 percent of the U.S. computer and information \nscience labor force; 6 percent of the engineering workforce; and less \nthan 2 percent of the computer science faculty. These statistics are \nall the more important because 60 percent of all jobs require \ninformation technology skills. Furthermore, jobs in information \ntechnology pay significantly higher salaries than jobs in \nnoninformation technology fields.\n  So you can see, technology is rapidly advancing and we are \nincreasingly growing dependent on it. Being digitally connected is \nbecoming ever more critical to economic and educational advancement. \nNow that a multitude of Americans regularly use the Internet to conduct \ndaily activities, people who lack access to these tools are at an \nincreasing disadvantage. Consequently, it is crucial that all \ninstitutions of higher education provide their students with access to \nthe most current information technology.\n  Unfortunately, however, due to economic constraints, many minority-\nserving institutions are unable to provide adequate access to the \nInternet and other information technology tools and applications. \nAccording to a 2000 study completed by the Department of Commerce and \nthe National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, \nwhile 98 percent of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, \nHBCUs, have a campus network, half of\n\n[[Page S5507]]\n\nthose surveyed did not have computers available in the location most \naccessible to students, their dormitories. Additionally, most HBCUs do \nnot have high-speed connectivity to the Internet, and only 3 percent of \nthese colleges and university indicated that financial aid was \navailable to help their students close the computer ownership gap.\n  While minority-serving institutions are making progress in upgrading \ntheir network capacity, progress is not quick enough. In his testimony \nbefore the Commerce Committee on February 13, 2003, Dr. Ricardo \nFernandez, president of Herbert H. Lehman College in New York City \nexplained the challenge these institutions face:\n\n       At my own institution . . . we are struggling to provide \n     network access to students and faculty. Providing fiber and \n     copper cabling, switches, and routers to every building and \n     classroom is simply very expensive for us and cost \n     prohibitive. . . . At the pace that we are moving, the \n     technology we are installing may well be obsolete before the \n     project is finished.\n\n  S. 196, the Digital and Wireless Technology Program Act of 2003, \nseeks to help institutions such as Lehman College or the eight eligible \nSouth Carolina colleges and universities by authorizing a program at \nthe National Science Foundation to bring digital technologies to \nminority-serving institutions. These funds could be used for a variety \nof activities from campus wiring, to equipment upgrades, and to \ntechnology training. We need to pass this bill now so these colleges \nand universities--and their students--don't have to wait until the \ntechnology is obsolete before they get it.\n  Working with Senator Allen and Senator McCain, we have made several \nchanges to the bill before we brought it to the floor. At the request \nof the HELP Committee, we have clarified that training grants under S. \n196 would be used for technology-related training and professional \ndevelopment. By narrowing the scope of the training, however, we do not \nthink we would narrow the scope of the bill. Infrastructure projects \nlike wiring classrooms or dorms could still be eligible for funding \nunder this bill if they fit into an overall program to strengthen an \ninstitution's technological capacity.\n  We have also tried to address some concerns about the NSF's peer \nreview process. I have said it before, peer review is all well and \ngood--if you are one of the peers. Too often, the institutions that S. \n196 is trying to serve are left out of NSF's peer review process. We \nhope that NSF, working with the advisory council established under \nsection 4, will develop a fair and equitable process for reviewing \nthese grants. To that end, we have added a requirement that any peer \nreview panel should include members from eligible institutions.\n  Finally, we have instructed NSF to review the program with an eye \ntoward insuring that grant recipients have demonstrated the need for \nthis assistance so that we can address the most trenchant problems \nfirst. In addition, the grants should go to a wide variety of \ninstitutions, large and small, throughout the country.\n  I thank Senator Allen and Senator McCain for helping us move this \nlegislation. I thank the staff who worked on this bill, particularly \nAllison McMahan, Chan Lieu, and Jean Toal Eisen of my Commerce \nCommittee staff and Floyd DesChamps of the majority staff. Moreover, I \ncommend my friend Max Cleland for bringing this issue to the Senate's \nattention. I look forward to the passage of S. 196.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa is yielded such time \nas he may consume. Rather, the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is all the same.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada, and I assure the Senator \nthat Iowa and Illinois are not the same, as my colleague said. Iowa \ndoes grow more corn, but we grow more soybeans. I make that clear now.\n  I support this bill. This bill is introduced by Senator Allen and \ncosponsored by many of my colleagues, and I am sure it will pass with \nflying colors. It is a great bill that seeks to address the technology \ngap that exists at many minority-serving institutions across America. I \ncommend Senator Allen for his leadership on this bill. I am sure that \nit is going to make a difference.\n  I also take the floor to acknowledge a man who is not here today. His \nname is Max Cleland. Max Cleland, during the 107th Congress, introduced \nS. 414, the Digital Network Technology Program Act. The bill was a work \nproduct that Senator Cleland put together with Atlanta University \nCenter, as well as national organizations such as the Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, tribal \ncolleges and universities, and other minority-serving institutions.\n  Senator Cleland pushed for the Commerce Committee to hold a hearing \non the bill which he chaired on February 27, 2002. After that, the \ncommittee reported the bill favorably. The bill was held on the floor \nby another Member of the Senate, as Senator Cleland was up for \nreelection. It is not uncommon when a Senator is up for reelection that \npeople in the Senate want to try to hold back passage of legislation so \nthat it does not create an advantage for them in the campaign. So \nSenator Cleland fell victim to that particular strategy. He was not a \nvengeful or spiteful man. I am sure he understands it, but this concept \nunderlying this bill meant a lot to him personally.\n  I stand here today to make sure, as Senator Allen has mentioned, \nSenator McCain mentioned, that Max Cleland's name be part of this \ndebate. I think it should be much more than just an acknowledgment in \nthe Congressional Record that Max Cleland worked so hard for this \nconcept. Max Cleland, former colleague of ours, a Senator from Georgia, \nused to have his chair right behind me. Max became one of our favorites \nin the Senate over a period of 6 years. We came to know and love Max \nCleland.\n  This is a man who was a triple amputee, a Vietnam veteran, with a \ndisability that might have stopped the lives of so many but never \nstopped his will and determination. He came out of a veterans hospital \nwith extensive rehabilitation, dealt with his disability, and became a \nleader in so many different areas. He, of course, was the head of the \nVeterans' Administration under President Carter, Secretary of State in \nthe State of Georgia, and then ran successfully for the Senate. He came \nhere and was one of the hardest working Members.\n  Those who got up this morning and felt a little tired should stop and \nthink about what every morning was like for Max Cleland, getting out of \nbed and facing the reality of being a triple amputee as a Vietnam \nveteran. But he came to his job with joy and determination, identified \ncauses that made a difference, and dedicated his career to pursuing \nthem. This bill was one of them.\n  I am sorry that Max Cleland's name is not included within the bill. \nIt should be. But I stand here today and say to those who follow these \ndebates that many times those who have been the precursors and the \nearly pioneers on ideas may not be in the Senate when the day comes for \ntheir final passage. I have seen that happen time and again in the \nhistory of this body. But I know Max Cleland can take pride, as we all \ndo, that Senator Allen has picked up this torch and ran with it. He has \ntaken the original Cleland bill, made improvements to it, changes to \nit, and now we have a bill which carried on in Max Cleland's tradition \nand I hope will serve this Nation well. I am certain that it will.\n  I commend Senator Allen and want to pay special recognition to Max \nCleland for initiating conversations which led to this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank my friend from Virginia for yielding, and I \ncongratulate him for his great work in getting this bill together. It \nis very much needed.\n  We cannot operate a modern college or university today without being \nup to date with information technology. The range of uses and needs for \nthat kind of technology are almost unlimited. They cover everything \nfrom long distance learning to access to research for students to the \nability to teach your students about information technology. Of course, \nmost jobs include a requirement that you be up to date in that kind of \ntechnology.\n  Another important use for universities is helping the communities \naround them. I will talk about an example of that in just a few \nminutes. Most modern colleges and universities,\n\n[[Page S5508]]\n\nwhatever their background, are networking very close to the communities \nwhich they serve. As centers of excellence in information technology \nthere is a wide variety of ways to make a difference. That is an \nimportant contribution that historically black universities and \nminority institutions make.\n  It is important to understand these institutions are not just \nimportant for the students who attend. That is their primary function, \nbut they are very important centers of achievement and community \nactivities in the communities of which they are a part. That is the \nreason this bill is so important and why I am pleased to cosponsor it \nand pleased to speak for just a few minutes today on its behalf.\n  Most of the background has been given here and I appreciate very much \nthe work of the chairman and Senator Allen in supporting this bill and \nassembling this information. They had a great hearing.\n  Let me talk about a couple of historically black colleges in Missouri \nthat would benefit from this bill. One is Lincoln University in \nJefferson City. Lincoln was founded in 1866 by former officers and \nsoldiers of the Union Army. It has 2,500 undergraduates, 200 graduate \nstudents. David Henson, the president of Lincoln University, told us \nthat the passage of the bill would give Lincoln the opportunity to \nacquire equipment, networking capability, digital network technology, \nwireless technology, and infrastructure to develop and provide \neducational services to its students, its faculties, and its staff, and \nalso give Lincoln students universal access to campus networks around \nthe country.\n  Another historically black college is Harris-Stowe State College with \na rich tradition in the St. Louis area. Henry Givens, Jr., the \npresident of Harris-Stowe State College, said this would enable their \nstudents and faculty to take advantage of a variety of sources, such as \ndistance learning, online services, and continuing education.\n  I mentioned before that the colleges are very important parts of the \ncommunities they serve. Harris-Stowe helps educate young kids from the \ncommunity. This kind of a grant would benefit the local public \nelementary school. It sends its children ranging from first to fifth \ngrade to learn at the Southwestern Bell Library and Technology Resource \nCenter at Harris-Stowe College. Harris-Stowe got a grant to build the \ncenter, but the technology is now very much out of date. This is \nanother aspect that this bill will help address, and I think it is \nimportant.\n  Of course, most historically black colleges and minority-serving \ninstitutions have not had a lot of money and do not have access to a \nlot of money to build these kinds of information technology centers in \nthe first place. But even when they can get the money to do that, it is \nextremely difficult for them to maintain and upgrade and update that \ntechnology. There is no area where it is more important to be up to \ndate than the area of information technology. That is the situation \nwith Harris-Stowe. Their resource center is 5 years old. It is greatly \nin need of a technology upgrade. Without Federal legislation of this \ntype, as a practical matter that is simply not going to be possible on \nan ongoing basis.\n\n  But with this support it will be possible, not only because of the \nFederal dollars we can help provide but also because the Federal \ndollars will be leveraged by these institutions with foundations, with \nState money, and will be an important way for them to gather resources \nfrom around the community and help serve their students and their \ncommunities with information technology.\n  I am grateful the Senator from Virginia has taken up this legislation \nand pushed it. A lot of what we do here is an attempt to directly fund \nor subsidize what some people are doing. It works so much better when \nwe work through institutions that already have strong records of \nperformance and strong records of service to constituencies around the \ncountry. That is what this bill does. I am very pleased to support it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to rise in \nsupport of what I consider to be very significant legislation, S. 196, \nthe Minority Serving Institution Digital and Wireless Technology \nOpportunity Act of 2003.\n  We have a very important opportunity in this country to make sure our \nuniversities and colleges not only do a good job in education in \ngeneral, but in particular in addressing the technology gap. We know in \nour Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic-serving \nInstitutions and Tribal Colleges, our Native-Hawaiian-serving \nInstitutions and Alaska-Native-serving Institutions, there is a digital \ndivide. This legislation would create a new grant program within the \nNational Science Foundation that provides up to $250 million to help \nthese colleges and universities.\n  In my own State of Mississippi I decided a few years ago we were \ntrying to shoot at too many targets and we were not hitting many of \nthem. We were missing them or we were not doing enough to make a \ndifference. So I concluded the best thing to do was try to get a \ntargeted focus on where we were going to put our efforts and where we \nwere going to put our money. Those areas have been education, \ntransportation--which can also be referred to as infrastructure, and \njobs. It is not just about highways and bridges, it is also about ports \nand harbors and railroads and aviation, the whole package, as well as \nindustrial sites where you can have the physical and technological \ninfrastructure and roads that lead to jobs.\n  So education, transportation, and jobs are critical all over this \ncountry and in my own State, which has been one that has struggled for \nyears to have advancement in education and economic opportunity.\n  I think this legislation is really important in helping to provide \nthe up-to-date technological education that today's society demands. As \nwe focus on education, not only at the higher education level where the \nFederal Government plays a critical role, but also when you look at \nwhat we need to do in kindergarten, and elementary, and secondary \neducation--if you are going to have the whole package, you have to make \nsure our young people have access to a good education that allows them \nto read and write and do basic arithmetic. Furthermore, they must be \nable to perform these basic skills at the fifth grade level, at the \neighth grade level, and in high school, but then be able to get into a \ncommunity college, some sort of a vocational training program, or our \ncolleges and universities, and when they get there that they will have \nthe tools and resources that they need.\n  It is fair to say I am from the generation that has been struggling \nwith technology and computers. We are sort of computer illiterates. Yet \nwe see our children who are able to do astonishing things because they \nhave had the exposure to the new technology.\n  We have to make sure that the Nation's focus applies not only to our \nmajor colleges and universities in America that primarily get the \nstudents who make very high scores on the SATs, but we also have to \nmake sure all students--whether they attend a private university or \ncollege or a State university or our historically Black or other \nminority institutions--have access to good education and what is needed \nin the technology field. Not just computers, but the whole high-tech \narea.\n  My own State of Mississippi is home to roughly 9 percent of the \nNation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities. I am pleased to \nbe able to recognize these great eight schools in Mississippi: Alcorn \nState University, Coahoma Community College, Hinds Community College--\nUtica, Jackson State University, Mary Holmes College, Mississippi \nValley State University, Rust College and Tougaloo College.\n  I am happy to be a cosponsor of the minority serving institution \nDigital and Wireless Technology Opportunity Act of 2003, because it \nprovides another opportunity to help expand the digital and \ntelecommunications infrastructure at the Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities in Mississippi. I always pay careful attention to \nlegislation that could be beneficial for higher education institutions \nin my state. In fact, earlier this year, I cosponsored an amendment to \nthe omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 2003 that authorizes \nadditional funding for grants to preserve and restore historic \nbuildings at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n\n[[Page S5509]]\n\n  Additionally, I would like to note an example of my ongoing \ncommitment to assist Mississippi's Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities in bridging the technology gap. In 2001, I worked with \nAllstate Insurance in their $17 million donation of a facility to \nestablish the Mississippi e-Center at Jackson State. The e-Center is an \nimpressive state-of-the-art complex with advanced computing and network \ninfrastructure, and information technology faculty and support staff. \nThrough the e-Center, Jackson State is able to fulfill its educational \nmission and leverage its unique strengths in the areas of remote \nsensing, engineering, and science and technology. I am also pleased to \nreport that Jackson State is the only Historically Black College or \nUniversity in the Nation with three supercomputers. We are making \nstrides in Mississippi to provide all our students with access to \ninformation technology, but the Nation still has much progress to make \nwhen it comes to providing these opportunities to our minority serving \ninstitutions of higher learning and all Americans.\n  It is clear that while our minority serving institutions of higher \nlearning stand ready to drive from the ``on ramp'' onto the Information \nSuperhighway, they still lag far behind other universities in America \nwhen adjusting to the new technological innovations and changes on the \nforefront, such as third generation technology. I urge the passage of \nthis legislation today so that we can hand some of America's best \ninstitutions of higher learning the technology keys they need to \ncompete with their peers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski.) Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, we were supposed to vote on this measure \nat noon. There is a question of whether or not we will be voting at \nnoon. There is a Holocaust Memorial Service at noon. At this moment, \nuntil we determine how we are going to correlate all of that, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 196, the \nDigital and Wireless Technology Program Act, which will provide $250 \nmillion annually for the next 5 years to address the technology needs \nof Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as colleges \nand universities that serve substantial numbers of Hispanic and Native \nAmerican students. The ``digital divide'' has been the subject of much \ndiscussion in both the public and private sectors, and this bipartisan \nbill, introduced by Senators Allen and Hollings, will help to bridge \nthat divide.\n  Internet access is an increasingly critical part of the educational \nprocess. The Internet provides a critical research tool, especially for \nstudents at institutions that cannot afford to offer world-class \nlibraries and other facilities. Indeed, internet access can be a great \ndemocratizing force if we can make it universal.\n  Although almost all Historically Black Colleges and Universities have \na campus network in place, only about half have computers available to \nstudents in their dormitories, and only 3 percent offer financial aid \nto students looking to buy a computer. In addition, a majority of these \nschools do not use high-speed connections, even when those connections \nare available in their areas. Additional funding for these colleges \nshould make a difference.\n  The schools struggling most mightily are those that serve Native \nAmerican students. Nearly 85 percent of students at tribal colleges \nlive at or below the poverty level, so few if any students can afford \ntheir own computers. But at Dull Knife Memorial College in Montana, 240 \nstudents must share two computers with internet access. Fewer than half \nof the 32 tribal colleges have access to a T-1 line. There are some \nsuccess stories, however, and with additional Federal assistance we can \ncreate more.\n  While I am concerned about the lack of internet access among minority \nstudents, I do hope that these colleges and universities will work \nclosely with their local communities in siting wireless facilities. The \n1996 Telecommunications Act regrettably cut out local communities in \ndeciding where new towers for wireless devices are located. The new \ngrant program created by this bill should not be used to exacerbate \nthis problem.\n  This issue is not new to the Senate. Senator Cleland introduced very \nsimilar legislation in the last Congress, and his bill was reported by \nthe Commerce committee. Regrettably, it was held up by the Republican \nleadership in the Senate, presumably in order to deny Senator Cleland \nany victory as he sought re-election. Given the dire state of many of \nthe schools this bill seeks to help, it is quite frustrating that \nSenator Cleland's bill fell victim to political machinations. It is \ndoubly unfortunate that suggestions to name this program after Senator \nCleland were rebuffed by the Republican side. It would have been a \nfitting tribute to the Senator who brought this and many other issues \nto the Senate's attention.\n  Despite my disappointment about that issue, however, I still believe \nthat this is a good bill that deserves every Senator's support. It will \nhelp institutions around our Nation provide the education that their \nstudents need and deserve.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back on S. 196. I believe all Senators--and I thank those who \nhave spoken in favor of this legislation: Senators McCain, Talent, \nDurbin, and Lott, as well as myself--who wanted to speak on the \nlegislation have.\n  Madam President, I yield back all time on S. 196. I also ask \nunanimous consent that the vote occur on passage at 1:30 p.m. today.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia has spoken with the majority leader, and the \nmajority leader is going to let this vote go for some time. It is my \nunderstanding there are people on both sides who are doing other \nthings--early and late--and this vote may have to be dragged for some \ntime.\n  Is that right?\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, that is correct. Due to \nthe Holocaust Memorial and a variety of other things that have arisen \nat noon, the vote will be at 1:30. But it will be held open. It will \nnot be a 15-minute vote. The vote will undoubtedly stay open for at \nleast a half an hour. And at 2 o'clock there is the top-secret briefing \nwith those officials from Defense.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, further reserving the right to object, as \nI indicated early today, I certainly think we should be in recess \nduring the Wolfowitz briefing, but there is a ranking member's meeting, \nfor example, that does not end until 2 o'clock. So I ask that there be \nsome consideration given to extending the vote for 5 or 10 minutes past \n2 o'clock.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I think that would be the intention. It \nis not just a Republican or Democrat scheduling conflict, and it will \nnot be a 15-minute vote as such. It will be held open until all Members \nwho are going to be here have an opportunity to vote on this measure.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am wondering if my friend would also \nallow me to modify the unanimous consent request, that following the \nclosure of the vote the Senate stand in recess until 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Nevada, that is \nunder consideration. I do not have the authority to make that decision. \nI suspect there will not be many people here. There are a variety of \nthings people need to do. And I certainly want to listen to Secretary \nWolfowitz, but at this point I do not have the authority to make that \ndecision. All I can say is, being patron of this measure, I want to \nmake sure everyone is allowed to vote on it, and the vote will be held \nopen.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n\n[[Page S5510]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

APPLICATION AND REVIEW PROCEDURE.\n\n       (a) In General.--To be eligible to receive a grant, \n     contract, or cooperative agreement under this Act, an \n     eligible institution shall submit an application to the \n     Director at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by \n     such information as the Director may reasonably require. The \n     Director, in consultation with the advisory council \n     established under subsection (b), shall establish a procedure \n     by which to accept and review such applications and publish \n     an announcement of such procedure, including a statement \n     regarding the availability of funds, in the Federal Register.\n       (b) Advisory Council.--The Director shall establish an \n     advisory council to advise the Director on the best \n     approaches for involving eligible institutions in the \n     activities described in section 3, and for reviewing and \n     evaluating proposals submitted to the program. In selecting \n     the members of the advisory council, the Director may consult \n     with representatives of appropriate organizations, including \n     representatives of eligible institutions, to ensure that the \n     membership of the advisory council reflects participation by \n     technology and telecommunications institutions, minority \n     businesses, eligible institution communities, Federal agency \n     personnel, and other individuals who are knowledgeable about \n     eligible institutions and technology issues. Any panel \n     assembled to review a proposal submitted to the program shall \n     include members from minority serving institutions. Program \n     review criteria shall include consideration of--\n       (1) demonstrated need for assistance under this Act; and\n       (2) diversity among the types of institutions receiving \n     assistance under this Act.\n       (c) Data Collection.--An eligible institution that receives \n     a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under section 2 \n     shall provide the Office with any relevant institutional \n     statistical or demographic data requested by the Office.\n       (d) Information Dissemination.--The Director shall convene \n     an annual meeting of eligible institutions receiving grants, \n     contracts, or cooperative agreements under section 2 for the \n     purposes of--\n       (1) fostering collaboration and capacity-building \n     activities among eligible institutions; and\n       (2) disseminating information and ideas generated by such \n     meetings.\n\n     SEC. 5. MATCHING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       The Director may not award a grant, contract, or \n     cooperative agreement to an eligible institution under this \n     Act unless such institution agrees that, with respect to the \n     costs to be incurred by the institution in carrying out the \n     program for which the grant, contract, or cooperative \n     agreement was awarded, such institution will make available \n     (directly or through donations from public or private \n     entities) non-Federal contributions in an amount equal to \\1/\n     4\\ of the\n\n[[Page S5511]]\n\n     amount of the grant, contract, or cooperative agreement \n     awarded by the Director, or $500,000, whichever is the lesser \n     amount. The Director shall waive the matching requirement for \n     any institution or consortium with no endowment, or an \n     endowment that has a current dollar value lower than \n     $50,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 6. LIMITATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--An eligible institution that receives a \n     grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under this Act that \n     exceeds $2,500,000, shall not be eligible to receive another \n     grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under this Act \n     until every other eligible institution that has applied for a \n     grant, contract, or cooperative agreement under this Act has \n     received such a grant, contract, or cooperative.\n       (b) Awards Administered by Eligible Institution.--Each \n     grant, contract, or cooperative agreement awarded under this \n     Act shall be made to, and administered by, an eligible \n     institution, even when it is awarded for the implementation \n     of a consortium or joint project.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \ngo into executive session to resume consideration of Executive Calendar \nNo. 86, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Priscilla Richman Owen, \nof Texas, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to speak about the nomination \nof Priscilla Owen. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for allowing \nme to go first.\n  I rise in opposition to the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the U.S. \nCourt of appeals for the Fifth Circuit. I know the President has the \nconstitutional responsibility to appoint Federal judges. I respect that \nright. In fact, I have voted for President Bush's judicial nominations \n97 percent of the time. Yet the Senate also has the constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent. We cannot rubberstamp \nnominations. Our courts are charged with safeguarding the very \nprinciples on which our country was built: justice, equality, \nindividual liberty, and the basic implicit right of privacy.\n  When I look at a nominee, I have three criteria: judicial competence, \npersonal integrity, and a commitment to core constitutional principles.\n  I carefully reviewed Judge Owen's rulings and opinions. I read the \ndissenting opinions of other judges and the views of legal scholars. I \nhave concluded that Judge Owen does not meet my criteria. Her decisions \nappear to be driven by ideology--not by law. She appears to be far \noutside the mainstream of judicial thinking, and her extreme and \nideological agenda would make her unsuitable to sit on the Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  What we are considering with an appellate nomination is a lifetime \nappointment for a court that is only one step below the Supreme Court. \nThe decisions made by this court have a lasting impact on the lives of \nall Americans for generations to come. This court's decisions will \naffect America's fundamental protections involving civil rights, \nindividual liberty, health, and safety, and the implicit right of \nprivacy. We need to be very careful about what we do.\n  That is why President Bush and all Presidents should nominate \ncompetent, moderate judges who reflect broad American values. No \nPresident should try to place ideologues on the court. If they do, I am \nconcerned that it will slow the pace of confirmations, backlog our \ncourts, and deny justice for too many Americans. Yet in nominating \nJudge Owen, the President has chosen someone with an extreme \nideological agenda on civil rights, individual rights, and the rights \nof privacy.\n  Judge Owen has pursued an extreme activist agenda. Can anyone be \nsurprised that this nomination has so many flashing yellow lights?\n  When President Bush discussed what would be his criteria for \nnominating judges, he said his standard for judicial nominees would be \nthat they ``share a commitment to follow and apply the law, not to make \nlaw from the bench.''\n  We applaud that criteria from the President. But I must say when we \nlook at Priscilla Owen, that is exactly what she does. She makes law \nand does not limit herself to interpreting law, and, therefore, fails \nthe President's own criteria.\n  The Texas court-watching journal, Juris Publici, said that Owen is a \n``conservative judicial activist.'' That means she has a consistent \npattern of putting her ideology above the law and ignoring statutory \nlanguage and substituting her own views.\n\n  She has offered over 16 significant activist opinions and joined 15 \nothers. Even White House counsel Judge Alberto Gonzales, who served \nwith Judge Owen on the Texas Supreme Court, once called her dissent in \nthe case ``unconscionable . . . judicial activist.''\n  In a different case, Judge Gonzales called a dissent by Judge Owen an \nattempt to ``judicially amend'' a Texas statute. A number of dissents \nshe wrote or joined in would have effectively rewritten or disregarded \nthe law usually to the detriment of ordinary citizens.\n  An example: Quantum Chemical Corp v. Toennies was a case concerning \nage discrimination based on a civil rights statute. The majority of the \nTexas Supreme Court found for the plaintiff. Owen's dissent stated that \nthe plaintiff needed to show that discrimination was a motivating \nfactor. Her dissent would have changed Texas law and\n\n[[Page S5512]]\n\nweakened Texas civil rights protections.\n  On the issue of individual rights to seek justice, I think we all \nbelieve the courthouse door must always be open. When you walk through \nthat door, you must find an independent judiciary. Yet Owen's rulings \nshow a bias against the rights of consumers, victims, and individuals. \nShe has consistently ruled against workers, accident victims, and \nvictims of discrimination. These decisions would impair the rights of \nordinary people from having access to the courts to obtain justice.\n  In Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, a case concerning \na teacher whose contract was not renewed, the teacher requested a \nhearing, which is allowed under the Texas Education Code. The hearing \nexaminer found that the school district didn't have a justification to \nfire the teacher and said her contract should be renewed. The school \nboard fired her.\n  The majority of the Texas Supreme Court found the school board went \nover its legal authority, and Judge Owen's dissent ignored the language \nand it would have weakened the rights of this teacher and all of those \nbefore the court. The majority of the court found that Owen's dissent \nshowed ``disregard of the procedural elements the legislation \nestablished to ensure the hearing examiner's process is fair and \nefficient for both teachers and school boards.''\n  On the right to privacy, zealous opposition to women's rights to \nchoose is a hallmark of Judge Owen's legal rulings. She used her \nposition on the Texas Supreme Court to restrict women's rights to \nchoose by ignoring the statute to create additional barriers for women \nseeking an abortion. Her opinions have been biased and unfair.\n  An example: Texas law requires that a minor's parent be notified \nbefore she can obtain an abortion. Many of us agree with that. But we \nalso agree with the fact that there is a judicial bypass enabling a \nmature, well-informed minor to obtain a court order permitting abortion \nwithout parental notification, which in several cases Judge Owen \ndissented vigorously from the majority of the court. That would have \nresulted in the rewriting of Texas law to place more hurdles in front \nof minors.\n  In Jane Doe, the majority actually included an extremely unusual \nsection explaining the proper role of judges admonishing the dissent, \nincluding Owen's duty to interpret the law and not attempt to create \npolicy. Judge Owen has ignored the law, seeking to impose new and \nimpossibly high standards for minors who seek abortions.\n\n  Based on her rulings and written arguments, I can only conclude that \nJudge Owen would use her position to undermine existing laws and the \nconstitutional protection of a woman's right to choose. When you do \nthat, you undermine the principles related to the implicit right of \nprivacy.\n  Also very troubling to me is that in her opinions Judge Owen has \noften substituted her authority for that of civil juries. She has a \nconsistent and persistent pattern of overriding juries' decisions. When \nthe jury has taken a position of awarding claims to accident victims \nand victims of discrimination, Judge Owen has tried to undermine them.\n  In Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Company v. Martinez, in a product liability \nsuit brought by a man who was severely injured when a tire he was \nworking on exploded, a jury found in favor of the plaintiff. A key \nissue was whether the manufacturer could be held liable because it knew \nof a safer alternative product design.\n  The majority of the Texas Supreme Court sided with the jury's \nverdict. But Owen dissented. Had her opinion prevailed, it would have \noverturned a jury verdict.\n  I could give example after example after example. I am not going to \ngo on just for the sake of going on. There are others who wish to \nspeak. I believe we should have full debate on the Owen nomination.\n  Let me conclude by saying that the President does have the right to \nnominate judges, but I cannot consent to the nomination of Judge Owen. \nMy advice to the President is to give us moderate judges. We have \napproved of many of them. We want to be supportive. But in this \ninstance, she is so far outside the mainstream of judicial thinking.\n  My advice to the President is to withdraw the nomination and appoint \na nominee who will fairly interpret the law for all Americans, and \nfollow the Bush test of interpreting the law and not making the law.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I listened to my colleague from Maryland \nand appreciate her comments. Let me make a couple of additional \ncomments with respect to this issue of judgeships.\n  I have spoken previously on the floor of the Senate about the Estrada \nnomination. What I indicated then was that Mr. Estrada, who aspires to \nhave a lifetime seat on the second highest court in the country, the DC \nCircuit Court, did not answer basic questions put to him by the \nJudiciary Committee at his hearing.\n  The administration has not released the information that has been \nrequested by Members of the Senate with respect to Mr. Estrada's work \nat the Solicitor General's Office. That is information that has been \nrequested of him and the administration so we might understand a bit \nmore about Mr. Estrada and his qualifications. Despite the fact that \nMr. Estrada did not answer the basic questions at his hearing, the \nadministration has not released the information that has been requested \nof his nomination.\n  There are some in the Senate--and perhaps some in the country--who \nbelieve there is a requirement for the Senate to proceed in any event \nto give Mr. Estrada his vote. There is no such requirement.\n  The Constitution provides the mechanism by which we give citizens of \nthis country lifetime appointments to the judiciary on the Federal \nbench. And that Constitution provides two steps: One, the President \nshall propose, by sending a nomination to the Senate; and, second, the \nSenate shall advise and consent, by deciding whether they wish this \ncandidate to have a lifetime appointment on the Federal bench. It is \nnot some entitlement that any President--Republican or Democratic--has \nto be able to send a nomination to the Senate and have that nomination \nautomatically considered. In fact, in recent years, this particular \ncircuit court, the DC Circuit Court, has had a number of nominations \nsent to the Senate from another President of a different party, and the \nSenate not only did not bring it to the floor, the candidates did not \neven get a hearing--not a 5-minute hearing--let alone a hearing and a \nvote in the committee and then going to the floor and having a vote.\n  Those candidates never even got a hearing. Mr. Estrada got a hearing. \nHe received the hearing I think he should have received, but he did not \nanswer the questions at the hearing. And the administration and Mr. \nEstrada have not provided information requested of him. Therefore, Mr. \nEstrada's nomination is not proceeding.\n  The Members of the Senate have the right, and perhaps the obligation, \nif they choose, to stop a nomination they think represents a nomination \noffered by a President trying to stack the judiciary or pack the \njudiciary with those of a certain extreme philosophy. It is not out of \nbounds for any group of Senators to decide to say to the President: \nThis is a partnership. You propose; we dispose. You nominate; we \nprovide advice and consent.\n  In order to have candidates on the Federal bench, they have to be \ncandidates who are going to be approved by the Senate. I expect a \nRepublican President will nominate Republican judges. In North Dakota, \nwe have had two recent open judgeships--one in Bismarck, one in Fargo. \nBoth judgeships have now been filled by Republican judges. I am a \nDemocrat. I supported both candidates. Both are exceptionally well \nqualified. I am proud of both of them. They have both assumed their \nduties. I voted for both. I told the President I fully supported both. \nThat is the way this process should work.\n\n  Regrettably, it is not working that way with respect to some \nnominations. The White House, instead, is saying: We intend to strain \ncandidates through a philosophical filter, and notwithstanding what we \nthink might or might not happen in the Senate, we are going to send \npeople to the Senate who are to the far edge of the philosophical \nspectrum. If the Senate does not like it, tough luck; we are somehow \ngoing\n\n[[Page S5513]]\n\nto auger up a lot of noise around the country that says the Senate has \nan obligation to proceed. We have no such obligation. The President and \nthe Senate have an obligation in this partnership to make sure we get \ngood judges on the Federal bench.\n  I just want everyone to be clear, I have voted for almost all of the \nnominations for Federal judges sent to us by the President. I voted, I \nbelieve, for 112 of them. I have only voted against a very few. I \nintend to support most of the President's nominees.\n  But when the President sends us the nomination of a candidate whose \npositions are well off the norm, way off to the side of the \nphilosophical chart, we have every right--in fact, an obligation--to \nmake our judgment known in the Senate. That is what is going to happen \nif Mr. Gonzales and President Bush decide they are going to try to \nstack or pack, as it were, circuit judgeships with candidates for those \njudgeships who philosophically are not anywhere near the center of \nRepublican and Democratic philosophies in this country.\n  In any event, I just wanted to make that point. I think the comments \nmade by the Senator from Maryland are right on point, and I hope at \nsome point we are able to move ahead.\n  We have another Hispanic judge who has been waiting who has been \ncleared on the Judiciary Committee. We are wondering why that judge is \nnot on the floor. He should be on the floor. Perhaps his nomination is \ncoming to the floor, but we have been calling for that. I believe the \nminority leader yesterday asked unanimous consent to bring that \njudgeship to the floor. He has the support of most everyone.\n\n\n                  Free Trade Agreement With Singapore\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, on Thursday of next week, U.S. officials \nwill sign a trade agreement with Singapore. It will be the first free \ntrade agreement that is negotiated under so-called fast track. Fast \ntrack, incidentally, is a procedure that the Senate adopted in a \nByzantine way. They did it without my vote, but enough Senators did it \nso that we have a fast-track procedure, which is a guarantee that your \ntrade negotiators can go overseas, go in a closed room, close the door, \nkeep the public out, and then you reach a negotiation with another \ncountry.\n  When you bring it back to the Senate, we will agree that none of us \nwill be able to offer any amendment at any time. What we have said is, \nbring us a straitjacket so we can put it on and we can all grin.\n  It makes no sense. That is what the Senate has done. So now we will \nhave a free trade agreement coming back to the Senate, the first one \nunder the so-called fast-track procedure, and it is done with the \ncountry of Singapore.\n  Let me read what is in the trade agreement, just one piece. There are \nmany, and I will talk about them in future days. All of this is cloaked \nin language that is hard to understand, but the implications are not \nhard to understand because it is related to American jobs. It all \nrelates to waving goodbye to American manufacturing jobs. Article 32, \ntreatment of certain products, under chapter 3: A party shall consider \na good listed in annex 2 when imported into its territory from the \nterritory of another port to be an originating good. Within 6 months \nafter entry into force of the agreement, the parties shall meet to \nexplore the expansion of the product coverage of annex 2.\n  This sounds like six or eight people sitting around drinking, but \nthese are pretty smart people who have reached a trade agreement. This \nis the way they write it: A party shall consider a good listed in annex \n2 when imported into its territory from the territory of another party \nto be an originating good.\n  What does that mean? What that means is that, in the circumstances of \na free trade agreement with Singapore, products such as electronics, \nsemiconductors, computers, telecommunications equipment, cell phones, \nfiber cables, optical cables, photocopy equipment, medical instruments, \nappliances, a wide range of high-tech products can come in through the \nfree trade agreement with Singapore, even if they are not produced \nthere. If they are produced elsewhere, they come through Singapore and \ncome into this country under a free trade agreement.\n  It is fascinating to me that in the last 12 years we have lost 2 \nmillion jobs. I am not talking about decreasing the rate of growth of \njobs. This country has lost over 2 million jobs. We are off negotiating \nnew trade agreements--and, incidentally, proposing new fiscal policies \nthat will exacerbate the loss of jobs with huge Federal deficits--and \nwe say to other countries, by the way, we will give you a special deal. \nWe don't care much about providing basic protection of fair competition \nfor America's domestic manufacturers. We will give you a special deal.\n  The special deal is this, Singapore: You can move goods through \nSingapore, high-tech goods, the product of high-skilled labor, good \njobs. You can move them through Singapore through a free trade \nagreement into the United States and displace American jobs. That is \nwhat this says.\n  In every single circumstance we have negotiated trade agreements--\nUnited States-Canada, NAFTA, the WTO--in agreement after agreement, we \nhave said to American workers and companies producing goods, we want \nyou to compete with others overseas that don't have to meet any basic \nstandards. It doesn't matter if the country will not allow them to \norganize as workers, if they don't have worker rights, if they hire \nkids, work them 16 hours a day, pay them 16 cents an hour. That doesn't \nmatter. They should be able to produce those products, these agreements \nsay, and run them through Singapore, some other country, run them \nthrough Mexico, for that matter, and move them into Toledo and \nPittsburgh and Bismarck and Los Angeles and Pierre, and then have \nAmerican workers and businesses compete with that labor.\n  What does it mean? It means we can't compete. Is there an American \nworker who decides they can compete against 16-cents-an-hour labor \nperformed by a 14-year-old who works 16 hours a day in a plant where \nthey don't have basic safety standards, where they can pump pollution \ninto the air and water; is there anybody who can compete with that? The \nanswer is no. And they should not be expected to.\n  This Singapore free trade agreement is coming here under fast track. \nWe cannot offer amendments. There isn't one single parliamentary step \nthat will be missed as we move to try to consider this. When they sign \nthis next Thursday--and they certainly should not sign it with this \nprovision in it; this is a loophole big enough to drive a semi truck \nthrough--let them understand that there will be no unanimous consent \nagreement for anything under any circumstance at any step of the way to \nget this considered by the Senate.\n  They will get it considered, no doubt, and no doubt those Senators \nwho decided they would like to put themselves in the straitjacket and \nprevent themselves from offering an amendment--God forbid they should \ntry to correct this--they will vote for it. And no doubt the Senate \nwill ratify this free trade agreement. I am just serving notice that it \nis going to take some time. We will have some lengthy discussion about \nit.\n  There is no justification, in my judgment, for this kind of nonsense. \nI will come to the floor in a day or so to also talk about China. We \ndid a bilateral trade agreement with them 2 years ago that has not \nmeant a thing. It is like spitting in a high wind. They agreed to \neverything so they could join the World Trade Organization. We have a \n$103 billion trade deficit with China. Our jobs have been exported.\n  The fact is, China has not done what they said they would do in the \nbilateral agreement. And nobody seems to care. We have all these \nbureaucrats running around, most of them negotiating incompetent trade \nagreements. We have a few of them down at the Department of Commerce \nwho are supposed to enforce the trade agreements.\n  Take a look at what we have. We have this miserable skeleton of an \nenforcement unit. We have no more than a dozen people who are supposed \nto enforce the trade agreements in China. If you gave them a pop quiz, \nthey would not have the foggiest idea of what is in the agreements, let \nalone enforce them. I think we have a growing scandal with the \nimbalance in Chinese trade, especially since we had a bilateral \nagreement 2 years ago with them and they have complied with none of it.\n\n[[Page S5514]]\n\n  Madam President, I want to serve notice on the Singapore free trade \nagreement that there is a lot to fix in this agreement. It doesn't mean \na thing when people such as I talk about this because our trade \nnegotiators don't care; they don't see; they are in their little \ncocoon, and they will negotiate, and the success of their life is \nreaching an agreement--even if it is bad. They did a bad agreement with \nCanada, with NAFTA, and with the WTO, and a bad agreement with \nSingapore. Apparently, they have not done a bad one with Chile yet \nbecause we didn't know where they stood on Iraq. The fact is, it is \ntime for them to stop doing bad agreements and time for them, on behalf \nof American workers and companies, to say we demand and insist on fair \ntrade. That certainly will not be the case with respect to the \nagreements we expect in future free trade deals, with respect to labor \nprotections and a whole range of issues in the Singapore agreement.\n\n\n                        The Size of the Tax Cut\n\n  Madam President, I want to talk for a moment about the front-page \nissue every day these days, and that is how big will be the tax cut. \nThat misses the point. Our press almost always reports all this as a \nhorserace. It is never much about the horse or jockey; it is about who \nis ahead down the stretch. Does he or doesn't he have the support to \nget 350, 550, or 750? What would be much more important would be to \nhave a report that talked about: What does this really mean for our \ncountry? What are the experts really saying? What are the consequences? \nWhere will this come from? Now, a tax cut.\n  Well, we have lost slightly more than 2.6 million jobs in the last \nnearly 2 \\1/2\\ years, and that is unusual because in the last 50 years \nevery single administration has seen a growth in jobs--some less than \nothers; nonetheless, a growth. We have, in this circumstance, lost \njobs--2.6 million in 2 \\1/2\\ years.\n  You can make a case--and I think part of it is valid--that we had 9/\n11, the war on terror, the war in Iraq, the technology bubble bust, the \ncollapse of the stock market, the bursting of the tech bubble, and we \nhad the largest corporate scandals in the history of the country. So \nyou can make a pretty good case that all of these things intersecting \nat the same time have caused a lot of havoc with this country and our \neconomy.\n  But it is the easiest lifting in American politics for any politician \nat any time to say: Do you know what I stand for? I stand perpetually \nfor reducing taxes and tax cuts.\n  If, in fact, cutting taxes always creates jobs, sign me up for $2 \ntrillion in tax cuts. Just sign me up. Then I think the President's \n$700 billion proposal of permanent tax cuts is way too short. If this \nin fact creates jobs, let's do $4 trillion in tax cuts. But we know \nwhat is happening here. We know that 2 years ago we were told if we had \nvery large tax cuts, and Congress voted for them, what we would be \ndoing was giving back surpluses that would exist in our budget as long \nas 10 years down the line, as far as the eye could see. So the Congress \nsupported very large permanent tax cuts. I did not, because I said at \nthe time I thought we should do them on a temporary basis, in order to \nbe a business conservative, and then figure out what is going to happen \nin the future.\n\n  What if something happens? It did. We found ourselves in a recession, \na war, the bubble burst, and corporate scandals. Congress said: The \nheck with that; we see surpluses forever. Two years later, we have \nprojections by all economists that we are going to have deficits \nforever. Even the President's budget has deficits predicted for 10 \nstraight years. The President's budget--which was on our desks right \nhere, and the Senate voted for it--said let's increase the Federal \nindebtedness from $6 trillion to $12 trillion in 10 years.\n  I am not making that up. It is on page 6 of the Budget Act that the \nSenate voted for and the President supported. It is what he wanted. \nLet's double the Federal debt. Now they say let's have very large tax \ncuts. Where do they come from? Every single dollar of the tax cut is to \nbe borrowed. So we send our sons and daughters to war; and then we say: \nBy the way, when you come back, you are going to pay the bill because \nwe are not paying for that.\n  Just yesterday, the Wall Street Journal pointed out that the Federal \nGovernment will need to borrow $79 billion in this quarter. That is a \nreversal of the more than $100 billion that was estimated for this \nquarter. So we missed the economic results by $100 billion in this \nquarter. I think the Government spends too much in a range of areas. I \nthink we ought to cut spending. I think we ought to make sure that \nthose things that improve the lives of people in this country are the \nthings in which we invest. I think we ought to make sure we deal with \neducation, health care, roads, and the kinds of things that represent \ninfrastructure that make this a great country.\n  But having said all that, I think to borrow $6 trillion more in 10 \nyears in order to provide tax cuts, the bulk of which will go to the \nlargest income earners in the country--if you do that, look at the \neconomic data. They say if you earn $1 million a year, good, you are \nlucky because you are going to get an $80,000-a-year tax cut with the \nPresident's plan, on average. At this point, when we are choking on red \nink and proposing to double the Federal debt from $6 trillion to $12 \ntrillion, do we think those who earn a million dollars a year, on \naverage, should receive an $80,000 a year tax cut? I don't think so. \nThat ought not be the priority.\n  The very first priority might be to reduce the Federal debt and get \nour fiscal house in order; second, to invest in those things that make \nlife worthwhile, improve our schools, do a range of things like that. \nIn addition to that, we should, as many colleagues say, cut spending in \nareas where we spend too much--and there are plenty of them.\n  I find it bizarre that we are having a national discussion about this \nwithout any requirement for their being specific. If you want, at a \ntime when we have very large budget deficits, to reduce the tax revenue \nby $550 billion or $750 billion over 10 years, then what don't you want \nto do? Do you want to increase defense spending? That is going to \nhappen. Increase homeland security spending? That is going to happen. \nHave very large tax cuts? That is going to happen. So what don't you \nwant to do? What is it in domestic discretionary spending? Educating \nour kids? Making sure grandma and grandpa have access to adequate \nhealth care? Having safe neighborhoods? What is it you don't want to do \nin that batch? How about building roads and bridges to make sure we \nhave a good infrastructure? What is it you don't want to do? I think \nthat is a question that needs to be answered.\n\n  Madam President, it is not answered by anybody. All the reporting is \non the horserace--who is ahead coming around the turn? Does the \nPresident have the vote or not? Is this Senator or that Senator finally \ngoing to turn or relent? That is not the issue.\n  Take a look at the best economic thinkers in this country, 10 Nobel \nlaureates, and ask them what they think of this country's economic \nfuture if we don't have some basic fiscal responsibility. I come from a \nsmall town, with 380 people or so. It has shrunk a bit since then. But \nmost people in America's towns and cities think about all this in \npractical, candid terms, making sure it adds up. They say let's handle \nthis as a business or a family.\n  Well, let's do that then. If you are short of revenue, do you want to \ncut your revenue further and increase spending? How does that add up? I \ndidn't take higher math, but I learned that 1 plus 1 equals 2 in \nKansas, in North Dakota, in New York, and all over the country--except \nin fiscal policy in Washington, DC, where 1 plus 1 equals 3, and \napparently $12 trillion in additional debt. That is not a fiscal \npolicy, in my judgment, that is good for my kids, your kids, or \nAmerica's kids.\n  I am not saying one party is all right or wrong. I am saying this: \nThere isn't any way we can reconcile this with what is happening in the \ncountry today. We have turned the largest surplus in American history \ninto the largest deficits. Yes, you can make a case that a lot of \nthings have happened that have intervened to make that happen that are \noutside of the control of the Congress and the President; yes, that is \ntrue. But if that is the case, then should we not recognize that? If 9/\n11 says we need more spending for homeland security, we just charge it \nto the future and say, well, we need to do that, but let's have tax \ncuts, too. If 9/11 says and Iraq means we need more\n\n[[Page S5515]]\n\nmoney for defense spending, we say, let's just charge that and we will \nhave tax cuts, too. One way or another this has to be reconciled.\n\n  I am in favor of some tax cuts. I would like to see some tax cuts. I \nthink the American people would like tax cuts. But when someone says \nlet's have the American people keep more of their own money, the answer \nto that on the reverse side of the same coin is let's charge more to \nthe American people because they are going to have to pay for it. One \ncan argue trade deficits are going to have to be paid by a lower \nstandard of living in this country, but our kids and grandkids are \ngoing to pay for a fiscal policy deficit. It is a selfish fiscal \npolicy, in my judgment, and one we ought to reverse.\n  We ought to try to call on the best of what both parties have to \noffer this country, not the worst of each. In my judgment, the best \nboth parties have to offer this country is some basic conservative \nvalues of saying let's do what is right to invest in what makes this a \ngood country and at the same time let's pay for that which we want to \nconsume. Let's have a fiscal policy that says to every American, this \nadds up. Let's say to our kids we are not going to have them shoulder \nthe burden of what we are doing today. That is what our fiscal policy \nought to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I will speak to the pending business, \nwhich is the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the circuit court of \nappeals. She is a highly qualified person who really needs to be \nrecognized. We need to move through this rapidly.\n  The last 2 years, I was honored to be able to serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee. We held extensive hearings on Priscilla Owen to be a circuit \ncourt judge. She went through those hearings in an extraordinary \nfashion. It was a learning experience. It was as if a professor was \nthere teaching and going through with us, here is how I decided this \ncase, here is hornbook law on this, here is how this should be decided, \nhere is how I viewed the issue. She really has a fine-tuned legal mind. \nI was impressed by the legal mind she has.\n  I was impressed by the common sense she had with it as well. It was \nas if this was a highly trained legal mind well adapted to being able \nto judge, but also with a sense of values of the people, which is as \none would expect because she was elected to the Texas Supreme Court. \nShe has been around the public. She knows how people think.\n  When a lot of people look at the judiciary in the United States, they \ndo not feel like they get a sensible approach to judging a fair amount \nof time. She is an extraordinary person to have both that depth of \nmental training and ability and a sensible touch that the people really \ndesire and want to have in somebody on the judiciary.\n  What I am most distressed about is it appears as if now we are going \nto get our second filibuster of a circuit court judge from the \nDemocratic Party. In the past, we have not had filibusters of judges. \nWe have had them at a Supreme Court level but not the circuit or \ndistrict court level. Now it appears as if we are going to get our \nsecond filibuster of a judge in a matter of a couple of months. This, \nof course, is to raise the vote standard so she does not have to get 51 \nvotes, she has to get 60 votes to be able to go on the circuit court of \nappeals.\n  This is not advice and consent of the Senate, which is what our \nstandard is held to. We are to give advice and consent on judges. They \nshould be appointed by the administration and then there should be \nadvice and consent. That should be a 51-vote margin. It should not be a \n60-vote margin that now the other side is attempting to establish. This \nis a very distressing situation we are getting into.\n  How many more judges are we going to see like that who are nominated \nfor the circuit court? Are we going to continue to put them forward and \nthe other side will say we are going to filibuster for whatever reason? \nHow many of these is it to be?\n  I recognize what the strategy is. It is to keep the circuit court \nreduced of judges, not to allow this President to appoint his judges, \nnot to allow him to put his print upon the judiciary. I recognize that \nis what is happening on the other side of the aisle, but when they do \nthat, one needs to recognize the long-term policy implications of so \ndoing. Now they are saying a President cannot appoint his or her judges \nto the bench; that when they were elected and selected by the people of \nthe United States, now they cannot appoint people to the court; that \nthe other party, if they can control 51 votes, can block the President. \nThis is not about advice and consent. It is about blocking a President \nfrom appointing his judges to the Federal bench.\n  We have not seen this strategy before. It was always the President \nputs forward his nominees, we hold hearings, and then if they can be \nblocked with 51 votes, they are blocked, but not filibustering of \ncircuit court judges. This is a dangerous area.\n\n  On the other hand, we could say the other party is looking at this \nsaying this represents a two-fer for us: We cannot only block the \nPresident from getting his judges on the bench, we can block the Senate \nfrom doing other business.\n  We do not normally take weeks on end to do a Federal circuit court \nnominee, but that is what we are ending up doing with Miguel Estrada \nand now with Priscilla Owen. We are spending weeks on end of Senate \nfloor time on a circuit court judge. That is not how the system is set \nup.\n  These nominations should be taking a couple of hours, at most, for \ndebate and voting, and then we should be moving on and debating fiscal \nstimulus, how do we get this economy growing, how do we create more \njobs. We have a number of issues in regard to rural development. How do \nwe get more people to move out into rural areas of Kansas. We have \nplenty of issues on foreign policy to debate. What about the new Iraqi \nleadership? What about the relationship of the United States to the \nU.N.? There is a whole litany of issues we could be taking floor time \nup with, but instead we are on circuit court judges that should be \ndebated in an hour or two, voted up or down by advice and consent of \nthe Senate, as it says in the Constitution, and moving forward. We are \ntaking up valuable time instead, weeks on end, with circuit court \njudges that should have a clear vote up or down.\n  This hurts the country on two fronts. It hurts on the judiciary, on \nnot having the people appointed to the bench that we need to have, and \nit hurts us by not being able to do other business we should be focused \non in the Senate. That is not a useful way for us to conduct business \nin the Senate.\n  I urge the other side of the aisle to please step forward and stop \nthe filibuster of circuit court judges. That is not the way we need to \noperate to be able to get the business done.\n  On top of that, we have circuit courts around the country that in \nsome cases have only half of the judges that are necessary. The other \nhalf have resigned or left office and so we have enormous vacancies. \nSome people would say they like it that way because then two circuit \ncourt judges can pick a third one--maybe it is two liberal circuit \ncourt judges can pick a district court judge, bring them up to a three-\njudge panel to have a liberal-leaning panel and we can set policy and \nset law that way. But that is not the way the system is set to operate, \neven though it does operate that way. We really need to move forward in \nthis area.\n  I do not normally come to the floor to harangue about what is taking \nplace in the judiciary, but in this case this is beyond the pale. This \nis not what should be taking place. It is hurting us and it is hurting \nthe country.\n\n\n                          Growing The Economy\n\n  I will take a minute or two to address some of the topics that came \nup about the economy. We need to get this economy growing and going. I \nwill make a couple of brief observations.\n  At the Federal level, we have two major tools to grow the economy. We \nhave monetary policy and we have fiscal policy. Monetary policy is set \nby the Fed, not by the Congress but by the Fed. The Fed can set \ninterest rates high or low, control the supply of money. The Fed is \ndoing the exact right thing to grow the economy today with low interest \nrates. That is as it should be.\n  On the other side of that is fiscal policy, and that is what the \nCongress does. We have tools at our disposal to try to grow the \neconomy. One of the major tools is tax policy. Do we increase taxes, do \nwe decrease taxes, in a way to stimulate the economy?\n\n[[Page S5516]]\n\n  The most stimulative tool that is available to us is to lower tax \nrates. That grows the economy. It grew the economy when President \nReagan cut taxes. It grew the economy when President Kennedy cut taxes. \nThat is the way the economy grows.\n  Some people would say, look at the deficit we are in now; we cannot \nafford to reduce the taxes at this point in time. I would answer, we \ncannot afford not to reduce taxes to stimulate the economy. In the last \n2 years, we have seen a reduction in Federal receipts of 9 percent, and \nan increase of Federal expenditures of around 12 percent. Quick math \ntells us we are going to be in a real problem when we have those two \ntrend lines.\n  The Federal receipts have gone down 9 percent. That is not as a \nresult of changes of tax policy. That is a result of the economy being \nsoft and not producing the economic lift and push we need. And, \nfrankly, the rest of the world needs a strong and robust U.S. economy \nas well.\n  How do we get the economy going again? We need to stimulate growth \nwith tax cuts. I will give one quick fact. Last year we saw a reduction \nin capital gains tax receipts of about $80 billion. There has been $80 \nbillion in loss in capital gains tax receipts. That is not the result \nof a tax policy shift. That is primarily the result of the stock market \nfalling dramatically the last couple of years, the tech boom going \nbust, problems and fears of what has taken place around the world, 9/\n11, a series of things where people pulled funds out of the market; \ninstead of having capital gains, they had capital losses.\n  Some say the stock market does not affect most people. Yet half of \nAmericans have some investment or retirement tied into the stock \nmarket. What can we do there? We can do away with that double taxation \nof corporate dividends as a way to stimulate investment and stimulate \ngrowth in the stock market. Plus, it is just good tax policy to not tax \nsomething twice.\n  What about balancing the budget? I have been a part of a Congress \nthat has balanced the budget. I came to the House of Representatives in \n1994. One of our major pushes was to balance the budget, which had not \nbeen done since 1969, and then it was actually an accounting move that \nallowed us to balance the budget in 1969. It had not been done for 20 \nyears prior to that, but from 1969 until we balanced it about 5 years \nago, the budget had not been balanced.\n  One of our key pushes was to balance the budget. So I have been a \npart of a Congress that has actually balanced the budget. It is the \nCongress that balances the budget. We are the ones who write the \nchecks. The administration, the Presidency, spends the money. They can \nspend less if they choose in some situations, but we are the ones who \nactually authorize and appropriate.\n  How do we balance the budget? I think we have found the formula for \ndoing it. We grow the economy and we restrain your growth in Federal \nspending until the lines intersect and you get the economy growing \nstrong, and then you restrain your growth in Federal spending until \nthose intersect. That is how we balance the budget. We had a growing \neconomy, but instead of spending this increase in Federal receipts, we \nrestrained the growth of Federal spending and those intersected and we \ngot 3 years of significantly balanced budgets, done by a Republican \nCongress. That is how you get it done.\n\n  What is our key now? Our key now is to get the economy growing, cut \ntaxes to stimulate the growth, and restrain the growth of Federal \nspending. I put forward a bill with several people as one way of \nrestraining Federal spending, to create a domestic program equivalent \nto the Base Closure Commission. We have a Base Closure Commission that \nhas been very successful saying we have too many military bases; we \nneed to eliminate some of those, consolidate them in fewer areas. To \nremove one or two at a time is an impossible task. So we have a \ncommission that recommends 50 closures taking place and gives Congress \none vote up or down whether to eliminate the bases altogether. It has \nbeen very successful in consolidating resources.\n  What about doing that in domestic discretionary programs where we \nhave thousands of domestic discretionary programs? Have a commission to \nsay these 100 were good when they started, but the reason for their \ncreation has gone. They are effective but not yielding as much as they \nshould. These 100 should be eliminated. The commission reports to \nCongress and requires Congress to vote up or down whether they agree or \ndisagree, eliminate all 100 or keep all 100. It is a domestic Base \nClosure Commission equivalent type of program, so we can try to \nrestrain some of the growth in Federal spending, consolidate it in \nfewer areas. Those are the sorts of things we need to do to balance the \nbudget and get our spending under control.\n  We also need trade agreements to take place. I point out that \nPresidents of both parties have requested trade promotion authority and \ntrade agreements. You cannot negotiate with another country and say, \nOK, give us your best offer and then do that; and then say, OK, we have \nto take it to the Congress, which may agree or disagree, and they will \namend it and we will come back to you again. That sort of trade \nagreement does not work. The other country says: We want to wait and \nsee your final offer. That is why the trade promotion authority is in \nplace.\n  Trade has been good for this country and has expanded jobs and \neconomic opportunities in the United States. It has been the right \nthing for us to do.\n\n\n                              War In Iraq\n\n  I end with a personal comment about how the Bush administration has \nconducted the war in Iraq and the followon. I think one has to \ncompliment this administration and the soldiers in the field for the \nway they have conducted this activity. Agree or disagree with going to \nIraq, in the first place, we have liberated the people, the face of \nliberty of Baghdad looks the same as the face of liberty in Berlin when \nthey see liberty. It has a beautiful face, to see liberty and see them \nkissing and hugging our soldiers developing liberty and finding a \ntreasure trove of information of terroristic activities to make the \nworld a freer place.\n  We have to compliment and say God bless the soldiers who have been \nover there, and we say thank you to them and to this administration for \ntaking so bold a step forward for liberty in a tough region of the \nworld, in Iraq.\n  I hope they continue to press for liberty in places such as North \nKorea against Kim Jong Il and his regime--this is the 50th year of the \narmistice we signed with North Korea--which has oppressed its own \npeople. In North Korea you have a regime that exports missiles, \ntechnology around the world, that has a third of its people living on \ninternational food donations, many of them starving, walking out of the \ncountry. We think somewhere between 20,000 and 300,000 have walked from \nNorth Korea into China. We have a regime that operates a gulag system \nin North Korea, continues to operate a Soviet-style gulag. We have a \nregime there that imports millions of dollars a year in luxury cars and \nalcohol and tobacco. So while their own people by the millions starve, \nthe regime that sits on top drives around in a Mercedes Benz, drinks \nfine wines, and smokes fine tobaccos.\n  When you turn the rock over in North Korea you will see the same, if \nnot worse, type of deplorable living conditions for the people, and \nextraordinary situations of high-life living for the elite. I have no \ndoubt from what we know already what has taken place in that regime. We \nwill see a level of depravity from liberty and from the basics of human \nlife from the North Korean people that would rival any on the planet. I \nhope the administration keeps the pressure on Kim Jong Il and his \ndecrepit Stalinist regime so that the 22 million people of North Korea \ncan one day be free.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Nomination Of Edward C. Prado\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the Democratic leader \nand assistant Democratic leader for going to bat for Judge Edward \nPrado. They\n\n[[Page S5517]]\n\napparently are now working on an arrangement, that I understand is \nclose to being worked out with the Republican leadership, so this \nnomination can be considered without further delay. I appreciate the \nfact that the majority leader and the deputy majority leader, Senator \nMcConnell, are going to work with us to do that.\n  As I have noted on the floor before, basically before the recess, and \nsince, we had checked on our side of the aisle and knew that nobody \nobjected to going forward with a vote on Judge Prado. In fact, I \nsuspect most are going to vote for him. I was not quite able to figure \nout why there was objection on the Republican side to going forward \nwith his nomination. So I thank the leaders for now getting together so \nhe will be allowed to go forward.\n  I also thank the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for its support for \nthis nomination, working with the Senate to go forward.\n  I noted on the floor on Monday that Judge Edward Prado, being \nnominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, \nwas cleared by all of us on this side; all Democratic Senators serving \non the Judiciary Committee had voted to report the nomination \nfavorably. That is why we were concerned when it was held up on the \nother side.\n  We have worked hard to find judges who might be consensus judges, as \nhe is. Interestingly enough, Judge Prado was originally appointed by \nRonald Reagan. He is not a Democrat. He is a Republican. He considers \nhimself a conservative Republican, but has a judicial record where he \nfits the test that I and many of us on both sides of the aisle \ncertainly thought a judge should meet: When you walk into a courtroom, \nyou should be able to look at that judge and say, Whether I am a \nRepublican or a Democrat, rich or poor, White or Black, plaintiff or \ndefendant, whatever, that judge is going to give me a fair hearing.\n  The current occupant of the chair has served as attorney general and \njustice of the Texas Supreme Court and he knows whereof I speak. Anyone \nwho spends time in a court knows, looking at a judge, if they are going \nto get a fair shake with the judge or not. We all know there are some \njudges you want to avoid, other judges about whom you say, fine, I have \nto prove my case, but I feel I have a fair chance. I think that is the \nkind of judge Judge Prado will be.\n  When the Democrats took over the majority of the Senate in the summer \nof 2001, we inherited 110 judicial vacancies, primarily because during \nthe last few years of President Clinton's term Republicans had blocked \nan unprecedented number of judges from going forward. But during the \nnext 17 months, we confirmed 100 of President Bush's nominees, \nincluding some who had been rated as not qualified by the ABA, several \nwho were divisive and controversial.\n  Forty new vacancies occurred during the normal course of deaths and \nresignations at that time. We still took the 110 vacancies we inherited \nand brought that down to 60, which is considerably less than what the \nRepublicans have always referred to as being full employment.\n  On the Senate executive calendar, we also have the nomination of \nCecilia M. Altonaga, of Florida, to be a Federal judge in Florida. She \nwill be the first Cuban-American to be confirmed to the Federal bench--\nexpedited at the request of Senator Graham of Florida. I might say this \nis another case where we are ready to go forward any time he wants. The \ndecision has not been made to go forward yet on the Republican side of \nthe aisle. We hope to go forward soon. We have cleared that. We have \ncleared her and are happy to go forward.\n  Mr. President, we have another nomination before us--again from the \nState of Texas, the State represented ably by the distinguished \nPresiding Officer. We have had really unprecedented debate. We are \nasked to reconsider the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  We have never had a case where President resubmitted a circuit court \nnominee that had already been rejected by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee for the same vacancy. Until a few weeks ago, never before had \nthe Judiciary Committee proceeded for a second time on a nominee.\n  I have spoken about my concerns relating to Priscilla Owen. I have \ndetailed some of the cases in which Judge Owen's views were sharply \ncriticized by her colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court. I explained \nwhy I believe she should not be confirmed to the seat on the Fifth \nCircuit. Today I would like to talk about some more of the cases, \ninvolving a variety of legal issues, which show Priscilla Owen to be a \njudicial activist, willing to make law from the bench rather than \nfollow the language and intent of the legislature.\n  I heard Senator Cornyn say the other day that just because you \ndisagree with the outcome of a particular case does not give you the \nright to call the judge who wrote it an activist. I agree. I wish more \nRepublicans had followed that rule when President Clinton was \nnominating qualified people to the Federal bench and a Republican \nmajority was holding them up anonymously and voting against them. There \nare many cases before the courts of this Nation where reasonable \npeople, reasonable lawyers and judges, could disagree on the outcome, \ncould have a difference of opinion about interpreting a statute. There \nare many times when a statute is ambiguous, or a legal precedent \nunclear, and there is no right or wrong result. I could not agree more \nwith the junior Senator from Texas on this fundamental point. I wish \nmore Republicans had followed that rule when President Clinton \nnominated qualified people to the Federal bench and anonymous hold \nafter anonymous hold was made on the Republican side. They were not \nallowed to go forward.\n  It is interesting when we talk about political background of judges. \nVermont is allowed one seat by tradition on the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. New York and Connecticut have the rest of the seats.\n  I went to President Clinton when there was a vacancy and recommended \na sitting Federal judge in our State. He had been a Republican Deputy \nAttorney General--a conservative. I disagreed with some of his \ndecisions. I disagreed with his legal reasoning. I thought he did a \ncareful and reasoned job. I went to President Clinton knowing that \nthere were a number of people who might be considered for that \nposition--a number of them leading Democrats in our State. I told the \nPresident I thought this would make a good person, and it involved the \nnomination which he could rest easy on and not have to worry about. \nShortly before he was about to make his decision, the Federal judge \nruled strongly against a position of President Clinton. And when the \nPresident asked me about that, I said he could have made the ruling a \nweek after you sent his nomination up, but that I thought he was \nhonest. The President admired his courage, honesty and ability, and he \nnominated him. And this Senate voted as I recall unanimously to put him \non the Second Circuit Court of Appeals where he does very, very well.\n  I voted on hundreds of hundreds of Republicans nominated by \nRepublican Presidents. But just as I voted against those nominated by \nDemocratic Presidents, I will vote against those nominated by \nRepublican Presidents when they show that they are going to be activist \njudges who are not going to follow the law but rather follow the \ndictates of their own philosophy.\n\n  That is why I will continue to oppose Priscilla Owen. I did do as the \nPresident asked when I was chairman. I held a hearing for her. We had a \nvery fair hearing, according to her, and actually put her on the agenda \nfor markup on the day the President of the United States requested that \nshe be put on. She was put over at a Republican request, but then she \nwas voted down by the committee.\n  When I look at Justice Owen's record, I am not looking at the outcome \nof the cases in which Justice Owen ruled, and criticizing her as an \nactivist just because I do not agree with a ruling or even a couple of \nrulings. I am looking at the substance of a number of her decisions, \nhow she approached those cases and the propriety of her legal analysis. \nThe conservative justices on the other sides of these cases, in many, \nmany of those cases, are themselves extremely critical of her approach, \nher reasoning, her judging--in short, her activism. They have called \nher an activist, said one of her opinions was just ``inflammatory \nrhetoric,'' noted in other cases that she\n\n[[Page S5518]]\n\nwent beyond the language of the law, ignored legislative intent, and \ngutted laws passed by the people's elected representatives. Like them, \nI disagree with Priscilla Owen's methods and activist judging.\n  In my last statement, I touched on some of the criticism received \nfrom the majority in the series of parental notification cases. In \naddition to cases dealing with parental notification, Justice Owen's \nactivism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of other cases, \nincluding those dealing with business interests, malpractice, access to \npublic information, employment discrimination and Texas Supreme Court \njurisdiction, in which she rules against individual plaintiffs time and \ntime again.\n  In one case that is perhaps the exception that proves the rule, \nJustice Owen wrote a majority opinion that was bitterly criticized by \nthe dissent for its activism. In In re City of Georgetown, 53 S.W. 3d \n328, Tex. 2001, Justice Owen wrote a majority opinion finding that the \ncity did not have to give the Austin American-Statesman a report \nprepared by a consulting expert in connection with pending and \nanticipated litigation. The dissent is extremely critical of Justice \nOwen's opinion, citing the Texas law's strong preference for disclosure \nand liberal construction. Accusing her of activism, Justice Abbott, \njoined by Chief Justice Phillips and Justice Baker, noted that the \nlegislature, ``expressly identified eighteen categories of information \nthat are `public information' and that must be disclosed upon request . \n. . [sec. (a)] The Legislature attempted to safeguard its policy of \nopen records by adding subsection (b), which limits courts' \nencroachment on its legislatively established policy decisions.'' The \ndissent further protests:\n\n       But if this Court has the power to broaden by judicial rule \n     the categories of information that are ``confidential under \n     other law,'' then subsection (b) is eviscerated from the \n     statute. By determining what information falls outside \n     subsection (a)'s scope, this Court may evade the mandates of \n     subsection (b) and order information withheld whenever it \n     sees fit. This not only contradicts the spirit and language \n     of subsection (b), it guts it. Id.\n\n  Finally, the opinion concluded by asserting that Justice Owen's \ninterpretation, ``abandons strict construction and rewrites the statute \nto eliminate subsection (b)'s restrictions.''\n\n  These examples, together with the unusually harsh language directed \nat Justice Owen's position by the majority in the Doe cases, show a \njudge out of step with the conservative Republican majority of the \nTexas Supreme Court, a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her \nactivist views.\n  I am also greatly concerned about Justice Owen's record of ends-\noriented decision making as a Justice on the Texas Supreme Court. As \none reads case after case, particularly those in which she was the sole \ndissenter or dissented with the extreme right wing of the court, her \npattern of activism becomes clear. Her legal views in so many cases \ninvolving statutory interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the \nplain meaning of the statute, the legislative intent, or the majority's \ninterpretation, leading to the conclusion that she sets out to justify \nsome preconceived idea of what the law ought to mean. This is not an \nappropriate way for a judge to make decisions. This is a judge whose \nrecord reflects that she is willing and sometimes eager to make law \nfrom the bench.\n  Justice Owen's activism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of \ncases, including those dealing with business interests, malpractice, \naccess to public information, employment discrimination and Texas \nSupreme Court jurisdiction, in which she writes against individual \nplaintiffs time and time again, in seeming contradiction of the law as \nwritten.\n  One of the cases where this trend is evident is FM Properties v. City \nof Austin, 22 S.W. 3d 868, Tex. 1998. I asked Justice Owen about this \n1998 environmental case at her hearing last July. In her dissent from a \n6-3 ruling, in which Justice Alberto Gonzales was among the majority, \nJustice Owen showed her willingness to rule in favor of large private \nlandowners against the clear public interest in maintaining a fair \nregulatory process and clean water. Her dissent, which the majority \ncharacterized as, ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric,'' was an \nattempt to favor big landowners.\n  In this case, the Texas Supreme Court found that a section of the \nTexas Water Code allowing certain private owners of large tracts of \nland to create ``water quality zones,'' and write their own water \nquality regulations and plans, violated the Texas Constitution because \nit improperly delegated legislative power to private entities. The \nCourt found that the Water Code section gave the private landowners, \n``legislative duties and powers, the exercise of which may adversely \naffect public interests, including the constitutionally-protected \npublic interest in water quality.'' The Court also found that certain \naspects of the Code and the factors surrounding its implementation \nweighed against the delegation of power, including the lack of \nmeaningful government review, the lack of adequate representation of \ncitizens affected by the private owners' actions, the breadth of the \ndelegation, and the big landowners' obvious interest in maximizing \ntheir own profits and minimizing their own costs.\n  The majority offered a strong opinion, detailing its legal reasoning \nand explaining the dangers of offering too much legislative power to \nprivate entities. By contrast, in her dissent, Justice Owen argued \nthat, ``[w]hile the Constitution certainly permits the Legislature to \nenact laws that preserve and conserve the State's natural resources, \nthere is nothing in the Constitution that requires the Legislature to \nexercise that power in any particular manner,'' ignoring entirely \nthe possibility of an unconstitutional delegation of power. Her view \nstrongly favored large business interests to the clear detriment of the \npublic interest, and against the persuasive legal arguments of a \nmajority of the Court.\n\n  When I asked her about this case at her hearing in July, I found her \nanswer perplexing. In a way that she did not argue in her written \ndissent, at her hearing Justice Owen attempted to cast the F.M. case \nnot as, ``a fight between and City of Austin and big business, but in \nall honesty, . . . really a fight about . . . the State of Texas versus \nthe City of Austin.'' In the written dissent however, she began by \nstating the, ``importance of this case to private property rights and \nthe separation of powers between the judicial and legislative branches. \n. .'', and went on to decry the Court's decision as one that, ``will \nimpair all manner of property rights.'' That is 22 S.W. 3d at 889. At \nthe time she wrote her dissent, Justice Owen was certainly clear about \nproperty rights for corporations.\n  At her second hearing, I know that Chairman Hatch tried to \nrecharacterize the F.M. Properties v. City of Austin case in an effort \nto make it sound innocuous, just a struggle between two jurisdictions \nover some unimportant regulations. I know how, through a choreography \nof leading questions and short answers, they tried to respond to my \nquestion from last July, which was never really answered, about why \nJustice Owen thought it was proper for the legislature to grant large \ncorporate landowners the power to regulate themselves. Again, I am \nunconvinced. The majority in this case, which invalidated a state \nstatute favoring corporations, does not describe the case or the issues \nas the chairman and the nominee have. A fair reading of the case shows \nno evidence of a struggle between governments. This is all an attempt \nat after-the-fact justification where there really is none to be found.\n  Justice Owen and Chairman Hatch's explanation of the case also lacked \neven the weakest effort at rebutting the criticism of her by the F.M. \nProperties majority. As I mentioned, the six justice majority said that \nJustice Owen's dissent was, ``nothing more than inflammatory \nrhetoric.'' They explained why her legal objections were mistaken, \nsaying that no matter what the state legislature had the power to do on \nits own, it was simply unconstitutional to give the big landowners the \npower they were given.\n  Another case that concerned me is the case of GTE Southwest, Inc. v. \nBruce, 990 S.W.2d 605, where Justice Owen wrote in favor of GTE in a \nlawsuit by employees for intentional infliction of emotional distress. \nThe rest of the Court held that three employees subjected to what the \nmajority characterized as ``constant humiliating and abusive behavior \nof their supervisor'' were entitled to the jury verdict in\n\n[[Page S5519]]\n\ntheir favor. Despite the Court's recitation of an exhaustive list of \nsickening behavior by the supervisor, and its clear application of \nTexas law to those facts, Justice Owen wrote a concurring opinion to \nexplain her difference of opinion on the key legal issue in the case--\nwhether the behavior in evidence met the legal standard for intentional \ninfliction of emotional distress.\n  Justice Owen contended that the conduct was not, as the standard \nrequires, ``so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to \ngo beyond all possible bounds of decency. . .'' The majority opinion \nshows Justice Owen's concurrence advocating an inexplicable point of \nview that ignores the facts in evidence in order to reach a \npredetermined outcome in the corporation's favor.\n  At her first hearing, in answer to Senator Edwards' questions about \nthis case, Justice Owen again gave an explanation not to be found in \nher written views. She told him that she agreed with the majority's \nholding, and wrote separately only to make sure that future litigants \nwould not be confused and think that out of context, any one of the \noutrages suffered by the plaintiffs would not support a judgment. \nLooking again at her dissent, I do not see why, if that was what she \ntruly intended, she did not say so in language plain enough to be \nunderstood, or why she thought it necessary to write and say it in the \nfirst place. It is a somewhat curious distinction to make--to advocate \nthat in a tort case a judge should write a separate concurrence to \nexplain which part of the plaintiff's case, standing alone, would not \nsupport a finding of liability. Neither her written concurrence, nor \nher answers in explanation after the fact, is satisfactory explanation \nof her position in this case.\n\n  In City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W. 3d 351, Tex. 2000, \nJustice Owen dissented from a majority opinion and, again, it is \ndifficult to justify her views other than as based on a desire to reach \na particular outcome. The majority upheld a decision giving the \nnewspaper access to a document outlining the reasons why the city's \nfinance director was going to be fired. Justice Owen made two \narguments: that because the document was considered a draft it was not \nsubject to disclosure, and that the document was exempt from disclosure \nbecause it was part of policy making. Both of these exceptions were so \nlarge as to swallow the rule requiring disclosure. The majority rightly \npoints out that if Justice Owen's views prevailed, almost any document \ncould be labeled draft to shield it from public view. Moreover, to call \na personnel decision a part of policy making is such an expansive \ninterpretation it would leave little that would not be ``policy.''\n  Quantum Chemical v. Toennies, 47 S.W. 3d 473, Tex. 2001, is another \ntroubling case where Justice Owen joined a dissent advocating an \nactivist interpretation of a clearly written statute. In this age \ndiscrimination suit brought under the Texas civil rights statute, the \nrelevant parts of which were modeled on Title VII of the federal Civil \nRights Act, and its amendments, the appeal to the Texas Supreme Court \ncentered on the standard of causation necessary for a finding for the \nplaintiff. The plaintiff argued, and the five justices in the majority \nagreed, that the plain meaning of the statute must be followed, and \nthat the plaintiff could prove an unlawful employment practice by \nshowing that discrimination was ``a motivating factor.'' The employer \ncorporation argued, and Justices Hecht and Owen agreed, that the plain \nmeaning could be discarded in favor of a more tortured and unnecessary \nreading of the statute, and that the plaintiff must show that \ndiscrimination was ``the motivating factor,'' in order to recover \ndamages.\n  The portion of Title VII on which the majority relies for its \ninterpretation was part of Congress's 1991 fix to the United States \nSupreme Court's opinion in the Price Waterhouse case, which held that \nan employer could avoid liability if the plaintiff could not show \ndiscrimination was ``the'' motivating factor. Congress's fix, in \nSection 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, does not specify whether \nthe motivating factor standard applies to both sorts of discrimination \ncases, the so-called ``mixed motive'' cases as well as the ``pretext'' \ncases.\n  The Texas majority concluded that they must rely on the plain \nlanguage of the statute as amended, which could not be any clearer that \nunder Title VII discrimination can be shown to be ``a'' motivating \nfactor. Justice Owen joined Justice Hecht in claiming that federal case \nlaw is clear--in favor of their view--and opted for a reading of the \nstatute that would turn it into its polar opposite, forcing plaintiffs \ninto just the situation legislators were trying to avoid. This example \nof Justice Owen's desire to change the law from the bench, instead of \ninterpret it, fits President Bush's definition of activism to a ``T.''\n\n  Justice Owen has also demonstrated her tendency toward ends-oriented \ndecision making quite clearly in a series of dissents and concurrences \nin cases involving a Texas law providing for a judicial bypass of \nparental notification requirements for minors seeking abortions.\n  The most striking example is Justice Owen's expression of \ndisagreement with the majority's decision on key legal issues in Doe 1. \nShe strongly disagreed with the majority's holding on what a minor \nwould have to show in order to establish that she was, as the statute \nrequires, ``sufficiently well informed'' to make the decision on her \nown. While the conservative Republican majority laid out a well-\nreasoned test for this element of the law, based on the plain meaning \nof the statute and well-cited case law, Justice Owen inserted elements \nfound in neither authority.\n  Specifically, Justice Owen insisted that the majority's requirement \nthat the minor be ``aware of the emotional and psychological aspects of \nundergoing an abortion'' was not sufficient and that among other \nrequirements with no basis in the law, she, ``would require . . . [that \nthe minor] should . . . indicate to the court that she is aware of and \nhas considered that there are philosophic, social, moral, and religious \narguments that can be brought to bear when considering abortion.'' That \nis In re Doe 1, 19 S.W.3d 249, 256, Tex. 2000.\n  In her written concurrence, Justice Owen indicated, through legal \ncitation, that support for this proposition could be found in a \nparticular page of the Supreme Court's opinion in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey. However, when one looks at that portion of the Casey decision, \none finds no mention of requiring a minor to acknowledge religious or \nmoral arguments. The passage talks instead about the ability of a State \nto ``enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know that \nthere are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that can be \nbrought to bear.'' That is Casey at 872. Justice Owen's reliance on \nthis portion of a United States Supreme Court opinion to rewrite Texas \nlaw was simply wrong.\n  As she did in answer to questions about a couple of other cases at \nher July hearing, Justice Owen tried to explain away this problem with \nan after the fact justification. She told Senator Cantwell that the \nreference to religion was not to be found in Casey after all, but in \nanother U.S. Supreme Court case, H.L. v. Matheson. She explained that \nin, ``Matheson they talk about that for some people it raises profound \nmoral and religious concerns, and they're talking about the \ndesirability or the State's interest in these kinds of considerations \nin making an informed decision.'' But again, on reading Matheson, one \nsees that the only mention of religion comes in a quotation meant to \nexplain why the parents of the minor are due notification, not about \nthe contours of what the government may require someone to prove to \nshow she was fully well informed. Her reliance on Matheson for her \nproposed rewrite of the law is just as faulty as her reliance on Casey. \nNeither one supports her reading of the law. She simply tries a little \nbit of legal smoke and mirrors to make it appear as if they did. This \nis the sort of ends-oriented decision making that destroys the belief \nof a citizen in a fair legal system. And most troubling of all was her \nindicating to Senator Feinstein that she still views her dissents in \nthe Doe cases as the proper reading and construction of the Texas \nstatute.\n\n  I have read her written answers to questions from Senators after her \nsecond hearing, many newly formulated, that attempt to explain away her \nvery disturbing opinions in the Texas parental notification cases. Her \nrecord is still her record, and the record is clear.\n\n[[Page S5520]]\n\nShe still does not satisfactorily explain why she infuses the words of \nthe Texas legislature with so much more meaning than she can be sure \nthey intended. She adequately describes the precedents of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, to be sure, but she simply does not justify \nthe leaps in logic and plain meaning she attempted in those decisions.\n  As I have mentioned with regard to some specific cases, Justice \nOwen's responses at her second hearing failed to alleviate these \nserious concerns nor did Senator Hatch's ``testimony'' at her second \nhearing, where he attempted to explain away cases about which I had \nexpressed concern.\n  The few explanations offered for the many other examples of the times \nher Republican colleagues criticized her were unavailing. The tortured \nreading of Justice Gonzales' remarks in the Doe case were unconvincing. \nHe clearly said that to construe the law in the way that Justice Owen's \ndissent construed the law would be activism. Any other interpretation \nis just not credible.\n  Or why in Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, the \nmajority criticized her for her disregard for legislative language, \nsaying that, ``the dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing \nexaminer's role in the . . . process,'' which it said stemmed from \n``its disregard of the procedural elements the Legislature established \n. . . to ensure that the hearing-examiner process is fair and efficient \nfor both teachers and school boards.'' Or why, in Collins v. Ison-\nNewsome, a dissent joined by Justice Owen was so roundly criticized by \nthe Republican majority, which said the dissent agrees with one \nproposition but then ``argues for the exact opposite proposition . . . \n[defying] the Legislature's clear and express limits on our \njurisdiction.''\n  I have said it before, but I am forced to say it again. These \nexamples, together with the unusually harsh language directed at \nJustice Owen's position by the majority in the Doe cases, show a judge \nout of step with the conservative Republican majority of the Texas \nSupreme Court, a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her \nactivist views. No good explanation was offered for these critical \nstatements last year, and no good explanation was offered two weeks \nago. Politically motivated rationalizations do not negate the plain \nlanguage used to describe her activism at the time.\n  I would like to explain again that Justice Owen has been nominated to \nfill a vacancy that has existed since January, 1997. In the intervening \n5 years, President Clinton nominated Judge Jorge Rangel, a \ndistinguished Hispanic attorney from Corpus Christi, to fill that \nvacancy. Despite his qualifications, and his rating of well qualified \nby the ABA, Judge Rangel never received a hearing from the committee, \nand his nomination was returned to the President without Senate action \nat the end of 1998, after a fruitless wait of 15 months.\n  On September 16, 1999, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, \nanother outstanding Hispanic attorney, to fill that same vacancy. This \nHarvard educated attorney, who received a unanimous well qualified from \nthe ABA, did not receive a hearing on his nomination either--for more \nthan 17 months. President Bush withdrew the nomination of Enrique \nMoreno to the Fifth Circuit and later sent Justice Owen's name in its \nplace. It was not until May of last year, at a hearing chaired by \nSenator Schumer, that the Judiciary Committee heard from any of \nPresident Clinton's three unsuccessful nominees to the 5th Circuit. \nLast May, Mr. Moreno and Mr. Rangel testified along with a number of \nother Clinton nominees about their treatment by the Republican \nmajority. Thus, Justice Owen was the third nominee to this vacancy but \nthe first to be accorded a hearing before the committee.\n\n  In fact, when the committee held its hearing on the nomination of \nJudge Edith Clement to the Fifth Circuit in 2001, it was the first \nhearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in seven years. By contrast, Justice \nOwen was the third nomination to the Fifth Circuit on which the \nJudiciary Committee, under my chairmanship, held a hearing in less than \none year. In spite of the treatment by the former Republican majority \nof so many moderate judicial nominees of the previous President, we \nproceeded last July with a hearing on Justice Owen and, for that \nmatter, with hearings for Judge Charles Pickering. We proceeded with \ncommittee debate and votes on all three of President Bush's Fifth \nCircuit nominees despite the treatment of President Clinton's nominees \nby the Republican majority.\n  President Bush has said on several occasions that his standard for \njudging judicial nominees would be that they ``share a commitment to \nfollow and apply the law, not to make law from the bench.'' Priscilla \nOwen's record, as I have described it today, and as we described it a \nfew weeks ago in committee and last September, does not qualify her for \na lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n  As I have demonstrated many times, I am ready to consent to the \nconfirmation of consensus, mainstream judges, and I have on hundreds of \noccasions. But the President has resent the Senate a nominee who raises \nserious and significant concerns. I oppose this nomination.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to join my \ncolleagues to discuss the nomination of Priscilla Owen to the Fifth \nCircuit Court.\n  Mr. President, someone watching this debate on C-SPAN today might \nwonder why the Senate is spending so much time on a judicial \nnomination. They may watch all our discussions about circuit courts and \nwonder, how does this affect me? Well, the truth is that it affects all \nof us. Our Federal courts impact the opportunities, rights, and lives \nof every citizen, and that is why the appointments to our courts must \nbe made with great care.\n  Since the founding of our Nation, our courts have changed our \nhistory, helping us to live up to our ideals as a society by protecting \nour rights and defending our freedoms. Our courts affect us at the \nbroadest level, from interpreting environmental standards of clean air \nand water, to guarding important safety and consumer protections.\n  Our courts have changed millions of lives at the individual level by \nknocking down barriers. The courts have helped end the segregation of \nour schools, worked to stop discrimination, and protected the voting \nrights of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, these decisions don't just happen. They are made by \npeople. According to our Constitution, those people are appointed by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate. Today, we are at an \nimportant step in that constitutional process. I care about our judges \nbecause I was elected to ensure that the people of my State have \nopportunities and to protect their rights. That is why I work on issues \nsuch as health care, education, economic development, to give \nWashingtonians opportunities. But those opportunities would mean \nnothing if the basic rights and freedoms of our citizens were \nundermined by judicial decisions.\n  This debate is also about the legacy that we leave. As Senators, our \nlegacy is not just in the bills we pass or the laws we change, it is in \nthe people we approve to interpret those laws. Those judges serve \nlifetime appointments. The precedents they set or break will impact the \nopportunities of American citizens long after all of us are gone.\n  So the debate we are having today is part of a process that impacts \nthe rights and freedoms of every American, and we have a responsibility \nunder the Constitution to carry out our role in this critical process. \nNow, some in the majority may suggest this filibuster is somehow new or \nunique. It is neither. Every Senator is familiar with the filibuster \nprocess. It is one of the many tools available to every Senator. It has \nbeen used for decades. It has been used on judicial nominations, and \neven on Supreme Court nominees.\n  In fact, a filibuster has been used on judicial nominees by members \nof the current majority party. This is nothing\n\n[[Page S5521]]\n\nnew. At the same time, a filibuster is not a step we take often or \nlightly, especially on judicial nominations, but I believe in this case \nit is clearly warranted.\n  As I look at what Americans expect from our judges, I see that this \nparticular nominee falls far short. Not only that, but this nominee's \nconfirmation poses such a risk that the Senate must send a signal we \nwill not confirm judges who represent an attack on the basic rights and \nfreedoms which the courts themselves must safeguard.\n  What are those qualities we look for in those who serve on the \nFederal bench? Qualities such as fairness, trust, experience, \ntemperament, and the ability to represent all Americans, and safeguard \ntheir rights. It is our duty in the Senate to defend these principles. \nWe are setting no new precedent with this debate. We are simply \nexercising our right as Senators to defend the principles we believe we \nmust defend.\n  Why do we feel so strongly about the nomination of Priscilla Owen? \nJustice Owen's record clearly illustrates she fails the test of meeting \nthe requirements that she be fair, that she engender trust, that she \nhas the proper experience and temperament, or that she has the ability \nto represent all Americans, and safeguard their rights. Justice Owen \nhas frequently ignored current Supreme Court precedent and State law in \nfavor of imposing her own personal moral and religious beliefs from the \nbench.\n  Do not just take my word for it. Let's examine what others, including \nWhite House counsel Alberto Gonzales, have said about some of Justice \nOwen's decisions. Justice Owen is a vigorous dissenter, and her \ncolleagues, including Justice Gonzales, have had a lot to say about her \nopinions. In one, her colleagues described her dissent as ``nothing \nmore than inflammatory rhetoric.'' In another instance, Justice \nGonzales wrote that Owen's dissenting opinion, if enacted, ``would be \nan unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  Those are pretty strong statements and they provide a window into \nwhat kind of judge Priscilla Owen would be on the Fifth Circuit.\n  It is the judgment of this Senator that Priscilla Owen cannot render \nimpartial justice to the people who appear before her court, that she \nwill not seek to safeguard individual rights, and that her temperament \nis incompatible with serving on the Fifth Circuit.\n  This is not an easy decision for me. Thus far, the Senate has \nconfirmed, if my math is correct, 119 of President Bush's judicial \nnominees. By any standard, that is a notable record. We have tried hard \nto work with the administration to fill court vacancies in a fair and \nthoughtful manner. Unfortunately, by every measure, this nomination \nfails the test. If I agreed to put this judge on the Fifth Circuit \nCourt, I would not be doing my job of protecting the citizens I am here \nto represent.\n  This is a critical debate. It is worth the time it takes because the \njudges we appoint will affect the lives of millions of Americans. We \nhave a special responsibility. Let us carry out that responsibility \nwell, because our legacy is not just in the laws we pass. It is also in \nthe people we appoint who will interpret those laws over a lifetime. \nThe precedents they will set or break will live on longer than any of \nus.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise as a former member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee to discuss something that is very important \nto all of us: How we should proceed on nominees for our Federal court \nsystem. And how we make sure we confirm nominees who will enforce the \nlaw and not nominees who might seek to bend the law or interpret it to \ntheir own desires. The American people deserve judges who hold the \nmainstream values of our country and our legal system. They deserve a \nFederal judiciary willing to interpret the laws as they are, rather \nthan as the judges might want them to be.\n  The American people believe that the Senate needs to do our job. Not \nto be a rubberstamp on nominees, but to thoroughly evaluate judicial \nnominees and determine whether they will continue the tradition of the \nFederal judiciary by being balanced and impartial, and serving as a \ncountercheck for the executive branch and for us, the legislative \nbranch. That was the role the Founding Fathers gave to the Senate, and \nI believe that is a role the American people think we should play.\n  That is why I don't think it is surprising, that 74 percent of the \npublic believes that the question of judicial views and judicial \nphilosophy should be something we consider in the Senate confirmation \nprocess, and that we should get answers to questions about judicial \nphilosophy from nominees.\n  More importantly, a majority of Americans also believe we should not \nvote to confirm a nominee who might otherwise be qualified if we don't \nthink their views on these important issues reflect mainstream American \nviewpoint. I believe that the nominee we are debating, Justice \nPriscilla Owen, fails to meet this test.\n  As a former member of the Judiciary Committee, I attended a hearing \non Priscilla Owen that lasted a full day. During that hearing, Owen's \nrecord showed a particular disregard for precedent and the plain \nmeaning of the law.\n  Anyone who walks into a courtroom as a plaintiff or a defendant in \nthis country should do so having the full confidence that there is \nimpartiality on the part of the judge on the bench. They should have \ntotal confidence that the rule of law will be followed, and believe the \nissues will be judged on their merits rather than viewed through the \nprism of an individual judge's personal values or beliefs.\n  There is reason to be concerned about the record of Priscilla Owen. \nTime after time, even her own Republican colleagues, on a predominantly \nRepublican Texas Supreme Court bench, criticized her for failing to \nfollow precedent or interpreting statutes in ways that ignore the clear \nintent of the law. Just yesterday a key newspaper in her State, the \nAustin American Statesman, wrote:\n\n       Owen is so conservative that she places herself out of the \n     broad mainstream of jurisprudence. She seems all too willing \n     to bend the law to fit her views.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that editorial printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From American-Stateman, Apr. 29, 2003]\n\n              Owen Deserves a Note But Not a Confirmation\n\n       The U.S. Senate is expected to resume debate soon over \n     President Bush's nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice \n     Priscilla Owen to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, \n     which hears federal appeals from Texas, Louisiana and \n     Mississippi. We have argued before that she deserved a \n     hearing, and she finally got one from the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. That said, however, she should not be confirmed.\n       There's no question that Owen is qualified for the 5th \n     Circuit by her legal training and experience. She was a \n     standout at the top of her Baylor University Law School \n     class; she became a partner at a major Houston law firm, \n     Andrews & Kurth, where she practiced commercial litigation \n     for 17 years; and she was elected in 1994 to the Texas \n     Supreme Court, and re-elected in 2000. She received the \n     highest rating, ``well-qualified,'' from an American Bar \n     Association committee that reviews judicial nominations.\n       But Owen is so conservative that she places herself out of \n     the broad mainstream of jurisprudence. She seems all too \n     willing to bend the law to fit her views, rather than the \n     reverse.\n       One example was the state Supreme Court's interpretation of \n     the then-new Parental Notification Act regarding abortions \n     sought by minors. In early 2000, the nine justices, all \n     Republicans, took up a series of ``Jane Doe'' cases to \n     determine under what circumstances a girl could get a court \n     order to avoid telling a parent that she intended to get an \n     abortion.\n       Owen and Justice Nathan Hecht consistently argued for \n     interpretations of the law that would make it virtually \n     impossible for a girl to get such an order.\n       Finally, in one Jane Doe case, another justice complained \n     that ``to construe the Parental Notification Act so narrowly \n     as to eliminate bypasses, or to create hurdles that simply \n     are not to be found in the words of the statute, would be an \n     unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n\n[[Page S5522]]\n\n       The justice who wrote that was Alberto Gonzales, who is now \n     Bush's general counsel.\n       Owen also could usually be counted upon in any important \n     case that pitted an individual or group of individuals \n     against business interests to side with business.\n       Owen is being appointed to a lifetime position in the \n     judicial branch of government, not to a post in which her \n     duty is to carry out the will of the president. And given the \n     narrowness of his 2000 election victory, Bush is not in a \n     position to argue that the public has said it wants ultra-\n     conservative judges.\n       If the Senate Democrats invoke their power to filibuster, \n     Owen would be the second judge nominated by Bush to be \n     blocked in such a way. The other is Miguel Estrada, who was \n     nominated to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the \n     District of Columbia, and who Democrats suspect is a radical, \n     ideological conservative.\n       Democrats are not blindly opposing all of the president's \n     judicial nominees. Many have been confirmed by the Senate, \n     and others have won committee approval without controversy, \n     including Edward Prado of San Antonio, a federal district \n     judge who was nominated to the 5th Circuit.\n       But Owen should not be confirmed.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. What some of Owen's colleagues on the bench have said \nabout her opinions I think is important. In a case dealing with a \ndeveloper seeking to evade Austin's clean water laws, her dissent was \ncalled ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric.''\n  In another case, her statutory interpretation was called \n``unworkable.'' In yet another case, the dissent she joined was called \n``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n  Some of our other colleagues have already mentioned that particular \nquote. One of the reasons we all find it somewhat unbelievable is the \nfact that it was made by her then-colleague on the Texas Supreme Court, \nnow the White House General Counsel Alberto Gonzales, who is in charge \nof pushing her nomination.\n  But the criticism of Owen comes not only from her colleagues but from \nacross the country. The San Antonio Express calls her nomination \nmisguided. The Atlanta Journal called the Judiciary Committee's \noriginal objection to her nomination ``the right decision for the \nAmerican people.'' The New York Times wrote last week that it was \nabundantly clear at her hearing that her ideology drives her decisions. \nThe Kansas City Star even said there are better nominees and better \nways for the executive branch to spend its time than re-fighting these \nbattles.\n  There is another reason this nomination is so important. I believe \nthis is critical to all the nominees we are considering for appointment \nto the Federal bench. That is, what is the judicial philosophy and \ncommitment to upholding current law as it relates to a citizen's right \nto privacy. I asked Justice Owen at her hearing about her beliefs on \nthe right to privacy. I asked her if she believed there was a \nconstitutional right to privacy and where she found that right in the \nConstitution.\n  She declined at the time to answer that question without the relevant \ncase information and precedents before her. When Senator Feinstein \nfollowed up with a similar question, Owen again would not answer \nwhether she believes a right to privacy does exist within the \nConstitution.\n  The question of whether a nominee believes that the right to privacy \nexists with regard to the ability to make decisions about one's own \nbody is only the tip of the privacy iceberg. I believe that we are in \nan information age that poses new challenges in protecting the right to \nprivacy. We are facing difficult issues including whether U.S. citizens \nhave been treated as enemy combatants in a prison without access to \ncounsel or trial by jury, whether businesses have access to some of \nyour most personal information, whether the Government has established \na process for eavesdropping or tracking U.S. citizens without probable \ncause, and whether the Government has the ability to develop new \nsoftware that might track the use of your own computer and places where \nyou might go on the Internet without your consent or knowledge. There \nare a variety of issues that are before us on an individual's right to \nprivacy and how that right to privacy is going to be interpreted. A \nclear understanding of a nominee's willingness to follow precedent on \nprotecting privacy is a very important criteria for me, and it should \nbe a concern for all Members.\n  Of course, some of my concern and skepticism about Justice Owen's \nviews on privacy results from the opinions she wrote in a series of \ncases interpreting the Texas law on parental notification. In 2000 the \nState of Texas passed a law requiring parental notification. But they \nalso included a bypass system for extreme cases.\n  Eleven out of 12 times Owen analyzed whether a minor should be \nentitled to bypass the notice requirement, she voted either to deny the \nbypass or to create greater obstacles to the bypass.\n  Owen wrote in dissent that she would require a minor to demonstrate \nthat she had considered religious issues surrounding the decision and \nthat she had received specific counseling from someone other than a \nphysician, her friend, or her family. Requirements, I believe, that go \nfar beyond what the Texas law requires.\n  In interpreting the ``best interest'' arm of the statute, Owen held \nthat a minor should be required to demonstrate that the abortion \nitself--not avoiding notification--was in the individual's best \ninterests. In this particular case, I think she went far beyond what \nthe statute required.\n  Where does that put us? Women in this country rely on the right to \nchoose. It is an issue on which we have had 30 years of settled law and \ncase precedent. In the Fifth Circuit, there are three States that \ncontinue to have unconstitutional laws on the books, and legislatures \nthat are hostile to that right to choose. The Federal courts are the \nsole protector of women's right to privacy in these states. I do not \nbelieve that the rights of the women of the Fifth Circuit can be \ntrusted to Justice Priscilla Owen.\n  Owen's rulings on privacy and not following precedent raise grave \nconcerns. But this is not the only area where Justice Owen has been \ncriticized. She also has been criticized in areas of consumer rights \nand environmental law.\n  The Los Angeles Times singles her out as a nominee who disdains \nworkers' rights, civil liberties and abortion rights. And even a \npredominantly Republican court--one considered by legal observers and \nscholars to be one of the most conservative in this country--Justice \nOwen still seems to go further than a majority on that court. Time \nafter time, Justice Owen has ruled in favor of business interests over \nworking people, against women, against victims of crime and negligence, \nand against the environment. Over a career a judge can have many \ncontroversial cases. But, as the Austin Statesman points out, Justice \nOwen is widely known as a nominee that ``could usually be counted on to \nside in any important case that pitted an individual against business \ninterests to side with business.''\n\n  I don't think that is the type of representation that we want to have \non our courts. Her controversial rulings include an opinion that a \ndistributor who failed to conduct a background check on a salesman was \nnot liable for the rape of a woman by that salesman.\n  In a case challenging the ability of Texas cities to impose basic \nclean water control, she held the legislature had the power to exempt a \nsingle developer from city water pollution controls by allowing the \ndeveloper to write their own water pollution plan. The majority called \nher dissent ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric.''\n  There are other cases dealing with Texas public information law which \nI think are important for all of us, for all of our citizens to have \naccess to public information.\n  She wrote that a memo prepared by a city agency about an employee \nshould not be subject to disclosure under the Texas Public Information \nLaw because it discussed ``policy,'' an exemption that a majority of \nothers on the board said would be ``the same as holding there is no \ndisclosure requirement at all.''\n  In another similar case about public information laws, she held that \na report prepared by the city of Houston and financed by taxpayers \ncould not be disclosed under the Texas Public Information Act. Again, \nher colleagues criticized her decision not only as ``contradicting the \nspirit and language of the statute, but gutting it.''\n  It is possible to find cases or points to argue in the record of \nalmost any judge, but because of the reaction of her own colleagues to \nher decisions. I find the constant criticism and rebukes that run \nthrough the opinions of\n\n[[Page S5523]]\n\nOwen's colleagues surprising. They consistently indicate that they \nthink she has overstepped or misinterpreted the law to such a degree \nthat they have used the words ``gutting'' or ``judicial activism'' or \n``overreaching.''\n  As do many of my colleagues, I believe that we should move off this \nnomination and on to more important matters. We in the Northwest have \nan economy that has failed to recover. We in America are looking for an \neconomic plan to move our country forward. There are many issues of \nnational security that we must continue to debate.\n  I think that we could do better than renominating Priscilla Owen, and \nothers who have already been rejected by a previous Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. The fact that we are even debating this nominee is \nunprecedented. While I respect the President's right to renominate her, \nI find his decision to do so given the breadth of opposition and \ngenuine questions that have been raised by her troubling.\n  The American public cares about us doing our job on nominees. It \ncares about us asking the right questions. It cares about us making \nsure that judicial nominees are following important laws that are \nalready on the books. I believe the majority of Americans are becoming \nmore and more concerned about their right to privacy and how it might \nbe protected in the future.\n  With all the issues that we are facing on our judicial nominees, I \nsay to my colleagues that it is time to move off this nominee--not to \nmove forward on it and instead to the important business that needs to \nbe done for this country and specifically for the Northwest.\n  I ask my colleagues to oppose the motion to proceed to a vote on this \nnomination and turn instead to the business that the people of America \nwant us to address: our economic livelihood and how we can all work \ntogether to provide better opportunities for Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I think it was a young kid who turned to ``Shoeless Joe'' Jackson \nwhen members of the Chicago White Sox were charged with corruption in \nbaseball and said, ``Say it ain't so, Joe.''\n  Tell me that we are not back again in these hallowed halls visiting \nthe issue of a nomination of a circuit court judge, trying to do what \nthe Constitution has given us the authority to do since the birth of \nthis magnificent country, the right to advise and consent but \nultimately to choose, to advise and consent and cast your vote up or \ndown for a judicial nomination.\n  I am here to talk about the nomination of Texas Supreme Court Justice \nPriscilla Owen to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit in support of that nomination.\n  The American public is going to hear these facts again and again. \nThey are going to hear about Judge Owen, who has been unanimously rated \nwell qualified by the American Bar Association, which my colleagues on \nthe other side have called the gold standard in the past; the way you \nwant to measure; you don't want to measure them by political \naffiliation, you don't want to measure them by what an interest group \nthinks.\n  The American Bar Association, certainly not a bastion of conservative \nAmerican values, unanimously has rated Justice Owen as well qualified. \nShe comes before us with a history of serving presently as a justice on \nthe Texas Supreme Court. She has been partner at a law firm and has \nhandled a broad range of legal matters. She has been admitted to \npractice at various State and Federal trial courts.\n  She is a leader in her community. I understand she teaches Sunday \nschool. She serves as the head of an altar guild. She is a great \nAmerican. She is well qualified. She has an opportunity now to serve on \nthe Federal bench. And all that is being sought is for this Senate to \ndo its constitutional duty.\n  I have made some of these remarks in regard to the Estrada \nnomination, and we may well be getting back to that. I fear we are \ngetting back to another filibuster, with my colleagues on the other \nside not allowing the Senate to do its business.\n  We have a lot of business to do in America. These are difficult times \nand challenging times. We have just seen the miracle of the American \nmilitary do great things in Iraq. But there is work to be done, and our \ncitizens at home are worried about jobs and worried about health care, \nworried about the future. We need to get to those issues. We can get to \nthose issues if we simply do our business and move on.\n  If you do not support Priscilla Owen, if you do not think she has the \nqualifications, if you do not agree with her principles, vote against \nher, but give us a chance to have a vote. That is my concern.\n  What we are doing here, and what we saw first happen with the Estrada \nnomination--and I fear we are stepping into the same swampland--is we \nare undermining the Constitution of this great country. The \nConstitution is one of those certifiable miracles of the modern age. It \nhas flourished and survived for 214 years. And I think providence has \ninspired it. When you think how delicate and finely balanced the \ndocument is, it has survived a Civil War, and several wise and unwise \nattempts to amend it, and many constitutional crises. That is our \nstrength. I think our adversaries do not understand the strength of \nthis country lies in this remarkable document and the care of our \nleaders to live within its boundaries.\n  That is why an attempt to tamper with this delicate balance of power \nmust be met with suspicion, and repelled with conviction. I said that \nin regard to Miguel Estrada. I say that in regard to Priscilla Owen: An \nattempt to tamper with the delicate balance of the Constitution must be \nmet with suspicion and repelled with conviction.\n  We have the opportunity to have endless debate in this body, but, in \nthe end, in the history of this country, we have had circuit court \nnominees getting a chance to be voted on. The Estrada nomination set a \nterrible new trend, one I hope we overcome. Never before have we had a \npartisan filibuster of a circuit court nominee, and now it appears we \nhave not one but two. Say it ain't so. Say it ain't so.\n  I told a story in regard to the Estrada nomination. I want to repeat \nthat story. It is a true story. A friend of mine who worked here for \nmany years gave it to me. He told me, many years ago, when the Senate \nwas the Supreme Court's upstairs neighbor in this building, a \nsignificant event took place which provides us with a further warning. \nA young architect of the Capitol wanted to improve the sight lines in \nthe Supreme Court Chamber on the first floor.\n\n  Calculating that one of the supporting pillars was unnecessary, he \nbrought in a crew to remove it from that Supreme Court Chamber. Halfway \nthrough the project, the ceiling fell in on the Supreme Court Chamber, \nwhich was also the floor of the Senate above, destroying both Chambers \nfor a while.\n  The lesson is when you tamper with one branch of Government, it can \naffect the others in ways you cannot anticipate. That is what is really \ngoing on here.\n  The Constitution of the United States gives this Senate the important \nauthority to advise and consent, and we do it by a majority vote. \nTreaties, on the other hand, require a supermajority. But when you have \na filibuster, as we have seen with Estrada, and we now, I fear, will \nsee with Priscilla Owen--and I hope not and again say: Say it ain't \nso--what happens is we are changing the constitutional standard.\n  You have to think about some of the consequences. Some of the obvious \nones. There may be some we do not see today. One of them is if this is \nnow the standard, that you need 60 votes, we are not going to get \nqualified and talented people to serve on our highest courts in the \nland. They are not going to make it through. I dare say, Justice Scalia \nwould probably not make it through. Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a liberal \nSupreme Court Justice, who graduated from the same high school I \ngraduated from in Brooklyn, New York, James Madison High School, may \nnot have made it through. Anybody who has been out there articulating a \nparticular position, a perspective, would not make it through.\n  Here is the fallacy of the argument of my distinguished colleagues on \nthe other side. They want fealty to their judicial philosophy. They \nwant the candidate to say: Here is a principle in\n\n[[Page S5524]]\n\nwhich I believe, and you have to tell me you believe in that. But that \nis not what our system is supposed to be. What judges are supposed to \ndo is not to say this is their own vision and their own view and their \nown philosophy, and regardless of what the constitution says, that is \nwhat they are going to apply. What the Constitution requires, what \nrules of court require, what we as Americans should require is that \njudges simply uphold the Constitution and to say they will follow \nestablished case law, that they will follow established precedence, by \nthe way, even if they do not agree with it.\n  That is what we require of judges. It is not about taking your own \njudicial philosophy and kind of driving it forward, come heck or high \nwater. It is about a willingness and a commitment to uphold judicial \nprecedent. That is what Justice Owen understands. That is what she \nrepresents. That is what Miguel Estrada represents.\n  We have business to pursue, important business. But of all the things \nwe do, if we take this Constitution and we disregard it, if we, in the \nhalls of this Senate Chamber, in the year 2003 simply say we are going \nto cast the Constitution aside, we are going to set a new standard--not \na majority but a supermajority, 60 votes--that we on one side--and this \ntime it is my distinguished colleagues across the aisle; they are going \nto turn down folks because they are not pledging abeyance, not giving \nfealty to their philosophy; and down the road, if there is a Democrat \nPresident who puts forth candidates, if the folks on our side say, hey, \nthe rules have been changed, the Constitution, we are no longer \nlistening to it, it is now 60 votes, and we are not going to approve \nanybody who is a Democrat who has some philosophies different than our \nown--our country is going to be in deep trouble.\n  I hope I get to serve in this institution a long time. The people of \nthe State of Minnesota have given me an opportunity to serve. They have \ngiven me at least 6 years. But I will tell you, I will try to conduct \nmyself in a way that when a candidate comes forward, I apply the same \nstandard, whether that candidate is being put forth by a Republican \nPresident or a Democratic President. That standard is pretty simple: \nAre they willing to commit themselves to follow established case law. \nDo they have the right kind of judicial temperament. And--again, we \nhave the American Bar Association giving the gold standard--then we \nshould not be having these debates right now. Again, let us be very \nwary of efforts to change the constitutional standards.\n  Let us discuss the merits of these nominees, their qualifications, \njudicial temperament, but then let us follow the constitutional process \nwe have followed for two centuries and vote yes or no on our advice and \nconsent to the President's nominee to the court of appeals.\n  I hope, Madam President, we give Justice Owen that right. I am going \nto be voting yea. My colleagues on the other side may disagree and vote \nnay, but let's make sure we get a vote, that we do not change the \nconstitutional standard.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of \nPriscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I begin by \nsaying, as have others, that the Senate has a constitutional obligation \nto advice and consent on a Federal judicial nominee. This is a \nresponsibility I take seriously, as do my Senate colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle. Unlike other nominations that come before the \nSenate such as ambassadorships or executive nominees, Federal judicial \nnominations are lifetime appointments. These are not decisions that \nwill affect our courts for 3 years or 4 years but, rather, 30 years or \n40 years, making it even more important that the Senate not act as a \nrubberstamp.\n  Having said that, to review the record of where we are under this \nPresident and his judicial nominations, to date the Senate has \nconfirmed 119 Federal justices and rejected two--not exactly a partisan \nexample of how we are moving forward on judgeships: 119 approved; two \nrejected. Ironically, one of those already rejected is the person now \nin front of the Senate again.\n  As a part of the important responsibility we have, I have examined \nJustice Owen's record. I am concerned that this is a nominee who has \nrepeatedly disregarded the language of the law and has instead \nsubstituted her own political and personal views. This is a nominee who \nhas been criticized by her own Republican colleagues on the bench for \nbeing a judicial activist. She is one who has consistently overreached \nin her decisions to justify her extreme personal positions.\n  I begin by talking briefly about the Texas Supreme Court. In Texas, \nSupreme Court judges are elected for 6-year terms. They run as party \ncandidates, as they do in many States, as Republicans or Democrats. \nThis is a conservative court and currently an all-Republican court. \nThis is important because when one reads Texas Supreme Court opinions, \nJustice Owen is outside of the mainstream even among those of her own \nparty who have been recognized as serving on a conservative court.\n  In fact, a review of the court's opinions shows that since Justice \nOwen joined the court in January of 1995 through June of 2002, just \nprior to her July 2002 judicial committee hearing, she was the second \nmost frequent dissenter among the justices then serving on the court. \nThe content of these dissents also shows that she is often out of touch \nwith the law and significantly more extreme than her Republican \ncolleagues on the court.\n  For example, in the 12 cases before her involving minors seeking \njudicial bypass to obtain an abortion under Texas parental notification \nlaws, Owen joined the majority in granting a bypass only once. That was \na case which was decided after her nomination to the Fifth Circuit.\n  In re Jane Doe 1, where a bypass was granted, the Republican majority \nopinion sharply rebuked Owen and the other dissenter's attempts to \nsubstitute their own personal views for the law instead of interpreting \nthe law itself. They stated:\n\n       We recognize that judges' personal views may inspire \n     inflammatory and irresponsible rhetoric. Nonetheless, the \n     issue's highly charged nature does not excuse judges who \n     impose their own personal convictions into what must be a \n     strictly legal inquiry.\n\n  Those are harsh words.\n\n       As judges, we cannot ignore the statute or the record \n     before us. Whatever our personal feelings may be, we \n     must respect the rule of law.\n\n  How many times have we heard colleagues speak about respecting the \nrule of law? Here was someone rebuked by her own Republican colleagues \nfor not respecting the rule of law.\n  In a concurring opinion on the same case, then Justice Alberto \nGonzales, the Bush administration's current White House counsel, \ndescribed the dissenters, including Justice Owen, as attempting to \nengage in ``an unconscionable act of judicial activism.'' These are the \nwords of the current White House counsel when he was serving with her, \nthat she attempted to engage in ``an unconscionable act of judicial \nactivism.'' Those are very powerful words.\n  This criticism is very serious. It does not come from Senators. It \ncomes from Justice Owen's own Republican colleagues. That is \nsignificant.\n  In another parental notification case, In re Jane Doe 3, the minor \ntestified that her father was an alcoholic who would take out his anger \ntoward his children by beating the mother. Justice Owen once again \nsubstituted her own personal views for the law and would have required \na higher evidentiary standard for showing the possibility of abuse \nunder the law. Republican Justice Enoch wrote, specifically to rebuke \nJustice Owen and her fellow dissenters for misconstruing the definition \nof the sort of abuse that may occur under the bypass law--a Republican \ncolleague on the bench--``Abuse is abuse. It is neither to be trifled \nwith nor its severity to be second-guessed.''\n  Justice Owen's judicial activism extends way beyond these cases. \nJustice Owen has been out of step with Republican justices of the Texas \nSupreme Court on everything from environmental cases to consumer \nprotection to workplace discrimination cases. In Read v. Scott Fetzer, \nKristi Read was raped in her home by a door-to-door salesman hired by \nthe Kirby vacuum distributor. If the distributor had conducted a \nbackground check or even checked the salesman's employment references, \nthey would have learned\n\n[[Page S5525]]\n\nthat women at his previous places of employment had complained about \nhis sexually inappropriate behavior and that he had pled guilty to a \ncharge of sexual indecency with a child and was fired as a result of \nthat incident.\n  The Republican majority in this case ruled that the victim was \nentitled to damages from the distributor that hired the salesman. \nJustice Owen, however, joined a dissenting opinion saying the victim \nwas not entitled to any damages from the distributor, arguing that \nsince the salesman was considered an independent contractor, the \ndistributor had no duty to perform any background checks. This is yet \nanother example where Priscilla Owen is out of step with even her \ncolleagues on the Texas Supreme Court, much less mainstream America.\n  President Bush has said he wants judges who are not judicial \nactivists and who will interpret the law, not make the law. Justice \nOwen fails this test by any measure. When one examines Justice Owen's \nrecord, her pattern of judicial activism becomes clear.\n  During her tenure on this conservative Republican court--and I say \nthat only to say that these were Republican colleagues on the court who \nwere making the statements about the inappropriate judicial activism--\nJustice Owen has dissented in 66 cases and has been criticized by her \ncolleagues, including White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales, on the \nbench for her judicial overreaching.\n  This is a nominee who has been divisive not only on the Texas Supreme \nCourt but in the U.S. Senate. I have received over 2,500 letters and e-\nmails from my constituents in Michigan opposing Priscilla Owen's \nnomination. I have received letters from over 60 different \norganizations, including civil rights groups, advocacy groups, women's \ngroups, environmental groups, and other citizens opposing this \nnomination.\n  In addition, Justice Owen's nomination was rejected last year by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, and her reconsideration is unprecedented. \nNever before has a nominee been voted on and rejected by the committee \nor the Senate and subsequently renominated for the same seat.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to say yes to a balanced Federal \njudiciary that will interpret and not make the law, and to say no to \nthe Owen nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some comments about \nPriscilla Owen. I could not disagree with my distinguished colleague \nmore. Priscilla Owen, I believe, is one of the great justices in \nAmerica. She has served on the Texas Supreme Court with distinction. \nShe has received support from all the Texas Supreme Court judges. They \nlike and admire her. She has an extraordinary record--a record of \npublic service and private litigation.\n  Her background and study capabilities have been reviewed by the \nAmerican Bar Association--the gold standard, the Democrats tell us, for \nwhether or not a person should be confirmed. They have--15 lawyers--\nreviewed her record. I think it is normally 15. They are lawyers in the \ncommunity and others who review the record. They interviewed litigants \nwho come before Judge Owen. They interviewed her law partners in the \nfirm where she worked as a private attorney. They interviewed opposing \nlawyers in cases she was on, judges in the community who know her, \nleaders of the bar association and presidents of the bar association. \nThey evaluate whether or not a judge is a fair and objective judge. \nAfter a complete evaluation of this excellent jurist's career, they \nhave unanimously voted that she is ``well qualified,'' which is the \nhighest rating they can give.\n  So to come in here and say she is an ``extremist'' who will not \nfollow the law and abuses the law is simply not correct. To just say \nthat she dissents on cases is not fair. Great judges who love the law \nand care about the law tend to dissent more. It is easy just to sign on \nto majority opinions. Judges who really care and are really concerned \ntend to review opinions and offer either concurring opinions or \nobjections. Oftentimes, that is a great compliment--that the jurist is \nconcerned about the law and wants to do it right.\n\n  Prior to her election in 1994 to the Supreme Court of Texas, she was \nwith the Houston law firm of Andrews and Kurth, where she practiced \ncommercial litigation for 17 years. In private practice, she handled a \nbroad range of civil matters at both the trial and appellate levels. \nShe was admitted to practice before various State and Federal courts, \nas well as U.S. courts of appeals--Federal courts--for the Fourth, \nFifth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits. She is nominated to be a member \nof what I call the old Fifth Circuit. Alabama and Georgia used to be in \nthe Fifth and they split.\n  Priscilla Owen is a member of the American Law Institute, American \nJudicature Society, American Bar Association, and a Fellow of the \nAmerican and Houston Bar Foundations. She was elected to the Supreme \nCourt of Texas in 2000, garnering 84 percent of the vote, having been \nendorsed by every major newspaper in Texas. A pretty good record. Is \nthis the record of some sort of extremist? No, it is not.\n  She served as a liaison to the Supreme Court of Texas's Court-Annexed \nMediation Task Force, and that is a good thing. We need to have more \nmediation and conciliation and less litigation, frankly. I am glad to \nsee she is concerned with that. She has been on statewide committees on \nproviding legal services to the poor and pro bono legal services. She \nwas part of a committee that successfully encouraged the Texas \nLegislature to enact legislation that has resulted in millions of \ndollars a year in additional funds for providers of legal services to \nthe poor.\n  Priscilla Owen also served as a member of the board of the A.A. White \nDispute Resolution Institute. Additionally, Judge Owen was instrumental \nin organizing a group known as Family Law 2000--an interesting group. \nIt seeks to find ways to educate parents about the effects a \ndissolution of a marriage can have on children, and to lessen the \nadversarial nature of legal proceedings while a marriage is being \ndissolved. This is a lady who cares about children, who cares about \nfamilies, and wants to do the right thing for them.\n  Among her community activities, Justice Owen served on the Board of \nTexas Hearing and Service Dogs for the Disabled. She is a member of the \nSt. Barnabas Episcopal Mission in Austin, TX, where she teaches Sunday \nschool and serves as head of the altar guild. I guess some might think \nthat maybe she is too religious. We are hearing complaints about that \ntoday. I, frankly, think that being a member of the Episcopal mission, \nserving on the altar guild, and being a Sunday school teacher is an \nhonorable thing to be recognized and is a positive contribution to the \ncommunity. I suggest it demonstrates certain values.\n  She has a tremendous academic record. She earned her bachelor's \ndegree cum laude from Baylor University, where she also graduated from \nlaw school, in 1977, cum laude with honors. She was a member of the \nBaylor Law Review, for graduating seniors or juniors to participating \nin the school's law review, is the highest honor a good law student can \nreceive. It goes beyond grades, but grades are an important part of it. \nShe was honored as the Baylor Young Lawyer of the Year and received the \nBaylor University Outstanding Young Alumna award.\n  If anybody has any doubts about her abilities--and you cannot always \ntell from grades--she made the highest score in the State of Texas on \nthe bar exam. I am telling you, they have people from Harvard, Yale, \nthe University of Texas, and all of those schools taking this exam. She \nmade the highest score on the Texas bar exam. I suggest to you there \nwere some talented people taking that exam. She made the highest \npossible score. She has the intellectual capabilities that everybody \nwho knows her says she has.\n  So what does this boil down to? It boils down to a complaint about \nher interpretation of a poorly written--because I was at the committee \nhearing--Texas statute dealing with parental notification. The Supreme \nCourt of the United States and 80 percent of the American people \nbelieve that if a young minor, a child, is contemplating an abortion, \nshe ought not to be able to go to the abortion doctor and have that \ndone without at least notifying her parents.\n\n[[Page S5526]]\n\n  Parents love children. I know there are some parents who are abusive \nand there are difficult circumstances, but most parents are not that \nway. Most parents love their children. Most parents would be helpful to \na child who has difficulties and most parents would be able to discuss \nthat with them in a rational way.\n  The Texas law was attempting to provide that. It was not a bad law, \nbut it was not written with sufficient clarity that a group of judges \ncould get together and always agree on exactly what it meant. Anybody \nhere knows if someone practices law that those circumstances happen. So \nthis is basically what the complaint about her is, over this one \nsubject.\n  A parental notification law says a parent of a young minor girl \nseeking an abortion should be notified if the teenager is going to have \nthe abortion. Notification does not mean a parent has to agree to the \nabortion, or to even say it is okay. That would be a consent \nrequirement. Parental notification laws do not require consent. \nNotification is simply telling a parent a child is about to undergo a \nmajor medical procedure.\n  School teachers will not allow a child to take an aspirin without \ncalling the parent, and yet the pro-abortionists think it is perfectly \nall right for a 13, 14 or 15-year-old, who has gotten themselves in \ntrouble, gotten themselves pregnant, that they should not even tell \ntheir parents and go off with some older man perhaps and conduct this \nprocedure. That is the sad reality of it.\n  So even if a parent were to object to this abortion, the teenager \ncould still go forward with it. It would not stand in the way of them \ngoing to an abortion clinic.\n  Eighty percent of Americans believe that it is appropriate that \nparents should get notification. Let me explain how these laws work in \nTexas. If a teenage girl becomes pregnant and does not want to follow \nthe notification law to give her parents an FYI, she is allowed to \npetition the court for a waiver. In other words, she can go to the \ncourt and say, judge, I do not want to have to tell my parents I am \npregnant and I am contemplating an abortion. Tell me I do not have to \ndo so. Give me authority not to do so.\n  She might want the waiver for several reasons. She might be afraid to \ntell her parents because she is afraid they would become angry or \nbecause there might be violence.\n  A teenage girl is given an opportunity to explain to a trial judge \nwhat her problem with notification is and to demonstrate to the judge \nshe is mature enough to make a decision on her own. That is what the \nTexas law provides. A trial court hears that and he observes the \nteenager. The trial judge sees the teenager personally and is able to \nenter into a discussion and colloquy with her. After discussing the \nsteps she has taken to become informed, such as talking to a counselor \nor considering alternatives to an abortion, the judge makes a decision \non whether or not the waiver should be granted and whether the girl \nshould be allowed to have an abortion without the knowledge of a \nparent.\n  Because some of my colleagues seem to be so determined about their \nsupport of abortion on demand, I assume they consider this as a right \nof privacy or something, they insist that no one, for any reason, can \neven be advised that a minor child would have an abortion. They are not \nhappy with these laws and object to these laws. The National Abortion \nRights League and that type of group have opposed these laws, but these \nlaws have been supported by the American people consistently and they \nhave passed.\n  But I guess they would want the judge to grant a waiver in every \nsingle case. Well, I do not think anyone would say the court should \ngrant a waiver in every case. Every case is different. So each case \nshould be evaluated and be ruled on on the merits. It is the court's \nduty to examine the facts in each waiver case to determine if the \nwaiver is suitable. That is what a judge does.\n  If the teenager goes before the trial court and the trial court \ngrants her waiver and says you do not have to notify your parents, she \ncan get an abortion without notifying either one of her parents. If the \ntrial court denies that waiver after a hearing and says she should tell \nthe parents, the teenager can either notify one of the parents or can \nappeal to the court of civil appeals.\n  At the court of civil appeals level, a minimum of at least three \njudges review the record of the trial judge to determine whether or not \nthe judge made an error and whether or not the teenager should be able \nto have an abortion without notifying either parent. The judges look \nagain at the reason behind the waiver request, the maturity of the \nteenager and her decision-making process. After a complete review of \nthe trial judge's decision, the appeals court either grants the waiver \nand allows the abortion to go forward without notification or affirms \nthe trial court's denial.\n  If the court of appeals denies the waiver, the girl either notifies \none of her parents or can appeal to the state supreme court, such as \nthe Texas Supreme Court where Justice Owen sits.\n  So by the time this case reaches the supreme court where Justice Owen \nsits, at least four judges will have either seen the teenager or \nreviewed the record carefully and ruled a notification should be made \nto at least one parent before an abortion takes place. So that is how \nthe system works. By the time the case reaches the Texas Supreme Court, \ntwo other lower courts will have already said the girl should provide \nthe parents the courtesy of telling them their daughter is about to \nundergo such a major operation.\n  So this is what the issue is all about. This is what the opponents \nare unhappy about, and they talk about it aggressively.\n  Justice Owen has never made an initial decision to deny a waiver. Her \nposition on the Texas Supreme Court does not permit that. Her position \nonly allows her to review denials of waivers already made by lower \ncourts. In upholding the lower court's denial of a waiver, Justice Owen \nis only agreeing with the trial judge, the judge who had the \nopportunity to visualize and see the teenager and to observe her, and \nalso the judges on the court of appeals, the intermediate level court. \nJustice Owen simply did what appellate judges do. Appellate judges \nallow the trial court to be the trier of fact and in most instances \nonly review their decisions on abuse of discretion grounds.\n  So to break it down, Justice Owen merely ruled in a few parental \nnotification cases that a trial judge and at least three judges on the \ncourt of civil appeals did not abuse their discretion by having a \nteenage girl notify her parents she intended to have an abortion. That \nis, I submit, far from being some sort of judicial activist, rogue \njudge who does not adhere to the law.\n  An FYI to a parent before a major surgery, that is what this \nfilibuster is all about. Some of my colleagues are really strongly \ncommitted to an almost absolutist position on abortion. They oppose \nlimiting partial-birth abortion. They oppose any limitation whatever.\n\n  Now we are at the point of seeing this sterling nominee, so well \nqualified, subjected to a filibuster because she did her best to \nevaluate and interpret the Texas law. In each case, her decision was in \nconjunction with and to affirm the decision of a trial judge and a \nthree-judge civil appeals panel below her.\n  When my colleagues talk about being out of the mainstream, I suggest \nthey should look at themselves. This accusation against Justice Owen is \nthe only thing that is out of the mainstream. We are not talking about \nrequiring parental consent for abortions. We are only talking about \nnotice. If a parent objects, a doctor is still required to perform the \nabortion and allowed to perform the abortion if the child wants. In \nJustice Owen's State of Texas, the law does not allow a teenager to get \nan aspirin in school without parental consent. If a teenager wants to \nget a tattoo, the law requires parental consent. If a teenage girl \nwants to get her ear pierced, parental consent is required. So if a \ngirl wants to take an aspirin in school, get a tattoo or have her ear \npierced, her parents not only have to have notification, they have to \nconsent. They have to sign off on it. That is not the case with \nabortion. In my view, giving a parent notice about an abortion for a \nteenage girl is nowhere outside the mainstream of American policy or \nAmerican law.\n  Justice Owen is one of the finest nominees this Senate has ever had \nthe opportunity to consider. For her nomination to be filibustered is \nan atrocity\n\n[[Page S5527]]\n\nof the confirmation process and to the tradition of this Senate. I \nstrongly support her confirmation. I believe if logic and reason \nprevail, we will confirm her instead of filibustering this nomination.\n  This nominee is sterling. She has the highest possible rating of her \npeers. She has performed as one of Texas's finest litigators and has \nwon election to the Supreme Court of Texas with 80 percent of the vote, \nhaving the support of every major newspaper in her State. I find it \ndifficult to see how we now are not even allowing her to have a vote in \nthis body.\n  They say she was rejected once. I was on the committee. That was when \nthe Democrats were in the majority. They voted a straight party line in \ncommittee after I thought she testified brilliantly in examination. \nThat never happened in the 8 years President Clinton was President.\n  Never did we vote down a nominee in committee on a party-line vote. \nThey say, well, only two of them have been blocked here. In 8 years, \nthere were 377 confirmations of President Clinton's judges. One was \nvoted down. None were voted down in committee. She was voted down on a \nparty-line vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, but she had not been \nrejected by the full committee.\n  If they think she is going to be rejected again, why don't they let \nus have a vote? Let's vote on it. I suggest this nominee is going to \nwin a majority of the votes in this Senate.\n  The Constitution makes clear that the Senate has an advice and \nconsent power. It notes, with regard to treaties, that the Senate shall \nadvise and consent provided two-thirds agree. Then with regard to the \nconfirmation of all other offices, it just says the Senate shall advise \nand consent.\n  Since the founding of this country, we have understood that to mean \nthe Senate will have a majority vote on the confirmation. There is no \nother logical thing it could mean. So now we have ratcheted up the \ngame.\n  I recall distinctly a little over 2 years ago when my Democrat \ncolleagues went to a private retreat. A number of law professors, \nLawrence Tribe, Cass Sunstein, and Marsha Greenberg went there, \nprofessors all who advised them to change the ground rules on the \njudicial nominations. It is written in the New York Times. Since then, \nthere has been a systematic change in the ground rules of judicial \nconfirmations. When they had the majority, they attempted to kill \nnominees in committee on a party-line vote, which had never been done \nbefore. And now, amazingly, they are going to the filibuster.\n\n  The American people need to understand something important. In the \nhistory of this country, there has never been a filibuster of a circuit \nor district judge. Never. It has always been an up-or-down vote.\n  I remember when some did not like some of President Clinton's judges \nand they said we should filibuster; Chairman Hatch said, No, we do not \nfilibuster judges.\n  When holds went on too long--the way you defeat a hold is to file a \nmotion for cloture--and a cloture vote was moved for by Republican \nleader Trent Lott to bring up Democratic Bill Clinton's judges. I voted \nfor cloture on each one of them. Sometimes I voted against the judge, \nbut I voted for cloture to bring the vote up because I did not want to \nparticipate in a filibuster.\n  We have a big deal here. Why someone would seek out this magnificent \nnominee, this person who is not only qualified for the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals but qualified to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, and \nfilibuster their nomination, is beyond me. It is just beyond me.\n  I conclude by saying I spent over 15 years of my professional career \ntrying cases in Federal court as a U.S. attorney and assistant U.S. \nattorney. I appeared before courts of appeal. I wrote briefs to courts \nof appeal. I appeared before Federal judges. I think I have looked at \nher record carefully. I have heard the explanations she has made in \ncommittee. I think they are imminently sound and reasonable. I think \nPresident Bush could not have found a finer nominee. I have every \nconfidence that she would be a superior judge on the court of appeals, \nand I am absolutely confident, were she given an up-or-down vote, she \nwould be confirmed.\n  We need to take seriously our responsibilities here. Let's have an \nup-or-down vote. Let's confirm this fine nominee. She will serve us and \nAmerica well.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the past 2 days, we have been working \non an agreement looking for an orderly, systematic process by which we \ncould consider some of the pending judicial nominations. It had been \nour hope we could reach an agreement to consider these nominations this \nweek and early next week. Unfortunately, after a lot of discussions--\nand we worked on both sides of the aisle in good faith--but after a lot \nof discussions, it does not appear we will be able to reach the consent \nagreement.\n  On our side, we have been prepared to consider and vote on all of the \ncircuit court nominations that are on the calendar now. I believe my \nDemocratic colleagues, at this point, are prepared to vote on just one \nof these judges. Therefore, unless we can reach a consent agreement \ntomorrow, following the cloture vote in the morning on the pending Owen \nnomination, it will be my intention to proceed to the Prado nomination. \nAnd following disposition of the Prado nomination, it would be my \nexpectation to proceed to the Cook nomination. I hope both of these \nnominations, which have received, by the way, bipartisan support, will \nbe considered and confirmed this week.\n  I think at this point I will go ahead and put forth the unanimous \nconsent request. And then we will have some comment and discussion \nabout where we are.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, at a time \ndetermined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session and the \nconsideration of calendar No. 105, the nomination of Edward Prado, of \nTexas, for the Fifth Circuit; further, that there be 3 hours for \ndebate, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member or \ntheir designees; I further ask consent that following the use or \nyielding back of time, the Senate vote, without intervening action, on \nthe confirmation of calendar No. 105; I further ask consent that \nfollowing the vote, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that on Monday, May 5, at a time to \nbe determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, the Senate proceed to executive session for the \nconsideration of calendar No. 34, the nomination of Deborah Cook, of \nOhio, to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Sixth Circuit; provided \nfurther, that there be 4 hours for debate, equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking member or their designees; further, I ask consent \nthat following the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, again, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that when the Judiciary Committee \nreports the Roberts nomination, it be in order for the majority leader \nto proceed to its consideration, and it be considered under a 2-hour \ntime limitation, and that following that time, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the confirmation, with no intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have, along \nwith Senator Daschle, worked very hard on this request the majority \nleader has read into the Record. Senator McConnell and the majority \nleader have also worked very hard. Over the years I have been involved \nin other matters where we have had very complicated, substantive issues \nwe have been able to work out. I am very disappointed we\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\ncannot work this out because this really does not compare to some of \nthe difficult issues we have been able to resolve previously. But we \nhave not been able to resolve this.\n\n  I am really disappointed for a number of reasons. It involves \nindividual Senators who have also devoted a lot of time on this issue, \nboth Democrats and Republicans. But if there were ever an effort in \ngood faith by the two sides, this has been it.\n  I hope my objection, which I will enter in just a few moments, will \nnot be the end of this. I hope we can, with a night's rest, work \nsomething out. For the last two nights we have come within a whisker of \nan agreement on these three judges. But in the Senate sometimes a \nwhisker stops us, and it has done that.\n  So I reluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, I share \nhis frustration. These are three nominations that are going to be \napproved, one of them probably unanimously. The assistant Democratic \nleader and I have wrestled around with this now for the last 2 days, \nand we find ourselves still not in a position to lock in a vote on Cook \nand Roberts.\n  So tomorrow is another day, and we will try again. But it is sort of \nan indication of where the Senate stands these days, that even in a \nsituation where you have three judges we know are going to be \nconfirmed, we have not been able to reach an agreement after 2 days' \nwork to conclude the inevitable, which is confirmation of these three \njudges.\n  Hopefully tomorrow will bring better results.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am very hopeful we will be able to make \nprogress. Again, the three Senators who are speaking now, with Senator \nDaschle, have been working very hard with our colleagues to try to \nreach an agreement. But we have been unsuccessful. We will keep moving \nahead, and I am optimistic these three nominees will be confirmed \nshortly.\n  I do want to add, really for the benefit of my colleagues, that \nprogress is being made. As my colleagues know, one of the nominees, \nRoberts, went back to committee, and the understanding was that with \nhim going back to committee, we would have votes, up-or-down votes, on \nboth Roberts and Cook. That is the background. We have been working on \nthat for actually several weeks, and that process is underway. So we \nlook forward to having that become a reality.\n  That first step, with Roberts going back to committee, was taken. And \nnow the expectation is, and the general agreement is, we are moving in \nthe direction that we will, at some point in time--we have not been \nable to lock in the time--have votes on both Roberts and Cook.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the majority leader will yield, I know \nthe hour is late. I don't want to talk longer than necessary. I just \nwant the record to be spread with the fact that we have a couple of \nSenators who have a different understanding as to what the majority \nleader and the minority leader and Senator McConnell and I thought had \nbeen agreed to. Senator McConnell was not on the floor; just the three \nof us thought it had been agreed to. There is an honest dispute as to a \nfact or two. This is just me speaking personally, not for my \ncolleagues. I really think we should be able to work our way through \nthis. It should not be as difficult as it is.\n  The Democratic leader and I acknowledge that the majority leader \nintervened right before the recess to get Roberts back for a hearing. \nWe know that wasn't easy for him to do. We acknowledge that. We \nappreciate that. And we hope we can resolve this procedural quagmire. \nThere certainly has been no bad faith by the leadership on the \nRepublican side or the Democratic side.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me say, once again, that we will have a \ncloture vote on Owen tomorrow. And if cloture fails, we will go to \nPrado and, once Prado is completed, go to the Cook nomination. That \nwill be the general plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5528-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise in morning business for a moment to \nspeak about the nomination of Priscilla Owen of Texas to the Federal \nbench.\n  This is really an extraordinary nomination. It is very troubling to \nme that it appears most of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are willing to keep Justice Owen from getting a vote. In the \npast, even with very controversial votes on Justices to the Supreme \nCourt--and I have, for example, Justice Clarence Thomas in mind, and \nthere was significant opposition to the confirming of Justice Thomas, \nprimarily by Members of the other side of the aisle--the leaders of the \nDemocratic Party understood that tradition called for a vote--probably \nknowing they would lose the vote. They, nevertheless, refused to \nsupport any kind of filibuster and they voted against Justice Thomas's \nconfirmation. But he was confirmed 52-48.\n  I always respected the things they said at or about the time of that \nconfirmation--that they would not ever support a filibuster, regardless \nof their particular feelings about the nominee. I thought that took \ncourage, and I respected it, coming, as it did, from some of the key \nleaders of the Democratic side of the Senate. It confirmed to me that \nthe tradition of the Senate relationship of comity we have with the \nPresident in dealing with his nominees, and the importance of our \nresponsibilities with respect to confirming Justices of the Supreme \nCourt and members of the Federal bench generally, is such that \npartisanship and tactical advantage could be laid to the side for the \ngood of the country and these nominations could be voted on.\n  Now, there have been votes--sometimes--where the nominee lost. Most \nof the time, when votes are allowed to happen, the nominees prevail. \nBut the new situation we have in this body, starting out with the \nPresident's nomination of Miguel Estrada--and now sadly, it seems, with \nthe nomination of Priscilla Owen--we are going to require that unless \n60 Members of the Senate agree to allow a vote, we don't get a vote. A \nfilibuster, in other words, becomes the benchmark, the standard for \nconfirmation of judges.\n  It has never been that way. There has only been one successful \nfilibuster, and that was a very strange situation. There has never been \na partisan filibuster in this body until now. It is especially \nremarkable because, in the case of Justice Owen, for example, one \ncannot claim, as has been claimed with regard to Miguel Estrada, that \nher record is unknown or unclear, or that there is more information \nthat needs to be gleaned. She appeared not once but twice before the \nJudiciary Committee. The reason I wanted to take the floor briefly \ntoday is to say to my friends I don't think I have ever seen a nominee \nwho handled herself or himself better than Justice Owen did at those \nhearings. She was forthcoming, brilliant in her exposition of the law, \nmeasured, and she clearly has the temperament to be a good judge.\n  She has been serving as a justice of the State Supreme Court of \nTexas. She has the support of another former justice of that court, \nJudge Gonzales, who obviously is now acting as the President's counsel, \nand the support of Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  The American Bar Association, as with Miguel Estrada, has recommended \nher for confirmation. She stayed at the hearing for as long as Members \nwanted her to stay. She answered all of the questions. So the same \nargument cannot be made that has been made about Miguel Estrada.\n  In fact, one of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle made it \nclear, in discussing the nomination of Miguel Estrada, that the only \nthing standing in the way of a vote--they would not necessarily commit \nto voting for him but at least allowing a vote on him--was producing \nthis information which they say they want from the Justice\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n\nDepartment about his prior employment. But for that, that vote could \noccur, seeming to suggest that the same thing would be the case with \nany other nominee--that as long as the information was forthcoming and \nthey knew about the individual, that therefore they could vote.\n  In fact, the last line, after this colleague talked to others in the \nDemocratic Party, states: Look, if we can just get this information, do \nyou think we can vote? And the answer was: Affirmative, to a person, \nbecause, frankly, then we would know for whom we were voting.\n  There was no commitment to vote for Miguel Estrada but at least they \nwould allow the vote to go forward because they would then know ``for \nwhom we are voting.''\n  Well, we do know who we are voting for in the case of Justice Owen. \nHer record is out there for everyone to see. There has never been a \nsuggestion by anybody that she needs to produce more in the way of a \nrecord. It is there to be evaluated.\n  I suspect the reason Members on the other side of the aisle will not \nallow her to come to a vote is because they fear she will be more \nconservative as a justice than they would like to see. Let's be honest \nabout it.\n  I voted for numerous circuit court nominees of President Clinton \nknowing they were far more liberal than I am. On my own circuit, the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals, I voted for several who I knew were \nmore liberal, and their voting record subsequently has borne that. They \nwere confirmed. I voted for them. I felt President Clinton was the \nPresident; he was elected by all of the people. He had the right to \nnominate his own people, and if they were otherwise qualified, then I \nought to vote for them. That has always been the tradition, that has \nalways been the standard, by which we have judged these candidates for \ncircuit court. So it is very troubling now to have a new standard \nimposed on us.\n  I come this morning to note that we are soon going to go back to the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen. I implore my colleagues to think about \nwhat they are doing by creating the 60-vote standard. There is no way \nthat can be the standard only for Republican Presidents and not \nDemocratic Presidents. It is either going to be the standard or it is \nnot. If it becomes the standard for all Presidents, then I believe it \nis only a very short period of time before the confirmation process is \ngoing to grind to a halt because there will always be political \ndifferences.\n  By and large, that is what divides the Democrat and Republican \nParties. We view life a little bit differently. We are all great \nAmericans. We all support the troops and all want the judiciary to \nsucceed, but we have some philosophical differences. That is fine, but \nthey should not be the basis for not confirming judges or, more \nimportantly, for requiring 60 votes to confirm because it is a very \nrare Senate in which one party has more than 60 votes in controlling \nthe Senate. So it is basically going to grind the confirmation process \nto a halt.\n\n  That is a breach of our comity to the judicial branch; it is a breach \nof our obligations to the American people, to ensure justice is done. \nWe know that justice delayed is justice denied. We have already heard \nfrom the Supreme Court Chief Justice about the emergencies that exist \nbecause we cannot fill these vacancies.\n  We have a crisis. We have to find a way to resolve this crisis. I \nsuggest that the simplest way to do this, that is fair to everybody, is \nthe way we have always done it: Express yourself, allow the vote to \noccur, vote your conscience and then move on. But do not hold up the \nvotes simply because you have a philosophical disagreement with the \nPresident who nominates these candidates.\n  I urge my colleagues to think carefully because in the case of \nPriscilla Owen, as the bar association found, as the Judiciary \nCommittee concluded in its most recent action by passing her out on the \nExecutive Calendar, she is a fine justice. She would make a fine member \nof the Federal bench. There is no legitimate reason to oppose her.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about this as we focus on her \nqualifications, on the relationship between the Senate and the House, \nand on the obligation we have to the courts and to the American people. \nThis is serious and we ought to be acting in a serious way. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5529-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO EMILIE WANDERER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Emilie \nWanderer, of Henderson, NV, on the occasion of her 101st birthday, \nwhich she celebrated earlier this month.\n  Emilie Wanderer is the oldest member of the Nevada bar, but her \nsignificance goes well beyond her longevity. She both contributed to, \nand exemplifies, the progress our society has made in terms of quality. \nShe broke down barriers for herself and for others. During a time when \nmany women were discouraged from pursuing higher education and many \nwere excluded from professional opportunities, Emilie Wanderer embarked \non a legal career in addition to raising her children.\n  Her noteworthy accomplishments include becoming the first woman to \npractice law in Las Vegas, being the first woman to run for district \njudge in Nevada, and joining with her son John Wanderer in the first \nmother-son legal practice in the State. She has been an inspiration and \na role model for Nevadans, especially for women pursuing careers in \nfields traditionally dominated by men.\n  Through her legal work and through her life, she has made our State a \nbetter, kinder, fairer, and more just place.\n  Emilie Wanderer is considered a legend in the southern Nevada civil \nrights community. Several decades ago, racism and segregation plagued \nLas Vegas like so many places throughout America. Earlier this year \nwhen we celebrated African American History Month we rightfully \nrecalled the role that Black leaders played in the civil rights \nmovement, but I think it is important also to recognize that some \nwhites--not only famous and prominent people but also those who never \nreceived much attention or credit--were committed to the pursuit of \njustice and fairness.\n  Emilie Wanderer is one such person who helped bring about progress in \nrace relations in Nevada. Early in her career, she served as legal \ncounsel for the Nevada chapter of the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored People, and she held NAACP meetings within her \nown home, even at the risk of harassment, threats and intimidation. She \nbelieved it was the right thing to do, and she had the courage of her \nconvictions.\n  Emilie Wanderer's commitment to, and contributions to, promoting \nsocial justice and securing equal rights for all the people of Nevada \ndeserve to be recognized and praised. On behalf of our State, I thank \nher and send my best wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5529-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5529-S5530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING THE 35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEATH OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, \n                                  JR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 35 years ago on April 4, 1968, Martin \nLuther King, Jr.'s life was tragically cut short by an assassin's \nbullet. Dr. King was just 39 years old. In 1963, Dr. King delivered a \nfuneral eulogy for the children who were killed by a firebomb at the \n16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Dr. King said: \n``Your children did not live long, but they lived well. The quantity of \ntheir lives was disturbingly small, but the quality of their lives was \nmagnificently big.'' Dr. King's own words could be said about himself.\n  Only three Americans have ever had a Federal holiday named for them \nby Congress. Two were presidents George Washington helped create our \nNation and Abraham Lincoln helped preserve it. The third, Martin Luther \nKing, Jr., never held an elected office but he redeemed the moral \npurpose of the United States. He reminded us that since we are all \ncreated equal, all of us are equally entitled to be treated with \ndignity, fairness, and humanity.\n  Last month I had an opportunity to visit the State of Alabama for the \nfirst time. I went there with Democratic and Republican Members of \nCongress, on a delegation led by Republican John Lewis from Atlanta, \nGA. We paid a visit to some of the most important spots in American \ncivil rights history. Dr. King's fingerprints are on these and \ncountless other watershed events in American civil rights history.\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\n  We went to Montgomery and stood on the street corner where Rosa Parks \nboarded the bus in 1955 and refused to give up her seat to a white \nrider, as was required by city law. After Rosa Parks was arrested, Dr. \nKing led a bus boycott in Montgomery, where he had just moved for his \nfirst pastorate.\n  We went to Birmingham and visited the 16th Street Baptist Church. \nBefore the tragic bombing in 1963, the church had been used for civil \nrights rallies and desegregation protests, and Dr. King had spoken \nthere and throughout Birmingham on many occasions. He wrote his famous \n``Letter from a Birmingham Jail'' 40 years ago after being arrested for \nleading a protest in April 1963. We went to Selma and stood at the spot \non the Edmund Pettus Bridge where, in 1965, a young John Lewis was \nbeaten unconscious by Alabama State troopers, at the time the 52-mile \nvoting rights march from Selma to Montgomery was turned back. In \nresponse, Dr. King led a second march, and these brave actions led to \nCongressional passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Dr. King is the \npre-eminent civil rights figure in our Nation's history, but he would \nnot have been as successful had it not been for a handful of courageous \nfederal judges who despite death threats to themselves and family \nmembers used the judiciary to help dismantle the legacy of Jim Crow. \nFor example, Alabama Judge Frank Johnson was part of a three-judge \npanel that struck down Montgomery's bus-segregation law, holding that \nseparate but equal facilities were violations of the due process and \nequal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. And after \nGovernor George Wallace banned the Selma-to-Montgomery march, Judge \nJohnson issued the order that allowed Dr. King and Rep. Lewis to \nconduct the march, calling the right to march ``commensurate with the \nenormity of the wrongs that are being protested.'' Dr. King called \nJudge Johnson a jurist who had ``given true meaning to the word \n`justice.'''\n  Dr. King was keenly aware of the importance of the federal judiciary \nto ensure equality and justice in our society. In a 1958 speech at Beth \nEmet synagogue in Evanston, Illinois, Dr. King said: ``As we look to \nWashington, so often it seems that the judicial branch of the \nGovernment is fighting the battle alone. The executive and legislative \nbranches of the Government have been all too slow and stagnant and \nsilent, and even apathetic, at points. The hour has come now for the \nfederal government to use its power, its constitutional power, to \nenforce the law of the land.''\n  Regrettably, President George W. Bush has been appointing Federal \njudges who have tried to limit the ability of the federal government to \nuse its constitutional power to enforce the law of the land. Many of \nhis judicial nominees are conservative ideologues who believe that the \nFederal Government lacks the constitutional power to provide meaningful \nremedies and access to the courts for victims of discrimination. In the \nname of States rights, these nominees have urged federal courts to \nstrip Congress of its powers and citizens of their remedies. I question \nwhether the President is appointing men and women to the federal \njudiciary who will make courageous decisions and, in the words of Dr. \nKing, give true meaning to the word justice.\n  Despite this unfortunate trend, I think Dr. King would have remained \noptimistic. In a 1965 speech of Dr. King's entitled ``A Long, Long Way \nto Go''--published for the first time this month in a new book called \n``Ripples of Hope: Great American Civil Rights Speeches''--Dr. King \nsaid:\n\n       There are dark moments in this struggle, but I want to tell \n     you that I've seen it over and over again, that so often the \n     darkest hour is that hour that just appears before the dawn \n     of a new fulfillment.\n\n  Dr. King's optimism in the face of dark moments is one of his \nenduring legacies. On this 35th anniversary of his death, I pay tribute \nto his optimism, courage, and heroism that transformed our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5530-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5530-S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LETTER FROM A CONNECTICUT SAILOR\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, we are all so proud of the American men \nand women in uniform who risked and gave their lives to liberate the \nIraqi people. They performed bravely and brilliantly, proving once \nagain that there has never been a fighting force in the history of the \nworld as well trained, well equipped, and well motivated as the United \nStates of America's.\n  Of course, their work is not done. Far from it: serious danger \nremains. Winning the peace will take a sustained commitment. But we can \nalready look back with so much gratitude at the sacrifices the men and \nwomen of our Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard have made \nfor our security and the security of the world.\n  In my service in the Senate and on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I have heard countless stories of the heroism of those who \nprotect us. But just when you think nothing can deepen your conviction \nabout the extraordinary character of these men and women, something \ndoes. Two proud parents from Bristol, CT, passed on to me a letter \nwritten on February 15, 2003, by their daughter, Barbara. She is an \nOperations Specialist Second Class in the U.S. Navy she was Third Class \nwhen she wrote it--serving aboard the U.S.S. Pearl Harbor, which was \nthen on deployment to the Middle East. The letter was sent to a \nnewspaper in reaction to some coverage that Barbara had read about war \nprotests here at home. In it, Barbara explains, more eloquently than I \never could, what drives those who risk their lives for our freedom, and \nshe reminds us of the unbreakable bonds between those serving half a \nworld away and our communities here at home.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Editor,\n       I currently serve as an Operations Specialist 3rd class in \n     the United States Navy, and there are a few things I would \n     like to clear up for you and for everyone. I serve my country \n     for many reasons, some of which include: pride, love and \n     responsibility. Let me explain\n       I am proud to be an American. It may sound cliche, but it's \n     true. I am proud to be a part of the greatest and strongest \n     nation in the world, and I am proud to serve her. It is my \n     duty and my privilege to serve in the United States Military, \n     and I am thankful for the chance to do so. I am by no means \n     an exemplary sailor; by anyone's standards I'm mediocre at \n     best. However, I do what I can. I was raised to be thankful \n     for the freedoms that we, as Americans, take for granted on a \n     daily basis: the freedom of speech, the freedom of religion, \n     the freedom to bear arms and many more. Many countries around \n     the world laugh at our government for allowing us these \n     `privileges' that we take for granted. After all, they ask, \n     how can you maintain authority when dissent is allowed? But \n     we say, how can you not? And that is what makes our country \n     great.\n       I am not a warmonger, nor a dissenter. I do not carry guns \n     or cry `fire' in a crowded theater. I am simply someone who \n     realizes that these freedoms that we cherish are not free of \n     cost. I am aware that the cost these freedoms is human lives. \n     A familiar saying, often attributed to Voltaire, captures the \n     spirit of the American military perfectly: ``I [may] \n     disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death \n     your right to say it.''\n       Every day we hear reports of people speaking out against \n     the U.S. military, saying that we spend too much, waste too \n     much, and are an archaic set of muscles our government flexes \n     to tell the world that we are still pertinent. I disagree \n     wholeheartedly for one reason: If I were not here spending \n     too much, wasting too much, and flexing my protective \n     muscles, then they would not be able to say that. If they \n     lived in a country like Iraq, they and their families could \n     be put to death for saying that. Think about that before you \n     say that we should do nothing. Think also that the man who \n     runs that country, Saddam Hussein, is building long-range \n     weapons and weapons of mass destruction, intending to aim \n     them at us.\n       I love my country, and I love my family and friends. I \n     would rather die than see either of them hurt. I would rather \n     put my life on the line so that they don't have to. That is \n     why I am here on a ship, ready to go to into danger. I'm not \n     saying I'm not scared; I'm terrified. However, I'm more \n     scared of inaction. More scared that if I don't do this, then \n     this man will reach out his hand from his palace and try to \n     hurt the ones I love. I will not allow that to happen. I am \n     on my way, right now, to stand ready to remove this man from \n     power before he can hurt the people I hold dear. Right now, \n     the man I love is over there getting ready to stand against \n     those who wish to hurt the people we love. I pray every day \n     that this does not come to war. I do not want to fight, and I \n     do not want my love to be in harm's way. However, we have \n     already made our decisions. We have realized that inaction \n     now will lead to greater bloodshed farther down the road, and \n     we will\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\n     do anything to protect the lives of our fellow countrymen. \n     This is our mission.\n       I believe every American has a responsibility to America. I \n     don't mean that everyone should join the military. The \n     military life is a hard one, and not a path easily trod. Once \n     my four years are completed, I will more than likely rejoin \n     the ranks of civilians that I work so hard to protect now. \n     However, I have fulfilled at least a part of what I owe \n     America. Everyone has a part to play, be it military, \n     politics, being an activist, or even just helping an elderly \n     neighbor rake their lawn. Each American has a responsibility \n     to every other person in our country. Each of us has a \n     responsibility to every other person in this world. Ani \n     DiFranco wrote `` the world owes me nothing, but we owe each \n     other the world `` I believe this to be one of the most true \n     statements I've ever heard. We, as a species, could not \n     survive without each other, even though it seems at times \n     that we are hell-bent on destroying ourselves.\n       I want every person in America to know this: I stand for \n     you. I will take your place in line when the final bell \n     tolls, and I will do it gladly, for I believe that your life \n     is worth it. You are worth every hardship, every effort, and \n     every last breath in my body. I love you. Even if I do not \n     know you, have never seen your face, have never heard your \n     voice, I love you. I do this today and every day for you. So \n     please, do not wave off my gift to you. Don't say you don't \n     want it, just accept that I love you, and will defend you, \n     even if it means my life.\n       May your life be blessed,\n                                           Barbara Marie O'Reilly,\n     0S3 USN.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5531-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

While a Sikh in traditional clothing was out \non an evening walk close to his home, four men attacked, beat, and \npunched him. The attackers yelled ``terrorist'' as they beat him.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5531-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I unfortunately had to miss the vote \nyesterday on the nomination of Jeffrey Sutton to serve on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, but I would like to explain \nwhy, had I been here, I would have voted against the nomination.\n  I take very seriously the Senate's constitutional duty to review \nPresidential nominees, especially those to the Federal bench. Once \nconfirmed by the Senate, judges have lifetime tenure, meaning that \nthere is no real opportunity to correct poor choices for judicial \npositions. Given the nature of a judge's job--they hold power not only \nover the liberty, but in many cases, the lives of those before them--\nMembers of the Senate must be convinced that the nominee is right for \nthe job before offering our consent to their nominations.\n  This does not mean that we should confirm only those whose views \ncomport precisely or even largely with their own; indeed, the President \nmust be given broad leeway to nominate those who he believes are right \nfor the job, which is why I have supported most of this President's \nnominees, to the bench or otherwise, regardless of whether I would \nconsider them the best candidates for the job. But the Senate has a \nconstitutional obligation to review, and, when necessary, serve as a \ncheck on the President's choices, and when a nominee's views and \npositions lie far from the mainstream or are so at odds with what I \nconsider to be needed for the job, I must respectfully withhold my \nconsent from their nomination, especially when the stakes are as high \nas they are for the bench.\n  After reviewing Mr. Sutton's record, I have concluded that I cannot \nsupport his nomination. Although his professional credentials are \nimpressive and I have little doubt that he is a good lawyer, I believe \nthat his legal views lie far out of the mainstream and that his \npresence on the Federal bench could do serious harm to the values about \nwhich our Nation cares deeply, particularly when it comes to our \nnational desire to fight discrimination and protect individual rights. \nMr. Sutton has devoted a significant part of his legal career to \nadvancing an extreme vision of federalism that restricts both the power \nof Congress to pass civil rights laws and the ability of individuals \nwho have been harmed by discriminatory acts of State governments to \nseek redress. He has used that vision of federalism to convince \nactivist judges to restrict congressional enactments. He has argued \nagainst the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act and the Violence Against Women Act. These were laws with \nstrong, mainstream support, and the records justifying them were \nstrong. I have deep concern that when future civil rights and similar \nlaws come before him, he will argue against them on federalism grounds \nas well. I cannot in good conscience support putting him in a position \nwhere he will be able to further restrict these good laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5531-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VA FINDS FLU SHOTS PROTECT ELDERLY\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM of Florida. Mr. President, throughout its history, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, has made great strides in medical \nresearch. At a time when VA's medical and prosthetic research program \nis being starved of vital funding, as ranking member of the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I would like to draw attention to a significant \ndiscovery the program recently has made.\n  As highlighted in an April 22, 2003, article in The Washington Post, \nresearchers at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center found that not only do \nseniors who get vaccinated against the flu gain protection from the \ndisease, but they also reduce their risk of hospitalization from \npneumonia, cardiac disease and stroke. The VA study, published in the \nApril 3, 2003, issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, also found \nthat during a given flu season, vaccinated elderly patients were half \nas likely to die as their unvaccinated peers.\n  Since its inception, the VA research program has made landmark \ncontributions to the well-being of veterans and the Nation as a whole. \nPast VA research projects have resulted in the first successful kidney \ntransplant performed in the U.S., as well as the development of the \ncardiac pacemaker, a vaccine for hepatitis, and the CAT and MRI scans. \nThis new discovery is yet another example of the crucial research work \ndone by the VA, and of why we must keep the research program \nsufficiently funded.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from The Washington Post \nhighlighting the VA research study on the benefits of the flu vaccine \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 22, 2003]\n\n                          Flu Shots Save Lives\n\n                (By Jennifer Huget and Associated Press)\n\n       Seniors who get vaccinated against the flu not only protect \n     themselves from that deadly disease but also reduce their \n     risk of hospitalization for pneumonia, cardiac disease and \n     stroke. Plus, a study in the April 3 issue of the New England \n     Journal of Medicine shows, vaccinated elderly patients were \n     half as likely to die as their unvaccinated peers during a \n     given flu season.\n       The study, conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     at the Minneapolis VA Medical Center, tracked 286,000 men and \n     women age 65 and over through two flu seasons. Although the \n     vaccinated folks were on average older and in worse overall \n     health than the unvaccinated, they were about a third less \n     likely to have pneumonia and about a fifth less likely to be \n     hospitalized for cardiac care of suffer a stroke during the \n     flu season.\n       Influenza kills about 36,000 people of all ages each year, \n     according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC); about 90 percent of those deaths are among the \n     elderly. Yet the CDC says that only 63 percent of those over \n     age 65 got flu shots in 2001. Flu shots confer benefits for \n     one flu season only. Since this year's flu season is now \n     winding down, experts suggest that seniors start seeking new \n     shots in October.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5531-4", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5531-S5532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IDEA FULL FUNDING\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I am proud to cosponsor the Hagel\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\nIDEA bill, S. 939, which will finally make Congress pay its promised \nshare of special education funding. I have long been a supporter of \nfully funding IDEA and I am pleased today to support this important \npiece of legislation.\n  Nearly 30 years ago, Congress made a promise to our schools to share \nthe cost of special education. The promise was simple--the Federal \nGovernment pays 40 percent of the excess cost of educating a special \nneeds child. Sadly, we have yet to fulfill that promise and I believe \nit is well beyond time that Congress relieves our State and local \ngovernments of the financial burden they have been forced to shoulder. \nThis bill will fully fund IDEA in 8 years by increasing funding by $2 \nbillion annually for 7 years and $1.8 billion in 2011. This funding \nwill have a tremendous impact in my home State of Kansas. The Kansas \nDepartment of Education estimates that this legislation will provide \nthe State an increase of $19 million in overall funding for IDEA each \nyear. Kansas schools may then spend these newly freed-up dollars in \nareas where they need it the most, such as professional development, \ntitle I programs, or technology.\n  In the State of Kansas, special education costs have skyrocketed to \nover $530 million for 2002. Unfortunately, the Federal Government only \npicks up about 16 percent of that figure, leaving 84 percent of the \nfunding to State and local governments. In dollar amounts, the State of \nKansas pays over $251 million in special education costs, while local \nschools must fork out an additional $200 million to cover the costs of \nspecial education. This is unacceptable. IDEA is the ``granddaddy'' of \nall unfunded mandates and I can assure my colleagues that funding IDEA \nat the promised level of 40 percent would not only relieve schools in \nmy home State of Kansas, but would also relieve schools in each and \nevery State in our great Nation. I stress to my colleagues that there \nis no better time than now to help our local schools by fully funding \nIDEA.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues the current budget situation \nin Kansas. Like many other States, Kansas is facing ominous cuts in the \nState budget, and schools across the State are worried about shortfalls \nin their own budgets. Rural schools all over Kansas are considering \nconsolidation to alleviate budget woes. Schools in western Kansas are \ncutting the school week to 4 days in order to save money. Schools in \neastern Kansas are cutting academic programs in order to cut costs. If \nCongress would pay its promised share of special education funding, \nthen our schools would be able to use those freed-up dollars for other \neducational needs. We are talking about real dollars for real people. \nFully funding IDEA is not just something that Congress should do, it is \nsomething we promised to do.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues for the commitment to education \nfunding. I do believe that Congress is on the right path to fully \nfunding IDEA, and I am pleased that education funding has been a top \npriority over the last few years. Since 2000, Federal special education \nfunding has increased by approximately 58 percent and title I funding \nhas increased by nearly 45 percent.\n  I am proud of this support for education funding, and I urge my \ncolleagues to continue on the course to fully funding IDEA. It is our \nduty to once and for all meet the promise we made nearly 30 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5532-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5532-S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MORATORIUM ON EXECUTIONS IN ILLINOIS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on \nGovernor Rod Blagojevich's recent decision to continue the moratorium \non executions in Illinois initiated by former Governor George Ryan. The \nleadership we have now seen from two successive Illinois Governors--one \nRepublican and one Democrat--sends the right message for the Nation. \nThis is not a partisan issue. All Americans who value fairness and \njustice can agree that executions should not take place--in Illinois or \nelsewhere in the Nation--under a flawed death penalty system, a system \nthat risks executing the innocent.\n  Three years ago, Governor Ryan, a death penalty supporter, made \nnational headlines when he was the first Governor in the Nation to \nplace a moratorium on executions. He did so after considering \nirrefutable evidence that the system in Illinois risks executing the \ninnocent. Since the death penalty was reinstated in Illinois in 1977, \nIllinois had executed 12 people. But, during this same time, another 13 \ndeath row inmates were found to be innocent and to have been wrongfully \nsentenced to death.\n  Governor Ryan did not stop there. He created an independent, blue \nribbon commission, including former U.S. Attorney Thomas Sullivan, one \nof our former colleagues, Senator Paul Simon, and lawyer and novelist \nScott Turow. He instructed the commission, composed of death penalty \nproponents and opponents, to review the State's death penalty system \nand to advise him on how to reduce the risk of executing the innocent \nand to ensure fairness in the system.\n  After an exhaustive 2-year study, the commission issued a \ncomprehensive report and set forth 85 recommendations for reform of the \nIllinois death penalty system. These recommendations address difficult \nissues like inadequate defense counsel, executions of the mentally \nretarded, coerced confessions, and the problem of wrongful convictions \nbased solely on the testimony of a jailhouse snitch or a single \neyewitness. The commission's work is the first and, so far, only \ncomprehensive review of a death penalty system undertaken by a State or \nFederal Government in the modern death penalty era.\n  Earlier this year, the Illinois legislature responded with a bill \nthat included some of the recommendations of the commission. Governor \nBlagojevich, however, rightly reviewed the legislation and determined \nthat the bill did not go far enough. And last week, he concluded that \nexecutions should not resume.\n  But, the series of mistakes that led to a moratorium are not unique \nto Illinois. Death penalty systems across the country are fraught with \nerrors and the risk that an innocent person may be condemned to die. \nThere have been over 800 executions in the United States in the modern \ndeath penalty era. During that same period, 107 people who were \nsentenced to death were later exonerated. That means that for \napproximately every eight persons executed, an innocent person has been \nwrongly condemned to die.\n  Evidence that race plays a role in who is sentenced to death \ncontinues to mount. A recent report on race and the death penalty \nreleased last week by Amnesty International tells us that while African \nAmericans comprise 12 percent of the U.S. population, they are more \nthan 40 percent of the current death row population and one in three of \nthose executed since 1977. The U.S. could soon carry out the 300th \nexecution of an African American inmate since executions resumed in \n1977. The report also highlighted that 80 percent of people executed in \nthe modern death penalty era in the U.S. were executed for murders \ninvolving white victims, even though blacks and whites are murder \nvictims in almost equal numbers in our society.\n  We should all be startled by this statistic. There is something \nparticularly insidious, particularly un-American about racial \ndiscrimination in the application of the death penalty. A system that \ntreats people differently in administering the ultimate punishment \nbased on their race or the race of the victim is immoral.\n  In the face of these and other startling pieces of evidence that the \ndeath penalty is broken, our Nation is not, as it should be, ceasing or \nslowing the use of capital punishment. Instead, executions are being \ncarried out at an alarming pace. Already this year, 28 people have been \nexecuted, and over the last 6 years, the average annual number of \nexecutions is well above that of previous years in the modern death \npenalty era. In 1999 alone, 99 people were executed in America.\n  It is my hope that we do not break any records this year. With an \neight-to-one executed-to-exonerated ratio, however, we are clearly in a \nrace--a race against time. Because with 107 death row inmates \nexonerated to date, I do not think any American can be sure that an \ninnocent person has not been executed in this country, and we most \ncertainly cannot guarantee that it will never happen. We must suspend \nexecutions and study the flaws in the\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\ndeath penalty system. I have introduced the National Death Penalty \nMoratorium Act, which would place a moratorium on Federal executions \nand call on the States to do the same, while an independent, blue \nribbon commission conducts a thorough study of the flaws in the system.\n  As public concern about the accuracy and fairness of the use of the \ndeath penalty deepens, I commend Governor Blagojevich for taking this \nopportunity to continue Illinois' commitment to justice and fairness.\n  Governor Blagojevich did the right thing last week when he decided to \ncontinue the death penalty moratorium in Illinois. We in the Senate \nhave a unique opportunity to look to the State of Illinois as a model \nfor the Nation in ensuring fairness in the Federal death penalty \nsystem. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor the National Death Penalty \nMoratorium Act.\n  The time for a moratorium is now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5533-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nINTERPRETATION OF TITLE IX OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, H.R. 3763\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on April 11, 2003, I submitted for \ninclusion in the official Record of the Senate a section-by-section \ndiscussion and analysis of title IX of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, \nP.L. 107-204. At the end of that statement, the full text of a letter \nto me from the United States Department of Justice, dated December 26, \n2002, should have appeared. In that letter, Assistant Attorney General \nDaniel J. Bryant confirms my view that the Department may use existing \ncriminal provisions to prosecute corporate executives who fail to file \na certification attesting to the accuracy of a company's financial \nreports, pursuant to Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \nUnfortunately, the letter was inadvertently excluded from the Record, \nso I now resubmit it and ask unanimous consent that its text be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 26, 2002.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden: This is in response to your letter of \n     October 16, 2002 to the Attorney General and the Chairman of \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding enforcement \n     of section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (``the \n     Act''). The Department thanks you for your leadership in \n     corporate governance reform and, in particular, commends your \n     efforts as primary author of section 906 of the Act (18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1350), which requires corporate executives to \n     make certain certifications with respect to their financial \n     statements.\n       The Department is fully committed to using the tools \n     Congress provided in the Act in our continuing efforts to \n     uncover and punish corporate fraud. As the President noted \n     when he signed the Act, ``this law gives my administration \n     new tools for enforcement. We will use them to the fullest.'' \n     In keeping with the President's statement, Attorney General \n     Ashcroft has directed all United States Attorneys and FBI \n     Special-Agents-in-Charge to review the Act and to take all \n     appropriate steps to implement its provisions fully and \n     expeditiously.\n       The Department continues to consult with the Commission \n     staff regarding certain legal and technical issues associated \n     with implementing section 906. In particular, questions have \n     arisen regarding the form, location, method of filing and \n     scope of the certification required under section 906. We \n     want to assure you that the Department will continue to work \n     closely with the Commission and we are confident that these \n     questions will be resolved to your satisfaction and with the \n     full input of all affected parties in the near future.\n       The Department does believe that it is in a position to \n     respond to one question you raised in your letter. You have \n     inquired whether covered individuals who willfully fail to \n     file the certifications required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1350(a) \n     are subject to the penalties provided in 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78ff. \n     While the facts and circumstances determine which tools our \n     prosecutors utilize in each individual case, we believe that \n     section 78ff's criminal penalties are applicable when an \n     individual willfully fails to file the required certification \n     under section 906.\n       Section 1350(a) of the Act mandates that each periodic \n     report containing financial statements filed by an issuer \n     with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to \n     Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 shall be accompanied by the required written \n     certification. In addition, Section 3(d) of the Act states \n     that: ``a violation by any person of this Act, any rule or \n     regulation of the Commission issued under this Act, or any \n     rule of the Board shall be treated for all purposes in the \n     same manner as a violation of the Securities Exchangee Act of \n     1934 (15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 78a et seq.) or the rules and \n     regulations issued thereunder, consistent with the provisions \n     of this Act, and any such person shall be subject to the same \n     penalties, and to the same extent, as for a violation of that \n     Act or such rules and regulations.''\n       The criminal provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of \n     1934 (15 U.S.C. Sec. 78ff) state that ``any person who \n     willfully violates any provision of this chapter (other than \n     section 78dd-1), or any rule or regulation thereunder the \n     violation of which is made unlawful or the observance of \n     which is required under the terms of this chapter . . . shall \n     upon conviction be fined not more than $1,000,000, or \n     imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.'' Therefore, as \n     you have suggested, the Department may utilize section 78ff's \n     criminal penalties to prosecute executives who violate the \n     Sarbanes-Oxley Act by willfully failing to file section 906's \n     required certifications.\n       The Department believes that it is critically important to \n     work with the Commission to resolve the remaining issues you \n     have raised in a timely and thoughtful manner, and we are \n     committed to moving forward expeditiously to achieve \n     consensus on those issues. We also will continue, where \n     appropriate, to formulate guidance for our prosecutors and \n     investigators who must enforce the new law and to provide \n     clarity for the corporate community which must comply with \n     it.\n       We appreciate your attention to these issues, and look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and others in Congress \n     on the implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the second \nfallen son of Connecticut in the war against Saddam Hussein's regime in \nIraq: Marine CPL Kemaphoom ``Ahn'' Chanawongse, 1st Battalion, 2nd \nMarine Regiment, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, United States Marine \nCorps, who was killed in an ambush outside of Nasiriyah, Iraq, on March \n23rd, 2003. This brave young man was just 22 when he lost his life.\n  Corporal Chanawongse had been listed as missing in action for 3 \nweeks: three weeks of what I can only imagine was, for his family, a \ntime of unimaginable uncertainty and trepidation. We can only hope that \nthe news of their son's death has given the Corporal's family some \nsense of closure, and an opportunity to come to terms with his passing \nwith God's help and the help of their friends.\n  Corporal Chanawongse was not the first to fall for his country in \nIraq, and sadly, it is safe to say that his death will not be the last. \nNonetheless it is important for us to honor each of the fallen in their \nown right: to say, ``these few gave their lives so that many could live \nwithout fear.'' There is no greater measure of compassion than the \nsacrifice that Corporal Chanawongse and his fallen brothers- and \nsisters-in-arms made. In the stories of the fallen soldiers we will \nlearn more about the stuff that this country is made of and the values \non which it is built. It is our duty as Americans, and as citizens of \nthe world who believe in freedom, to always remember their names, their \nfaces, and their stories.\n  This young man and his family came to the United States when he was 8 \nyears old, and they settled in the wonderful town of Waterford, CT. Ahn \ngraduated from Waterford High School in 1999 and joined the Marines \nshortly thereafter. It is a story similar to the stories of countless \nother young men and women who choose to serve their country for the \nchance to be a part of something greater than themselves; for a chance \nto build a noble life for themselves and the children they might \nsomeday have; for a chance to join a select brotherhood and sisterhood \nthat has, throughout history, responded to our country's call and the \ncall of others in danger and distress around the world.\n  I extend my deepest condolences to Corporal Chanawongse's mother, Tan \nPatchem, his stepfather, Paul Patchem, and his older brother, Awe. I \ntell you plainly that I am humbled by your family's sacrifice, and I am \nhonored to pay tribute to your son in this Chamber today.\n  Paul, Tan, and Awe, our prayers are with you in this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5533-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5533-S5534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE LATE SENATOR SPARK MATSUNAGA\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, 13 years ago this month, our late \ncolleague, the Honorable Spark Matsunaga of Hawaii, died while serving \nin office, abruptly cutting short a distinguished 28-year\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\ncareer in the United States Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  His legacy should not be forgotten, particularly since in recent \nmonths, the war has dominated discussions in our Chamber and throughout \nthe world. Sixty years ago, circumstances compelled Senator Matsunaga \nto become a warrior, and he acted with bravery and valor that resulted \nin our country awarding him the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. Even \nas a war hero, however, Senator Matsunaga knew the importance of peace \nand believed that the peaceful resolution of disputes should always be \nour primary goal.\n  ``After serving as a soldier, he went into public service to find a \nway to end war,'' his son, former Hawaii State Senator Matt Matsunaga, \nonce said.\n  Like other prominent Americans such as Woodrow Wilson, Jennings \nRandolph, and Everett Dirksen, Senator Matsunaga envisioned a \n``Department of Peace'' that ideally would be on equal footing with the \nDepartment of Defense. In 1979, he was successful in having a provision \nadded to an education appropriations bill that called for the \nestablishment of the Commission on Proposals for the National Academy \nof Peace and Conflict Resolution.\n  Senator Matsunaga chaired the newly created nonpartisan panel, which \nbecame known as the Matsunaga Commission. After numerous public \nhearings and meetings with scholars, government, and military \nofficials, and representatives from religious and ethnic organizations, \nthe Commission recommended the creation of a national peace academy. \nSubsequently, Senator Matsunaga spearheaded a bipartisan drive that led \nto the passage of a bill that was signed into law by President Reagan \nestablishing the United States Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C.\n  The Institute's mission is to ``support the development, \ntransmission, and use of knowledge to promote peace and curb violent \ninternational conflict.''\n  Following Senator Matsunaga's death in 1990, the University of Hawaii \npaid tribute to him by establishing the Matsunaga Institute for Peace, \nwhere scholars could study and advise on ways to settle regional and \ninternational disputes without turning to violence.\n  Senator Matsunaga's belief in peace began early. In 1930, as a \nstudent at the University of Hawaii, he wrote a short essay, titled \n``Let Us Teach Our Children to Want Peace'':\n\n       Wants are the drives of all human action. If we want peace \n     we must educate people to want peace. We must replace \n     attitudes favorable to war with attitudes opposed to war. \n     Parents should protect the child from experiences with \n     materials of warfare. Teachers should let the generals fall \n     into the background and bring into the foreground leaders in \n     social reform as heroes. We must help our young men to see \n     that there are other types of bravery than that which is \n     displayed on the battlefield. If in our teaching we emphasize \n     the life and work of out great contributors instead of our \n     great destroyers, people will come to realize that moral \n     courage is bravery of the highest type, and America will be \n     called the Champion of Peace.\n\n  Senator Matsunaga lived by those words throughout his life. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in paying tribute to the late Senator Matsunaga.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5534-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5534-S5535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE DISTINGUISHED CAREER OF JAY CUTLER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto the distinguished career of Jay Cutler, who is retiring this year as \nthe Director of Government Relations and Special Counsel for the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, where he has served for 25 years. \nDuring that quarter century he has been a powerful advocate for \nAmerica's psychiatrists, for the patients they serve, and for the \nbroader cause of mental health. He is well known to virtually every \nSenator as an outstanding advocate and a fine human being.\n  I first came to know Jay many years ago, when he served on what was \nthen known as the Senate Human Resources Committee and is today our \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Jay was Senator Jacob \nJavits' top staff person on the committee. I worked closely with him on \na wide range of issues, especially on health care.\n  Jay's career has had a remarkable breadth and depth. There is no \ncause in which he has been more deeply involved than better treatment \nfor persons suffering from mental illness and substance abuse. Over the \ncourse of his career, there has been a remarkable shift in the \nperception of mental illness and substance abuse by policy makers and \nthe public. The Nation has made a remarkable transition from the long \nheld and destructive view that mental illness and substance abuse are \ncharacter flaws, and has achieved a new understanding, that they are \ndiseases which can and should receive the best treatment that medical \nscience can provide. In many ways, Jay's tireless dedication to the \ncause of mental illness reform and substance abuse treatment has been \nat the core of this profound shift in public awareness and \nunderstanding of these disorders.\n  Among many other accomplishments during Jay's years in the Senate \ntenure, he had played the central staff role in the drafting, \nintroduction and passage of the landmark Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse \nand Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act of 1970, \nP.L. 91-616, that established the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse \nand Alcoholism. He worked side by side with Senator Javits and Senator \nHarold Hughes to change the perception of national policymakers towards \nalcoholism and the effects of alcohol abuse.\n  As a Senate aide and later as APA's Director of Government Relations, \nJay had a direct impact on virtually every major bill on health policy \nand mental illness and substance abuse treatment legislation over more \nthan 30 years. Even a selective list of the policies and laws that bear \nJay's imprint includes: the landmark Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act; expansion of the community mental health centers program; \npublic oversight to protect patients in mental health treatment against \nabuse; reauthorization and reorganization of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, \nand Mental Health Administration; the exemption of psychiatric \nhospitals and units from the Medicare prospective payment methodology, \nensuring their fiscal viability for nearly 20 years; the expansion of \nMedicare's limited coverage of outpatient treatment for mental illness, \nfirst by lifting the $250 annual dollar limit to $500, then to $1,200, \nand ultimately repealing the discriminatory dollar limit altogether; \nenactment of the landmark 1996 Federal Mental Health Parity Act; \nincreased funding for veterans', children's, and Indian mental health \nservices; medical records privacy legislation, especially assuring the \nconfidentiality of medical records for psychiatric and substance abuse \ntreatment.\n\n  The historic decision by President Clinton to issue an Executive \nOrder requiring non-discriminatory coverage of treatment for mental \nillness, including alcohol and substance abuse disorders, in the \nFederal Employees' Health Benefits Program; the APA's successful \nefforts to enact ``parity'' laws in some 30 States; the bipartisan \nnational campaign to double the NIH research budget, including the \nbudgets on mental illness and substance abuse disorders.\n  For more than 30 years, Jay has dedicated his professional career to \nthe eradication of any stigma against persons with mental illness, \nincluding those struggling with alcohol and substance abuse disorders. \nHe has greatly assisted in educating the public and key national \npolicymakers on these vital issues. he has also been at the forefront \nof efforts to eliminate discrimination against persons with mental \nillness. He has a record that few can match as an advocate for \neducation, research, and treatment of all mental disorders.\n  Jay's personal qualities have not only contributed immeasurably to \nhis success but have made him countless friends in the Senate, the \nHouse, administrations of both parties, and the health policy \ncommunity. All his interactions are marked by an extraordinary degree \nof candor and openness and by the incisive intellect and political \nskill that has made him a valuable counselor to so many of us.\n  Jay has always fought hard and effectively for the interests of the \nphysicians represented by the American Psychiatric Association. Jay's \nwisest counsel to the APA was to place the public policy needs of its \npatients first. To his enduring credit, throughout\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\nJay's service as Director of Government Relations, APA could be relied \nupon to fight just as hard for its patients as its members.\n  No tribute to Jay can fail to mention Jay's beloved wife and lifelong \npartner, Randy. When the APA hired Jay Cutler, it got Randy as part of \nthe deal. Her generosity of spirit, keen intellect, and strong \ncommitment have meant the world to Jay, to his colleagues at the APA, \nand to the nation.\n  Throughout his remarkable career, Jay Cutler--with Randy Cutler \nbeside him--has worked to improve the lives of millions of Americans \nwho, for no fault of their own, have struggled to overcome mental \nillness. Much of the distance that we have come in recognizing their \nneeds and meeting them over the years of Jay's outstanding services and \ndedication is the result of Jay's ability.\n  On the occasion of Jay's retirement, I comment his brilliant service \nto Congress, to the American Psychiatric Association, and to the \nmillions of Americans with mental illness. I wish Jay and Randy great \nhappiness and success as they begin this new chapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5535-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          EL DIA DE LOS NINOS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

As cochair of the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force, I \nbelieve it is important that we set aside a time to commemorate the \nessential role of children in the future of every nation.

In my own State, for \nexample, the New Mexico State University Library, in conjunction with \nthe Southern New Mexico Engaging Latino Communities for Education \nCollaborative, ENLACE, is hosting an exhibit of bilingual, Spanish-\nEnglish, children's books. This activity serves to help communities \ncelebrate and promote the importance of reading in many languages.\n  As we continue to discuss the well-being of our children, I invite my \ncolleagues to join with me in taking time on this day, El dia de los \nninos, to rededicate ourselves to working together and acting on behalf \nof our children throughout the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5535-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     PREPARING FOR NATIONAL COMPETITION ON CONSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this May, more than 1,200 students \nfrom across the United States will visit Washington, D.C. to compete in \nthe national finals of the We the People... The Citizen and the \nConstitution program. It is the most extensive educational program in \nthe country developed specifically to educate young people about the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights.\n  I am proud to announce that a class from Smyrna High School will \nrepresent the State of Delaware in this national event. These students, \nwith the leadership of their teacher Marc Deisem, have worked \ndiligently to reach the national finals. Through their experience, they \nhave gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental \nprinciples and values of our constitutional democracy.\n  This 3-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the \nUnited States Congress. The hearings consist of oral presentations by \nhigh school students before a panel of adult judges on constitutional \ntopics. The students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning \nby the judges who probe their depth of understanding and ability to \napply their knowledge.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the We the People... \nprogram has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle \nand high school levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. \nThe program affords students a working knowledge of our Constitution, \nBill of Rights, and the principles of democratic government.\n  It is inspiring to see these young people advocate the principles of \nour Government. These principles identify us as a people and bind us \ntogether as a Nation. It is important for our next generation to \nunderstand the values and principles that serve as the foundation in \nour ongoing effort to preserve and realize the promise of democracy.\n  These students from Smyrna High School are currently conducting \nresearch and preparing for their upcoming participation in the national \ncompetition in Washington, DC. I wish these young ``constitutional \nexperts'' the best of luck at the We the People... national finals. \nThey represent the future of our State and Nation, and they give us \ncause for great hope as we look to the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5535-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5535-S5536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING ONCOLOGY NURSING MONTH--MAY 2003\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \noncology nurses. May is the ninth annual Oncology Nursing Month. The \ncelebration kicks off on Thursday, May 1, 2003, on Oncology Nursing \nDay, during the opening ceremonies of the Oncology Nursing Society's \n28th Annual Congress in Denver, CO, and continues until May 31, 2003.\n  Oncology Nursing Month recognizes oncology nurses, educates the \npublic about oncology nursing, provides an opportunity for special \neducational events for oncology nurses, and celebrates the \naccomplishments of oncology nurses.\n  The Oncology Nursing Society, ONS, is the largest professional \noncology group in the United States composed of more than 30,000 nurses \nand other health professionals. It exists to promote excellence in \noncology nursing and the provision of quality care to those individuals \naffected by cancer.\n  As part of its mission, the society honors and maintains nursing's \nhistorical and essential commitment to advocacy for the public good. \nONS was founded in 1975, and held its first Annual Congress in 1976. \nSince the society was established, 218 local chapters have been formed \nto provide a network for education and peer support at the community \nlevel.\n  In my State of California, there are more than 2,515 oncology nurses \nand health professionals who care for individuals with cancer and their \nfamilies. In addition, California has 18 local Oncology Nursing Society \nchapters including the areas of Pacific Grove, Fresno, Brentwood, \nLompoc, Simi Valley, Palm Springs, Greater Los Angeles, Redding, \nSacramento, Colton, Chico, Lodi, Orange County, San Diego, San \nFrancisco, Santa Clara, Sonoma County, and Lakewood.\n  Over the last 10 years, the setting where treatment for cancer is \nprovided has changed dramatically. An estimated 80 percent of all \nAmericans receive cancer care in community settings including cancer \ncenters, physicians' offices, and hospital outpatient departments. \nTreatment regimens are as complex, if not more so, than regimens given \nin the inpatient setting a few short years ago.\n  Oncology nurses are on the frontlines of the provision of quality \ncancer care for individuals with cancer. Nurses are involved in the \ncare of a cancer patient from the beginning through the end of \ntreatment. Oncology nurses are the frontline providers of care by \nadministering chemotherapy, managing patient therapies and sideeffects, \nworking with insurance companies to ensure that patients receive the \nappropriate treatment, and providing counseling to patients and family \nmembers, in addition to many other daily acts on behalf of cancer \npatients.\n  With an increasing number of people with cancer needing high quality \nhealth care, and an inadequate supply of nurses, our Nation could well \nbe facing a cancer care crisis of serious proportion, with limited \naccess to quality cancer care.\n  I was proud to support the passage of the ``Nurse Reinvestment Act'' \nin the 107th Congress. This important piece of legislation expanded and \nimplemented programs at the Health Resources Services Administration, \nHRSA, to address the multiple problems contributing to the nationwide \nnursing shortage, including the decline in nursing student enrollments, \nshortage of faculty, and dissatisfaction with nurse workplace \nenvironments.\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\n  I commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all of its hard work to \nprevent and reduce suffering from cancer and to improve the lives of \nthose 1.3 million Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer in \n2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5536-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5536-2", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and two treaties which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5536-3", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \nMr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 274.

SENATE ADVICE AND CONSENT SUBJECT TO \n     DECLARATIONS AND CONDITIONS.\n       The Senate advises and consents to the ratification of the \n     Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the \n     Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia (as defined in section 4(6)), which \n     were opened for signature at Brussels on March 26, 2003, and \n     signed on behalf of the United States of America and other \n     parties to the North Atlantic Treaty, subject to the \n     declarations of section 2 and the conditions of section 3.\n       Sec. 2. DECLARATIONS.\n       The advice and consent of the Senate to ratification of the \n     Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949 on the \n     Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia is subject to the following \n     declarations:\n       (1) Reaffirmation that United States Membership in NATO \n     Remains a Vital National Security Interest of the United \n     States. The Senate declares that\n       (A) for more than 50 years the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) has served as the preeminent organization \n     to defend the countries in the North Atlantic area against \n     all external threats;\n       (B) through common action, the established democracies of \n     North America and Europe that were joined in NATO persevered \n     and prevailed in the task of ensuring the survival of \n     democratic government in Europe and North America throughout \n     the Cold War;\n       (C) NATO enhances the security of the United States by \n     embedding European states in a process of cooperative \n     security planning, by preventing the destabilizing re-\n     nationalization of European military policies, and by \n     ensuring an ongoing and direct leadership role for the United \n     States in European security affairs;\n       (D) the responsibility and financial burden of defending \n     the democracies of Europe and North America can be more \n     equitably shared through an alliance in which specific \n     obligations and force goals are met by its members;\n       (E) the security and prosperity of the United States is \n     enhanced by NATO's collective defense against aggression that \n     may threaten the security of NATO members;\n       (F) with the advice and consent of the United States \n     Senate, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic became \n     members of NATO on March 12, 1999;\n       (G) on May 17, 2002, the Senate adopted the Freedom \n     Consolidation Act of 2001 (S. 1572 of the 107th Congress), \n     and President George W. Bush signed that bill into law on \n     June 10, 2002, which ``reaffirms support for continued \n     enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     Alliance; designated Slovakia for participation in the \n     Partnership for Peace and eligible to receive certain \n     security assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994; \n     [and[ authorizes specified amounts of security assistance for \n     [fiscal year] 2002 for Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, \n     Slovenia, Bulgaria and Romania''; and\n       (H) United States membership in NATO remains a vital \n     national security interest of the United States.\n       (2) Strategic Rationale for NATO Enlargement. The Senate \n     finds that\n       (A) notwithstanding the collapse of communism in most of \n     Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United \n     States and its NATO allies face threats to their stability \n     and territorial integrity;\n       (B) an attack against Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia, or\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\n     Slovenia, or their destabilization arising from external \n     subversion, would threaten the stability of Europe and \n     jeopardize vital United States national security interests;\n       (C) Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Slovakia, and Slovenia, having established democratic \n     governments and having demonstrated a willingness to meet all \n     requirements of membership, including those necessary to \n     contribute to the defense of all NATO members, are in a \n     position to further the principles of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty and to contribute to the security of the North \n     Atlantic area; and\n       (D) extending NATO membership to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, will strengthen \n     NATO, enhance security and stability in Central Europe, deter \n     potential aggressors, and advance the interests of the United \n     States and its NATO allies.\n       (3) Full Membership for New NATO Members. The Senate \n     understands that Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, in becoming NATO members, \n     will have all the rights, obligations, responsibilities, and \n     protections that are afforded to all other NATO members.\n       (4) The Importance of European Integration.\n       (A) Sense of the Senate. It is the sense of the Senate that\n       (i) the central purpose of NATO is to provide for the \n     collective defense of its members;\n       (ii) the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe is an institution for the promotion of democracy, the \n     rule of law, crisis prevention, and post-conflict \n     rehabilitation and, as such, is an essential forum for the \n     discussion and resolution of political disputes among \n     European members, Canada, and the United States; and\n       (iii) the European Union is an essential organization of \n     the economic, political, and social integration of all \n     qualified European countries into an undivided Europe.\n       (B) Policy of the United States. The policy of the United \n     States is\n       (i) to utilize fully the institutions of the Organization \n     for Security and Cooperation in Europe to reach political \n     solutions for disputes in Europe; and\n       (ii) to encourage actively the efforts of the European \n     Union to continue to expand its membership, which will help \n     to strengthen the democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.\n       (5) Future Consideration of Candidates for Membership in \n     NATO.\n       (A) Senate Findings.

A bill to allow travel between the United States and Cuba; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, today I offer a bill that will make a very \nsmall change in our Cuba policy. It deals only with travel provisions \nto Cuba.\n  I have been watching Cuba since the 1960s. I went to George \nWashington University, and I was there at the time of the Cuban missile \ncrisis. I have had the opportunity to watch what has happened with Cuba \nthroughout the years. I am reminded of something my dad used to say, \nwhich was that if you keep on doing what you always have been doing, \nyou are going to wind up getting what you already got. That is kind of \nthe situation with Cuba. We have been trying the same thing for over 40 \nyears, and it hasn't worked.\n  I am suggesting just a small change to maybe get a few more people in \nthere to increase conversation with people who understand the way the \nUnited States works and the way Cuba works and how they ought to drift \nmore rapidly toward where we are.\n  In recent weeks, as we shared the joy of the Iraqi people as they \nwere liberated from the ruthless regime of Saddam Hussein, we also felt \nthe pain of those in Cuba who had dared to speak out in a vain but \nvaliant effort to demand those same freedoms for themselves. As they \ndid, 75 Cuban citizens were arrested and received harsh sentences--some \nfor more than 20 years--all for the crime of yearning to be free. Once \nagain, Castro has shown himself to be his own worst enemy when it comes \nto Cuba's image overseas, and so, when faced with an outcry from around \nthe world about his actions, he quickly tried to blame the United \nStates for his own actions. It was a hard sell at best, and, given the \nreactions we've seen from all sides of this issue, I don't think anyone \nis buying it.\n  Still, Castro's cruelty might tempt us to tighten the already strong \nrestrictions on the relations between our two countries, but I hope we \nwill not do that. If we increase the diplomatic pressure on the Cuban \ngovernment that is now emanating from every corner of the world, we \nmight be successful in bringing about a better way of life for the \nCuban people.\n  If, however, we stop Cuban-Americans from bringing financial \nassistance to their families in Cuba, and end the people to people \nexchanges that have been so successful, and stop the sale of \nagricultural and medicinal products to Cuba, we will not be hurting the \nCuban government nearly as badly as we will be hurting the Cuban people \nby diminishing their faith and trust in the United States and reducing \nthe strength of the ties that bind the people of our two countries.\n  If we allow more and freer travel to Cuba, if we increase trade and \ndialogue, we take away Castro's ability to blame the hardships of the \nCuban people on the United States. In a very real sense, the better we \ntry to make things for the Cuban people, the more we will reduce the \nlevel and the tone of the rhetoric used against us by Fidel Castro.\n  I have often heard it said that it is foolish to do the same thing \nover and over again and expect different results. In a way, that is \nwhat we are doing in Cuba. We are continuing to try to exert pressure \nfrom our side and, as we do, we are giving Castro a scapegoat to blame \nfor the poor living conditions in his country in the process. It's time \nfor a different policy, one that goes further than embargoes and \nreplaces a restrictive and confusing travel policy with a new one that \nwill more effectively help us to achieve our goals in that country.\n  Today, Senators Dorgan, Baucus, and Bingaman and I are introducing \nthe Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act.\n  Our bill is very straightfoward. It states that the President shall \nnot prohibit, either directly or indirectly, travel to or from Cuba by \nUnited States citizens or transactions incident to such travel.\n  In 1958 the Supreme Court affirmed or Constitutional right to travel, \nbut the U.S. government then prohibited Americans from spending money \nin Cuba. We simply said, okay, you have a right to travel, but try \ntraveling without spending a dime.\n  Most of us know that certain people can and do continue to travel to \nCuba. Cuban Americans can apply for a license to travel for \nhumanitarian reasons to visit ailing family members and such, but not \nalways conveniently.\n  The way I got involved in this whole process was a Cuban American \nfrom Jackson, WY, who had been in Cuba visiting his family, doing his \none visit a year. As he left and was on the plane coming back to \nWyoming, one of his\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\nparents died. He could not go back there for a year. That is not a good \nsituation for any family.\n  Educational groups can apply for licenses to travel for scholarly \nreasons, for educational opportunities and conferences. Members of the \nU.S. Government can travel for fact-finding reasons, but for the \naverage American, that process is too complicated.\n  Even with the proper licenses, the regulations on where you can go \nand whom you can talk to are confusing, misleading, and frustrating. \nEach year the Office of Foreign Assets Control levies fines on \ntravelers who followed the law to the best of their ability. Fines and \npunishments were imposed without guidelines and seemingly at the whim \nof a nameless bureaucrat.\n  I must ask my colleagues, why are we continuing to support a policy \nthat was basically implemented 40 years ago? Why are we supporting a \npolicy that has had little effect on the Government we oppose? Why do \nwe not improve our policy so that it will improve conditions for the \nCuban people and their image of the United States?\n  The bill we are introducing today makes real change in our policy \ntoward Cuba that will lead to a real change for the people of Cuba. \nWhat better way to let the Cuban people know of our concern for their \nplight than for them to hear it from their friends and their extended \nfamily in the United States, or let them hear it from the American \npeople who will go there?\n  The people of this country are our best ambassadors, and we should \nlet them show the people of Cuba what we as a nation are all about. One \nthing we should not do is to play into Castro's hand by enacting \nstricter and more stringent regulations and create a situation where \nthe United States is easy to blame for the problems in Cuba. Unilateral \nsanctions will not improve human rights for Cuban citizens. The rest of \nthe world is not doing what we are doing. Cuba is being supplied by the \nrest of the world with everything they need.\n  Open dialog and exchange of ideas and commerce can move a country \ntoward democracy. What better way to share the rewards of democracy \nthan through people-to-people exchanges? We cannot stop that program. \nIf the United States Government continues on its current course to put \nan economic stranglehold on the Cuban Government, the people of Cuba \nwill suffer. Unilateral sanctions stop not just the flow of goods but \nthe flow of ideas. Ideas of freedom and democracy are the keys to \nchange in any nation.\n  Some may ask why we want to increase dialog right now, why open the \ndoor to Cuba when Castro is behaving so poorly? No one is denying that \nthe actions of Castro and his government are deplorable, as is his \nrefusal to provide basic human rights to his people. But if we truly \nbelieve Castro is a dictator with no good intentions, how can we say we \nshould wait for him to behave before we engage? He controls the entire \nmedia in Cuba. The entire message that is coming out, unless we have \npeople interacting, is his message. Keeping the door closed and \nhollering at Castro on the other side does not do anything.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning, my colleague from Wyoming, \nSenator Enzi, has introduced a piece of legislation I am an original \ncosponsor of. I want to make a point about the legislation.\n  The legislation deals with the freedom of the American people to \ntravel in the country of Cuba. I want to talk about that just for a \nmoment. I support that legislation. The legislation has nothing to do \nwith supporting Fidel Castro. We do not support Fidel Castro. It has \nnothing to do with making life easier for Fidel Castro. This issue is \nnot about Fidel Castro; it is about the American people.\n  Ninety miles off our shores sits a country ruled by communists, a \ncommunist government run by Fidel Castro. We have a communist \ngovernment in the country of China, with 1.3 billion people half way \naround the globe. We have a communist government in the country of \nVietnam. I have visited both.\n  In both of those countries, we have an American Chamber of Commerce. \nThey are doing business in those countries. We have engaged in trade \nand tourism. People travel there. People do business there. Why? \nBecause our country thinks engagement is the right way to move these \ncommunist countries in the right direction toward greater personal \nfreedom and greater liberty for the people of China and Vietnam.\n  But Cuba is 90 miles off the coast of Florida, and we are told that \nCuba is different. Instead of engagement being constructive for Cuba, \nwe are told a 40-year embargo, which has not worked, should be \nretained. That embargo includes not only an embargo on trade with Cuba, \nbut it also includes a restriction on the American people's ability to \ntravel to Cuba. And the restriction is so absurd and so byzantine, here \nis what it has provoked.\n  I had a hearing on this about a year and a half ago. We have people \ndown in the Treasury Department who are spending their days, with \ntaxpayers' money, tracking Americans who have traveled to Cuba, so they \ncan levy a civil fine on those Americans.\n  Let me tell you of one: A retired school teacher in Illinois. She is \na cyclist, loves to bicycle. She answered an ad in a cycling magazine \nand signed up for a 10-day cycling trip in Cuba. This retired school \nteacher--I hope she won't mind me saying, a little, old, retired \nschoolteacher--from Illinois, bicycles in Cuba for 10 days with a \ncycling group, organized by a Canadian cycling company, and she gets \nback to this country only to receive in the mail a notice by the U.S. \nTreasury Department that she has been fined $9,600 for traveling in \nCuba.\n  She would not be fined for traveling in China, a communist country. \nShe would not be fined for traveling in Vietnam, a communist country. \nBut she is fined for traveling in Cuba.\n  Or do you want one better? How about the guy whose dad died, who was \na Cuban citizen who came to this country, and the last thing he wanted \nwas for his ashes to be taken back to Cuba and spread on Cuban soil. So \nhis son did that. But guess what? That son gets caught in the net of \nthe U.S. Treasury Department, because at a time when we are worried \nabout terrorism, we have people down at the Treasury Department who are \nchasing retired school teachers and sons of deceased American citizens \nwho used to live in Cuba who want to take their parents' ashes back to \nCuba.\n  We have people down there spending the taxpayers' dollars and their \ntime, their effort, and energy to see if we can't levy a civil fine \nagainst Americans who travel in Cuba. My colleague, Senator Enzi, has \nintroduced legislation, with myself and others, to say it is not \nhurting Fidel Castro by limiting the freedom and choice of the American \npeople to travel in Cuba. Cuba and the Cuban people would be much \nbetter off with additional travel by Americans and expanded trade. The \nsame circumstances that lead people to believe that engagement with \nChina and Vietnam is helpful ought to understand that it would be \nhelpful with Cuba as well.\n  I have been to Cuba. I have visited with the dissidents. Frankly, \nthey believe the embargo is counterproductive, and they believe lifting \nthe embargo and the travel restrictions would be helpful to their \ncause.\n  Fidel Castro is a Communist and a dictator. What he has done in \nrecent weeks is appalling to me. He has thrown people in jail, \ndissidents, for what they have said and what they think. He has \nexecuted several people in recent weeks who attempted to allow others \nto escape. Shame on him. But it makes no sense for us to continue a \npolicy that is counterproductive.\n  Again, talk to the dissidents in Cuba and they will tell you that \nallowing people to travel to Cuba and allowing our family farmers to \nsell grain to Cuba is constructive.\n  We are finally for the first time able to sell some products into the \nCuban marketplace because I and then former Senator John Ashcroft, now \nAttorney General, offered legislation that opened that embargo of 40 \nyears that did not work, and for the first time in 40 years, 22 train \ncarloads of dried peas left North Dakota to go to the Cuban market, \npurchased by the Cubans.\n  Our farmers for the first time in 42 years sold some food to Cuba. \nThat makes good sense. We should never use food as a weapon. Travel is \nthe same circumstance. Limiting the freedom of the American people \nmakes no sense to me.\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\n  The Enzi bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, moves in the direction \nof eliminating that limitation on travel by the American people.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to offer legislation, along \nwith my colleagues Senator Enzi and Senator Dorgan, that would end the \nrestrictions placed on travel to Cuba.\n  I understand our colleagues in the House will introduce companion \nlegislation in the coming weeks. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in both chambers, and on both sides of the aisle, as we move \nforward.\n  With this legislation, we are undertaking a serious cause. Repeal of \nthe travel ban is long overdue.\n  There are numerous reasons to introduce this legislation, but I want \nto focus today on just two: first, the current situation in Cuba; and \nsecond, our troubled economy here at home.\n  Introduction of this legislation comes at a crucial time in U.S.-Cuba \nrelations. Last month, nearly 80 Cuban dissidents were arrested. All of \nthem have been sentenced to an average of almost 20 years in prison.\n  Democratic governments around the world, as well as human rights \norganizations and others, including myself and my colleagues in the \nSenate and House Cuba Working Groups, have harshly criticized the \nCastro regime for these appalling acts of repression. Yet, throughout \nall of this, the Castro regime has remained defiant and undaunted.\n  Why? In my view it is because Castro wants the embargo to continue. \nObservers have noted an emerging pattern: every time we get close to \nmore open relations, Castro shuts the process down with some repressive \nact, designed to have a chilling effect on U.S.-Cuban relations.\n  Castro fears an end to the embargo. He knows the day the embargo \nfalls is the day he runs out of excuses. Without the embargo, Castro \nwould have no one to blame for the failing Cuban economy.\n  Nor would his way of governing be able to survive the influx of \nAmericans and democratic ideas that would flood his island if the \nembargo were lifted.\n  Now, some Cuba watchers have predicted that the dissident arrests and \nthe resulting decline of U.S.-Cuba relations are a death knell to the \nengagement debate in Washington.\n  I strongly disagree. And I think now, more than ever, a genuine, \nhonest debate about the merits of the embargo is needed.\n  Some people seem to think tightening the embargo is a rational \nresponse to the Castro regime. I guess if you think an embargo can hurt \nCastro without hurting the Cuban people, then tightening the embargo \nmight make some sense.\n  But it does not work that way. The embargo actually hurts the Cuban \npeople much more than it hurts Castro.\n  This is why many Cuban dissidents, including Oswaldo Paya, the \nfounder of the Varela Project, oppose our embargo and support \nengagement.\n  Indeed, after 43 years, it ought to be clear to everyone that the \nembargo has failed to weaken Castro. A better approach is to reach out \nto the Cuban people. Ending the travel ban is the first and best way to \ndo this.\n  If Castro fears contact between the Cuban people and the American \npeople, the rational American response is to send more Americans, not \nfewer.\n  Of course, ending the travel ban would have benefits not only for the \nCuban people, but also for Americans. Ending the travel ban would have \nan immediate and direct economic impact, beyond even the immediate \ntravel sector.\n  Most importantly for my home state of Montana, ending the travel ban \nwould help farmers and ranchers.\n  Americans are currently allowed to sell food and medicine to Cuba on \na cash basis. But there is a lot of red tape thrown in their way. And \nwithout the ability to travel to Cuba and develop the business \ncontacts, the full potential of these sales is not realized.\n  In fact, one study has suggested that lifting the travel ban could \nresult in an additional quarter billion dollars of agricultural sales, \nand create thousands of new jobs.\n  Ending the travel ban would bring benefits to both Cubans and to \nAmericans. And that, after all, is what this debate should be about. \nSupporters of the embargo are so focused on hurting Castro that they \nactually strengthen him--at the expense of the Cuban people, and at the \nexpense of our own economy.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in co-sponsoring this important \nlegislation. I believe it is the best way to show that we truly care \nabout the Cuban people\n  And indeed, if we truly care about democracy, then let us send Cuba \nexactly that. Let us travel to Cuba and show them democracy in action.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I commend my colleague from Wyoming and his leadership in \nrelationship to Cuba, which is of strong interest to businesses and \nfarmers in my home State of Minnesota. I ask unanimous consent to be \nadded as a cosponsor to his legislation. I look forward to working with \nhim as part of his caucus to further those relationships. I again \ncommend the Senator for his leadership in this important area and look \nforward to working with him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Dayton, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 951. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nmedicare beneficiaries a refundable credit against income tax for the \npurchase of outpatient prescription drugs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce this morning a \nbill on which my distinguished colleagues from Minnesota and Maine and \nI have collaborated. That is the Older Americans Prescription Drug Tax \nRelief Act. I will speak a minute or two on it, then should the Senator \nfrom Minnesota desire to speak to this, I will yield to the Senator and \nthen resume the balance of my statement.\n  By way of introduction, all Members of this body have heard the \ntragic stories about older Americans who must choose between paying for \ntheir groceries and paying for their medicines. Many older Americans \nare forced into this choice because, unbelievably, the Medicare program \nstill lacks an outpatient prescription drug benefit. America's seniors \ndeserve much better.\n  Our President, the House of Representatives, and every single Member \nof this Senate, all 100 Members, share the common goal of enacting a \ncomprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit. Over the years, we \nworked diligently to achieve those goals but have yet not reached what \nI would consider, and I think others would consider, success. We have \nall worked in support of this vitally important goal, but, again, \nsuccess has alluded us. Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach a \nconsensus.\n  I hope this bill might be a new initiative that would merit the \nattention of my colleagues, and that it might provide a basis for that \nconsensus. As we here in the Nation's Capital debate how best to add a \nMedicare prescription drug benefit and continue to debate the specifics \nof such benefits such as premiums, co-pays, deductibles, formularies, \nand whether to run the program through the existing Medicare system or \nthrough a public-private partnership, our seniors continue to suffer. \nMedicare beneficiaries have waited far too long for Congress to provide \nsome sort of relief for their prescription drug costs.\n  I remain committed, as are my distinguished colleagues from Minnesota \nand Maine, to working with our colleagues on creating a comprehensive \nprescription drug benefit in the Medicare program. I believe we must \nact now, however, to provide some relief at this point in time. We \ncannot defer this decision any longer. The Warner-Dayton-Collins \nproposal will provide real relief to Medicare beneficiaries. The \nlegislation is simple and can be described in three points.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Virginia, \na leader on this measure. I will be brief because I am scheduled to \nmeet in my office in just a few moments with the nominee for the new \nsuperintendent of the Air Force Academy, which is a matter on which the \nSenator from Virginia has also exhibited great leadership on behalf of \nthis country.\n  I am very proud to join with Senator Warner in sponsoring this \nlegislation. I agree and associate myself with everything the Senator \nhas said regarding this matter.\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\n  I came to the Senate a little over 2 years ago, believing the most \nurgent matter facing our country in the area of social legislation was \nto provide prescription drug coverage for all of our elderly. I have \nbeen dismayed at our inability--all of us--to reach necessary \nagreements so such legislation could be enacted.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator from Virginia that this is \nsomething I hope our colleagues will consider. If there is a better \napproach that we can all agree on this year, then so be it. But in the \nabsence of that, as there has been that failure during the last 2 \nyears, I hope our colleagues will look at this as a very feeling \nalternative. Even if long-term legislation is enacted, I believe it \nwill be at least a year or two before that is available to our senior \ncitizens, before that program is set up. This is an approach that could \nbe implemented very swiftly, could be available almost immediately, and \ncould provide, on an interim basis if not a long-term basis, the \nfinancial assistance our elderly citizens desperately need.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Virginia. I am proud to associate \nmyself with this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague for responding. I wish \nto emphasize a very important point the Senator from Minnesota made.\n  This may not be the final resolution of this complex set of issues. \nBut given the desperate circumstances of so many who have to make the \nchoice between food and drugs, I think it is a very carefully crafted \ninterim step that could be enacted into law and later quickly \nsuperseded should that hoped-for event occur in the future of a more \ncomprehensive piece of legislation.\n  I think the emphasis on that is very important.\n  I would say, all of us here in the Senate benefit greatly by \nprofessional staff. On my staff, Chris Yianilos really worked \ndiligently to bring this legislation into being and he collaborated \nwith a distinguished member of your staff, Mr. Bob Hall. I also thank \nPriscilla Hanley, who worked with Senator Collins on the legislation.\n  The first is that the Warner-Dayton-Collins bill provides Medicare \nbeneficiaries with a refundable--I repeat--a refundable tax credit of \n50 cents on every dollar of out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. \nWhether you actually pay income taxes or not, you are eligible to get \nthe benefit of this tax credit.\n  The benefit is capped at $500 for the expenses of an individual \nsenior. Married seniors would be eligible for a credit up to $1,000. \nThe cap is based on a recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation that \nestimates that the average senior's out-of-pocket prescription drug \ncosts is almost $1,000. Thus the proposal will cover 50 percent of the \nout-of-pocket drug costs for the average senior.\n  To take advantage of this refundable tax credit, Medicare \nbeneficiaries will not have to worry about whether their drug is \ncovered under some formulary. In addition, there are no premiums, no \ndeductibles. Medicare beneficiaries will simply take their \nprescriptions, get them filled, and then apply for their refundable tax \ncredit.\n  Second, in recognition that a generous but necessary refundable tax \ncredit such as this can be costly, we have imposed a responsible income \nphase-out on older Americans who can benefit from this tax credit. The \nphase-out level begins for individuals who earn $75,000 per year. \nMarried Medicare beneficiaries begin to phase-out of the benefit at \n$150,000 a year. This cost containment mechanism will affect less than \n10 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries but allows us to responsibly \nprovide a refundable tax credit that will cover about 50 percent of the \naverage Medicare beneficiary's out-of-pocket drug costs.\n  Again 90 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries will not be affected \nby the phase-out. In other words, they are beneath the phase-out caps. \nOnly those individuals who are blessed with a larger income among \nAmerica's seniors, who can afford in large measure to pay for their \nprescription drugs, will be phased-out.\n  Third, the legislation will sunset once a comprehensive Medicare \nprescription drug benefit is signed into law. Again, as my colleague \nfrom Minnesota mentioned, and others, this is an interim proposal. \nTherefore, it can be superseded by a more comprehensive bill.\n  We wholeheartedly agree this legislation is not a substitute for a \ncomprehensive prescription drug Medicare benefit, and we will continue \nto work with the President and our colleagues from both sides of the \naisle in the Senate who support a more comprehensive piece of \nlegislation. But as I stated earlier, America's seniors cannot wait any \nlonger for relief, and this proposal provides a real benefit to \nAmerica's seniors.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Dayton and Senator Collins in \nintroducing the Older Americans Prescription Drug Tax Relief Act. I \nurge my colleagues to give this matter consideration and, hopefully, it \ncan be enacted into law.\n  Let us do something. Let us open the door and talk to the Cuban \npeople.\n  Travel and other policies that deal with Cuba will continue to be a \ntop priority for those of us in the newly formed Senate Cuba Working \nGroup. The working group members have expressed their support for \nchanges in our policies toward Cuba, and we will continue to be a part \nof the dialogue. I do encourage all of my colleagues to join us in that \neffort.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to take a look at this bill that has \nbeen introduced today. I know there are people looking at it. I expect \na lot more cosponsors on it. This is the most reasonable provision \ndealing with Cuba that has been presented during the 6 years I have \nbeen here. We have tried some bigger bites at the apple. They have not \nworked. So we are moving back to the travel restrictions, a bill that \nis very limited. It allows one to travel and to have those things that \nare necessary for travel. For instance, the right to take baggage to \nCuba cannot be cut off. That is another way the law can be subverted. \nSo it is a very straightforward travel policy that will get Americans \ninto Cuba to talk to Cubans to promote the ideas we believe in. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 952. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nreduce the work hours and increase the supervision of resident-\nphysicians to ensure the safety of patients and resident-physicians \nthemselves; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce my \nlegislation, the Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of \n2003, to limit medical resident work hours to 80 hours a week and to \nprovide real protections for patients and resident physicians who are \nnegatively affected by excessive work hours. I feel strongly that as \nCongress begins to consider proposals to reduce medical malpractice \npremiums and improve quality of care, we must consider the role that \nexcessive work hours play in exacerbating medical liability problems \nand reducing quality of care.\n  It is very troubling that hospitals across the Nation are requiring \nyoung doctors to work 36 hour shifts and as many as 120 hours a week in \norder to complete their residency programs. These long hours lead to a \ndeterioration of cognitive function similar to the effects of blood \nalcohol levels of 0.1 percent. This is a level of cognitive impairment \nthat would make these doctors unsafe to drive--yet these physicians are \nnot only allowed but in fact are required to care for patients and \nperform procedures on patients under these conditions.\n  The Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2003 will \nlimit medical resident work hours to 80 hours a week. Not 40 hours or \n60 hours. 80 hours a week. It is hard to argue that this standard is \nexcessively strict. In fact, it is unconscionable that we now have \nresident physicians, or any physicians for that matter, caring for very \nsick patients 120 hours a week and 36 hours straight with fewer than 10 \nhours between shifts. This is an outrageous violation of a patient's \nright to quality care.\n  In addition to limiting work hours to 80 hours a week, my bill limits \nthe length of any one shift to 24 consecutive hours, while allowing for \nup to three hours of patient transition time, and limits the length of \nan emergency room shift to 12 hours. The bill also ensures that \nresidents have at least one\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nout of seven days off and ``on-call'' shifts no more often that every \nthird night.\n  Since I first introduced the Patient and Physician Safety and \nProtection Act in the 107th Congress, the medical community and the \nAccreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, ACGME, \nspecifically have taken critical steps to address the problem of \nexcessive work hours. The ACGME's recommendations to reduce resident \nwork hours are commendable. If appropriately enforced, these new work \nhour guidelines will go a long way toward reducing the number of hours \nthat residents must work, thereby improving the health of our Nation's \nmedical residents and ensuring the safety of the patients.\n  Despite the medical community's best intentions to reduce work hours, \nhowever, I am very concerned that the ACGME's policy lacks the \nenforcement mechanisms that are essential to ensure compliance with the \nnew work hour rules. Too many hospitals failed to comply with previous \nwork hour requirements mandated by the ACGME because there was \ninsufficient oversight and enforcement. While the new policy \nestablishes more stringent work hours reductions, it fails to create \neffective enforcement and oversight tools. These rules are meaningless \nwithout enforcement.\n  That is why Federal legislation is necessary. The Patient and \nPhysician Safety and Protection Act of 2003 not only recognizes the \nproblem of excessive work hours, but also creates strong enforcement \nmechanisms. The bill also provides funding support to teaching \nhospitals to implement new work hour standards. Without enforcement and \nfinancial support efforts to reduce work hours are not likely to be \nsuccessful.\n  Finally, my legislation provides meaningful enforcement mechanisms \nthat will protect the identity of resident physicians who file \ncomplaints about work hour violations. The ACGME's guidelines do not \ncontain any whistleblower protections for residents that seek to report \nprogram violations. Without this important protection, residents will \nbe reluctant to report these violations, which in turn will weaken \nenforcement.\n  My legislation also makes compliance with these work hour \nrequirements a condition of Medicare participation. Each year, Congress \nprovides $8 billion to teaching hospitals to train new physicians. \nWhile Congress must continue to vigorously support adequate funding so \nthat teaching hospitals are able to carry out this important public \nservice, these hospitals must also make a commitment to ensuring safe \nworking conditions for these physicians and providing the highest \nquality of care to the patients they treat.\n\n  In closing I would like to read a quote from an Orthopedic Surgery \nResident from Northern California, which I think illustrates why we \nneed this legislation.\n  I quote, ``I was operating post-call after being up for over 36 hours \nand was holding retractors. I literally fell asleep standing up and \nnearly face-planted into the wound. My upper arm hit the side of the \ngurney, and I caught myself before I fell to the floor. I nearly put my \nface in the open wound, which would have contaminated the entire field \nand could have resulted in an infection for the patient.''\n  This is a very serious problem that must be addressed before medical \nerrors like this occur. I hope every member of the Senate will consider \nthis legislation and the potential it has to reduce medical errors, \nimprove patient care, and create a safer working environment for the \nbackbone of our Nation's health system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 952\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient and Physician Safety \n     and Protection Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government, through the medicare program, \n     pays approximately $8,000,000,000 per year solely to train \n     resident-physicians in the United States, and as a result, \n     has an interest in assuring the safety of patients treated by \n     resident-physicians and the safety of resident-physicians \n     themselves.\n       (2) Resident-physicians spend as much as 30 to 40 percent \n     of their time performing activities not related to the \n     educational mission of training competent physicians.\n       (3) The excessive numbers of hours worked by resident-\n     physicians is inherently dangerous for patient care and for \n     the lives of resident-physicians.\n       (4) The scientific literature has consistently demonstrated \n     that the sleep deprivation of the magnitude seen in residency \n     training programs leads to cognitive impairment.\n       (5) A substantial body of research indicates that excessive \n     hours worked by resident-physicians lead to higher rates of \n     medical error, motor vehicle accidents, depression, and \n     pregnancy complications.\n       (6) The medical community has not adequately addressed the \n     issue of excessive resident-physician work hours.\n       (7) The Federal Government has regulated the work hours of \n     other industries when the safety of employees or the public \n     is at risk.\n       (8) The Institute of Medicine has found that as many as \n     98,000 deaths occur annually due to medical errors and has \n     suggested that 1 necessary approach to reducing errors in \n     hospitals is reducing the fatigue of resident-physicians.\n\n     SEC. 3.

ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HOSPITAL COSTS.\n\n       There are hereby appropriated to the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services such amounts as may be required to provide \n     for additional payments to hospitals for their reasonable \n     additional, incremental costs incurred in order to comply \n     with the requirements imposed by this Act (and the amendments \n     made by this Act).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Miller, Mr. Lott, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Sessions, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 954. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to provide for the \nprotection of electric utility customers and enhance the stability of \nwholesale electric markets through the clarification of State \nregulatory jurisdiction; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on July 31, 2002, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, FERC, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to \ncreate a one-size-fits-all template for electric markets referred to as \n``standard market design,'' SMD.\n  The SMD rule would bring about numerous sweeping changes, the degree \nand consequences of which are still being assessed. The proposed rule \nwould require customers to pay for transmission facility upgrades \ncaused by new generators, even if the customer does not need or use the \npower from those generators.\n  FERC's proposal would also usurp State authority to obligate \nutilities to serve customers, set generation reserve margins, centrally \ncontrol generation dispatch, and set rates for retail transmission \nservice. FERC's proposed rulemaking will effectively eliminate a \nState's ability to make decisions on issues specific to their State. \nSuch sweeping changes to the energy industry should only be made after \ncareful consideration of all potential consequences. After hearing \nthese concerns, FERC promised a white paper to speak to the many \nconcerns of myself and many others.\n  On April 28, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released its \nlong-awaited white paper on Wholesale Power Markets and Standard Market \nDesign. I and others had hoped that the release of that paper would \nsignal a shift in the approach that the Commission has been taking with \nrespect to the ``federalization'' of electricity regulation and \nmarkets. Disappointingly, despite some modest changes in approach, the \nCommission and Chairman Pat Wood have decided to move away from a \npartnership with the States toward Federal domination of the \nelectricity system and electricity regulation.\n  In the document, the Commission reasserts its authority to regulate \nthe terms and conditions of retail transmission, mandates the formation \nof Regional Transmission Organizations, and limits State authority to \nprotect existing native load customers from the loss of transmission \nrights. The paper promises more ``technical conferences'' and \nconsultation with the States, but does not change the premise upon \nwhich the Commission's Standard Market Design, ``SMD'', Notice of \nProposed Rulemaking rests--that the States and regions serve only as \nadjuncts to the Commission as it devises new wholesale market rules \nthat directly impinge upon retail markets.\n  In light of the Commission's white paper and the Senate's intention \nof quickly addressing energy policy, my colleagues and I present \nlegislation today to ensure the concerns of my constituents and the \nconstituents of my colleagues are addressed. This crucial legislation \nwill ensure that States maintain their jurisdiction over retail \nutilities, that native load customers can be assured of reliability of \nservice, that customers are not forced to socialize the cost of new \ntransmission developed in their area but intended for other regions, \nand finally the legislation will prohibit the FERC from implementing \nits current SMD rule nor any rule that is of similar substance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Dayton, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n  S. 956. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to permit States and local educational agencies to decide the \nfrequency of using high quality assessments to measure and increase \nstudent academic achievement, to permit States and local educational \nagencies to obtain a waiver of certain testing requirements, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as millions of public school students \nand teachers around the country prepare to complete their first school \nyear under the No Child Left Behind Act, NCLB, I am introducing a bill \nthat would help to return a measure of local control that was taken \nfrom school districts and States by its enactment last year.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Jeffords, \nDayton, and Leahy.\n  I have heard a lot of concern from my constituents about various \naspects of the President's education bill. Following the enactment of \nthe bill last year, the drumbeat of concern has continued to \nreverberate throughout my\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nState, and has gotten even louder, as students, teachers, parents, \nadministrators, school counselors and social workers, and others are \nlearning first-hand about the effect of the NCLB.\n  I strongly support maintaining local control over decisions affecting \nour children's day-to-day classroom experiences. I also believe that \nthe Federal Government has an important role to play in supporting our \nState educational agencies and local school districts as they carry out \ntheir most important responsibility--the education of our children.\n  I voted against the President's education bill in large part because \nof the new annual testing mandate for students in grades 3-8. While I \nagree that there should be a strong accountability system in place to \nensure that public school students are making progress, I strongly \noppose over-testing students in our public schools. I agree that some \ntests are needed to ensure that our children are keeping pace, but \ntaking time to test students has to take a back seat to taking the time \nto teach students in the first place.\n  I have heard a lot about these new annual tests from the people of \nWisconsin, and their response has been almost universally negative. My \nconstituents are concerned about this additional layer of testing for \nmany reasons, including the cost of developing and implementing these \ntests, the loss of teaching time every year to prepare for and take the \ntests, and the extra pressure that the tests will place on students, \nteachers, schools, and school districts.\n  I share my constituents' concerns about this new Federal mandate. I \nfind it interesting that proponents of the NCLB say that it will return \nmore control to the States and local school districts. In my view, \nhowever, this massive new Federal testing mandate runs counter to the \nidea of local control.\n  Many States and local school districts around the country, including \nWisconsin, already have comprehensive testing programs in place. The \nFederal Government should leave decisions about the frequency of using \nhigh quality assessments to measure and increase student academic \nachievement up to the States and local school districts that bear the \nresponsibility for educating our children. Every State and every school \ndistrict is different. A uniform testing policy may not be the best \napproach.\n  I have heard from many education professionals in my State that this \nnew testing requirement is a waste of money and a waste of time. These \npeople are dedicated professionals who are committed to educating \nWisconsin's children, and they don't oppose testing. I think we can all \nagree that testing has its place. What they oppose is the magnitude of \ntesting that is required by this law.\n  Beginning in the 2005-2006 school year, the NCLB will pile more tests \non our Nation's public school students. And of course, when those tests \nare piled on students, they burden our teachers as well, because \nteachers must spend more and more time preparing students to take these \nexams.\n  This kind of teaching, sometimes called ``teaching to the test,'' is \nbecoming more and more prevalent in our schools as testing has become \nincreasingly common. The dedicated teachers in our classrooms will now \nbe constrained by teaching to yet more tests, instead of being able to \nuse their own judgment about what subject areas the class needs to \nspend extra time studying. This additional testing time could also \nreduce the opportunity for teachers to create and implement innovative \nlearning experiences for their students.\n  Teachers in my State are concerned about the amount of time that they \nwill have to spend preparing their students to take the tests and \nadministering the tests. They are concerned that these additional tests \nwill disrupt the flow of education in their classrooms. One teacher \nsaid the preparation for the tests Wisconsin already requires in grades \n3, 4, 8, and 10 can take up to a month, and the administration of the \ntest takes another week. That is five weeks out of the school year. And \nnow the Federal Government is requiring teachers to take a huge chunk \nout of instruction time each year in grades 3-8. In my view, and in the \nview of the people of my state, this time can be better spent on \nregular classroom instruction.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, the Student Testing \nFlexibility Act of 2003, would give States and local school districts \nthat have demonstrated academic success the flexibility to apply to \nwaive the new annual testing requirements in the NCLB. States and \nschool districts with waivers would still be required to administer \nhigh quality tests to students in, at a minimum, reading or language \narts and mathematics at least once in grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12 as \nrequired under the law.\n  This bill would allow States and school districts that meet the same \nspecific accountability criteria outlined for school-level excellence \nunder the State Academic Achievement Award Program to apply to the \nSecretary of Education for a waiver from the new annual reading or \nlanguage arts and mathematics tests for students in grades 3-8. The \nwaiver would be for a period of three years and would be renewable, so \nlong as the state or school district meets the criteria.\n  To qualify for the waiver, the State or school district must have \nsignificantly closed the achievement gap among a number of subgroups of \nstudents as required under Title I, or must have exceeded their \nadequate yearly progress, AYP, goals for two or more consecutive years. \nThe bill would require the Secretary to grant waivers to states or \nschool districts that meet these criteria and apply for the waiver. \nIndividual districts in states that have waivers would not be required \nto apply for a separate waiver.\n  The Federal Government should not impose an additional layer of \ntesting on states that are succeeding in meeting or exceeding their AYP \ngoals or on closing the achievement gap. Instead, we should allow those \nStates that have demonstrated academic success to use their share of \nFederal testing money to help those schools that need it the most.\n  The bill I am introducing today would do just that by allowing states \nwith waivers to retain their share of the Federal funding appropriated \nto develop and implement the new annual tests. These important dollars \nwould be used for activities that these States deem appropriate for \nimproving student achievement at individual public elementary and \nsecondary schools that have failed to make AYP.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by the American \nAssociation of School Administrators, the National PTA, the National \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals, the National Association \nof Secondary School Principals, the School Social Work Association of \nAmerica, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, the Wisconsin \nEducation Association Council, the Wisconsin Association of School \nBoards, the Milwaukee Teachers' Education Association, and the \nWisconsin School Administrators Alliance, which includes the \nAssociation of Wisconsin School Administrators, the Wisconsin \nAssociation of School District Administrators, the Wisconsin \nAssociation of School Business Officials, and the Wisconsin Council for \nAdministrators of Special Services.\n  While this bill focuses on the over-testing of students in our public \nschools, I would like to note that my constituents have raised a number \nof other concerns about the NCLB that I hope will be addressed by \nCongress. My constituents are concerned about, among other things, the \nnew AYP requirements, the effect that the Act will have on rural school \ndistricts, and about finding the funding necessary to implement all of \nthese provisions of this new law. I share these concerns.\n  I regret that, for the second year in a row, the President's budget \nrequest did not fully fund NCLB requirements and failed to provide any \nfunding to crucial programs such as rural education and school \ncounseling. If we are to truly leave no child behind, we must provide \nadequate funding for programs such as Title I, special education and \nprofessional development in order to ensure that all students have the \nmeans to succeed. To do less sets up some of our most vulnerable \nstudents for failure.\n  I hope that my bill, the Student Testing Flexibility Act, will help \nto focus attention on the perhaps unintended consequences of the \nongoing implementation of the President's education bill for states, \nschool districts, and individual schools, teachers, and students.\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 956\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to prevent abuse of recipients of long-term care services under the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Flight \nAttendant Certification Act.''\n  Since September 11, flight attendants have become a last line of \ndefense against terrorist attacks. As we all know, the terrorists \nhijacked four commercial jets--all of which were heading to California. \nThat day forever changed air travel in this country, and in turn \nforever changed the security functions of flight attendants.\n  No one can forget that it was a flight attendant who discovered that \nRichard Reid was trying to ignite a bomb on his shoe. If not for the \naware flight attendant, the bomb could have gone off over the Atlantic \nand all the passengers and crew would have been lost.\n  Today, I can say with certainty that air travel is more secure than \nit was a year and a half ago. But that does not mean that more should \nnot be done. We must continue to take the appropriate steps to ensure \nthat we are doing everything in our power to prevent terrorist attacks \nand protect the American people. That is why I am proud to offer this \nlegislation.\n  This bill would make American air travel safer by requiring that \nflight attendants be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, \nFAA. Currently, flight attendants are not required to receive formal \ncertification even though they have the responsibility for safety, \nsecurity, and emergency response.\n  In addition, the legislation would close the growing gap in the \nquality and content of training programs between airlines by creating a \nsingle training standard across the industry. This bill would require \nuniform training standards and establish a central approval process for \ncertification of flight attendants at the FAA.\n  The FAA already recognizes the training of other airline personnel by \nissuing certification to pilots, mechanics, air-traffic controllers and \nothers. Flight attendants deserve the same recognition and \ncertification.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Patient \nAbuse Prevention Act, which will go a long way in protecting patients \nin long-term care from abuse and neglect. This legislation will \nestablish a National Registry of abusive long-term care workers and \nrequire criminal background checks for potential employees. It is \nnecessary so we can ensure that people with violent and abusive \nbackgrounds cannot find work in nursing homes and home health and prey \non our elderly relatives. After many years of refinement so that the \nbackground checks will run smoothly, and with the strong support of \nboth patient advocates and the American Association of Homes and \nServices for the Aging, I sincerely hope that this is the year when we \nwill finally take action and enact these common-sense protections.\n  There is absolutely no excuse for abuse or neglect of the elderly and \ndisabled at the hands of those who are supposed to care for them. Our \nparents and grandparents made our country what it is today, and they \ndeserve to live with dignity and the highest quality care.\n  Unfortunately, this is not always the case. We know that the majority \nof caregivers are dedicated, professional, and do their best under \ndifficult circumstances. But it only takes a few abusive staff to cast \na dark shadow over what should be a healing environment.\n  Current State and national safeguards are inadequate to screen out \nabusive workers. All States are required to maintain registries of \nabusive nurse aides. But nurse aides are not the only workers involved \nin abuse, and other workers are not tracked at all. Even worse, there \nis no system to coordinate information about abusive nurse aides \nbetween States. A known abuser in Iowa would have little trouble moving \nto Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients there.\n  In addition, there is no Federal requirement that long-term care \nfacilities conduct criminal background checks on prospective employees. \nPeople with violent criminal backgrounds--people who have already been\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\nconvicted of murder, rape, and assault--could easily get a job in a \nnursing home or other health care setting without their past ever being \ndiscovered.\n  Our legislation will go a long way toward solving this problem. \nFirst, it will create a National Registry of abusive long-term care \nemployees. States will be required to submit information from their \ncurrent State registries to the National Registry. Facilities will be \nrequired to check the National Registry before hiring a prospective \nworker. Any worker with a substantiated finding of patient abuse will \nbe prohibited from working in long-term care.\n  Second, the bill provides a second line of defense to protect \npatients from violent criminals. If the National Registry does not \ncontain information about a prospective worker, the facility is then \nrequired to initiate an FBI background check. Any conviction for \npatient abuse or a relevant violent crime would bar that applicant from \nworking with patients.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where workers with \ncriminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct patient care, \nand have subsequently abused patients in their care. Unfortunately, \nthese news reports have tragically become commonplace over the years. \nIn 1997, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel ran a series of articles \ndescribing this problem, including a Green Bay employee who was \nconvicted of sexually assaulting a disabled woman, an Oshkosh employee \nwho physically and emotionally abused nursing home residents, and a \nMilwaukee employee who charged more than $2,000 on a home health \nclient's credit card. All had prior criminal convictions. A 1999 Bergen \nRecord study of home health workers found that in nearly every county, \ncriminals were working in the homes of the elderly and infirm. Many \naides had committed offenses against patients in their care, but they \nwere still listed as certified and eligible for work in State records. \nMost recently, the Chicago Sun-Times ran an article on November 1, \n2002, in which a home care aide beat his disabled client to death with \na hammer. That caregiver had previously been convicted of shooting a \nman in the face.\n  In 1998, at my request, the Senate Special Committee on Aging held a \nhearing that focused on how easy it is for known abusers to find work \nin long-term care and continue to prey on patients. At that hearing, \nthe HHS Inspector General presented a report which found that, in the \ntwo States they studied, between 5 to 10 percent of employees currently \nworking in nursing homes had serious criminal convictions in their \npast. They also found that among aides who had abused patients, 15 to \n20 percent of them had at least one conviction in their past.\n  In 1998, I offered an amendment which became law that allowed long-\nterm care providers to voluntarily use the FBI system for background \nchecks. So far, 7 percent of those checks have come back with criminal \nconvictions, including rape and kidnapping.\n  And on July 30, 2001, the House Government Reform Committee's Special \nInvestigations Division of the Minority staff issued a report which \nfound that in the past two years, over 30 percent of nursing homes in \nthe U.S. were cited for a physical, sexual, or verbal abuse violation \nthat had the potential to harm residents. Even more striking, the \nreport found that nearly 10 percent of nursing homes had violations \nthat caused actual harm to residents.\n  Let me say again that despite this evidence, I know that the vast \nmajority of caregivers in nursing homes and home health care do an \nexcellent job and have their patients' best interests at heart. But \nclearly, a national background check system is a critical tool that all \nlong-term care providers should have--after all, they don't want \nabusive caregivers working for them any more than families do. I am \npleased that the nursing home industry has worked with me over the \nyears to refine this legislation, and I greatly appreciate their \ncontinued support of the bill. This bill reflects their input and will \nhelp ensure a smooth transition to an efficient, accurate background \ncheck system. This is a common-sense, cost-effective step we can and \nshould take to protect patients by helping long-term care providers \nthoroughly screen potential caregivers.\n  I realize that this legislation will not solve all instances of \nabuse. We still need to do more to stop abuse from occurring in the \nfirst place. But this bill will ensure that those who have already \nabused an elderly or disabled patient, and those who have committed \nviolent crimes against people in the past, are kept away from \nvulnerable patients.\n  I want to repeat again that I strongly believe that most long-term \ncare providers and their staff work hard to deliver the highest quality \ncare. However, it is imperative that Congress act immediately to get \nrid of those that don't.\n  This bill is the product of collaboration and input from the health \ncare industry, patient and employee advocates--who all have the same \ngoal I do: protecting patients in long-term care. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with my colleagues, the Administration, and the \nhealth care industry in this effort. Protecting our nation's seniors \nand disabled deserves our full attention.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 958\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit the age restrictions imposed by the \nAdministrator of the Federal Aviation Administration for the issuance \nor renewal of certain airman certificates, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as the Senate's only commercially licensed \npilot, I rise today, along with my colleagues, Senator Kyl, Senator \nBurns, Senator Thomas and Senator Grassley, to introduce a bill that \nwill help end age discrimination among airline pilots.\n  This bill will abolish the Federal Aviation Administration's, FAA, \nAge 60 Rule--the regulation that for 43 years has forced the retirement \nof airline pilots the day they turn 60--and replace it with a rational \nplan that raises the retirement age to 63 immediately and then \nincrementally increases the age limit to 65.\n  Most nations have abolished mandatory age 60 retirement rules. The \nUnited States is one of only two countries in the Joint Aviation \nAuthorities that requires its commercial pilots to retire at the age of \n60. Some countries, including Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have \nno upper age limit at all.\n  The Age 60 Rule has no basis in science or safety and never did. FAA \ndata shows that pilots over age 60 are as safe as, and in some cases \nsafer than, their younger colleagues. In 1981, the National Institute \nof Aging stated that ``the Age 60 Rule appears indefensible on medical \ngrounds'' and ``there is no convincing medical evidence to support age \n60, or any other specific age, for mandatory pilot retirement.''\n  This bill will allow our most experienced pilots--demonstrably \nhealthy, and fit for duty--to retain their jobs, a step that will \nbenefit pilots, the financially burdened airlines, and most \nimportantly, passengers. Now, more than ever before, we need to keep \nour best pilots flying.\n  Again, there is no scientific justification for requiring pilots to \nretire at age 60. Our pilots, our airlines, and our passengers deserve \nour consideration. I urge the rest of my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 959\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON AGE RESTRICTIONS.\n\n       Section 44703 of title 49, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k) Limitation on Age Restrictions.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Administrator may not, solely by reason of a \n     person's age, if such person is 65 years of age or younger--\n       ``(A) refuse to issue to, or renew for, such person an \n     airman certificate for the operation of aircraft engaged in \n     operations under part 121 or part 135 of title 14, Code of \n     Federal Regulations; or\n       ``(B) require an air carrier to terminate the employment \n     of, or refuse to employ, such person as a pilot on such an \n     aircraft owned or operated by the air carrier.\n       ``(2) Applicability.--Paragraph (1) shall only apply to \n     persons who have not reached the age of 64 as of the date of \n     enactment of this subsection.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 960. A bill to amend the reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to authorize certain projects in the State of \nHawaii and to amend the Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2000 to modify \nthe water resources study; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize three important water reclamation projects in the State of \nHawaii. In addition, this bill increases the amount authorized for the \nFederal share of the activities under P.L. 106-566, the Hawaii Water \nResources Act of 2000.\n  The Hawaii Water Resources Act of 2000 was an important first step in \naddressing Hawaii's irrigation and water delivery systems. It allowed \nthe Bureau of Reclamation to survey irrigation and water delivery \nsystems in Hawaii. It also instructed the Bureau to identify new \nopportunities for reclamation and reuse of water and wastewater for \nagriculture and non-agricultural purposes. In addition, the Act \nincluded Hawaii in the Bureau of Reclamation's wastewater reclamation \nprogram and extended drought relief programs to Hawaii. While this was \nan important beginning, more needs to be done, particularly since the \nHonolulu Board of Water Supply predicts that even with improved \nconservation methods, the island of Oahu will run out of potable water \nby 2018. This means that the use rate exceeds the recharge rate and \nOahu residents and visitors will be ``mining'' for water. Even more \ndisconcerting is the fact that Oahu will run out of fresh water by \n2018. It is vitally important for the State of Hawaii to begin working \non water reclamation projects.\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\n  This legislation authorizes three water reclamation projects. The \nfirst project, in Honolulu, will provide reliable potable water through \nresource diversification to meet existing and future demands, \nparticularly in the Ewa area of Oahu where water demands are outpacing \nthe availability of drinking water. The second project, in North Kona, \nwill address the issue of effluent being discharged into a temporary \ndisposal sump from the Kealakehe Wastewater Treatment Plant. The third \nproject, in Lahaina, will reduce the use of potable water by extending \nthe County of Maui's main recycled water pipeline. The legislation also \nauthorizes an additional $1.7 million for the Bureau of Reclamation to \ncomplete its study of Hawaii's irrigation and water delivery systems. \nThis is a challenging task as the Bureau is reviewing the water systems \nin the State.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation which is vital to \nthe people of Hawaii.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 961. A bill to expand the scope of the HUBzone program to include \ndifficult development areas; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto correct an inequity in the HUBzone contracting program administered \nby the Small Business Administration, SBA. This bill amends the \ncriteria by which areas are designated as HUBzone under the Small \nBusiness Act by adding a new category designated as ``Difficult \nDevelopment Areas.'' These ``Difficult Development Areas'' are already \nrecognized by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. For reasons I will explain, the \nbusinesses and people in the community of Ketchikan, AK have been \nwrongly denied participation in the HUBzone program. This bill will \ntake care of that problem.\n  The current HUBzone qualifications have two tiers. The first is that \nthe county in which a business seeking to participate in the program \nmust not be located in a Metropolitan Statistical Area, MSA. The second \nlevel has three separate criteria. If an area meets any one of the \nsecond level criteria, it qualifies as a HUBzone area. One of the \ncriteria simply relates to whether a business is located in an Indian \nReservation. The other two are correlated to the characteristics of the \nresident population.\n  The first of the characteristic is that the area is not located in a \nmetropolitan statistical area at the time of the most recent census. \nthe second criterion is that the unemployment rate in the area is not \nless than 140 percent of the statewide average unemployment. In the \ncase of Ketchikan, the community is not located in a metropolitan \nstatistical area. In February of this year the Alaska statewide \nunemployment rate was 7.1 percent almost 2 percent higher than the \nnational average. But Ketchian's preliminary unemployment rate for \nFebruary is 11 percent and the reviewed rate for January was 11.9 \npercent. The Ketchikan figure currently exceeds the requirement. In \nJune of 2002 the rate was 8.6 percent in the Ketchikan Gateway Borough \nin comparison to 7.4 percent statewide at that same time. But because \nof the timing of the compiling of the information by the Census Bureau, \nKetchikan has been denied participation in the program although it \nroutinely exceeds the statewide rate. The anomaly is that for a few \nshort months in the summer Ketchikan does not exceed 140 percent of the \nstatewide average due to the influx of workers from the area related to \nthe tourism industry.\n  The SBA has the best intentions and understands the problems. \nHowever, the SBA has stated to me that nothing short of a legislative \nchange can fix the problem. Part of the problem as I understand it is \nthat the SBA's current use of the median income and unemployment rate \ncriteria makes the assumption that the populations are relatively \nimmobile. Further, the SBA criterion assumes that the area in question \nhas a fully developed labor market. The criteria assume a community \nmodel more closely aligned to the traditional urban areas.\n  In Alaska, our largest community, Anchorage is rightfully not \nconsidered a HUBzone area. But the SBA's criteria based on the use of \nthe Census Bureau statistics fails to accurately reflect the true \nunemployment and labor market in one place in particular in Alaska--\nKetchikan. The program now uses a Qualified Census Tract.\n  Ketchikan is a small coastal community that was highly dependent on \nthe timber industry which has been shut down as a result of changes in \nFederal policies and activities of the U.S. Forest Service. As a \nresult, the population has become highly dependent on the tourism \nindustry. Further, the labor pool is highly transient and leaves to \ncollect unemployment after the summer tourist season is over.\n  The Census Bureau data taken when the summer population is higher and \nmore fully employed does not reflect the reality of the area. As a \nresult the Ketchikan Gateway Borough is not considered a HUBzone. There \nis a dry-dock and ship repair facility located in Ketchikan that could \nprovide year round employment. But it cannot compete for government \nvessel repair contracts offered by the U.S. Coast Guard and the NOAA \nthat have been set aside for HUBzone. These vessels operate in Alaska \nand could be better repaired near where they operate. Now they must \nleave the State and perhaps be out of service longer.\n  The bill adds a fourth area to qualify as a HUBzone. The Deptartment \nof Housing and Urban Development already has a program that recognizes \nnot only the Qualified Census Tracts but also denotes a ``Non-\nmetropolitan Difficult Development Area.'' The amendment simply adds \nthis Difficult Development Area. Many of these areas already qualify as \nHUBzones under the prior three criteria. I have asked the SBA to advise \nme how much this would expand their program but in reality I expect the \naddition to be only a minor expansion of the HUBzone program. However \nsmall the change is, the change will be significant to the people and \nbusinesses located in Ketchikan, AK.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 961\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \naccelerate the increase in the child tax credit and to expand \nrefundability of such credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor legislation \nbeing introduced today that will dramatically improve the child tax \ncredit. I thank my friend and colleague, Senator Lincoln, for her hard \nwork on behalf of our Nation's working families.\n  In the 6 years since the child tax credit was first enacted, it has \nprovided important tax relief to families across the country. Income \ntaxes can be particularly burdensome to moderate income families who \nare facing increased costs for food, housing, medicine, education, and \nother basic needs for their children. Indeed, almost half of the \nbenefits of this credit are enjoyed by families with taxable income \nunder $50,000 per year. This is important in States like mine; in West \nVirginia, almost 80 percent of the taxpayers have annual incomes below \n$50,000.\n  While the current child tax credit is excellent--it could be even \nbetter. The $600 credit, which is available only for children under the \nage of 17, does not truly recognize the costs that face many families \nraising children. Moreover, many working families do not have enough \nincome to qualify for the credit. Make no mistake, I am talking about \nhard-working parents who go to\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\ntheir jobs every day and take their responsibilities to their children \nvery seriously. These parents are paying payroll taxes, but cannot \nprovide for some of the basic needs of their children. The legislation \nintroduced today would improve the law so that a greater portion of the \nchild tax credit could be refunded to these admirable parents.\n  Specifically, this legislation includes two important improvements to \nthe current child tax credit that will benefit all families who claim \nthe credit. First, the legislation would increase the amount of the tax \ncredit from $600 to $1,000 immediately. Second, the bill increases the \nage of children who are eligible for the credit from 16 to 18. We know \nthat 17- and 18-year-old children are facing enormous educational \nexpenses in order to attend college or technical school. We ought to \nhelp parents pay for this education by allowing them to continue to \nreceive the child tax credit until their child is a legal adult. The \nbill also includes two important improvements to the eligibility \ncriteria for the refundable credit. By lowering the income threshold \nfor the refundable credit and increasing the percentage of income \neligible for the refundable credit, we can ensure that more of the \nfamilies most in need of assistance can benefit from this credit.\n  The child tax credit is one of the most important ways that Congress \ncan demonstrate its support for America's families. And I hope that my \ncolleagues will support this legislation which would dramatically \nimprove the child tax credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 963. A bill to require the Commandant of the Coast Guard to convey \nthe United States Coast Guard Cutter Bramble, upon its decommissioning, \nto the Port Huron Museum of Arts and History, Port Huron, Michigan, for \nuse for education and historical display, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of a \nbill I am introducing to turn the historic United States Coast Guard \nCutter Bramble, into a floating maritime museum in Port Huron, MI, \nafter she is decommissioned later this year.\n  Once you hear the history of the Bramble, I am sure you will all \nagree that not only should she be preserved, but the Port Huron Museum \nof Arts and History will be able to provide the ideal home.\n  The Bramble has been part of many important missions since it was \nfirst launched on October 23, 1943.\n  But--along with her sister ships, Spar and Storis--the Bramble is \nbest known for being part of the first mission by United States vessels \nto steam from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean via the Northwest \nPassage. Upon completing this mission, Bramble and her sister ships \nwent on to become the first to circumnavigate the North American \ncontinent--a dream of sailors for more than 400 years.\n  The Bramble set out on this historic mission from Miami, Florida, on \nMay 24, 1957. Steaming through the Panama Canal to the Pacific Ocean, \nthe Bramble then headed to Seattle.\n  On July 1, 1957, the Bramble left Seattle and headed toward the \nAtlantic Ocean via the Bering Straights and the Arctic Ocean. Sixty-\nfour days and 4,500 miles later, the Bramble and her sister ships \nreached the Atlantic and on December 2, 1957, she tied up again in \nMiami--completing the first circumnavigation of the North American \ncontinent.\n  For that reason alone, the Bramble would be worth saving as a museum \nof maritime history.\n  But over her 60 year history, the Bramble has seized tons of illegal \ndrugs, saved hundreds of lives in search and rescue missions, helped \ntrain maritime police in 10 Caribbean nations, maintained buoys and \nother aids to navigation, performed icebreaking duties in the Great \nLakes and been the recipient of numerous awards, service ribbons and \ncommendations.\n  The Bramble also has a long history with Michigan and Port Huron and \nthat is why I believe my State would make an excellent home once this \nhistoric ship is retired.\n  The Bramble first came to Detroit, MI, in 1962, where she performed \nsearch and rescue, icebreaking, law enforcement and navigation missions \nthroughout the Great Lakes.\n  Since 1975, the Bramble's homeport has been Port Huron. And that is \nwhere I think she should stay after she is decommissioned.\n  The Coast Guard motto is Semper Paratus--or Always Ready.\n  For 60 years the Bramble has been there--always ready to serve our \ncountry in waters close to home and far away.\n  And I believe that as a museum of maritime history, she can continue \nserving us for years to come--still Semper Paratus--still Always Ready.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the continuing economic crisis facing \nthe U.S. airline industry also imperils the future of hundreds of small \nand rural communities across our country as air carriers drastically \nreduce service to small and rural communities. While small and rural \ncommunities have long had to cope with limited and unreliable service, \nthese problems have been exacerbated by the weakened financial \ncondition of most major U.S. airlines.\n  Faced with declining revenues brought on by the Nation's economic \ndownturn, the events of September 11, 2001 and the war in Iraq most \ncarriers have substantially reduced or eliminated service to many \ncommunities. In the last month, United Air Lines, US Airways and \nContinental Airlines announced significant service cuts to West \nVirginia.\n  Last month, this Congress provided $3.5 billion in direct and \nindirect benefits to the Nation's airlines. I strongly supported this \npackage because our economy requires a strong and vibrant airline \nindustry. In my own aviation relief package, I had provided resources \nto the airlines to continue to provide air service to small and rural \ncommunities. Even in the best of times, these communities face a \ndifficult time maintaining and developing new air service options. \nToday, their challenge is preventing the complete loss of air service. \nIn these difficult economic and uncertain times, I strongly believe \nthat the Federal Government must continue to assist our most vulnerable \ncommunities stay connected to the Nation's aviation network--a network \npaid for by all Americans.\n  The reduction or elimination of air service had a devastating effect \non the economy of a community. Having adequate air service is not just \na matter of convenience, but a matter of economic survival. Without \naccess to reliable air service, no business is willing to locate their \noperations in these areas of the country no matter how attractive the \nquality of life. Airports are economic engines that attract critical \nnew development opportunities and jobs.\n  West Virginia has been able to attract firms from around the world \nbecause corporate executives know they can visit their operations with \nease. Rural and small town America must continue to be adequately \nlinked to the Nation's air transportation network if its people and \nbusinesses are to compete economically with larger urban areas in this \ncountry and around the world.\n  In the Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, we \nbegan to address the need to improve air service in small and rural \ncommunities. I, along with many of my colleagues, supported the \ncreation of the Small Community Air Service Development Pilot Program, \na competitive grant program to provide communities with the resources \nthey needed to attract new air service to their communities. The \nprogram is an enormous success. Over 180 communities applied for 40 \ngrants in the first year funds were available. The Department of \nTransportation has announced the next round of funding.\n\n  In West Virginia, Charleston received money under the program and has \nused it to successfully attract a new service connection to Houston, an \nimportant gateway to the markets of Latin America. This program gave \nlocal communities the ability and flexibility to meet local air \ntransportation needs.\n  The Aviation Investment and Revitalization Vision Act, cosponsored by \nmyself and Senator Lott, reauthorizes the expands the successful Small \nCommunity Air Service Development Program. The bill authorizes the \nparticipation of 120 communities over 3 years.\n  Many of our most isolated and vulnerable communities whose only \nservice is through the Essential Air Service Program have indicated \nthat they would like to develop innovative and flexible programs that \ncommunities who received Small Community Air Service Development grants \nto improve the quality of their air service.\n  It is for this reason that I, along with Senator Lott, have \nintroduced the Small Community and Rural Air Service Revitalization Act \nof 2003. The legislation reauthorizes the Department of \nTransportation's Essential Air Service, EAS, program and creates a \nseries of pilot programs for EAS communities to participate to \nstimulate passenger demand for air service in their communities.\n  Under the bill, communities are given the option on continuing their \nEAS as is or they may apply to participate in new incentive programs to \nhelp them develop new and innovative solutions to increasing local \ndemand for air\n\n[[Page S5612]]\n\nservice. The EAS Marketing and Community Flexibility Programs would \nprovide communities new resources and tools to implement locally \ndeveloped plans to improve their air service. By providing communities \nthe ability to design their own air service proposals, a community has \nthe ability to develop a plan that meets it locally determined needs, \nimproves air service choices, and gives the community a greater stake \nin the EAS program.\n  Specifically, these new EAS pilot programs include authorization for \nthe use of smaller planes to decrease cost or increase frequency, \ncommunities to cost-share for service above base EAS subsidy level, \nalternative service at up to 3 EAS points if a community applies, an \nopt out of the EAS program with a one-time infusion of funding to \nassist in transition out of the program, and DOT to mandate multiple \ncode-sharing arrangements for EAS providers.\n  A pilot program added at the request of Senator Lott would allow DOT \nto require a cost-share for up to 10 communities within 100 miles of a \nhub. I have significant reservations about forcing communities to pay \nfor a service the Federal Government promised them.\n  In addition, the communities that participate in EAS are small and \nisolated and have lower than average per captia incomes than urban or \nsuburban communities. Cash-strapped communities will have to provide \nanywhere between $50,000 and $120,000 in local funds to continue their \nEAS service. I worked with Senator Lott to make sure DOT considers a \nvariety of relevant factors when selecting communities, to provide \ncommunities appeal rights, and to make sure they have access to all \nother pro-active pilot programs. I will monitor DOT's implementation of \nthis pilot program closely.\n  Small and rural communities are the first to bear the brunt of bad \neconomic times and the last to see the benefits of good times. The \ngeneral economic downturn and the dire straits of the aviation industry \nhave placed exceptional burdens on air service to our most isolated \ncommunities. The Federal Government must provide additional resources \nand tools for small communities to help themselves attract adequate air \nservice. The Federal Government must make sure that our most vulnerable \ntowns and cities are linked to the rest of the Nation. My legislation \nbuilds on existing programs and strengthens them. If these bills are \nenacted, our constituents will have the tools and resources necessary \nto attract air service, related economic development, and most \nimportantly expand their connections to the national and global \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5612-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 126--COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA GOLDEN \n    GOPHERS FOR WINNING THE 2002-2003 NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC \n      ASSOCIATION DIVISION I NATIONAL COLLEGIATE MEN'S ICE HOCKEY \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Dayton) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I submit this measure today to call \nattention to one of the most serious injustices in our country. 42 \nmillion Americans lack access to quality, affordable health care \nbecause they have no health insurance. Most of these Americans work in \nfull-time jobs, but still cannot afford the high cost of health care. \nAs a result, hospital emergency rooms are their only doctor. They face \nimpossible choices in paying for the medicine they need on top of \npaying the rent, or putting food on the table. As a result, they die \nyounger. Yet, the richest and most powerful Nation in the world looks \nthe other way.\n  For half a century, the United States has led the world in scientific \nand medical advances. We have more Nobel Prize winners in medicine than \nany other Nation. We were the first to successfully decode the entire \nhuman genome. And yet, we cannot see that every American child gets \nvaccinated against deadly and disabling diseases. We fail to guarantee \nthat all Americans can obtain the medical treatments that could save \ntheir lives.\n  Every year, 8 million uninsured Americans fail to take their \nmedications because they can't afford to pay for their prescriptions. \n300,000 children with asthma never get treated by a doctor. Uninsured \nwomen diagnosed with breast cancer are 50 percent more likely to die \nfrom the disease, because their cancer is diagnosed too late. 32,000 \nAmericans with heart disease go without life-saving bypass surgery or \nother treatments.\n  And the problem is getting worse. For most of the past 16 years, the \nnumber of people without health insurance has increased. Now, when our \neconomy is weak, health care costs are rising at double-digit rates. \nPeople are losing jobs and their health insurance too. States are \ncutting back on Medicaid care for the poor. If we do nothing, the \nnumber of uninsured could reach more than 52 million by 2010. Clearly, \nthe time to act is now.\n  We must pass legislation to ensure that every man, woman, and child \nin the United States has access to high quality, affordable health \ncare. And we must do it soon.\n  Some say we cannot afford the cost of covering the uninsured. But as \na country, we are already paying the much higher costs of failing to \nprovide good care for all. We pay for it when we fail to detect cancer \nearly by using the preventive screening that we know is effective. We \npay for it in every person with diabetes who becomes blind because of a \ndisease we know how to control. We pay for it by failing to give every \nchild the same opportunity for good health and a productive life.\n  We know that the battle for affordable health care has never been \neasy. But to solve this problem, we must commit to working together to \nfind a solution. That is why I am submitting this resolution. This \nmeasure does not endorse a specific plan to cover the uninsured, but it \ndoes state unequivocally that universal health care is our goal, and it \nsets a time for Congress to get the job done.\n  A similar resolution has already been submitted in the House of \nRepresentatives and has received the strong support of our 470 \norganizations, including many groups representing patients, health \nproviders, and faith-based organizations.\n  Democrats are leading the charge in Congress in the fight for quality \nhealth care for all Americans--and, as Congressman Gephardt has shown \nwith his recent proposal, Democrats are prepared to take this issue to \nthe White House as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this resolution to enact \nbipartisan legislation to provide health care for all Americans by the \nend of the year 2005.

Now they do very extraordinary things in \nprotecting this beautiful Capitol, the employees here, the tourists, \nand the Members of the Senate.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaties transmitted to the Senate on April 30, 2003, by the President \nof the United States: Amendments to Constitution and Convention of \nInternational Telecommunication Union, Geneva 1992, Treaty Document No. \n108-5, and Protocol of Amendment to International Convention on \nSimplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures, Treaty Document \n108-6.\n  I further ask that the treaties be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that they be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's messages be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The messages of the President are as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe amendments to the Constitution and Convention of the International \nTelecommunication Union (ITU) (Geneva 1992), as amended by the \nPlenipotentiary Conference (Kyoto 1994), together with declarations and \nreservations by the United States as contained in the Final Acts of the \nPlenipotentiary Conference (Minneapolis 1998). I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State \nconcerning these amendments.\n  Prior to 1992, and as a matter of general practice, previous \nConventions of the ITU were routinely replaced at successive \nPlenipotentiary Conferences held every 5 to 10 years. In 1992, the ITU \nadopted a permanent Constitution and Convention. The Constitution \ncontains fundamental provisions on the organization and structure of \nthe ITU, as well as substantive rules applicable to international \ntelecommunications matters. The ITU Convention contains provisions \nconcerning the functioning of the ITU and its constituent organs.\n  Faced with a rapidly changing telecommunication environment, the ITU \nin 1994 adopted a few amendments to the 1992 Constitution and \nConvention. These amendments were designed to enable the ITU to respond \neffectively to new challenges posed.\n  The pace at which the telecommunication market continues to evolve \nhas not eased. States participating in the 1998 ITU Plenipotentiary \nConference held in Minneapolis submitted numerous proposals to amend \nthe Constitution and Convention. As discussed in the attached report of \nthe Department of State concerning the amendments, key proposals \nincluded the following: amendments to clarify the rights and \nobligations of Member States and Sector Members; amendments to increase \nprivate sector participation in the ITU with the understanding that the \nITU is to remain an intergovernmental organization; amendments to \nstrengthen the finances of the ITU; and amendments to provide for \nalternative procedures for the adoption and approval of questions and \nrecommendations.\n  Consistent with longstanding practice in the ITU, the United States, \nin signing the 1998 amendments, made certain declarations and \nreservations. These declarations and reservations are discussed in the \nreport of the Department of State, which is attached hereto.\n  The 1992 Constitution and Convention and the 1994 amendments thereto \nentered into force for the United States on October 26, 1997. The 1998 \namendments to the 1992 Constitution and Convention as amended in 1994 \nentered into force on January 1, 2000, for those states, which, by that \ndate, had notified the Secretary General of the ITU of their approval \nthereof. As of the beginning of this year, 26 states had notified the \nSecretary General of the ITU of their approval of the 1998 amendments.\n  Subject to the U.S. declarations and reservations mentioned above, I \nbelieve the United States should ratify the 1998 amendments to the ITU \nConstitution and Convention. They will contribute to the ITU's ability \nto adapt to a rapidly changing telecommunication environment and, in \ndoing so, will serve the needs of the United States Government and U.S. \nindustry.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthese amendments and that the Senate give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, April 30, 2003.\n                                  ____\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith for Senate advice and consent to accession, the \nProtocol of Amendment to the International Convention on the \nSimplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures done at Brussels \non June 26, 1999. The Protocol amends the International Convention on \nthe Simplification and Harmonization of Customs Procedures done at \nKyoto on May 18, 1973, and replaces the Annexes to the 1973 Convention \nwith a General Annex and 10 Specific Annexes (together, the ``Amended \nConvention''). I am also transmitting, for the information of the \nSenate, the report of the Department of State on the Amended \nConvention.\n  The Amended Convention seeks to meet the needs of international trade \nand customs services through the simplification and harmonization of \ncustoms procedures. It responds to modernization in business and \nadministrative methods and techniques and to the growth of \ninternational trade, without compromising standards of customs control. \nAccession by the United States would further the U.S. interest in \nreducing non-tariff barriers to international trade.\n  By acceding to the Protocol, a state consents to be bound by the \namended 1973 Convention and the new General Annex. At the same time, or \nanytime thereafter, Parties have the option of accepting any of the \nSpecific Annexes (or Chapters thereof), and may at that time enter \nreservations with respect to any Recommended Practices contained in the \nSpecific Annexes. In accordance with these terms, I propose that the \nUnited States accept seven of the Specific Annexes in their entirety \nand all\n\n[[Page S5617]]\n\nthe Chapters, but one of each of two other Specific Annexes (A-E, G, \nand H, as well as Chapters 1, 2, and 3 of F, and Chapters 1, 3, 4, and \n5 of J), and enter the reservations proposed by the Bureau of Customs \nand Border Protection as set forth in the enclosure to the report of \nthe Department of State. The provisions for which reservation is \nrecommended conflict with current U.S. legislation or regulations. With \nthese proposed reservations, no new implementing legislation is \nnecessary in order to comply with the Amended Convention.\n  Accession to the Protocol by the United States would contribute to \nimportant U.S. interests. First, accession by the United States would \nbenefit the United States and U.S. businesses by facilitating greater \neconomic growth, increasing foreign investment, and stimulating U.S. \nexports through more predictable, standard, and harmonized customs \nprocedures governing cross-border trade transactions. Setting forth \nstandardized and simplified methods for conducting customs business is \nimportant for U.S. trade interests in light of the demands of increased \ntrade flows, as is the use of modernized technology and techniques for \ncustoms facilitation. These achievements can best be pursued by the \nUnited States as a Party to the Amended Convention. Second, through \nearly accession, the United States can continue to take a leadership \nrole in the areas of customs and international trade facilitation as \nthe U.S. accession would encourage other nations, particularly \ndeveloping nations, to accede as well.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Protocol and give its advice and consent to accession.\n                                                      George W. Bush.  \nThe White House, April 30, 2003.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2003/04/30/senate-section/article/S5617-1", "month": "04", "year": "2003", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5617]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, MAY 1, 2003\n\n  Mr. FRIST.
